- 1 1 - Introduction Febr uary 202 2 Chapter 1: Introduction to the Pennsylvania Tuberculosis (TB) Manual PURPOSE This manual is designed to present the key steps and crucial information needed to perform TB control tasks in Pennsylvania. Where additional or more detailed information is available, references and/or hyperlinks to CDC guidelines and other resources are provided. AUDIENCE The audience for this manual includes community health nurses ( CHNs )1, outreach workers, TB clinicians, public health officers, regional consultants, and state TB program staff. State Health C enters and State Contracted Clinics will be referred to as \"SHCs\" or \"State Clinics .\" Licensed physicians who evaluate and treat patients with tuberculosis ( TB) disease and latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) in State Clinics are referred to as \"TB clinicians.\" PURPOSE OF TB CONTROL The goal of TB control in the United States is to reduce TB morbidity and mortality by: Preventing transmission of Mycobacterium TB (M.TB) from persons with contagious forms of the disease to uninfected persons Preventing progression to active TB disease among persons with LTBI The four fundamental strategies to reduce TB morbidity and mortality include: Early and accurate detection, diagnosis, and reporting of TB cases, leading to initiation and completion of treatment Identification of contacts of patients with infec tious TB and treatment of those at risk with an effective drug regimen Identification of other persons with LTBI at risk for progression to TB disease, and treatment of those persons with an effective drug regimen Identification of settings in which a hig h risk exists for the transmission of M.TB and the implementation of effective infection control measures To protect the health of all citizens, TB control is the responsibility of both the private and public health sectors of medicine. All new suspected and confirmed cases of TB must be reported to the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH) via Pennsylvania' s version of the National 1 Throughout this manual, the job title of community health nurse ( CHN ) is used to refer to nurses who provide patient care in a public health setting regardless of whether they work in a state health center or a county or municipal health department. Pennsylvania TB Manual 1 - 2 1 - Introduction Febr uary 202 2 Electronic Disease Surveillance System (PA -NEDSS). Patients may be treated by private clinicians or by TB clinicians. DOH will assist and advise private clinicians and other agencies that treat TB patients or conduct TB control ac tivities. By regulation, the department has a responsibility to see that persons with TB in the infectious stage accept medical supervision for their disease so that they become non -infectious. LAWS PERTAINING TO TB CONTROL Pennsylvania laws on TB can be found in the Administrative Code of 1929 and the Disease Prevention and Control Law of 1955, 35 P.S. Sec. 521.1 Under the provisions of the Pennsylvania Administrative Code of 1929 and the Disease Prevention and Control Law o f 1955, DOH has the authority to \"protect the health of the people of this Commonwealth, and to determine and employ the most efficient and practical means for the prevention and suppression of disease.\" 28 Pa Code \u00a7 27.21a (b)(2) requires that tuberculosi s, suspected or confirmed active disease (all sites) must be reported within five work days after being identified by symptoms, appearance or diagnosis. Reports may be submitted electronically via PA -NEDSS or by calling the local SHC or county/municipal he alth department (CMHD) . The Pennsylvania Public School Code of 1949, Section 1402(a)(4), requires that students be tested for TB. However, since 1997 School Districts may request approval from the Secretary of Health for a modified health plan to not test students for TB in accordance with current recommendations of the American Thoracic Society, the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics. School Districts that receive approval are not required to submit the form for students but must continue to s ubmit information as required for staff employees and volunteers. For more information, see the School Health TB webpage . The United States Code contains sections that provide authority to 1) contract with the states for research on the causes, prevention and treatment of disease, 2) cooperate with states to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, and 3) provide grants to states for preventive health programs. QUALITY OF C ARE For TB programs, quality of care is evaluated based on the achievement of objectives and adherence to standards. Objectives reflect outcomes and program targets and are based largely on the national objectives established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ). Standards are an accepted set of conditions or behaviors that define what is expected and acceptable regarding job duties, performance, and provision of services. Pennsylvania TB Program standards are established based on applicable laws as well as national guidelines. Pennsylvania TB Manual 1 - 3 1 - Introduction Febr uary 202 2 NATIONAL AND STATE PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The National Tuberculosis Indicators Project (NTIP) was developed to facilitate the use of existing data from the Electronic Disease Notification (EDN) and National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) to help U.S. TB control programs evaluate their program effectiveness and prioritize their activities. The NTIP objectives are categorized in eight major groups: 1. Goals for Reducing TB Incidence 2. Objectives on Case Management and Treatment 3. Objectives on Laboratory Reporting 4. Objectives on Contact Investigations 5. Objectives on Examination of Immigrants and Refugees 6. Objectives on Data Reporting 7. Objectives on Pr ogram Evaluation 8. Objectives on Human Resources Development The current NTIP obj ectives can be found on the CDC website at : https://www.cdc.gov/tb/programs/evaluation/indicators/default.htm . To monitor progress towards achievement of the NTIP objectives, the Pennsylvania TB Program has established a state goal for each NTIP objective based on epidemiology data and recent program performance. Call the TB Program at 717 -787-6267 for more information about the state goals . NATIONAL TB GUIDELINES United States guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and case management of persons with LTBI or TB disease have been developed, and updated as appropriate, by nationally accepted authorities including the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the CDC , and generalized recognized experts in TB control, including the National TB CHN Coalition (NTNC) and the National TB Controllers Association (NTCA). These guidelines constitute standards of care for the medical treatment and control of TB and should be available for reference by each TB staff member. A complete list of current TB guidelines by topic or date of issuance can be found on the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publi cations/guidelines/default.htm .

Top of Document or Top of Chapter Pennsylvania TB Manual 5-1 5-Dx of LTBI and TB Disease Rev. April 2021 Chapter 5: Diagnosis of Latent TB Infection (LTBI) and TB Disease INTRODUCTION PURPOSE Use this chapter to understand the procedures for : Diagnos ing TB disease Diagnosing LTBI Prioritiz ing treatment for patients with LTBI who are at high risk for progression to TB disease POLICY The following individuals should be evaluated for TB disease: Persons who show or report signs and symptoms of TB Persons who test positive for M. tuberculosis and: are a contact to an infectious case of TB ; have at least one risk factor for TB exposure ; or are at increased risk of progression from LTBI to TB disease . Only after a diagnosis of TB disease has been eliminated can LTBI be diagnosed. Individuals at high risk for progressio n from LTBI to TB disease should be prioritized for LTBI treatment . Refer to Chapter 6, Treatment of LTBI, for more information . Anyone who tests positive for TB or is suspected of having TB disease is eligible to receive medical evaluation and treatment services at a state health center (SHC) or county or municipal health department (CMHD) . The interferon gamma -release assay (IGRA) test is considered the standard of care when testing patients 2 years of age or older fo r M. tuberculosis infection. BACKGROUND Individuals exposed to infectious TB have typically been categorized as having either LTBI or TB disease. Today, it is more widely accepted that TB is a continuum that starts with exposure and escalates to infection, subclinical (asymptomatic) disease, and non -severe to severe Until further notice, refer to the CDC website for current guidance about COVID -19 mRNA vaccines and TB testing of LTBI and TB Disease Rev. April 2021 (symptomatic) disease. Where a patient falls on t he continuum correlates with bacterial burden i.e., the higher the burden of M. tuberculosis , the more likely the patient is to have symptomatic TB disease. Movement along the continuum is also influenced by other factors including the health of the patient's immune system, the virulence of the TB strain, and the impact of various environmental f actors on the intensity of exposure. QUICK START CHECK LIST A Quick Start Checklist is included in Appendix A to this chapter. It was designed as a tool for public health nurses when evalua ting a patient for LTBI or TB disease . The tasks should be performe d by licensed nursing, medical, and laboratory staff as appropriate . HIGH -RISK GROUPS As shown in Table 1 : Persons at High Risk for LTBI and Progression to TB Disease , certain factors identify persons at high risk for LTBI and/or progression to TB disease. Persons with risk factors from both columns may be at much higher risk than those with risk factors in only one column . For example, an individual born in a high -TB-prevalence country who has tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) is at a much higher risk of having active TB than a US -born individual with HIV infection. TABLE 1: PERSONS AT HIGH RISK FOR LTBI AND PROGRESSION TO TB DISEASE For LTBI : For Progression to TB Disease : High-priority contacts such as housemates , coworkers or contacts of persons who have smear -positive pulmonary or laryngeal TB Infants, children, and adolescents exposed to adults in high -risk categories Immigrants from countries with a high incidence of TB (Asian, African, Latin American, and East ern European countries have TB rates 5 -30 times higher than U.S. rates, and an increasing percentage of TB cases here are occurring among immigrants from those countries) Recent immigrants from Mexico Migrant workers Persons who have recently spent over 3 months in high -incidence countries (such as missionaries) Native Americans Persons with HIV infection Infants and children 5 years of age and younger Persons infected with M. tuberculosis within the previous 2 years Persons with a history of untreated or inadequately treated TB disease Persons with radiographic findings consistent with previous TB disease Persons who, within the past year, misused injectable or non -injectable drugs, or consumed excessive amounts of alcohol Pennsylvania TB Manual 5-3 5-Dx of LTBI and TB Disease 2021 For LTBI: For Progression to TB Disease: Persons with high rates of TB transmission: \u00ad Homeless persons \u00ad Injection drug users \u00ad Persons with HIV infection \u00ad Persons living or working in institutions with individuals at risk for TB such as: Hospitals, especially staff in nursing, emergency departments, and laboratories Long -term care facilities Homeless shelters Residences for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients Correctional facilities Persons with any of the following clinical conditions or other (e.g., leukemias and lymphomas) \u00ad Other malignancies (e.g., carcinoma of head, neck, or lung) \u00ad Body weight more than or equal to 10% below idea body weight \u00ad Prolonged corticosteroid use \u00ad Use of other immunosuppressive treatments (e.g., prednisone or tumor necrosis factor - alpha [TNF - ] antagonists) \u00ad malabsorption syndromes \u00ad Jejunoileal bypass Sources CDC.

Available at: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4906.pdf TB TESTING FOR M. TUBERCULOSIS INFECTION There are two types of screening tests available for the detection of M. tuberculosis infection in the United States: 1. Interferon gamma -release assay (IGRA) blood test 2. Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) Current clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children favor the use of an IGRA over the TST. The key advantages of an IGRA are tha t it requires just one visit by the patient, results are typically available in 24 -36 hours, and there is no risk of a false positive result due to prior inoculation with the Bacille Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine . The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends either an IGRA or TST for children 2 years of age or older, however the IGRA is preferred for children previously vaccinated with BCG or who are unlikely to return for a TST to be read. For children less than 2 years of age , the TST remains the preferred test. Patients who test positive for M. tuberculosis or exhibit the signs and symptoms of TB should undergo a medical evaluation for TB disease including a chest radiograph, medical history, Pennsylvania TB Manual 5-4 5-Dx of LTBI and TB Disease Rev. April 2021 serology for HIV, physical examination and - if appropriate - bacteriologic examination of clinical specimens . Only after eliminating a diagnosis of TB disease can LTBI be diagnosed. INTERFERON GAMMA RELEASE ASSAY An IGRA is a blood test for M. Tuberculosis infection . It is the preferred test for children 2 years of age and older, persons previously vaccinated with BCG, and for immunocompromised patients - including those who are HIV positive or have AIDS . The key advantages of an I GRA test are that it requir es just one visit by the patient, results are typically available in 24 -36 hours, and there is no risk of a false positive result due to prior inoculation with the BCG vaccine. Persons with a positive TB test result, regardless of whether they are asympto matic, should be evaluated for TB disease before LTBI is diagnosed. At minimum, a chest radiograph should be examined for abnormalities consistent with TB disease. A negative IGRA result does not exclude M. tuberculosis infection in persons with signs or symptoms suggestive of TB disease. Medical evaluation of such persons should include a history and physical examination, chest radiograph, bacteriologic studies, serology for HIV, and, when indicated, other tests or studi es. IGRA results are reported as positive , negative or indeterminant . An indeterminant result indicates there is no measurable immune system response to M. tuberculosis , suggesting an error i n performing the test or immuno suppression due to a medical condition such as HIV or immunosuppressive medication such as TNF -alpha inhibitors. TUBERCULIN SKIN TEST The TST has limitations detect ing infection with M. tuberculosis . A valid TST requires proper administration of tuberculin -purified protein derivative (PPD) via an intradermal injection into the volar surface of the forearm. In addition, patients must return within 48 -72 hours to have the test read by a trained health ca re provider and the reading of the test result can be subjective . False-positive TST results can be caused by either infection with non -tuberculosis mycobacteria or prior inoculation with the BCG vaccine. If there is a question about the validity of a previously documented positive TST due to prior BCG vaccination or reservations about the administration or reading of the TST, the patient can be re -tested with an IGRA . See C hapter 11: Targeted Testing for more specific information about the administration , reading and interpretation of the TST. SPECIAL SITUATIONS Pregnancy Both the IGRA and the TST can safely be used to test pregnant women for TB, but pregnancy can affect the test results. A \"low positive\" IGRA result in a pregnant woman may be a false positive and she should be retested no sooner than 3 months postpartum. Pennsylvania TB Manual 5-5 5-Dx of LTBI and TB Disease Rev. April 2021 Pregnant women with any of the following conditions are at increased risk for LTBI or TB disease and should be tested: Symptoms suggestive of TB disease ; HIV infection ; Behavioral risk factors for HIV ; Medical conditions other than HIV infection that increase the risk fo r TB disease ; Close contact with a person who has pulmonary or laryngeal TB disease ; or Immigration from an area of the world where the incidence of TB is high . Bacille Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) Vaccine BCG vaccines are live vaccines derived from a strain of M. bovis. Infants and children in countries with a high incidence of TB are commonly vaccinated with BCG to prevent meningeal TB. However, b ecause the effectiveness of BCG vaccine s in preventing infec tious forms of TB has never been demonstrated in the United States, they are not recommended in this country as a TB control strategy, except under rare circumstances. Due to the high incidence of false -positive TSTs in BCG -vaccinated individuals , an IGRA should be used instead of a TST to test anyone 2 years of age and older with a history of BCG vaccination . For children less than 2 years of age , the TST is still the preferred test. In those instances where BCG -vaccinated individuals are tested with the TST, proceed as follows: Consider diagnosis and treatment of LTBI in BCG -vaccinated persons with a TST reaction of equal to or greater than 10 mm induration who: o are frequently exposed to populations with a high prevalence of TB (e.g., some healthcare workers, employees and volunteers at homeless shelters, and workers at correctional facilities or drug treatment centers); o were born or have lived in a country with a high prevalence of TB; and/or o were ever exposed to a case of infectious TB, particularly if that case transmitted TB to others. These patients should also be evaluated for symptoms of TB disease and have a CXR . If the patient is coughing sputum specimens should be obtained for acid -fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture testing . Refer to Appendix B of this chapter, Sputum Collection During TB Treatment. Anergy Testing Anergy testing is not routinely recommended in conjunction with the TST for HIV -infected persons in the U.S. Anergy testing is a diagnostic procedure used to obtain information about the competence of the cellular immune system. Conditions that cause an impaired cellular immune system include HIV Pennsylvania TB Manual 5-6 5-Dx of LTBI and TB Disease Rev. April 2021 infection, severe or febrile illness, measles or other viral infections, Hodgkin's disease, sarcoidosis, live virus vaccin ation, and corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy. Persons with conditions such as these may have suppressed reactions to a TST even if infected with TB. However, there are no simple skin -testing protocols that can reliably identify persons as either anergic or non -anergic and that have been proven to be feasible for application in public health TB screening programs. Documented Prior Positive TB Test (IGRA or TST) Persons who previously tested positive for TB with either an IGRA or a TST will continue to test positive and should not have another TB test . If there is a question of the TST being a false positive, then an IGRA can be done. A low-risk individual who has a positive TST and a negative IGRA is not considered to be TB infected. However , a positive TST in a high-risk individual should be considered infected even if the IGRA is negative. However , if both the TST and the IGRA are positive the n the individual is infected with M. tuberculosis . Such patients should then undergo a medical evalu ation including chest radiography and a physical examination to rule out a diagnosis of TB disease. Live-Virus Vaccines The TST can be administered in conjunction with all vaccines. However, the measles (MMR) vaccine \u2014and possibly influenza vaccines \u2014may transiently suppress the response to PPD. Therefore, if a vaccine containing live virus (e.g., measles, smallpox) has already been given, the TST should be deferred until (or repeated) at least four weeks after the vaccine was administered. When giving the TST and the MMR, one of the following three sequences should be used: Apply the TST at same visit as the MMR Delay the TST at least four weeks if the MMR is given first Apply the TST first and then give the MMR when the TST is measured . The last option is the least favored because it delays the administration of the measles vaccine. The CDC 2011 General Recommendations on Immunization: Recommendations of the ACIP state that \"the same timing guidelines that apply to the interval between a live vaccine and TST apply to IGRA (i.e., 28 days between the live vaccine and IGRA if they do not occur on the same day), because IGRA (like TST) might be suppressed through immunologic mechanisms\". Chest Radiography (CXR) All individuals who either test positive with an IGRA or a TST or exhibit signs and symptoms of TB should have a CXR to rule out pulmonary TB disease (see Table 2: When a Chest Radiograph is Required and How to Follow up on Radiography Results ). A posterior -anterior radiograph (x-ray source is positioned so the x -ray beam enters through the patient's back and exits via the chest) is the standard view used for the detection and Pennsylvania TB Manual 5-7 5-Dx of LTBI and TB Disease Rev. April 2021 description of chest abnormalities in adults. In some instances, other views (e.g., anterior - posterior , lateral, lordotic) or additional studies (e.g., computed tomograph y [CT] scans) may be necessary. For children, two -view chest radiography is the standard of care. TABLE 2: TARGETED TESTING FOR LTBI: WHEN CHEST RADIOGRAPHS ARE REQUIRED AND HOW TO FOLLOW UP ON RADIOGRAPHY RESULTS Signs or Symptoms of TB? IGRA or TST Result? Recent Exposure to an Infectious Case ? Chest Radiograph Result Follow -up Action No Negative No CXR not recommended unless the patient has HIV infection or other forms of immunosuppression are present No Positive No Normal Consider treatment for LTBI Abnormal: Noncalcified fibrotic lesions suggestive of old, healed TB; comparison film available and stable Consider evaluating for TB disease Abnormal: Consistent with TB disease; no comparison film available Evaluate for TB disease Yes Positive or negative Yes or no Normal or abnormal Evaluate for TB disease IDENTIFYING SUSPECTED TB CASES Be alert for cases of TB among persons who are contacts to an infectious case of TB and to persons with newly diagnosed M. tuberculosis infection - especially those at increased risk of progression to TB disease (see Table 1: Persons at High Risk for LTBI and Progression to TB Disease ). Individuals who present with one or more of the common signs and symptoms of TB disease - fever, chills, a persi stent cough for two to three weeks or longer , hemoptysis (coughing up blood) , weight loss, loss of appetite, and fatigue - should be evaluated for TB disease. All persons who have a chronic cough for two to three weeks or more should be masked and placed i n an airborne infection isolation room (AII) until confirmed noninfectious . Hemoptysis is a serious symptom and patients who cough up blood should be evaluated for TB disease as soon as possible. Pennsylvania TB Manual 5-8 5-Dx of LTBI and TB Disease Rev. April 2021 The clinical presentation of TB varies considerably based on the extent of the disease and the patient's response. Suspect pulmonary TB and start a medical evaluation of the patient when the health history, clinical signs, symptoms, and radiographic findin gs listed in Table 3 occur among adults (see Table 3 : When to Suspect Pulmonary TB in Adults ). TB should be suspected in any patient who has a persistent cough for more than two to three weeks, or other signs and symptoms of TB . A diagnosis of TB should al so be considered in asymptomatic patients who have risk factors for TB and a CXR compatible with TB. If a patient has a positive TST or IGRA, consider signs and symptoms of extra -pulmonary TB. TABLE 3 : WHEN TO SUSPECT PULMONARY TB IN ADULTS Patient History Exposure to a person with infectious TB during lifetime Positive test result for Mycobacterium TB infection Presence of risk factors, such as immigration from a high - prevalence area, HIV infection, homeless ness, or previous incarceration Diagnosis of community -acquired pneumonia that has not improved after 7 days of treatment Common Signs and Symptoms of TB Prolonged coughing ( i.e., for 2-3 weeks or longer ) with or without production of sputum that might be bloody (hemoptysis)\u00a7, Chest pain Chills Fever Night sweats Loss of appetite Weight loss Weakness or easy fatigability Malaise (a feeling of general discomfort or illness) CXR: Immunocompetent patients Classic findings of TB are upper -lobe opacities, frequently with evidence of contraction fibrosis and cavitation CXR: Patients with advanced HIV hilar adenopathy, treated with levofloxaci n or moxifloxacin may have a clinical response when TB is the cause of the pneumonia. \u00a7 Sputum produced by coughing does not need to be bloody to be a symptom of TB. \u00b6 These features are not specific for TB, and, for every person in whom pulmonary TB is diagnosed, an estimated 10-100 persons are suspected based on clinical criteria and must be evaluated.

April 2021 DIAGNOSIS OF TB DISEASE Cultures or other laboratory te sts that are positive for M. tuberculosis support a diagnosis of TB disease. However, TB may also be diagnosed based on clinical signs and symptoms in the absence of positive culture or other laboratory results. An individual who is suspected of having TB disease require s a complete medical evaluation including the following: Medical history - including symptoms, exposure at any time to an infectious case of TB, previous diagnosis and treatment for LTBI or TB disease , and risk factors HIV screening Physical examination TB testing with an IGRA or TST CXR Bacteriologic examination When a suspected case of pulmonary TB is identified, refer to Table 5 for guidance on the evaluation of patients in five clinical scenarios encountered by primary h ealthcare providers , including those serving in medical emergency departments. TABLE 5: GUIDELINES FOR THE EVALUATION OF PULMONARY TB IN ADULTS IN FIVE CLINICAL SCENARIOS Patient and Setting Recommended Evaluation Any patient with a cough lasting 2-3 weeks or longer IGRA or TST and CXR: If the CXR is suggestive collect 3 sputum specimens AFB microscopy, culture, and a nucleic acid amplification test (NAA T) Any patient at high risk for TB with an unexplained illness, including respiratory symptoms lasting 2-3 weeks or longer IGRA or TST and CXR: If suggestive of TB, collect 3 sputum specimens for AFB sme ar microscopy, culture, and NAAT Any HIV patient with unexplained cough or fever IGRA or TST, CXR and collect 3 sputum specimens for AFB smea r microscopy, culture, and NAAT Any patient at high risk for TB with a diagnosis of community -acquired pneumonia who has not improved after 7 days of treatment IGRA or TST, CXR and collect 3 sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy, culture, and NAAT Any patient at high risk for TB with incidental findings on CXR suggestive of TB even if symptoms are minimal IGRA or TST, r eview previous CXR ( ), and collect 3 sputum specimens for AFB sme ar microscopy, culture, and NAAT * Opacities with or without cavitation in the upper lobes or the superior segments of the lower lobes.

Controlling TB in the United States: recommendations from the American Thoracic Society, CDC, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. MMWR 2005;54(No. RR -12):33. MEDICAL HISTORY When completing a medical history, the c linician should ask the patient about : Symptoms of TB disease (Table 2 and Table 4) Exposure at any time during their lifetime to someone with infectious TB Previous diagnosis of LTBI or disease (Table 1) Risk factors (Table 1) Demographic factors (e.g., country of origin, age, ethnicity, occupation) Underlying medical conditions, especially HIV or diabetes, that may increase the patient's risk of progression from LTBI to TB disease Recent medical encounters (e.g., going to the emergency department for pneumonia) Previous antibiotic therapy and the condition treated HIV SCREENING The CDC recommends that the following patients be screened for HIV : All suspected or confirmed cases of TB disease Persons diagnosed with LTBI Contacts to suspected or confirmed cases of infectious TB disease HIV infection is the most important known risk factor for progression from LTBI to TB disease. Because both conditions weaken the immune system, the progression from LTBI to TB disease can proceed quic kly and, if untreated, be deadly. Emphasize to the patient that the HIV test is part of the baseline work -up for TB disease and that HIV status can affect the treatment of TB disease. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A physical examination is an essential part of the medical evaluation of any patient suspected of having TB. I t cannot be used to confirm or rule out TB disease, but it can provide valuable information about the patient's overall condition, inform the method of diagnosis, and reveal other factors - such as HIV status - that may affect TB disease treatment, if diagnosed. CHEST X -RAY For adults, a posteri or-anterior radiograph of the chest is the standard view used for the detection and description of chest abnormalities. In some instan ces, other views (e.g., lateral or lordotic) or additional studies (e.g., computed tomography [CT] scans) may be necessary and can be ordered by the TB clinician. For children , two-view chest radiography is the standard of care . Many young c hildren aren't tall enough for the -anterior Manual 5-13 5-Dx of LTBI TB Disease Rev. April 2021 Certain abnormalities on CXR are suggestive, but not diagnostic, of TB disea se. In pulmonary TB, radiographic abnormalities are often seen in the apical and posterior segments of the upper lobe or in the superior segments of the lower lobe. Lesions may appear anywhere in the lungs and may differ in size, shape, density, and presen ce or absence of cavitation, especially in HIV - infected and other immunosuppressed persons. In HIV -infected persons, pulmonary TB may present atypically on the CXR . For example, TB may cause opacities without cavities in any lung zone, or it may cause medi astinal or hilar lymphadenopathy with or without accompanying opacities and/or cavities. In HIV -infected persons, almost any abnormality on a CXR may indicate TB. On the other hand , the CXR of an HIV-infected person with TB disease may appear entirely norm al. BACTERIOLOGIC EXAMINATION See Table 6 to determine the types of specimens needed to assist in the diagnosis of TB. TABLE 6 : SPECIMENS FOR EXAMINATION Suspected Diagnosis Specimen Needed Pulmonary or laryngeal TB Sputum (phlegm from deep in the lungs) samples fo r smear and culture examination . If the patient can't produce sputum, other procedures to obtain respiratory fluids may be necessary, including bronchoscopy or , for children , gastr ic aspiration. If pulmonary TB is suspected but the smear is AFB negative, submit the sample for cultur e and request a nucleic acid amplification test (NAA T). Extrapulmonary TB Depending on the anatomical site, other clinical specimens are necessary, such as: Urine Cerebrospinal fluid Pleural fluid Pus or other aspirated fluid Biopsy specimens Refer to Table 7 for information on the bacteriology tests used to diagnose TB. Pennsylvania TB Manual 5-14 5-Dx of Rev. 2021 TABLE 7: BACTERIOLOGY TESTS USED IN DIAGNOSING TB DISEASE Test Description Laboratory Turnaround Times Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB) Smear Provides strong inferential evidence for a diagnosis of TB. It 's usually the first bacteriologic evidence of the presence of mycobacteria in a clinical specimen. If positive, gives a semi -quantitative estimate of the number of bacilli being excreted ( a measure of bacterial load and the patient's infectiousness). On-site test: within 24 hours from specimen collection. Off-site test: within 24 hours from laboratory receipt of specimen (time from specimen collection to laboratory receipt should be 24 hours or less). Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAA T) A test done on clinical specimens for the rapid identification of the M. tuberculosis complex. NAATs performed by GeneXpert used will also provide a molecular rifampin resistan ce result A NAAT does not replace the need for routine AFB smear and culture testing . Within 48 hours from specimen collection Culture Usually necessary for species identification of all clinical specimens suspected of containing mycobacteria. Required for drug susceptibility testing and genotyping. Mycobacterial growth detection: within 14 days from specimen collection Identification of mycobacteria: within 21 days from specimen collection Cultures are reported out as negative after 7 weeks that produce no growth Drug Susceptibility Testing For first -line drugs: Is performed on initial isolates of all patients to identify an effective anti-TB regimen . For both first -line and second -line drugs: Is repeated on interim isolates when a patient remains culture -positive after 3 months of treatment. First-line drugs : within 30 days from specimen collection Second -line drugs: within 4 weeks from date of request MDDR (Molecular Detection of Drug Resistance) (CDC) MDDR testing is done for patients who present with a high suspicion of drug resistance to quickly identify drug resistance so that an effective anti -TB regimen can be started as soon as possible. MDDR tes ting is done by the CDC's TB Reference Laboratory in Michigan. Only samples in which M. tuberculosis complex has been detected should be submitted for MDDR testing, and such samples must be submitted by the state Bureau of Laboratories (BOL). Results re: first -line anti-TB drugs are typically available within 48 hours upon receipt at the CDC reference Laboratory. If the MDDR confirms resistance to any first -line drugs, additional testing can be done to identify resistance to any second -line anti- TB drugs and TB Disease Rev. April 2021 One of the National TB Indicators Project (NTIP) objectives for 202 5 is to increase the proportion of patients with suspected pleural or respiratory TB disease that have a sputum culture result reported. Another one of the NTIP objectives for 202 5 is to increase the proportion of patients with positive culture results who have initial drug -susceptibility results reported. Sources: ATS, CDC, IDSA.

Other species in the M. tuberculosis complex include M. bovis , M. and M. mungi ; of these seven species, six can cause clinical disease or be transmissible from person to person -M. M. mungi . Therefore, disease caused by any of those six organisms should be reported as TB. The only exception is the bacillus Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) strain of M. bovis , which can be isolated from persons who have received the v accine for protection against TB or as cancer immunotherapy; disease caused by the BCG strain of M. bovis should not be reported as TB. DIAGNOSIS OF LTBI Patients who test positive for TB, but whose medical evaluation ruled -out a diagnosis of TB disease, should be diagnosed with LTBI. Treatment of LTB I is essential to controlling and eliminating TB in the United States because it substantially reduces the risk that LTBI will progress to TB disease . Individuals at high risk for progression from LTBI to TB disease (refer to Table 1 on pages 2 and 3 of this chapter ) should be prioritized for LTBI treatment .

The tasks should be performed by licensed nursing, medical, and laboratory staff as appropriate . Step Date Completed Use the appropriate Pennsylvania Risk Assessment Form (Adult or Pediatric; see Chapter 11, Targeted Testing) to determine who is at increased risk of exposure to M. tuberculosis and should be tested. Test using an interferon gamma- release assay (IGRA) blood test (preferred for patients 2 years of age or older) or a tuberculin skin test (TST; preferred for children younger than 2 years of age). Do not test patients who have had a previous positive IGRA or TST result. Instead, screen the patient for the signs and symptoms of TB. If the patient issymptomatic, complete a medical evaluation for TB disease. For patients who exhibit the signs and symptoms of TB, take infection control precautions immediately: Have the patient wear a mask or cover their mouth Advise staff to take personal respiratory precautions if necessary Isolate patients who have positive acid- fast bacilli (AFB) sputum smear results or whose CXR reveals signs of cavitary disease Advise the patient to restrict activities to their home while consider ed i nfectious Patients who exhibit the signs and symptoms of TB or have a newly positive test for M. tuberculosis should undergo a medical evaluation for TB diseas e i ncluding a chest radiograph (CXR), medical history, serology for HIV, physical examination and - if appropriate - bacteriologic examination of c linica l s pecimens. 5A-2 5A-Dx of L TBI and TB Disease Pennsylvania TB Manual January 2020 Step D ate Completed Patients with an abnormal CXR should be evaluated for current TB diseas e For patients diagnosed with TB disease: If not available, obtain baseline biochemistry tests for toxicity monitorin g C onsidering any special circumstances (e.g. HIV status, kidney insufficiency, liver disease, patient age, pregnancy), select and immediately start the patient on an appropriate treatment regim en See Chapter 7 - Treatment of TB Disease A diagnosis of L TBI can only be made once a diagnosis of TB disease has been ruled out.

Once the patient is on anti -TB treatment , sputum smear and culture results are used to evaluate the patient's infectiousness and response to treatment. SPUTUM SPECIMEN COLL ECTION For diagnostic purposes, all persons suspected of having TB disease at any site should have sputum specimens collected for an acid -fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture, even those without respiratory symptoms. If possible, specimens should be obtained in an airborne infection isolation (AII) room or other isolated, well -ventilated area (e.g., outdoors). There are four col lection methods for respiratory specimens - coughing, induced sputum, bronchoscopy and gastric aspiration. For descriptions of each method , refer to the CDC Core Curriculum , Chapter 4, available here. BACTERIOLOGIC TESTING FOR INITIAL DIAGNOSIS To assist in the diagnosis of pulmonary TB, at least three consecutive sputum specimens are needed, each collected in eight to 24 -hour intervals, with at least one being an early morning specimen. Ideally, specimens should be collected before starting the patient on drug therapy because even a few days of treatment can inhibit the growth of, and prevent the isolation of, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). Samples submitted for the initial diagnosis of TB should undergo both AFB smear and culture testing. A nucleic acid amplification test, or NAAT, should be ordered on at least one respiratory specimen from a patien t with signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB when a diagnosis of TB is considered, but not yet confirmed. NAAT results are typically available 24 -48 hours after the test and inform physician decisions about pat ient treatment and any need for isolation , but do not replace the need for an AFB smear or culture. A NAAT should be obtained even if the patient is smear negative. Culture remains the gold standard for laboratory confirmation of TB and is required for drug -susceptibility testing and gen otyping. Pennsylvania TB Manual 5B-2 5B-Sputum Collection During TB Treatment January 2020 TB TESTING FOR RELEASE FROM ISO LATION Sputum smear results are also used to evaluate infectiousness while the patient is on anti -TB treatment. Patients may be considered for release from isolation when ALL of the following criteria (one through five) are met: 1. For patients whose initial smear was: AFB positive - they have completed two weeks of the standard four -drug anti -TB drug regimen; or AFB negative - they have completed five to seven days of the standard four -drug anti-TB drug regimen 2. The patient is receiving treatment via directly observed therapy (DOT ) and has been adherent 3. The patient h as shown evidence of clinical improvement such as a decrease in symptoms, improvement in radiographic findings, or other m edical determination of improvement 4. The patient h as had three consecutive negative smears collected at least eight ho urs apart with at least one early morning specimen 5. The patient has no risk factors for drug -resistance, e.g. being a contact to an i ndex case with drug -resistant TB For patients with an AFB positive smear at baseline, begin weekly collection of sputum specimens as follows: 1. For patients with cavities upon chest x -ray (CXR ) and/or baseline sputum smears that are 3+ (moderate) or 4 (hea vy), wait until the patient has completed one to two weeks of treatment before collecting the first follow -up sputum specimen. 2. For patients without cavities upon CXR and/or baseline sputum smears that are 1+ (rare) or 2+ (few), a sputum specimen can be col lected once the patient completes one week of treatment. 3. For both 1) and 2) above, if the first sputum is negative, obtain a second sputum specimen. If the second specimen is negative, obtain a third. If any one specimen is positive, wait one week and re-start the collection process. 4. Once three consecutive smear -negative specimens are collected: Patients on isolation can be considered for release if criteria two through five in the previous section have all been met . Sputum specimens can then be collect ed monthly (in sets of three) until conversion to culture negative is documented. Pennsylvania TB Manual 5B-3 5B-Sputum Collection During TB Treatment January 2020 TB TESTING FOR RESPO NSE TO TREATMENT The best way to monitor treatment effectiveness f or patients with a positive sputum culture is to collect sputa monthly for testing until culture conversion is documented . The conversion should be documented as of the date of the first negative culture as long as there are no subsequent positive cultures. After three months of therapy, patients who have not achieved cultu re conversion or who remain symptomatic should be evaluated for drug -resistant disease or non -adherence to treatment. Patients with multi or extensively drug -resistant (MDR or XDR) TB should have cultures performed monthly for the full course of treatment . Resources CDC . (2019).

Pennsylvania TB Manual 5C-1 5C-Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing ACID AMPLIFI CATION TESTING T B? A nucleic acid amplification test, or NAAT, for tuberculosis (TB) is a molecular test used to detect the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in a sputum or other respiratory sample. Because the amount of DNA in a sample is very small, NAA testing includes a step that amplifies (or copies) the genetic material. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a common form of NAAT used in laboratory diagnosis. GeneXpert\u00ae MTB/RIF test is a PCR that simultaneously detects MTBC and the ge netic mutation that confers rifampin (RIF) resistance. WHAT ARE THE ADVANTA GES OF A NAAT FOR TB ? A NAAT can detect MTBC genetic material even when very small amounts are present in the sample tested. NAAT results are typically available in 24 to 48 hours . Rapid results enable earlier diagnosis of TB, earlier initiation of treatment, a reduced period of infectiousness, and improved patient outcomes. The GeneXpert MTB/RIF NAAT also provides rapid identification of RIF resistance, a predictor of multi -drug resistant TB. In most cases, patients resistant to RIF are also resistant to isoniazid (INH). DOES A NAAT FOR TB R EPLACE AN AFB SMEAR OR CULTURE? A NAAT does not the need for an acid -fast bacilli (AFB) smear or culture. Culture remains the gold st andard for laboratory confirmation of TB and is required for drug - susceptibility testing and genotyping. WHEN SHOULD A NAAT B E ORDERED? Order a NAAT on at least one respiratory specimen from a patient with signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB when a diagn osis of TB is considered, but not yet confirmed. If unable to access a laboratory which performs the NAAT, send a specimen to the Pennsylvania Department of Health Bureau of Laboratories (BOL). The BOL TB molecular testing guidelines are available at http://bit.ly/TBMolecularTesting and the BOL specimen submission form at http://bit.ly/BOLMicroSpecimen . Pennsylvania TB Manual 5C-2 5C-Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing 2020 HOW NAAT RESULTS INTERPRETED? If the NAAT and AFB smear are both positive, presume the patient has TB an d begin anti-TB treatment while awaiting the culture results. If the NAAT is positive and the AFB smear negative, the clinician should be highly suspicious of active TB but use clinical judgement whether to begin anti -TB treatment while awaiting the cult ure results. o In a patient with high suspicion of having TB, TB treatment should be initiated. o In a patient with little suspicion of having TB, a single positive NAAT should be viewed with suspicion and the result interpreted in the context of other clini cal, radiographic and laboratory findings. If TB is still not suspected, consider whether to do additional diagnostic tests including another NAAT. If the NAAT is negative and the AFB smear is positive, confirm that inhibition testing was performed as pa rt of the NAAT. This is done automatically for PCR testing performed at the BOL and is part of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF test. If the NAAT and AFB smear are both negative, use clinical judgement whether to begin anti-TB treatment while awaiting the results of the culture and any other diagnostic tests. o A single negative NAAT result does not definitively exclude TB. The bacterial load in the sample may fall below the detectable limit of the NAAT. Currently available NAATs are not sufficiently sensitive (detect ing 50% to 80% of AFB -smear negative, culture positive pulmonary TB cases) to exclude a diagnosis of TB in AFB smear - negative patients suspected of having TB.

April 2021 Chapter 6: Treatment of Latent TB Infection (LTBI) INTRODUCTION PURPOSE Use this chapter to understand and follow national and Pennsylvania guidelines to : Identify the high -risk groups who should be given priority for LTBI treatment. List the LTBI treatment regimens and doses; Select the appropriate LTBI treatment regimen for specific situations, such as when a patient is pregnant or is co-infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV); Monitor patients for side effects and adverse reactions; Monitor patients' adherence to treatment; and Determine whether and when therapy is completed . POLICY The shortest treatment regimen appropriate for the specific patient should be used to treat LTBI. Newer short -course regimens using isoniazid (INH) and rifapentine ( RPT) once -weekly for 12 weeks (also known as 3HP) or rifampin (RIF) alone taken daily for 4 months have been shown to have higher completion rates with less liver toxicity than the older regimen of INH taken daily for 9 months. Increased use of the 3HP regimen is encouraged in appropri ate patients. Refer to Appendix B of this chapter for current guidance about the administration of 3HP via directly observed therapy (DOT) or, in certain circumstances, via a combination of DOT and self-administered therapy (SAT ). LTBI treatment should be started for patients at increased risk of progression to TB disease, and every effort should be made to ensure such patients complete treatment. BACKGROUND Treatment of LTBI is essential to controlling and eliminating TB in the Unite d States beca use it substantially reduces the risk that LTBI will progress to TB disease. The CDC estimates that up to 13 million people in the U.S. have LTBI, and that just 300,000 to 400,000 of those individuals are treated each year - far lower than the number neede d to Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 6-2 6 - Treatment of LTBI Rev. April 2021 eliminate TB in the U.S. It is estimate d that approximately 80% of new TB cases in the U.S. are due to untreated LTBI progressing to active TB disease (also referred to as the reactivation of LTBI). As a result, the greatest reduction in future tuberculosis cases will come from expanded testing for and treatment of LTBI. A key challenge in getting patients with LTBI to start and complete treatment has been the long duration of therapy. For many years, the standard o f care in LTBI treatment was INH daily for 9 months, but the completion rates for such a long regimen are generally low. A lso, the most concerning side effect with isoniazid - hepatoxicity - though relatively rare and manageable, can have severe consequences if not recognized promptly. Because the newer short -course regimens (once -weekly 3HP for three months ; RIF daily for four months) offer shorter durat ion of treatment, reduced hepatotoxicity and increased completion rates they are now preferred by th e CDC over 9 months of INH . WHOM TO TREAT Once infected, certain groups are at high risk of developing TB disease. LTBI treatment should be started for pat ients at increased risk of progression to TB disease, and every effort should be made to ensure such patients complete treatment. The strongest known risk factor for the progression of LTBI to TB disease is co-infection with HIV. Patients c oinfected with HIV and LTBI have a 7 to 10 percent yearly risk of developing TB disease compared to a 10 percent lifetime risk for patients with LTBI alone . Refer to Table 1 for a more complete list of groups who should be given high priority for LTBI treatment. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 6-3 6 - Treatment of LTBI Rev. April 2021 TABLE 1: HIGH PRIORITY CANDIDATES FOR LTBI TREATMENT Groups Who Should be Given High Priority for LTBI Treatment People who have a positive IGRA result or a TST induration of 5 or more millimeters HIV infected persons Recent contacts of persons with infectious disease Persons with fibrotic changes on chest radiograph (CXR) consistent with prior TB disease Patients with organ transplants Persons who are immunocompromised for other reasons (including patients taking the equivalent of 15 mg/day of prednisone for a month or more) People who have a positive IGRA result or a TST induration of 10 or more millimeters People born in or who frequently travel to countries where TB disease is common, including Mexico, the Philippines, Vietnam, India, China, Haiti, and Guatemala, or other countries with high rates of TB Injection drug users Residents and employees of high -risk congregate settings (e.g., correctional facilities, nursing homes, homeless shelters, etc.) Mycobacteriology laboratory personnel Persons with medical conditions that increase the risk for progression to TB disease (diabetes mellitus, silicosis, recent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.TB) within the past two years, bone marrow and organ transplant recipients, prolonged high -dose corticosteroid therapy and other immunosuppressive therapy, chronic renal some hematological and Hodgkin's disease], other malignancies head, neck, or lung], chronic malabsorption syndromes, weight 10% or m ore below ideal body weight, and intestinal bypass or gastrectomy Children less than 5 years of age or children and adolescents exposed to adults in high -risk categories People who have a TST induration of 15 or more millimeters The following groups may be considered for treatment of LTBI if their TST result is greater than or equal to 15 mm. These groups should be given a lower priority for prevention efforts than the groups listed above . Persons with no known risk factors for TB disease Healthcare workers who are otherwise at low risk for TB disease and who received baseline testing at the beginning of employment as part of a TB screening program Some contacts who have a negative IGRA or TST result but are at high risk o f progression to TB disease if infected should be evaluated for LTBI treatment after TB disease has been ruled out by clinical exam and a CXR . See the following section for more detail. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 6-4 6 - Treatment of LTBI Rev. April 2021 CLOSE CONTACTS AT HIGH RISK OF PROGRESSION A contact is someone who has been exposed to M.TB infection by sharing air space with an infectious TB person. Susceptible contacts are those individuals who are more likely to progress to TB disease once infected. Vulnerable contacts are those individuals who could suffer severe morbidity if they developed TB disease. Persons who are susceptible and/or vulnerable to TB disease are candidates for window prophylaxis , or the treatment of presumptive LTBI during the interval between the time at which infection occurs and when it is detectable via an IGRA or TST. The CDC recommend s that the window period be estimated at 8 to 10 weeks. The following susceptible and vulnerable contacts with initially negative IGRA or TST test results sh ould begin window prophylaxis LTBI treatment after TB disease has been ruled out by clinical ex amination and a CXR : Children less than 5 years of age Immunosuppressed persons Persons at increased risk for progression to TB disease once infected If the second IGRA or TST result is negative and the contact is immunocompetent (including immunocompetent young children) and no longer exposed to infectious TB, treatment for LTBI may be discontinued, and further follow -up is not required. If the second test is negative but the contact i s immunocompromised (e.g., HIV), a full course of LTBI treatment is recommended. If the second test result is negative but the person remains in close contact with an infectious patient, LTBI treatment should be continued if the contact is: less than 5 years old; aged 5 -15 years, at the clinician's discretion ; or HIV-seropositive or otherwise immunocompromised . Contacts known to be, or suspected of being, immunocompromised should be given treatment for LTBI regardless of the IGRA or TST reaction. LTBI TREATMENT REGIMENS AND DOSAGES Treatment of LTBI is an essential part of the strategy to eliminate TB in the U nited States . Persons with LTBI who are considered at increased risk of progressing to TB should be encouraged to start treatment. There are several treatment regimens available for the treatment of LTBI, and providers should discuss options with patients. DOT administration is recommended for p ersons at high risk for progressing to TB who are either suspected of being unlikely to adh ere to treatment or on an intermittent dosing regimen . DOT is especially appropriate when a household member is on DOT for TB disease or in institutions and facilities where a staf f member can observe treatment. High-risk (under 5 years of age or immunocom promised) contacts of active cases should be started promptly on treatment for LTBI. For more information on the treatment of LTBI, see the : Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 6-5 6 - Treatment of April 2021 \"Treatment Regimens for Latent TB Infection\" page on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) TB websi te at https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/ltbi.htm .

In some instances - a contact to a drug -resistant index case o r a patient who has an allergic reaction to rifampin - other medications may need to be used. In such cases, consult with the state TB consultant and/or the Global TB Institute at 1-800-482-3627 . TABLE 2: RECOMMENDED DRUG REGIMENS FOR TREATMENT OF LTBI Priority Rank * Drug Interval and Duration Comments Recommendation/ Evidence Preferred INH + RPT (3HP) Once weekly for 12 weeks in adults Once weekly for 12 weeks in children greater than 2 years of age Missed doses or altered dosing intervals or amounts could jeopardize efficacy or safety ; DOT or SAT may be used consistent with current TB Program policy. Effective February 2020 , CDC and t he National TB Controllers Association recommend 3HP to treat LTBI in adults and children greater than 2 years of age. Data on the safety and pharmacokinetics of rifapentine in children aged <2 years are not available. Refer to Appendix B of this chapter f or current state TB program guidance about the administration of 3HP in children. Strong/Moderate Preferred RIF Daily for 4 months in adults Daily for 4 months in children RIF is used for persons who are contacts of patients with INH-resistant, RIF-susceptible TB. Some antiretroviral drugs, such as the protease inhibitors and NNRTIs, have interactions with the rifamycin s. Clinicians should consult Web -based updates (e.g., https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/htnl/4/ adult -and-adolescent -opportunistic - infection/0 ) or experts for the latest specific recommendations.

Alternative INH Daily for 9 months \u00a7 This regimen is conditionally recommended for adults and children of all ages, both HIV -negative and HIV - positive. In HIV -infected patients, INH may be administered concurrently with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), protease HIV = human immunodeficiency virus. * Preferred: excellent tolerability and efficacy, shorter treatment duration, higher completion rates than longer regimens and therefore higher effectiveness; Alternative: excellent efficacy but concerns regarding longer treatment duration, lower completion rates , and therefore lower effectiveness. ** Prescribing providers and pharmacists who are unfamiliar with rifampin and rifapentine might confuse the two drugs. They are not interchangeable and caution should be taken to ensure that patients receive the correc t medication for the intended treatment regimen. No evidence reported in HIV -positive persons. \u00a7 Strong recommendation for those persons unable to take a preferred regimen (e.g., due to drug intolerability or drug -drug interactions).

Refer to Appendix B of this chapter for more information. DOT may also be used at the clinician's discretion for patients at increased risk of progression from LTBI to TB disease. Refer to Chapter 8 - Directly Observed Therapy for more information. SIDE EFFECTS AND ADVERSE REACTIONS As is true with all medications, anti-TB medications are associated with a predictable incidence of side effects and adverse reactions, some mild, some serious. Regardless of the LTBI treatment regimen selected (INH for 9 months, RIF for 4 months, or INH plus RPT for 12 weeks), patients should be seen by the TB nurse at least once a month so the patient can be assessed for treatment compl iance and any signs or symptoms of side effects or adverse reactions. The patient can also be given the next month's supply of medication during the monthly visit. If the patient is experiencing side effects or adverse reactions, the TB clinician should b e consulted, and the patient may need to be monitored more frequently. Chemistries and CBC, AST/ALT, or other tests based on specific drugs should be done periodically. See Table 5 : Monitoring and Interventions for Side Effects and Adverse Reactions in thi s chapter. Side effects are generally mild, may resolve in time without any intervention and can often be anticipated by the prescribing physician or the TB nurse because they are known to commonly occur. Adverse reactions, however, are usually more severe , in rare instances can be fatal, and require intervention. For example, mild nausea in a patient taking INH may be considered a side effect while severe hepatitis is an adverse reaction. Descriptions of known side effects and adverse reactions for a speci fic prescription drug are based on substantial clinical evidence and can be found in the product package insert (PI) and the patient package insert (PPI). Although it is important to be attuned to the potential for side effects and adverse reactions , it is at least equally important that treatment not be stopped without adequate justification. Mild side effects may resolve without any intervention or may be managed with treatment directed at controlling the symptoms . Adverse reactions can be severe and it is important to recognize adverse reactions that indicate when a drug should not be used. With more severe adverse Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 6-9 6 - Treatment of LTBI Rev. April 2021 reactions , the offending drug or drugs must be discontinued. Proper management of more serious adverse reactions often requires expert medical consultation. Serious adverse reactions are either life -threatening, require inpatient hospitalization or extends the length of current hospitalization, or results in death. Serious adverse reactions will be reported to the U.S Food & Drug Administration (FDA) via MedWa tch at https://www.fda.gov/media/76299/download or by calling the FDA at 1 -800-FDA-1088. BASIC MONITORING STEPS Monitor patients for side effects and adverse reactions following the basic monitoring steps listed below. All health care personnel providing treatment for LTBI should follow the current guidelines : o 2018 \"Update of Recommendations for the Use of Once -Weekly Isoniazid - Rifapentine Regimen to Treat Latent Mycobacterium tuberculosi s Infection \", pages 723-726 at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/pdfs/mm6725a5 -H.pdf o 2011 \"Recommendations for Use of an Isoniazid -Rifapentine Regimen with Direct Observation to Treat Latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection\", pages 1650 -1653 at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6048.pdf o See the \"Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring\" section and Table 8: Medications to Treat LTBI - Doses, Toxicities and Monitoring Requirements of the 2000 LTBI treatment guidelines, \"Targeting Tuberculin Testing and Treatment of LTBI\" at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4906.pdf . It is also important to check for guideline updates posted on the CDC's Division of TB Elimination home page at http://www.cdc.gov/tb/ and the list of guidelines by date a t https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/guidelines/list_date.htm . While on treatment, all patients should be evaluated in person at baseline (before starting treatment) and then at least mont hly for side effects and adverse reactions . More frequent monitoring may be indicated with alternate treatment regimens . No more than a one -month supply of any medication will be given to a patient unless specifically ordered by the TB clinician and approved by the TB Program . The common side effects and adverse reactions reported for drugs used to treat for LTBI are listed in Table 4: Reporting Reactions to Anti -TB Medications . Educate patients to stop the prescribed TB medication(s) and promptly report to the prescribing clinic any of the symptoms or signs listed in Table 4 or any other unexplained illness . o If a patient reports a potential side effect or adverse reaction to the outreach worker, the outreach worker must notify the patient's TB public health nurse ( PHN) immediately. o PHN must assess the patient's side effect or adverse reaction and notify TB clinician and other District Office staff as appropriate. PHN will con tinue to monitor the patient. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 6-10 6 - Treatment of LTBI Rev. April 2021 If you suspect that an anti -TB drug may be causing a side effect or adverse reaction: o Refer to Table 5: Monitoring and Interventions for Side Effects and Adverse Reactions . o Consult with the patient's TB clinician and notify the nurse supervisor . If you suspect that an anti -TB drug may be interacting with other medications that the patient is taking, refer to pages 45 -47 in the \"Treatment of TB\" (MMWR 2003;52[No. RR-11]) at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5211.pdf .

April 2021 Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 6-16 6 - Treatment of LTBI Rev. April 2021 ADHERENCE Non-adherence with medication regimens is a major cause of LTBI treatment failure . Monitor patients face to face for adherence to self -administered LTBI treatment regimens at least once a month throughout treatment. It is difficult to identify who will and who will not be adherent. If patients do not take medicine as directed, the effectiveness of the regimen decreas es and the patient will be at greater risk of progressing to TB disease in the future and of infecting others with TB. ASSESSMENT OF ADHERENCE At each visit, the TB clinician or PHN should assess adherence by doing the following: The initial patient history must be carefully taken. Initial history intake may indicate that the patient is at -risk for non -adher ence with medication ingestion. Inquire about missed doses since their last refill. Staff will encourage patients to bring their bottles of medici ne to the appointment. Staff will count remaining pills and document. If adherence problems are identified, include patients in the problem -solving process. o Ask patients why they think that doses are missed and what could be done better: change the time of day, the location where they keep or take their pills, etc. (Encourage pill box). o Find out if there are barriers to obtaining refills in a timely manner that could be corrected. o Review with patients is their risk of developi ng TB if medicine is not taken . o Mutually agree on a plan to improve adherence. o Provide detailed documentation. Particular attention should be given to patients who receive LTBI therapy because they are close contacts of a case, children, persons who are HIV positive, and patients wit h other medical disorders which increase their risk of developing TB disease. DOT should be considered for patients who are at risk of non -adherence. The physician and nurse shall be jointly responsible for the decision to administer medication by self -administration or by DOT. NON -ADHERENCE NOT DETECTED AT INITIAL VISIT The initial history and observations of the patient may not detect evidence of a lifestyle or other barriers to adherence to a treatment program. The patient who does not keep appointments, have laboratory work done as requested, take medication as directed, and assist the Department in locating close contacts for testing exhibits behavior which supports the impression of non -adherence. If the patient doesn't keep an appointment, the patient should be telephoned the same day or the next working day. Alternatively, the patient can be contacted by a home visit Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 6-17 6 - Treatment of LTBI Rev. April 2021 the same day or the next day. The initial interview should have given the patient the information that return appointments are important . Be sure that the patient understood the appointment time and that the patient can get to the clinic. Negotiate with the patient the earliest return to the clinic. STRATEGIES FOR ALTERING NON -ADHERENT BEHAVIOR The non -adherent patient who is on DOT needs strategies to maintain therapy other than education and appointment reminders. The same PHN should see the patient at each clinic visit. Appointment schedules should be arranged so that patients are not kept waiting. Reimold funds may be used to assist the TB patient with transportation, purchase of meals, and purchase of items which are incentives for compliance. Examples of incentives and enablers, along with information about the TB Program p olicy and procedures for requesting Reimold funds can be found in Chapter 17. REFUSAL OF TREATMENT FOR LTBI If a person refuses treatment, document the refusal in the chart and in PA -NEDSS. For any refusal of treatment, send a letter emphasizing the importance of treatment and confirming the refusal. File a copy of the letter in the chart. Anyone who refuses treatment should be advised to seek medical care if they have symptoms suggestive of TB. MISSED CLINIC APPOINTMENTS FOR LTBI TREATMENT Make one telephone call to the patient . If no response, send a missed appointment letter . If the patient doesn't respond to the telephone call or letter and is at increased risk of progression to TB disease, make a home visit as soon as possible to re -engage the patient. If the re is no response to the above actions , discharge the patient from clinic with the approval of the CHNS and the TB clinician . Document all actions to contact the patient in the patient chart and in PA -NEDSS. COMPLETION OF THERAPY Determine whether the patient has completed therapy based on the total number of doses administered and the length of time in which they were completed (r efer to Table 6). When patients have had lapses in therapy but are still able to complete the recommended number of doses in the allotted time period, enco urage them to complete therapy. For noncompliant patients, consult the TB clinician to determine course of therapy. Assess patients who will not complete appropriate therapy within the time frame specified to determine whether to restart treatment. If the decision is made to retreat the patient, then restart Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 6-18 6 - Treatment of LTBI Rev. April 2021 the entire regimen and follow the recommended treatment plan. Specific factors to consider when determining whether to restart treatment include the following: Individual's risk for developing TB disease Total number of doses of LTBI treatment administered Time elapsed since the last dose of treatment for LTBI Patient adherence issues (previous attempts at completion, willingness to continue, etc.) Give non -adherent patients at very high risk of developing TB disease every opportunity to complete treatment for LTBI. Consider these patients for intermittent therap y with DOT and evaluate the use of incentives and enablers . Treatment of LTBI in contacts is consi dered a priority in TB control activities. Make every effort to assure compl etion of treatment by contacts. All contacts who are being treated for LTBI should be seen face -to-face by the TB nurse at least once every month. Incentives and enablers are recommended as aids to adherence, and the healthcare provider should educate the patient about TB, its treatment, and the signs and symptoms of adverse drug effects at each patient encounter.

Make every effort to encourage patients to adhere to the LTBI treatment regimen. However, if a patient has failed three attempts to complete treatment, no further effort may be merited. The PHN should contact patients who interrupt therapy and are at high risk of developing TB disease (for example, contacts of patien ts with infectious TB, HIV -infected patients, or TB Class 4 patients) for reevaluation. TREATMENT IN SPECIAL SITUATIONS MANAGEMENT OF CLOSE CONTACTS OF DRUG -RESISTANT CASES Close Contacts of Drug -Resistant TB Patients - For persons who have been exposed to INH- resistant, RIF -susceptible TB who are known or suspected to have LTBI, a 4 -month regimen of daily RIF is recommended. When RIF cannot be used, rifabutin may be substituted. Close Contacts of Multidrug -Resistant (MDR) TB Patients - For persons who have been exposed to a TB patient resistant to both INH and RIF and are known or suspected to have LTBI, alternative LTBI treatment regimens should be considered. Alternative regimens should include two drugs to which the TB strain is susceptible. A potential regimen should include daily fluoroquinolone. Many experts are now recommending a fluoroquinolone alone for treatment of LTBI in MDR contacts. The TB clinic physician is encouraged to discuss all aspects of the preventive treatment of contacts to drug resistant cases with the state TB consultant for adult or pediatric TB and/or the Global TB Institute. The drug(s) should be given in standard therapeutic doses in accordance with the information contained in Chapter 7, Treatment of TB Disease . Management of contacts with a high probability of infection with MDR -TB may include immigrants, refugees, and persons from areas of the world which have a high incidence of TB. Consult with the pediatric TB consultant about window prophylaxis treatment for children who are close contacts, especially those younger than 5 years of age. Contacts with known or suspected LTBI who are not immunosuppressed may be treated for 6 months or observed without LTBI treatment for 6 months. Contacts with a high risk of progression to TB disease should receive preventive LTBI treatment. All persons with suspected MDR LTBI should be monitored for 2 years regardless of the treatment regimen. Management of persons intolerant to INH can follow an approach similar to that taken for contacts of INH -resistant cases. Advise the patient to seek medical attention if the signs and symptoms of TB develop. A CXR should be obtained. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 6-20 6 - Treatment of LTBI Rev. April 2021 PREGNANCY AND BREASTFE EDING Pregnancy has minimal influence on the pathogenesis of TB or the likelihood of LTBI progressing to disease. Pregnant women should be targeted for testing only if they have a specific risk factor for LTBI or for the progression of LTBI to TB disease. Extensive use of INH during pregnancy has shown that although the drug readily crosses the placental barrier, it is not teratogenic, even when given during the first four months of gestation. Pregnant women taking INH should receive pyridoxine supplementat ion. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated when the mother is being treated for LTBI. Infants whose breastfeeding mothers are taking INH should receive supplemental pyridoxine. Note that the amount of INH provided by breast milk is inadequate for treatment of the infant. ALCOHOLISM INH (and RIF) can cause hepatitis that may result in additional liver damage in patients with preexisting liver disease. Treatment with these drugs is initiated despite preexisting liver disease as clinically indicated. Drug -induced hepatitis is defined as a serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level more than three times the upper limit of normal in the presence of symptoms or five times the upper limit of normal in the absence of symptoms. Prior to treatment, serologi c testing for hepatitis viruses A, B, and C should be considered, if clinically appropriate . Close monitoring, symptom review and repeat serologic testing, is essential in the management of a patient with an elevated serum AST. To monitor for hepatitis: Conduct clinical monitoring on the initial visit and at least monthly Educate patients about symptoms and signs of adverse reactions, and instruct patients to stop treatment should symptoms occur and contact SHC If the patient is on DOT, assess for adverse r eactions at each visit REFERENCES Guidelines for the Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis Infection: Recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020.

April 2021 CHAPTER 6, APPENDIX B: UPDATED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF ISONIAZID PLUS RIFAPENTINE TO TREAT LATENT TB INFECTION (LTBI) This document summarizes key updates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Pennsylvania Tuberculosis (TB) Program concerning the use of 3HP. The full text of the updated CDC recommendations was published in the June 29, 2018 issue of the CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report . The key updates address the use of 3HP in children and in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (i ncluding acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS) and introduce the opportunity for self -administration. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Treatment of LTBI is essential to controlling and eliminating TB in the United States because it substantially reduces the risk that latent TB infection will progress to TB disease. Since the CDC first recommended 3HP for the treatment of LTBI in 2011, ad ditional research has been done in multiple patient populations to evaluate the efficacy, safety and treatment completion rates for 3HP. In 2017, a CDC Work Group did a systematic review and meta - analysis of published data concerning the 3HP regimen, the r esults of which were published in June 20181. The meta -analysis determined that 3HP \"is as safe and effective as other recommended [LTBI] regimens and achieves substantially higher treatment completion rates\". Based on all available data, the CDC continu es to recommend 3HP for treatment of LTBI in adults and now recommends use of 3HP: In persons with LTBI aged 2 to 17 years; In persons with LTBI who have HIV infection, including AIDS, and are taking antiretroviral medications with acceptable drug -drug int eractions with rifapentine; and By directly observed therapy (DOT) or self -administered therapy (SAT) in persons aged 2 years and older. The CDC advises health care providers to choose the mode of administration (DOT or SAT) based on local practice, indiv idual patient attributes and preferences, and other considerations 1 Njie GJ, Morris SB, Isoniazid tuberculosis infection: a systematic review and meta -analysis. Am J Prev Med 2018. Epub June https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2018.04.30 Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 6B-2 6B- Recommendations for Use of INH + RPT Rev. April 2021 including the patient's risk for progression to severe forms of TB disease2. The CDC also recommends that all individuals on 3HP be evaluated monthly to assess compliance with treatment an d side effects, and that patients taking 3HP via SAT be encouraged to maintain a medication diary in which they record 1) each date they took their medication and 2) any difference in the day of the week they took their medication (e.g., the patient agreed to take their medication every Tuesday but took it on Wednesday in week 4). Lastly, the updated CDC recommendations state that additional studies are needed to understand the: Pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerance of 3HP in children less than 2 years of age; Adherence to and safety of 3HP when self -administered by persons aged less than 18 years; and Safety of 3HP during pregnancy. PENNSYLVANIA TB PROGRAM RECOMMENDATIONS The Pennsylvania TB Program encourages increased use of the 3HP regimen in appropr iate patients and recommends that 3HP be administered as follows: Patients less than 18 years of age should receive 3HP via DOT. Self -administered therapy (SAT) with 3HP has not been studied in persons younger than 18 years of age. Strong consideration of the patient's age, medical history, social circumstances, and risk factors for progression to severe TB disease should be given when making the decision regarding the administration of 3HP. o DOT is strongly recommended for patients on 3HP at high risk of progression to TB including, but not limited to: persons with conditions such as end stage -renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and organ transplantation; persons who use alcohol or illegal drugs; and persons with an incomplete TB treatment history. DOT is al so highly recommended for patients who require translation services. o For patients aged 1 8 years and older at low risk of progression to TB, a combination of DOT and SAT may be considered, with each DOT visit including an in -person assessment of treatment compliance and side effects. Doses one, two, six and 10 of 3HP are provided via DOT with the patient self -administering doses three through five, seven through nine, and doses 11 and 12. Patients should have a final clinic visit upon completion o f treatment. A combination of in -person DOT and video DOT may be utilized for patients meeting video DOT eligibility criteria. All patients on the DOT+SAT regimen will maintain a medication diary and record any side effects. The 3HP regimen is not approved for use by pregnant women. 2 Groups at higher risk of pr ogression to TB disease include, but are not limited to, children less than 5 years of age; persons with HIV infection; persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis within the last 2 years; foreign -born persons; and persons with other immunocompromising conditions such as diabetes, end stage renal disease, or organ transplantation. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 6B-3 6B- Recommendations for Use of INH + RPT Rev. April 2021 Clinicians with questions about 3HP or the most appropriate mode of administration for a specific patient can call the TB program at 717 -787-6267 to request a consultation. OTHER INFORMATION The updated CDC recommendat ions also include the following information: Approximately 5% of patients discontinue 3HP because of adverse events. Side effects typically occur after the first three to four doses and usually resolve without treatment within 24 hours. However, if sympto ms suggestive of a systemic drug reaction occur3, patients should stop 3HP while the underlying cause is determined. Data published since 2011 confirm the effectiveness of 3HP in individuals with HIV infection who are not taking antiretroviral therapy and demonstrate the absence of clinically significant drug interactions between once -weekly rifapentine and either efavirenz or raltegravir in individuals with HIV infection treated with those antiretroviral medications. Simultaneous use of LTBI treatment and antiretroviral medications in patients with HIV infection should be guided by clinicians experienced in the management of both conditions. 3 Such as fever, headache, dizziness, nausea, muscle and bo ne pain, rash and itching Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-1 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease Chapter 7: Treatment of TB Disease INTRODUCTION PURPOSE The overall goals for treatment of TB are to cure the patient and to minimize the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis ) to others. In the 2005 \"Controlling Tuberculosis in the United States: Recommendations from the American Thoracic Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America,\" one of the recommended strategies to achieve the goal of reduct ion of TB morbidity and mortality is the early and accurate detection, diagnosis, and reporting of TB cases, leading to initia tion and completion of treatment. Successful treatment of TB has benefits both for the individual patient and the community in which the patient resides. TB clinicians and nurses should understand and follow national and Pennsylvania (PA) guidelines when providing care to patients with TB disease: Follow basic treatment principles for TB disease . Select appropriate treatment regimens, dosages, and duration. Administer TB medication s via d irectly observed therapy (DOT) as a best practice standard of care. Monitor patients for sid e effects and adverse reactions. Assess patients' response to treatment . Determine completion of therapy . Determine the need for post -treatment evaluation . Provide treatment in special situations, such as when a patient has drug -resistant TB or TB/HIV co -infection. Hospitalize and coordinate hospital discharges of patients wi th infectious TB. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-2 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease POLICY All patients with TB disease in Pennsylvania should receive and complete treatment in accordance with the national guidelines set forth in the Pennsylvania TB Manual, the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH) Public Health Polici es, Procedures and Standing Orders and in accordance with Pennsylvania laws and regulations. BASIC TREATMENT PRINCIPLES Follow the basic treatment principles for TB disease , as outlined in Table 1. TABLE 1: BASIC TREATMENT PRINCIPLES FOR TUBERCULOSIS DISEASE Phase Principles At Start of Treatment Patient -centered care and DOT. An adherence plan should tailor treatment and supervision to each patient by considering his or her clinical and social circumstances (patient -centered care), as well as emphasizing DOT. Cultural competence. It is imperative to become culturally competent and guide other healthcare providers toward culturally competent healthcare. A culturally competent system acknowledges cultural diffe rences regarding healthcare and incorporates them into all levels of the healthcare delivery system, from policy to provider to patient. HIV testing. HIV testing will be offered to all patients with TB disease. Document outcome in the patient chart . Medica l supervision. Patients with confirmed or suspected tuberculosis (TB) disease must be under the medical supervision of a provider who is licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a medical physician. Prompt start. Start patients with confirmed or sus pected TB disease promptly on appropriate treatment. It is not necessary to wait for laboratory confirmation. Regimen During Treatment Multiple drugs. Treatment regimens must contain multiple drugs to which the organism is susceptible. The administration of a single drug or the addition of a single drug to a failing regimen can lead to the development of resistance. Never add a single drug to a failing regimen. Single doses. TB medications should be administered together as a single dose rather than in divided doses. A single dose leads to higher and potentially more effective peak serum concentrations and facilitates DOT. Although ingesting the medications with food will del ay or moderately decrease the absorption of the medications, the effects are of little clinical significance. Pyridoxine to prevent neuropathy. Pyridoxine (Vitamin B -6, 25 mg) is recommended for some individuals receiving isoniazid (INH) as part of their treatment regimen to prevent peripheral neuropathy. It should be used in persons at risk for neuropathy (women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or persons with nutritional deficiency, diabetes, HIV infection, renal failure, or alcoholism). Persistent Positive Cultures Evaluation when positive cultures persist. Monitor for culture conversion and promptly evaluate patients with persistently positive cultures after 3 months of therapy to identify the cause. Treatment failure is defined as continued or recurrent positive cultures after 4 months of treatment. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-3 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease Phase Principles At Completion of Treatment Completion in terms of the number of doses. The criteria for treatment completion are based upon the total number of doses observed via DOT and not solely on the duration of therapy. TUBERCULOSIS INFECTIOUSNESS Patients with signs or symptoms of TB shall be given a surgical mask and instructed to keep it on during clinic visits and visits outside their residence, until they are considered not infectious. The patient will b e informed when the physician determines the patient is no longer infectious . (See #4 below for the criteria used to determine infectiousness as listed in the CDC \"Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis in Healthcare Settings, 2005\") Health care workers, including outreach workers, shall use particulate respirators to prevent the inhalation of M. tuberculosis when visiting the home of an infectious TB patient and while treating an infectious patient in the clinic . In general, patients who have suspected or confirmed active pulmonary , pleural or laryngeal tuberculosis should be considered infectious if they: o are coughing ; o are undergoing cough -inducing or aerosol -generating procedures ; o have sputum smears positive for acid -fast bacilli (AFB) and they are not receiving therapy, have just started therapy, or have a poor clinical or bacteriologic response to therapy ; and/or o have ca vitary disease on radiographic studies . Patients may be considered not infectious if they meet ALL THREE of the following criteria: o They have received adequate therapy for a minimum of 2 to 3 weeks. o They have a minimum of three (3) consecutive negative sputum smear results from sputum specimens collected at least 8 hours apart with one s pecimen obtained in the early morning. o They have a favorable clinical response to therapy (i.e., reduction in cough, weight gain, resolution of fever). BASELINE LABORATORY STUDIES All TB patients shall have the following laboratory tests performed : o CBC o Platelet count (or a platelet estimate on smear) Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-4 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease o Blood chemistry screening to include an AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, serum creatinine, BUN, and uric acid o HIV test (unless patient opts out) Note: One of the NTIP objectives for 202 5 is to increase the proportion of TB patients who have a positive or negative HIV result reported. The clinic nurse should have test results available for the TB clinician to review before medications are started. Visual acuity testing (reading small print, such as newspaper and Snellen eye chart) and color testing (Ishihara Color Chart) must be performed before ethambutol (EMB) is administered , and monthly while taking EMB, since EMB may affect eyesight. o These visi on screening tests should be done in the clinic and do cumented in the medical record. o The tests should be repeated monthly while the patient receives EMB. Snellen readings should be recorded as 20/20, 20/30, 20/40 etc. with a notation of the number of miss ed letters viewed, e.g. 20/20 -1; 20/30 -2. Refer to Snellen Chart Instructions. o The Ishihara color plates are designed to read in a room that is adequately lit by daylight. When it is convenient only to use electric light, it should be adjusted as far as possible to resemble the effect of natural daylight. The plates are held 75 cm (approx. 2 feet) from the subject and tilted so that the plane of the paper is at right angles to the line of vision. Refer to Ishihara Instructions. o If the results are ques tionable, the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation. The clinic nurse should notify the TB Program prior to any such referrals to obtain preauthorization. o Document results in the patient 's chart . DIRECTLY OBSERVED THERAPY (DOT) DOT is the standard of care for TB disease. All TB patients should receive their anti -tuberculosis medications via DOT as specified in Chapter 8: Directly Observed Therapy of this manual. Document all DOT doses in the patient 's chart. INTERMITTENT THERAPY An intermittent therapy regimen may be used for patients with non -cavitary disease if clinically appropriate. Intermittent antibiotic therapy is any therapy regimen where the patient is not required to take medication every day for TB. Intermittent thera py must be given at least three times a week. A twice-weekly regimen is no longer recommended because of an increased incidence of relapse. Intermittent therapy is always given as DOT. Intermittent therapy is never Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-5 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease self-administered. Intermittent administration of anti -TB medications is no longer recommended for HIV positive patients. The October 2016 ATS/CDC/IDSA guidelines for the treatment of drug -susceptible tuberculosis state that the \"use of i ntermittent treatment regimens in HIV positive patients has been associated with high rates of relapse and the emergence of drug resistance \". The state TB consultant does not recommend intermittent therapy for patients with cavitary disease. CLINICAL MONITORING DURING TREATMENT All patients with TB disease shall be seen monthly by the TB clinic physician and monitored at least monthly by the nurse. Patients should be asked about any side effects or adverse reactions experienced while on treatment and the responses documented in the patient record. If the patient's treatment regimen includes EMB monthly visual acuity and color testing must be done and documented in the patient record . INH-induced hepatitis: Patients taking INH should be monitored monthly for signs of hepatitis. LABORATORY STUDIES DURING TREATMENT Patients taking INH, a rifamycin, or pyrazinamide for the treatment of TB disease should have monthly liver function laboratory tests are not necessary during treatment unless the patient has signs or symptoms suggestive of toxicity to the medications. If symptoms suggestive of toxicity occur, the appropriate laboratory tests should be done. AST and bilirubin must be don e for symptoms suggestive of hepatic toxicity, a platelet count for excessive bleeding or bruising and other tests as indicated. The medication which is suspected to cause the symptoms should be discontinued until the laboratory tests are interpreted by th e clinician. Never leave the patient on one drug. Either stop all medications or continue the patient on two or more medications if the patient was initially started on two or more. For patients with an AFB positive smear at baseline, begin weekly collecti on of sputum specimens as follows: o For patients with cavities upon CXR and/or baseline sputum smears that are 3+ (moderate) or 4 (heavy), wait until the patient has completed one to two weeks of treatment before collecting the first follow -up sputum specim en. o For patients without cavities upon CXR and/or baseline sputum smears that are 1+ (rare) or 2+ (few), a sputum specimen can be collected once the patient completes one week of treatment. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-6 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease o For both a ) and b) above, if the first sputum is negative, obtain a second sputum specimen . If the second s pecimen is negative, obtain a third. If any one s pecimen is positive, wait one week and re -start the collection process. o Once three consecutive smear -negative specimen s are collected: \u00ad patients on isolation can be considered for release and/or \u00ad sputum specimen s can then be collected monthly (in sets of three) until conversion to culture negative is documented. TREATMENT REGIMENS AND DOSAGES Use this information to : identify the appropriate regimen , determine the appropriate dosage for each drug , and determine the duration of treatment. The information in this topic was provided using guidelines for treating drug-susceptible TB that have been devel oped by the ATS, C DC, and IDSA. See the \"Treatment in Special Situations\" topic in this chapter for information on treatment when there is drug -resistant TB, HIV infection, liver disease, or renal disease; when the patient is taking tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF -) antagonists; where there is culture -negative TB or extrapulmonary TB; when the patient is pregnant or breastfeeding; when the patient is of pediatric age ; or when the patient has TB disease and nontuberculosis mycobacterium infection. TABLE 2: REGIMENS Identify the appropriate regimen for the patient. There are four basic regimens recommended for treating adults with TB caused by organisms that are known or presumed to be susceptible to INH, RIF, PZA, and EMB. Children, depending on the circumstances, may not receive EMB in the initial phase of a six -month regimen, but the regimens are otherwise identical. Each regimen has an initial phase of 8 weeks , followed by a choice of several options for a continuation phase of either 18 or 31 -32 weeks . In Table 3: Drug Regimens for Culture - Positive Pulmonary Tuberculosis Caused by Drug -Susceptible Organisms , the init ial phase is denoted by a number (1, 2, 3, or 4), and the options for the continuation phase are denoted by the respective number and a letter designation (a, b, or c). Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-7 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease DOT is the standard of care for all anti-tuberculosis treatment regimens and should be used in accordance with the PA DOH Best Practice document . The recommended regimens, and the number of doses specified by each regimen, are described in Table 3 . Note: Two of the NTIP objectives for 202 5 address TB treatment initiati on. 1. Treatment initiation: For TB patients with positive AFB sputum smear results, increase the proportion who initiated treatment within 7 days of specimen collection. 2. Recommended Initial Therapy: For patients whose diagnosis is likely to be TB disease, in crease the proportion who are started on the recommended initial 4 -drug regimen.

Clinical Infectious Diseases , Volume 63,Issue 7, 1 October 2016, Pages e147 -e195 DURATION OF TREATMENT Use the treatment algorithm in Figure 1: Treatment Algorithm for Tuberculosis to dete rmine the duration of treatment. The recommended regimens for treating patients with TB caused by drug-susceptible organisms have a duration of six to nine months. Each regimen has an initial phase of 8 weeks , followed by a continuation phase of either 18 or 31-32 weeks . Figure 1 gives direction s for treating patients with pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. The standard duration of treatment for pulmonary TB is 26 weeks unless both the patient's chest x - ray (CXR ) indicates cavitation is present and the patient is still culture positive after two months of treatment or has a co -morbidity such as diabetes in which case 40 weeks is recommended . 1. For tuberculous meningitis, the optimal length of therapy has not been established, although most experts recommend 9 to 12 months with 12 months preferred. For children with TB meningitis, use a 12 -month regimen. 2. The recommended duration of t reatment for TB of the bone or joint is 9 months. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-12 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease 3. In HIV -negative, culture -negative patients, tr eatment for 18 weeks may be adequate if there is clinical or radiographic improvement and no other etiology identified. However, HIV-infected patients with culture -negative pulmonary TB should be treated for a minimum of 26 weeks . 4. In some cases, either bec ause of intolerance or drug -resistance, the above -described regimens cannot be used. In these instances, an alternative regimen may be required. Source: ATS, CDC, IDSA.

Feb 2022 TB Disease SIDE EFFECTS AND ADVERSE REACTIONS As is true with all medications, anti-TB medications are associated with a predictable incidence of side effects and adverse reactions, some mild, some serious. While on treatment, the patient should be seen monthly by the TB clinic physician and monitored at le ast monthly by the nurse for treatment compliance and any signs and symptoms of side effects or adverse reactions. If the patient is experiencing side effects or adverse events , the TB clinician should be consulted and the patient may need to be monitored more frequently. Chemistries and CBC, AST, ALT, or other tests based on specific drugs should be done. See Table 8 : Monitoring and Interventions for Side Effects and Adverse Reactions in this section. Side effects are generally mild, may resolve in time without any intervention and can often be anticipated by the prescribing physician or the TB nurse because they are known to commonly occur. Adverse reactions, however, are usually more severe, in rare instances can be fatal, and require intervention. For example, mild nausea in a patient taking INH may be considered a side effect while severe hepatitis is an adverse reaction. Descriptions of known side effects and adverse reactions for a specific prescription drug ar e based on substantial clinical evidence and can be found in the product package insert (PI) and the patient package insert (PPI). Although it is important to be attuned to the potential for side effects and adverse reactions, it is at least equally impo rtant that treatment not be stopped without adequate justification. Mild side effects may resolve without any intervention or may be managed with treatment directed at controlling the symptoms. Adverse reactions can be severe and it is important to recogni ze adverse reactions that indicate when a drug should not be used. With more severe adverse reactions, the offending drug or drugs must be discontinued. Proper management of more serious adverse reactions often requires expert medical consultation. Serious a dverse reactions are either life-threatening, require inpatient hospitalization or extends the length of current hospitalization, or results in death. Serious adverse reactions will be reported to the U.S Food & Drug Administration (FDA) via MedWa tch at https://www.fda.gov/media/76299/download or by calling the FDA at 1 -800-FDA-1088. BASIC MONITORING STEPS Monitor patients for side effects and adverse reactions following the basic monitoring steps listed below. All health care personnel providing treatment for TB disease should follow the current guidelines, \"Treatment of Drug -Susceptible Tuberculosis\" , Clinical Infectious Diseases , Volume 63, Issue 7, 1 October 2016, Pages 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease It is also important to check for guideline updates posted on the CDC's Division of Tuberculosis Elimination home page at http://www.cdc.gov/tb/ and the list of guidelines by date at: https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/guidelines/list_date.htm . While on treatment, all patients should be evaluated in person at baseline (before starting treatment) and then at l east monthly for side effects and adverse reactions . The common side effects and adverse reactions to drugs used for the treatment of TB diseases are listed in Table 7: Reporting Reactions to Anti -tuberculosis Medications . Educate patients to stop the medi cine and promptly report any of the signs or symptoms listed in Table 7 or any unexplained illness to the prescribing clinic immediately. o If a patient reports a potentially serious adverse reaction, hold the medications, call the TB clinician immediately a nd alert the community health nurse supervisor. o If a patient reports a potentially less severe side effect, call the TB clinician immediately and monitor the patient. o If hepatotoxicity is suspected, complete the MedWatch form available at: https://www.fda.gov/media/76299/download . If you suspect that an anti -tuberculosis drug may be causing a particular side effect or adverse reaction refer to Table 8: Monitoring and Interventions for Side Effects and Adverse Reactions . If you suspect that an anti -tuberculosis drug may be interactin g with other medications that the patient is taking, refer to pages 45 -47 in the \"Treatment of Tuberculosis\" (MMWR lowing patient information: o Review of symptoms, side effects, and adverse reactions ( include any labs that were ordered/collected ) o Education provided o Refill provided (number of pills on hand, number dispensed) o Description of any problems encountered and ac tion taken for that visit o Next appointment REPORTING REACTIONS Table 7 is intended for use by the community health nurse ( CHN) and/or outreach worker providing care to the patient. The patient should be instructed to contact the CHN if he or she experiences any of the side effects or adverse reactions listed in Table 7. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-15 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease If a patient reports a potentially serious adverse reaction, the CHN should notify the patient's TB clinician immediately. In consultation with the TB clinician, the CHN should instruct the patient to stop TB medications until evaluated by the clinician. If a patient reports a potentially less severe side effect, the CHN should notify the TB clinician within 24 hours and monitor the patient. TABLE 7: REPORTING REACTIONS TO ANTI -TUBERCULOSIS MEDICATIONS Potentially Serious Adverse Reactions* Less Severe Signs and Symptoms* Immediately report the following signs and symptoms or other abnormalities or unexpected events to the patient's TB clinician . These signs and symptoms suggest potentially serious adverse reactions , including hepatotoxicity: Jaundice Dark urine Vomiting Abdominal pain Fever Visual changes Marked clinical rash In consultation with the TB clinician, instruct the patient to stop TB medications until evaluated by the TB clinician. Report the following signs and sym ptoms to the patient's TB clinician within 24 hours: Anorexia Nausea Malaise Peripheral neuropathy: tingling or burning sensation in hands or feet Rashes * These lists are not all -inclusive.

Rifamate\u00ae (INH and RIF) Rifater\u00ae (INH, RIF, PZA) See comments under individual drugs above Note: The PA TB program neither stocks nor uses Rifamate and Rifater. Rifamate is a combination of INH and RIF. Rifater is a combination of INH, RlF, and PZA. Use of either of these medications has the advantage of having the patient take fewer units of medication. Patients cannot arbitrarily stop taking one medication while remaining on another when given a combination pill. Studies have shown side effects on these combination medications differ very little from the side effects noted from using individual doses of each drug.

Feb 2022 TB Disease NON -ADHERENCE ENFORCEMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC TREATMENT REGIMENS FOR NON -ADHERENCE Patients who are infectious and do not follow isolation, diagnostic, and treatment regimens prescribed by the DOH to render them non -communicable are to be provided with an initial warning that a future failure to cooperate may prompt action by the departm ent to enforce adherence. o It is preferred that the initial warning be given verbally by TB clinic staff and then followed -up in writing . o When feasible, another employee or clinician should be present for purposes of corroboration if court action is subsequently taken. o The warning and the way it was communicated are to be recorded in the patient's medical record and PA -NEDSS. Language and cultural barriers should be considered when issuing the warning and appropriate translation must be provided. If the patient remains non -adherent, a second more stringent letter shall be hand delivered to the patient with prior approval from legal counsel . This letter should be prepared and presented to the patient if the initial verbal/written warning is ignored. The patient should sign the letter acknowledging receipt and understanding of the letter. The patient's signature should be observed by two witnesses who als o sign the letter in the space provided. All actions taken with respect to a non -adherent patient (such as attempts to locate, communicat ion with family, etc.) and all departures by the patient from prescribed treatment or other directives are to be fully and legibly recorded in the patient's medical record and PA -NED SS. PERSISTENT NON -ADHERENCE The TB Program must be notified of any patient who misses more than three consecutive DOT visits. If significant non -adherence persists, such as repeated failures to take medications, adhere to isolation instructions, keep appointments, or provide specimens for laboratory tests, consider a letter to the patient consistent with the policy and procedures in effect in your jurisdiction . It is recommended that t he letter be written by the TB clinic staff to suit the situation. Include a brief summary of the dates, times and circumstances pertaining to the missed doses. Be sure the letter is clear, concise and states the corrective action expected of the patient in terms he or she can readily understand. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-21 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease All actions taken with respect to a non -adherent patient (such as attempts to locate, communications with family, etc.) and all departures by the patient f rom prescribed treatment or other directives are to be fully and legibly recorded in the patient's medical record and PA -NEDSS. Note: Record keeping standards apply at all times, but adherence with these standards is critical in case legal action is deem ed necessary . If there is a significant violation of the directions given in the letter, a court order may be needed to more forcefully persuade the patient to compl y with an appropriate medical care regimen. When the clinic staff believes a court order is necessary , the following preparations are recommended: o Determine the care regimen to be impose d (revising the violated regimen if appropriate) o Prepare a list of directions for the patient to follow that are to be included in the court order o Evaluate whether a request for Reimold funds to provide for nutrition, shelter or transportation is needed to help the patient remain on treatment o Consult with your legal advisor If a court order is ultimately secured and the patient violates the order, th e clinic staff shall immediately inform the nurse supervisor, who will consult with the TB clinician and the legal advisor to determine whether confinement is indicated. HOSPITALIZATION OR INCARCERATION FOR NON -ADHERENCE Hospitalization or incarceration of an infectious non -adherent patient for acute care is possible in a hospital or detention facility with respiratory isolation capability. If confinement of the patient is deemed necessary to ensure treatment adherence, follow the TB policy and procedures i n effect for your local jurisdiction. MEDICAL INTERPRETATION SERVICES If the patient is not comfortable speaking in Englis h, arrange for a professional medical interpreter who speaks the patient's primary language to be available via phone. Avoid asking a family member or friend to interpret unless no other option is available. To arrange for a professional medical interpreter , follow the instructions provided by the DOH contractor for medical interpretation services. Here are some do's and don'ts when interviewing a patient with the support of an interpreter: Do plan ahead. Before meeting with a patient, try to determine whether they are comfortable speaking in English. If not, arrange for a professional medical interpreter who speaks the patient' s primary language to be available via phone. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-22 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease Do speak directly to the patient, not the interpreter. Do ask one question at a time. Do avoid using medical jargon. Do pay attention to nonverbal cues by the patient . Do encourage the patient to ask questions. Do respect the patient's privacy and modesty. Don't use family members - especially children - or a f riend to interpret unless no other option is available. Don't ignore cultural differences e.g., some cultures view looking at someone directly as a sign of aggression. Don't rely on brochures to communicate - they can reinforce your conversation but should not replace it. Don't shout - not being comfortable speaking English doesn't mean the person is hard of hearing! Also, be aware of t he following behavioral cues when talking with a patient: If a patient shows signs of impatience or annoyance during your conversation, that may indicate intercultural misunderstanding. If a patient asks you personal questions, that may indicate a cultural need to establish trust and reassurance. Hesitation by the patient when talking with you may mean you've hit a cultural wall. Try to treat the patient the way he or she wants to be treated - not the way you like to be treated. If patients repeat your inst ructions exactly, it's possible they are repeating your words without understanding them. Rephrase your instructions and ask the patient to restate in his or her own words. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-23 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease RESPONSE TO TREATMENT The key measure of a patient's response to treatment is sputum culture conversion to negative. For patients whose sputum smears are positive before treatment, begin follow -up weekly sputum collection as described in the \"Laboratory Studies During Treatmen t\" section of this chapter . Once three consecutive weekly specimens are smear negative, additional specimens should be collected monthly until conversion to culture negative is documented. Patients with multidrug -resistant tuberculosis (XDR -TB) should have cultures performed monthly for the entire course of treatment. Note: One of the NTIP objectives for 202 5 is to increase the proportion of TB patients with positive sputum smear results who have documen t conversion to negative results within 60 days of treatment initiation. In some cases, a patient may not be able to produce a sputum specimen after 8 weeks of treatment. If the patient has improved clinically and has shown chest radiograph improvement, treatment may be continued as if the patient had a negative sputum specimen at 8 weeks . Important treatment decisions concerning the continuation phase regimen are based on the micro bacteriological status at the end of the initial phase of treatment, which is at the minimum of 8 weeks of treatment. The initial treatment period may extend bey ond 8 weeks in some circumstances: Patients with cavitary disease with positive cultures at 8 weeks should be evaluated to increase the continuation phase of therapy from 18 to 31 -32 weeks for a total of nine months of treatment. Patients whose cultures have not become negative after 12 weeks of therapy should be re-evaluated for potential drug resistant disease, as well as for potential inadequate drug levels and potential failure to adhere to the regimen. Patients who have positi ve cultures after 18 weeks of treatment should be considered as having failed treatment and be managed accordingly. For treatment decisions at the 12 to 18 weeks interval, a consultation with the state TB medical consultant or the Global TB Institute should be obtained. The consultants have expertise in the management of drug resistance and treatment failures. Radiographic evaluations during treatment are of less importance than sputum evaluation. Patients whose cultures remain positive or whose symptoms do not resolve after 12 weeks of therapy should be reevaluated for drug -resistant disease, potential inadequate drug levels and for compliance issues. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-24 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease CULTURE POSITIVE AFTER THREE MONTHS The patient who is culture positive after 12 weeks of treatment must be reassessed. Because the results of the culture taken at the third month will not be available for a period of time, a positive smear is enough information to presume that the culture w ill be positive. If the initial culture showed the organisms sensitive to all first line drugs, the best explanation of the smear findings is that the patient has not taken sufficient medication. Infrequently, a patient with a large bacillary load will not improve the sputum smear after 12 weeks of therapy. A Molecular Detection of Drug Resistance (MDDR) test should be considered for a patient who is culture positive after three months. MDDR testing can quickly identify drug resistance so that an effective anti-TB regimen can be prescribed. Only specimen s in which M. tuberculosis complex has been detected should be submitted to CDC for MDDR testing, and such specimen s must be submitted by the state Bureau of Laboratories (BOL). If drug susceptibility results show resistance to any of the first -line drugs or if the patient remains symptomatic or smear - or culture -positive after 12 weeks consult the state TB medical consultant or the Global TB Institute . When the culture and sensit ivities done in the third month are returned, a new medication program may be needed. The clinician must consult with the state TB medical consultant or the Global TB Institute if drug resistant organisms are isolated. Patients whose cultures are positive and whose smears are positive are probably infectious and must remain isolated until the smears show no acid -fast bacilli. In patients with negative sputum cultures before treatment, the major indicators of response to therapy are the chest radiograph and clinical evaluation. The intervals at which chest radiography should be repeated depend on the clinical circumstances and the differential diagnosis that is being considered, but usually should be no more than every three months. If the radiograph does not improve after the patient has received three months of treatment, the abnormality may be the result of either previous (not current) TB or another process . TREATMENT FAILURE Any patient whose sputum has not converted to negative (either smear or culture) after 26 weeks of treatment is a treatment failure. A current sputum specimen shall be submitted for smear, culture, and susceptibility testing. While the results are pending, the present medication regimen is continued. Consultation with the state TB medical consultant or the Global TB Institute shall be obtained. Two drugs not previously ordered may be given after consultation. The regimen should be adjusted after the culture s and sensitivities taken at six months are reviewed. Treatment must be by DOT. A treatment failure must be reported to the TB Program. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-25 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease COMPLETION OF TREATMENT Completion of treatment occurs when the patient has taken the prescribed regimen of antibiotics, converted cultures and/or smears to negative, has cleared the symptoms of disease, and, for pulmonary disease, has a CXR which is stable. A patient who complet es the 26 weeks of treatment is recommended to obtain a CXR at the conclusion of treatment, and - if the CXR has not returned to normal - again at 6 months post treatment. A patient who completes treatment should be told during their last clinic visit that if their TB symptoms re occur, they should return to the clinic (or to the private physician). Symptoms suggesting TB recurrence are cough and sputum production for more than two weeks, weight loss, and fever. Completion of treatment is determined base d on a) the total number of doses administered b) within a recommended maximum timeframe. If there are no interruptions in drug administration, 26 weeks is usually the minimum duration of treatment for TB disease. Eighteen (18) weeks of treatment may be adequate for HIV-negative, culture -negative patients, if there is clinical or radiographic improvement and no other etiology is identified. Treating a patient for a defined duration, without accounting for the number of doses taken, can result in undertreat ment. Occasionally , either because of drug toxicity or nonadherence to the treatment regimen, the specified number of doses cannot be administered within the targeted period. In these cases, the goal is to deliver the specified number of doses within a rec ommended maximum time frame . For example, for a six -month daily regimen, the total doses should be administered within nine months of beginning treatment. If treatment is not completed within this period, the patient should be assessed to determine the appropriate action to take, such as continuing treatment for a longer duration or restarting treatment from the beginning. Interruptions in treatment may have a significant effect on the duration of therapy. Reinstitution of treatment must consider the ext ensiveness of the disease (e.g., cavitary versus noncavitary disease on chest radiograph, smears and cultures, immunologic status), the point in time when the interruption occurred, and the duration of the interruption. The earlier in treatment an interrup tion occurs and the longer the duration of the interruption, the more serious the effect and the greater the need to rest art therapy from the beginning. Note: A 202 5 NTIP objective for patients with newly diagnosed TB disease - for whom 12 months or less o f treatment is indicated - is to increase the proportion of such patients who do complete treatment within 12 months. RELAPSE AFTER COMPLETION OF TREATMENT A patient whose TB is suspected of recurring twelve months or more after completing treatment shoul d be carefully evaluated. If the patient took the initial course of treatment, Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-26 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease the organisms may still be sensitive to first line drugs and the initial treatment schedules shall be utilized until cultures and sensitivities are obtained. If relapse occurs a nd the nurse or clinician believes that the patient may not have taken or completed the initial course of treatment , directly observed therapy of at least two antibiotics not previously ordered shall be the method of treatment. Treatment can be changed when the results of culture and susceptibility studies are reviewed. Relapse is definite when cultures are positive. Worsening of a CXR with clinical symptoms suggests relapse. Biopsy findings of acid-fast bacteria and/or isolation of M. tuberculos is from an extra -pulmonary site also indicates relapse. Treatment is continued for at least eighteen months or at least twelve months after the last positive culture, if cultures are still positive after the initial six months of treatment. All patients be ing treated for relapse are recommended to be seen monthly by the physician. Patients treated for relapse must be questioned regarding any toxic manifestations of the drugs they are receiving. Any necessary clinical laboratory examinations should be perfo rmed. WARNING: NEVER ADD A SINGLE NEW ANTI -TUBERCULOSIS DRUG TO A FAILING REGIMEN AS THIS WILL LEAD TO RESISTANCE TO THE NEW DRUG. POST -TREATMENT EVALUATION Routine follow -up after completion of therapy is not necessary for patients with a satisfactory and prompt bacteriologic response to a six - or nine -month regimen that includ ed both isoniazid and rifampin. The table below describes the clinician's responsibilities at completion of therapy for patients with a) drug-susceptible TB and b) drug-resistant TB. TABLE 9: CLINICIAN'S RESPONSIBILITIES AT COMPLETION OF THERAPY Drug Susceptibility Clinician's Actions Drug -susceptible organisms Instruct the patient to promptly report the development of any symptoms, particularly prolonged cough, fever, or weight loss. Organisms resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, or both Individualize follow -up evaluation. May include x -ray and three sputa at conclusion of treatment, and at 6 month s, 12 months and up to 24 months post treatment. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-27 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease TREATMENT IN SPECIAL SITUATIONS Treatment of TB in the following situations requires a high level of expertise or close consultation with an expert to provide appropriate management: Drug -resistant TB HIV infection Liver disease Renal insufficiency and end -stage renal disease (ESRD) TB associated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF -) -negative pulmonary Treatment of TB caused by drug -resistant organisms should be provided by, or in close consultation with, an expert in the management of these difficult situations. Second -line regimens often represent the patient's last hope for being cured and inappropriate management can have life -threatening consequences. Drug -resistant TB disease can develop in two different ways, called primary and secondary resistance. Primary resistance occurs in persons who are initially exposed to and infected with resistant organisms. Secondary resistance, or acquired resistance, develops during TB therapy, either because the patient did not take the prescribed regimen appropriately or because of other conditions such as drug malabsorption or drug -drug interactions that lead to low serum levels. Please refer to table 2.7 on page 37 of Core Curriculum: \"CDC Core Curriculum on Tuberculosis ( Sixth Edition, 2013) (Division of Tuberculosis Elimination\" Web site; updated 2013). Available at: http://www.cdc.gov/tb/education/corecurr/pdf/corecurr_all.pdf . Drug resistance is proven only by drug -susceptibility testing performed in a com petent laboratory. A patient with a strain of M. tuberculosis resistant to both INH and RIF has multidrug resistant TB (MDR -TB). Refer to the 2019 clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of drug - Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-28 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease resistant tuberculosis1 and s eek a medical consultati on with the Global TB Institute (GTBI) at Rutgers, a CDC -funded TB center of excellence . The 2019 guidelines briefly mention the August 2019 FDA approval of pretomanid in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid (the BPaL regimen) for the treatment of a specific limited population of adults with pulmonary extensively drug resistant (XDR -TB) or treatment - intolerant or nonresponsive MDR -TB. The FDA approval was conditional on the completion of additional clinical studies. Based on clinical experience since 2019 and expert opinion, \" Provisional CDC Guidance for the Use of Pretomanid as part of a Regimen [Bedaquiline, Pretomanid, and Linezolid (BPaL) ]to Treat Drug -Resistant Tuberculosis Disease2\" was issued in February 2022. The guidance is expected to continue evolving as new clinical data are presented and published. The BPaL regimen should only be prescribed in consultation with the GTBI. Due to the potential for adverse events with BPaL, it is a best practice to review a BPaL treatment consent with the patient and have the patient sign the consent before starting treatment. (Sample text for a BPaL treatment consent is available from the PA TB Program. The treatment consent should be approved by local legal counsel before u se.) A patient who is prescribed BPaL should also be asked to review and sign the BPaL Data Consent (see Appendix C). Failure to sign the Data Consent does not prevent the patient from receiving treatment with BPaL. Acquired drug resistance usually develo ps when an inadequate drug regimen is prescribed (e.g., inappropriate drugs or insufficient dosage) or when there is a combined failure of both the patient and the provider to ensure that an adequate regimen is taken. A patient with acquired drug resistanc e may transmit his or her strain to others, who may then develop primary drug - resistant TB. HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS INFECTION Management of TB in HIV positive patients is complex and requires expertise in the management of both TB and HIV disease. Bec ause HIV -infected patients often take numerous medications, some of which interact with anti -tuberculosis medications, clinicians are strongly encouraged to consult with the state TB medical consultant or the Global TB Institute about appropriate treatment options . It is especially important to use DOT and other adherence -promoting strategies with TB patients who are HIV positive . 1 Nahid P, Mase SR, Migliori GB, Sotgiu G, Bothamley GH, et al .

Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-29 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease TB patients who are also taking antiretroviral therapy for HIV may experience a temporary exacerbation of s ymptoms, signs, or radiographic manifestations (paradoxical reactions) of TB while receiving anti -tuberculosis treatment. This is known as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, or IRIS. Note: drug regimens 1b and 2a in Table 3 in this chapter are no t recommended for the treatment of TB in HIV+ patients . For more information on Human of isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), and pyrazinamide (PZA), they should be used, if clinically appropriate, even if there is preexisting liver disease. Drug -induced hepatitis is defined as a serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level more than three times the upper limit of normal in the presence of symptoms or five times the upper limit of normal in the absence of symptoms. TB itself may involve the liver, which may then cause abnormal liver function. Not all abnormalities in liver function tests noted at baseline should be attributed to causes other than TB. Liver abnormalities caused by TB will improve with effec tive treatment. Prior to the initiation of treatment, serologic testing for hepatitis viruses A, B, and C should be considered. Close monitoring, symptom review and repeat serologic testing is an essential part in managing a patient with elevated serum AST . To monitor for hepatitis: Conduct clinical monitoring on the first visit and repeat monthly to check for signs of hepatitis. Educate patients about symptoms and signs of adverse reactions and instruct patients to stop treatment should symptoms occur. Provide treatment via DOT and review for adverse reactions/symptoms during each visit. For more information on alcoholism refer to http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5211.pdf . LIVER DISEASE Management of TB in patients with unstable or advanced liver disease is difficult. The likelihood of drug -induced hepatitis may be greater in these patients. The implications of drug -induced hepatiti s for patients with marginal hepatic reserve are potentially serious, even life -threatening. Fluctuations in the biochemical indicators of liver function (with/without symptoms) related to the pre-existing liver disease confound monitoring for drug -induced hepatitis. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-30 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease For all patients with pre -existing liver disease, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should be performed to detect drug -induced hepatic injury. For more information on l iver disease refer to http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5211.pdf . RENAL INSUFFICIENCY AND END -STAGE RENAL DISEASE Renal insufficiency complicates the management of TB because some anti -tuberculosis medications are cleared by the kidneys. Management may be further c omplicated by the removal of some anti -tuberculosis agents via hemodialysis. To facilitate DOT (three times per week) and avoid premature removal of the drugs, administer all anti -tuberculosis drugs immediately after hemodialysis . For more information on renal insufficiency and end-stage renal disease refer to http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5211.pdf . TUBERCULOSIS ASSOCIATED WITH TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR -ALPHA ANTAGONISTS TB is a potential consequence of treatment with tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF -) antagonists Adalimumab (Humira\u00ae) blocking TNF -, an inflammatory cytokine, and are approved for treating rheumatoid arthritis and other selected autoimmune diseases. Blocking TNF - can allow latent TB infection (LTBI) to progress to TB disease. Healthcare providers sho uld take steps to prevent TB in immunocompromised patients and remain vigilant for TB as a cause of unexplained febrile illness. Patients should be screened for risk factors for M. tuberculosis infection and tested for infection before initiating immunosup pressive therapies, including TNF - antagonists . For more information about TB and TNF - antagonists, see http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5330a4.htm . CULTURE -NEGATIVE PULMONAR Y TUBERCULOSIS A diagnosis of TB should not be ruled out if M. tuberculosis cannot be isolated from persons suspected of having pulmonary TB based on clinical features and chest radiographic examination. Alternative diagnoses should be carefully considered , and further appropriate diagnostic studies undertaken in persons with apparent culture -negative TB. A diagnosis of culture -negative pulmonary TB can be made if all the following conditions are met: Initial AFB smears and cultures are negative Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-31 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease Clinical or radiographic response occurs within two months of initiation of therapy No other diagnosis has been established After the initial phase (first 8 weeks ), continue treatment with an additional 10 weeks of isoniazid and rifampin during the continuation phase to complete a total of 18 weeks of treatment. HIV - infected patients with culture -negative pulmonary TB should be treated for a minimum of 26 weeks . For more information on c ulture -negative pulmonary tuberculosis refer to http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5211.pdf . EXTRAPULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS The basic principles for treating pulmonary TB also apply to extrapulmonary forms of the disease. The addition of corticosteroids is recommended for patients with TB pericarditis and TB meningitis. Recommendations concerning duration of therapy are as follows: For bone or joint TB, us e a minimum regimen of 9 mont hs. For TB meningitis , use a minimum regimen of 12 month s. Use a 26-week course of therapy for TB involving any site. Consider prolonging therapy for patients with TB in any site that is slow to respond. Note: Affected lymph nodes may enlarge while patients are receiving appropriate therapy or after treatment has ended without any evidence of bacteriological relapse. On occasion, new nodes can appear during or after treatment as well. For more information on extrapulmonary TB refer to http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5211.pdf , http://www.cdc.gov/tb/pubs/TBfactsheets.htm and http://www.phppo.cdc.gov/phtn/tbmodules/Default.htm PREGNANCY AND BREASTFEEDING Because of the risk of TB to the fetus, treatment in pregnan t women should be initiated whenever the probability of maternal disease is moderate to high. The initial treatment regim en should consist of INH, RIF, and EMB. As PZA generally is not included in the initial treatment regimen, the minimum duration of ther apy is 40 weeks . Although these drugs cross the placenta, they do not appear to have teratogenic effects. Breastfeeding should not be discouraged in women being treated with first -line anti -tuberculosis agents because the small concentrations of drugs in b reast milk do not produce toxicity in the nursing newborn. Conversely, drugs in breast milk should not be considered an effective treatment for TB in a nursing infant. Pyridoxine supplementation (25 mg/day) is recommended for all women taking INH who are either pregnant or breastfeeding. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-32 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease For more information on pregnancy and breastfeeding refer to http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5211.pdf and http://www.phppo.cdc.gov/phtn/tbmodules/Default.htm TUBERCULOSIS IN CHILDREN A pediatric patient is a person less than 10 years of age . TB clinic physicians are strongly encouraged to consult with the state pediatric TB medical consultant or the Global TB Institute when evaluating children for LTBI or TB disease. The following recommendations have been developed for children: Because of the high risk of disseminated TB in infants and children younger than 5 years of age, t reatment should be started as soon as the diagnosis of TB is suspected. Regimens recommended for infants, children, and adolescents with TB are generall y the same as those for adults. Duration of treatment in children is six months. Exception: For dissemin ated disease and TB meningitis, use a 12-month regimen. For other exceptions, refer to \"Duration of Treatment\" in the \"Treatment Regimens and Dosages\" topic s in this chapter . DOT is required when treating children. This include s monitoring the parent or gu ardian administering the medication to the child. Due to the difficulty of isolating M. tuberculosis in a child with pulmonary TB, the choice of drugs for the child is frequently guided by the drug susceptibility test results of the presumed source case. I f drug -resistant TB is suspected or the source case isolate is not available, specimens for microbiological evaluation should be obtained via early morning gastric aspiration, bronchoalveolar lavage, or biopsy. For more information on tuberculosis in ren refer http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5211.pdf is the most common of several mycobacteria included in the definition of the M. tuberculosis complex (the others include M. africanum , M. and M. mungi). In terms of their ability to cause clinical disease or be transmissible from person to person, all but M. caprae behave like M. tuberculosis and should be reported as tuberculosis. While most laboratories do not disti nguish between the mycobacteria in the M. TB complex, the state BOL has this capability. The two most common reasons for someone to test positive for M. bovis are: Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 7-33 7- Treatment of Rev. Feb 2022 TB Disease 1. The consumption of unpasteurized dairy products such as milk or cheese. Pasteurization, a process of rapidly heating and cooling milk, eliminates disease -causing organisms such as mycobacteria. 2. Treatment with Bacillus Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) for bladder cancer. BCG is prepared from an attenuated, or weakened, strain of M. bovis . If not identifie d through lab testing, M. bovis BCG (also called M. bovis attenuated) can be identified by genotyping. Isolates testing positive for M. TB complex that are M. bovis BCG will have a genotype consistent with M. bovis as well as a MIRU that has an x, y, or z as the second character of the result and a spoligotype that ends in 600. TB program staff review genotyping results and will notify the public health nurse of any patients with a genotype consistent with M. bovis BCG. M. bovis infection should also be considered in patients resistant to PZA. Patients infected with M. bovis from consuming unpasteurized dairy products should be treated for TB disease. These cases should be counted as an active case of confirmed TB dis ease. Patients undergoing treatment with BCG for bladder cancer should be treated for TB disease if it has disseminated to areas of the body other than the urinary tract system (comprised of two kidneys, two ureters, the bladder, and the urethra). Patients with disseminated M. bovis BCG should receive treatment for TB disease. All RVCT items in the surveillance system should be completed as for a case of TB disease -even though a case of M. bovis BCG will not actually be counted. TB AND NONTUBERCULOSIS MYCO BACTERIUM (NTM) INFECTION In rare cases , a patient may be co infected with TB and NTM . In such cases, t he treatment of the TB disease is unaffected by the NTM infection . However, t he Pennsylvania Department of Health does not provide NTM treatment and patients coinfected with TB disease and NTM should be referred by the public health TB clinician or nurse to a pulmonologist or infectious disease specialist for the treatment of NT M.

The CDC uses the se data to monitor TB case and treatment trends in the United States . No patient is identified by name in this process. In August 2019, t he U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved three drugs - bedaquiline , pretomanid and linezolid - to be used together (as the BPaL regimen) to treat adults with tuberculosis (TB) of the lungs that is extensively drug -resistant The BPaL regimen cuts the len gth of treatment for these conditions from two or more years to six to nine months and greatly improve s the chance for a cure . BPaL provides important benefits but can cause serious side effects . Therefore , in addition to the required reporting of TB diagnosis and treatment data, the CDC is asking health departments to voluntar ily report extra information about the use of the BPaL regimen including : The dates the patient started and stopped taking each of the three drugs (bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid); The patient's e lectrocardiogram (ECG) test results before starting treatment and at least 2, 12 and 24 weeks after starting treatment ; and The amount of each of the three drugs in the patient's blood ( i.e., therapeutic drug levels ) if they are ordered by the prescribing TB clinician . The extra information about the use of BPaL will be collected and reported to the CDC three times - when a patient begin s treatment, finish es treatment and one year after the patient complete s treatment. I understand that if I do not consent to the DOH reporting the BPaL extra information to the CDC, it will not change my ability to receive treatment or the care I receive . By signing this consent , I agree to allow the DOH to send the extra information about my treatment with BPaL to the CDC when I begin treatment with BPaL, when I finish treatment and one year after I complete treatment. _______________________________ ________________ Patient signature Date _______________________________ ________________ Clinic representative signature Date Pennsylvania TB Manual 8-1 8 - Directly Observed Therapy Rev. April 2021 Chapter 8: Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) BACKGROUND Treatment for tuberculosis (TB) disease lasts longer - typically a minimum of six months - and requires more drugs than treatment for most other infectious disease s. With a multi -drug regimen and long treatment period comes the risk that patient s will become nonadherent , which can lead to disease relapse and the development of drug resistant TB . DEFINITION DOT is the standard of care recommended by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for ensuring that patients adhere to therapy for active TB disease. DOT is the proc ess in which a trained health care worker observes a patient ingest each dose of TB medication. DOT ensures that a patient successfully completes treatment. Incomplete treatment can lead to relapse and the development of drug resistance . Drug resistant TB can be deadly and is a growing problem across the nation . It can result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in treatment costs and even death. DOT should be started when treatment starts. To improve patient acceptance of DOT , the prescribing physician sho uld explain that it is widely used in TB and - by reducing the potential for missed doses - is very effective in helping patients complete their treatment as quickly as possible . This message should also be reinforced by the public health nurse or DOT worker. With each visit the public health nurse or DOT worker will have the opportunity to do one or more of the following: Educate the patient about TB Observe how the patient is tolerating and r esponding to treatment Offer in centives and/or enablers to facilitate and recognize compliance Help the patient connect with other social services as needed DOT can be provided in a variety of settings including the TB clinic or physician office, the patient's home or workplace, a com munity -based organization site, a school, or any other site mutually agreeable to the patient and the DOT worker. DOT FOR PRIVATELY MANAGED PATIENTS DOT is traditionally done by health department staff. For TB cases that are privately managed, however, the local public health nurse (PHN) should contact the private physician to emphasize the importance of DOT and discuss whether the physician has the resources to provide DOT. Pennsylvania TB Manual 8-2 8 - Directly Observed Therapy Rev. April 2021 If the physician has sufficient staff resources to provide DOT, he or she must pro vide the local PHN with monthly documentation of the case information (i.e., RVCT data elements) necessary for CDC reporting. If the physician does not have sufficient resources to provide DOT, then the case should be referred to the local health departmen t for TB treatment and case management. For more information, refer to the TB Program Policy for state health centers (SHCs) or guidance for county and municipal health departments (CMHDs) on privately managed patients. PENNSYLVANIA (PA) TB PROGRAM RECOMMENDATIONS For the treatment of TB disease, the PA TB Program recommends: All patients with suspected or confirmed TB disease are to receive their TB medications via DOT for the full course of treatment. If resources are l imited, prioritize the patient types listed in Table 1 on the next page for DOT. During the first tw o weeks of treatment, DOT must be prov ided seven days a week. After the first two weeks - and if approved by the TB clinician - DOT can be provided five days a week with the patient self -administering on weekends . Daily dosing is preferred over intermittent, but the ATS/CDC/IDSA guidelines allow for intermittent dosing three times a week for patients who are HIV negative and at low risk of relapse (i. e., patients with pulmonary tuberculosis caused by drug -susceptible organisms that at the start of treatment is noncavitary and/or smear negative) . Intermittent dosing must be ordered by the treating physician and provided via DOT. Intermittent dosing should not be used for patients with cavitary disease. Each dose witnessed via DOT should be documented. Only those doses administered via DOT are counted towards treatment completion . If field resources are limited, the decision whe ther to provide DOT should be made on a case by case basis with the local TB clinician , nurse supervisor and the PA TB Program . Patients with the risk factors listed in Table 1 should be prioritized for DOT. Video DOT is an option for appropriate patients. \u00ad SHCs must comply with the TB program video DOT policy. \u00ad CMHDs are encouraged to develop and implement their own video DOT policy and protocols. A helpful resource is the CDC toolkit for \"Implementing an Electronic Directly Observed Therapy (eDOT) Program\" available at https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/pdf/TBeDOTToolkit.pdf . For window prophylaxis, the PA TB Program recommends: DOT is the standard of care for children younger than 5 years of age receiving window prophylaxis (due to an increased risk of rapid progression to TB disease once infected). In most cases this doesn't pose an additional burden on field resources since the se children typically live with an adult receiving DOT for infectious TB disease. DOT is recommended for all other patients (including adults) on window prophylaxis. For the treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) with the once -weekly 12 -dose regimen of INH and rifapentine (3HP), see the TB Program's current recommendations concerning the use of 3HP. Pennsylvania TB Manual 8-3 8 - Directly Observed Therapy Rev. April 2021 Table 1 : Risk Groups Prioritized for DOT In the event limited staff resources prevent providing DOT to all appropriate patients, the PA TB Program follows the California Department of Public Health 's (CDPH) guidelines that patients with certain risk factors be prioritized for DOT as listed in Table 1. Table 1: Risk Groups to be Prioritized for DOT High risk for transmission or acquired drug resistance High risk for nonadherence High risk for adverse eve nts and/or poor treatment outcomes Cavitary pulmonary disease Positive acid -fast bacilli (AFB) smear at diagnosis Sputum conversion more than 2 months (60 days) after starting treatment o r slow clinical improvement Clinical deterioration while on treatment Drug resistant TB Receiving intermittent TB medication regimen HIV infection, including those patients on anti -retroviral therapy Nonadherence with TB regimen, past or present Patients c ourt-ordered to complete their TB treatment Too ill to self -manage Psychiatric disorder or memory impairment Poor or non -acceptance of TB diagnosis or treatment Poor adherence to initial medical management Recent history of alcohol or drug abuse Homeless, shelter resident, or unstably housed Current or recent history of incarceration TB disease relapse Patients at higher risk for severe outcomes (e.g. those with end -stage renal disease, diabetes, or on a TNF -alpha antagonist) Immunosuppression pos t organ transplant Children For more information, see the CDPH information sheet at https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/T BCB-PMD -DOT.pdf Pennsylvania TB Manual 8A-1 8A - DOT for Privately Managed Patients January 2020 CHAPTER 8, APPENDIX A: DOT FOR PRIVATELY MA NAGED PATIENTS Background: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends DOT as the most effective strategy to ensure patient adherence to treatment for active tuberculosis (TB). DOT is defined as the observation of the patient by a health care provider or other re sponsible person as the patient ingests every dose of TB medication. DOT should be used for all patients with TB disease, including children and adolescents as well as health care workers such as physicians, nurses and pharmacists. There simply is no way t o accurately predict which patients will adhere to treatment without the use of DOT1. Purpose: The purpose of th is guidance is to establish a systematic approach to ensure all patient s with TB disease diagnosed and managed by a private physician receive TB treatment via DOT . Guidance : Privately managed TB cases are typically identified by reports electronically submitted via PA -NEDSS (e.g. lab results), outreach by the physician to the local state health center or county or municipal health department, or via word of mouth in the community. When a privately managed patient with active TB is identified, the local public health nurse (PHN) should contact the private physician promptly to open a dialogue and communica te the importance of DOT in the successful completion of TB treatment. Suggested talking points include: o DOT is universally recognized as the standard of care for all active TB cases. o The CDC strongly recommends DOT for all persons with active TB. o DOT imp roves treatment compliance, thereby decreasing the risk of disease transmission and/or the development of drug resistant TB. o The local state health center or county or municipal health department: Assumes all responsibility for DOT and patient monitoring while the patient is receiving TB treatment ; Provides all TB medications free of charge ; and Keeps the private physician informed (with the patient's consent) about the patient's progress while on tr eatment. 1 CDC. TB 101 for Health Care Workers, Lesson 6: Treatment of TB Disease Pennsylvania TB Manual 8A-2 8A - DOT for Privately Managed Patients January 2020 If the physician commits to provide DOT and has the resources to do so, he or she must provide the PHN with documentation on a monthly basis of the case information (i.e. RVCT data elements) necessary for CDC reporting. If the physician doesn't h ave the resources to provide DOT, the PHN should recommend that the patient be referred to the local state health center or county or municipal health department for TB treatment and case management. If the private physician is unconvinced about the impor tance of DOT or is reluctant to give up responsibility for the patient's care and treatment, the PHN should ask the TB clinic physician to contact the private physician directly to discuss treatment and case management options. If that fails, the next step is for the PHN to work through their supervisory chain to request assistance from the state TB program. The request must include the following: o PA-NEDSS investigation number o Name and contact information of the private physician o Summary of the contact with the private physician regarding DOT Within three business days of receiving the request for assistance, the TB program will enlist the help of the state TB Medical Consultant to contact the private physician. A summary of the contact with the private physician will be provided to the local P HN by the TB program. For state health centers, a TB patient may continue to be managed by a private physician as long as the following conditions are met: o The private provider has discussed this option with the TB clinician or state TB consultant; o The TB clinician or state TB consultant prescribes the anti -tuberculosis medications ; o The patient receives DOT from a community health nurse or outreach worker ; and o The private provider consults monthly with the TB clinician or state TB consultant about the patient's response to treatment and any changes to the treatment regimen. The end goal of this process is to ensure that every patient with TB disease receives treatment via DOT, and that physicians aren't just educated about TB and its treatment but come to regard the state health centers or county or municipal health departments as valued partners in health care. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 9-1 9 - Infection Control January 2020 Chapter 9: Infection Control INTRODUCTION Infection control measures are fundamental to reducing the spread of communicable diseases such as TB. Transmission of M. tuberculosis from person to person can occur in many locations, such as home, work, school, and healthcare facilities. It is impossibl e to prevent all exposure , however, the goal is to reduce the amount of transmission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publication titled \"Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health -Care Settings , 2005 \" recommends that all healthcare settings have a TB infection -control program designed to ensure prompt detection of TB , appropriate use of airborne precautions, and prompt treatment of persons who have suspected or confirmed TB disease. The extent of infection control activities for an agency or facility is based on the results of its risk assessment. In areas where TB rates are lower, the TB risk is lower . This should affect which elements of the TB infection control plan are utilized. In May 2019, the CDC updated the portion of the 2005 guidelines that addressed the frequency of TB screening, testing and treatment of health care personnel. A summary of the updated recommendations and associated reference materials can be found on the CDC website . For guidance on facility risk assessments and infection control practices please continue to refer to the 2005 guidelines. The three components of an infection control program are ad ministrative controls, environmental controls, and personal respiratory protection. Because each patient care setting and patient's home is different, each program will incorporate a different combination of control activities. In areas where TB rates are lower, the TB risk is lower . This should affect which elements of the TB infection control plan are utilized. PURPOSE Use this chapter to understand and follow national and Pennsylvania guidelines to: Review infection control measures and know where to go for further information; Alert local public health staff to the basic differences between masks and respirators; Evaluate when a patient is infectious and when he or she is noninfectious; Determine when to isolate patients, when to discharge them from hospitals, and when to permit them to return to work, school, or other settings; Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 9-2 9 - Infection Control January 2020 Review how to implement infection control measures in residential settings, patient care facilities, and transportation vehicles; Consult with facilities that are implementing infection control measures, including two - step testing . POLICY Infection control measures apply to three main settings : Healthcare facilities - where persons with infectious TB disease would seek care Congregate settings and residential faci lities, whose residents are at increased risk for TB disease The TB patient's home INFECTION CONTROL ME ASURES There are three types of infection control measures. The first are administrative controls, which are primarily aimed at early identification, isolation, and appropriate treatment of infectious patients. The second are environmental controls, which focus on preventing the spread and reducing the concentration of infectious droplet nuclei in the air. The third is personal respirato ry protection, which may provide additional protection for healthcare workers in high -risk settings such as isolation rooms and cough -inducing or aerosol -generating suites. The activities described below are more relevant to infection control in healthcare or residential facilities. Home settings are discussed separately in the \"Residential Settings\" topic in this chapter. ADMINISTRATIVE CONTR OLS Administrative control measures are the first of three levels of measures designed to reduce the risk of TB tran smission. Administrative controls are the first level of infection control because they include a variety of activities to identify, isolate, and appropriately treat persons suspected of having TB disease. An effective TB infection control plan contains me asures for reducing the spread of TB that are appropriate to the risk of a specific setting. Every healthcare setting should have a TB infection control plan that is part of an overall infection control program. A written TB infection control plan helps t o ensure prompt detection, airborne precautions, and treatment of persons who have suspected or confirmed TB disease. In TB infection control programs for settings in which patients with suspected or confirmed TB disease are expected to be encountered, develop a written TB infection control plan that outlines a protocol for the prompt recognition and initiation of airborne precautions for persons with suspected or confirmed TB disease, and update it annually. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 9-3 9 - Infection Control January 2020 In TB infection control program for settings in which patients with suspected or confirmed TB disease are NOT expected to be encountered, develop a written TB infection control plan that outlines a protocol for the prompt recognition and transfer of persons who have suspected or confirmed TB disease to another healthcare setting. The plan should indicate procedures to follow to separate persons with suspected or confirmed infectious TB disease from other persons in the setting until the time of transfer. Evaluate the plan annually, if possible, to ensure that the setting remains one in which persons who have suspected or confirmed TB disease are not encountered, and that they are p romptly transferred. ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIV ITIES Key activities to reduce the risk of transmission include the following: Assign responsibility to a specific person for designing, implementing, evaluating, and maintaining a TB infection control program for that facility. Conduct a risk assessment. The risk level for a specific facility will affect the extent of all other acti vities and will result in each facility having a different plan. Refer to Appendix B: TB Risk Assessment Worksheet in the 2005 CDC Guidelines at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5417.pdf . Develop, i mplement, and enforce policies and procedures to ensure early identification, evaluation, and treatment of infectious cases of TB. Provide prompt triage and management in the outpatient setting of patients who may have infectious TB. Initiate promptly and maintain TB isolation for persons who may have infectious TB and are admitted to an inpatient setting. Plan effectively for the discharge of the patient , coordinating between the local public health agency and the healthcare provider. Implement environmental controls. Develop, install, maintain, and evaluate the effectiveness of engineering controls. Implement a respiratory protection program. Develop, in itiate, install, maintain, and evaluate the effectiveness of the respiratory protection program. Implement precautions for cough -inducing procedures. Develop, implement, and enforce policies and procedures to ensure adequate precautions when performing cough-inducing procedures. Educate and train healthcare workers about TB. Counsel and screen healthcare workers. Develop and implement counseling and screening program for healthcare workers about TB disease and latent TB infection (LTBI). Evaluate promptly p ossible episodes of TB transmission. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 9-4 9 - Infection Control January 2020 Coordinate activities between the state and local public healthcare agencies. For more comprehensive information, please refer to \"Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health -care Settings, TB is caused by an organism called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. When a person with infectious TB disease coughs or sneezes, tiny particles called droplet nuclei that contain M. tuberculosis are expelled into the air. Environmental controls are used to prevent the spread and reduce the concentration of infectious droplet nuclei. Each fac ility should use different combinations of environmental controls, based on the results of its risk assessment. It is important to note that without strong administrative controls, environmental controls are ineffective because cases would not be recognize d or managed appropriately. TABLE 1: TYPES OF ENVIRONMENT AL CONTROLS Most Effective Control Ventilation Controls direction of air flow to prevent contamination of air in areas surrounding a person with infectious tuberculosis (TB) Dilutes and removes contaminated air Exhausts contaminated air to the outside Supplementary Controls High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration Cleans the air of infectious droplet nuclei Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) Kills or inactivates TB bacilli in the air PERSONAL RESPIRATORY PROTECTION Although administrative controls and environmental controls are most effective in controlling the spread of TB, they do not eliminate the risk of transmission entirely. Personal respiratory protection, the third level of infection control, is also used in higher -risk settings. The purpose of a respirator is to reduce exposure by filtering out TB bacilli from the room air before the air is breathed into a person's lungs. Respirator s used for TB control should be approved for TB use by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). It is recommended that state health center (SHC) or county or municipal health department (CMHD) staff and visitors use personal respi ratory protective equipment in settings that may be at higher risk for TB transmission, such as the following: Rooms where infectious TB patients are being isolated Areas where cough -inducing or aerosol -generating procedures are performed Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 9-5 9 - Infection Control January 2020 Other areas, whic h should be identified in the facility's risk assessment, where administrative and environmental controls are not likely to protect persons from inhaling infectious droplet nuclei It is important to note that the precise level of effectiveness (of respirat ory protection) in protecting healthcare workers from M. tuberculosis transmission in healthcare settings has not been determined. State health center nurses should refer to the DOH Respiratory Protection Program. For more information about respiratory protection programs, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) \"Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis -care Settings, -17]:75 -79) at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5417.pdf . The CDC guidelines recommend that healthcare facilities conduct annual training regarding multiple topics for healthcare workers (HCWs), including the nature, extent, and hazard s of TB disease in the healthcare setting. Annual fit testing/training will be conducted in conjunction with other related training regarding infectious disease associated with airborne transmission. Surgical -type masks are to be used by persons who are in fectious or are suspected cases of TB disease when they are out of TB respiratory isolation. The purpose of the mask is to reduce transmission by reducing the number of TB bacilli coughed out into the room air. The infectious patient should not wear a resp irator. For more information, see Table 2: Using Masks and Respirators. In addition, training topics should include the following : Risk assessment process and its relation to the respirator program, including signs and symbols used to indicate that respirators are required in certain areas and the reasons for using respirators Environmental controls used to prevent the spread and reduce the concentration of infectious droplet nuclei Selection of a specific respirator for a given hazard (See \"Selectio n of Respirators\" on p. 78 of the 2005 CDC guidelines.) Operation, capabilities, and limitations of respirators Cautions regarding facial hair and respirator use Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulations regarding respirators, includ ing assessment of employees' knowledge Trainees should be provided opportunities to handle and wear a respirator until they become proficient. Trainees should also be provided with copies or summaries of lecture materials for use as references and instruct ions to refer all respirator problems immediately to the respiratory program administrator for your jurisdiction . A fit test is used to determine which respirator fits the user adequately and to ensure that the user knows when the respirator fits properly. Fit testing provides a means to determine which respirator model and size fits the wearer best and to confirm that the wearer can don the Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 9-6 9 - Infection Control January 2020 respirator properly to achieve a good fit. Annual fit testing and training is required for all PA DOH staff. This tra ining is provided by appropriately trained personnel. OSHA enforces CDC recommendations for respiratory protection, which includes the need for the following: Respiratory Protection Program Amended medical evaluation Training and recordkeeping Annual fit t esting Fit checking WHO SHOULD USE A MAS K OR RESPIRATOR? Using masks and respirators properly can reduce transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and exposure to TB. Refer to Table 2: Using Masks and Respirators to determine when to use masks and respirators. TABLE 2: USING MASKS AND RESP IRATORS -95 or higher*) Purpose To reduce transmission by capturing infectious droplet nuclei that an infectious patient releases before they get into the air. Purpose To reduce exposure by filtering infectious droplet nuclei out of the air, before the wearer breathes the air into their lungs. Who should wear a mask? Patients with infectious TB or suspected infectious TB Who should wear a respirator? Staff Visitors to TB isolation rooms (keep these visitors to a minimum) A patient should wear a mask In a hospital setting when: Suspected of having infectious TB and not yet placed in respiratory isolation Leaving a respiratory isolation room for any reason Note: Infectious patients should NOT wear masks when in their TB isolation rooms. In a health clinic setting when: Not in a TB isolation room Returning to the clinic for evaluation A staff person or visitor should wear a respirator In a hospital or clinic setting when: Entering a TB isolation room Performing cough -inducing or aerosol -generating procedures Unlikely to be protected by administrative or environmental controls A patient should wear a mask In a transportation setting when: Traveling in a vehicle with other persons A staff person or visitor should wear a respirator In some transportation settings when: Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 9-7 9 - Infection Control January 2020 Riding in a vehicle with a patient with infectious TB In the patient's home: Note: Infectious patients do NOT need to wear a mask when they are in their homes. A staff person or visitor* should wear a respirator In a patient's home when: Visiting the infectious patient inside a home/residence *Note: There should NOT be any visitors (excluding protected healthcare workers) to the home until the patient is released from TB isolation. Definition of abbreviations: NIOSH = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; TB = tuberculosis. * There are some devices, such as the 3M 1860, which are both N95 respirators and surgical masks.

ISOLATION To reduce disease transmissio n, a patient with TB disease may need to be isolated or have activities restricted. Isolation: Isolation is used when people are ill. Isolation of people who have a specific illness separates them from healthy people and restr icts their movement to stop the spread of that illness. Isolation allows for the focused delivery of specialized health care to people who are ill, and it protects healthy people from getting sick. People in isolation may be cared for in their homes, in ho spitals, or at designated healthcare facilities. Isolation is a standard procedure used in hospitals today for patients with TB and certain other infectious diseases. In most cases, isolation is voluntary; however, many levels of government (federal, state , and local) have the basic legal authority to compel isolation of sick people to protect the public. Restricted Activities: Until determined to be noninfectious, the patient is not permitted to return to work, school, or any social setting where the patie nt could expose in dividuals to airborne bacteria. Quarantine: Although TB Control Program has used the word \"quarantine\" interchangeably with \"isolation\" and \"restricted activities,\" the word \"quarantine\" when properly used is not a term applicable to TB C ontrol. Quarantine applies to people who have been exposed and may be infected but are not yet ill. Separating exposed people and restricting their movements is intended to stop the spread of illness. Quarantine is not an appropriate TB C ontrol measure for asymptomatic, exposed individuals. DETERMINING INFECTIOUSNESS Patients who have suspected or confirmed TB disease and who are not on anti -tuberculosis treatment should be considered infectious if they have any of the following: Presence of cough Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 9-8 9 - Infection Control January 2020 Cavitation on radiograph Positive acid -fast bacill i (AFB) sputum smear result Respiratory tract disease with involvement of the lung or airways, including larynx Failure to cover the mouth and nose when coughing Undergoing cough -inducing or aerosol -generating procedures (e.g., sputum induction, bronchoscopy, airway suction) If a pat ient with one or more of these characteristics is on standard multidrug therapy with documented clinical improvement, usually in connection with smear conversion over several weeks, the risk of infectiousness is reduced. DETERMINING NONINFEC TIOUSNESS Use t he following criteria as general guidelines to determine when during therapy a patient with pulmonary TB disease has become noninfectious. Decisions about infectivity of a person on treatment for TB should depend on the extent of illness and the specific n ature and circumstances of the contact between the patient and exposed persons. These guidelines can and should be modified on a ca se-by-case consultation with the TB clinician. Patient has negligible likelihood of multidrug -resistant TB (no known exposure to multidrug -resistant tuberculosis and no history of prior episodes of TB with poor compliance during treatment). Patient has received standard multidrug antituberculosis therapy for two to three weeks. (For patients with AFB sputum smear results that ar e negative or rarely positive, threshold for treatment is four to seven days.) Patient has demonstrated complete adherence to treatment (e.g., is receiving directly observed therapy). Patient has demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement (e.g., reducti on in the frequency of cough or reduction of the grade of the AFB sputum smear result). All close contacts of the patient have been identified, evaluated, advised, and, if indicated, started on treatment for LTBI . This criterion is critical, especially for children younger than 5 years of age and persons of any age with immunocompromising health conditions . While in a hospital for any reason, patients with pulmonary TB should remain in airborne infection isolation until they: o are receiving standard mult idrug antituberculosis therapy; o have dem onstrated clinical o have had three consecutive AFB -negative smear results of sputum specimens collected eight to 24 hours apart, with at least one being an early morning specimen. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 9-9 9 - Infection Control January 2020 Hospitalized patients re turning to a congregate setting (e.g., a homeless shelter or detention facility) should have three consecutive AFB -negative smear results of sputum specimens collected more than eight hours apart before being considered noninfectious. AIRBORNE INFECTION I SOLATION IN A HEALTHC ARE FACILITY In airborne infection isolation (AII), the patient is placed in an AII room, usually within a hospital or healthcare facility. The main characteristics of an AII room (for new or renovated buildings) are that it has negativ e air pressure relative to the hall and 12 or more air exchanges per hour, of which at least two exchanges are outside air. For existing structures, six or more air exchanges per hour are acceptable. The decisions to initiate and discontinue isolation should be made on a case -by-case basis in consultation with the TB clinician. WHEN TO INITIATE AIR BORNE INFECTION ISOL ATION Suspected cases of laryngeal or pulmonary TB should be isolated immediately, bef ore AFB sputum smear results are available. Initiate TB AII precautions for any patient who meets the criteria in Table 4. TABLE 4: INITIATION OF AIRBOR NE INFECTION ISOLATI ON Criteria for Initiation of Airborne Infection Isolation The patient has signs or symptoms of pulmonary, laryngeal, or multidrug - resistant tuberculosis (MDR -TB) disease OR The patient has documented infectious pulmonary, laryngeal tuberculosis (TB) disease or MDR -TB disease AND The patient has not completed treatment Source: CDC. Guidelines for preventing the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in health -care settings, 2005. MMWR 2005;54(No. RR -17):16, 44. While in the hospital for any reason, patients with pulmonary TB should remain in airborne infection isolation until they (1) are receiving standard multidrug antituberculosis therapy; (2) have demonstrated clinical improvement; and (3) have had 3 consecutive AFB -negative smear results of sputum specimens collected 8 to 24 hours apart, with at l east one being an early morning specimen. WHEN TO DISCONTINUE AIRBORNE INFECTION I SOLATION The decision to release a patient with suspected or known MDR TB from isolation should be made in consultation with the state TB consultant and/or the Global TB Inst itute at Rutgers. For patients placed in AII due to suspected infectious TB disease of the lungs, airway, or larynx, AII can be discontinued when the criteria in Table 5 are met. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 9-10 9 - Infection Control January 2020 TABLE 5: DISCONTINUATION OF A IRBORNE INFECTION IS OLATION OF SUSPECTED CASES O F TB Criteria for Discontinuing Airborne Infection Isolation: Suspected Case of Tuberculosis of the Lungs, Airway, or Larynx Infectious tuberculosis (TB) disease is considered unlikely AND EITHER Another diagnosis is made that explains the clinical syndrome OR The patient has 3 negative acid -fast bacilli (AFB) sputum smear results,* has been on treatment delivered as directly observed therapy, and has demonstrated clinical improvement * Each of the 3 sputum specimens should be collected 8 to 24 hours apart, and at least one (1) should be an early morning specimen (because respiratory secretions pool overnight). Generally, this will allow patients with negative AFB sputum smear results to be released from AII in 2 days. Sources: CDC.

Controlling tuberculosis in the United States: recommendations from the American Thoracic Society, CDC, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. MMWR 2005;54(No. RR -12):9 Because patients with TB disease of the lungs, airway or larynx can still be infectious even with negative AFB sputum smear results, patients who meet the above criteria for release from AII should not be released to an area where other patients with immunocompromising conditions or children less than 5 years of age are housed. CONFIRMED TB DISEASE A patient with drug -susceptible TB of the lung, airway, or larynx who is on standard multidrug antituberculosis treatment and who has had a significant clinical and bacteriologic response to therapy (e.g., reduction in cough, resolution of fever, a nd progressively decreasing quantities of AFB on smear results) is probably no longer infectious. However, since the culture and drug susceptibility results are not usually known when the decision to discontinue AII is made, all patients with confirmed TB disease should remain in AII while hospitalized until all the criteria in Table 6 are met.

HOSPITAL DISCHARGE The decisions to discharge an AFB sputum smear -positive patient or an MDR -TB patient should be made in consultation with the PA TB Program and - for an MDR patient - the state TB consultant. DRUG -SUSCEPTIBLE TB DISEASE If a hospitalized patient who has suspected or confirmed drug -susceptible TB disease is deemed medically stable (including patients with positive AFB sputum smear results indicating pulmonary TB disease), the patient can be discharged from the hospital bef ore converting AFB sputum smear results to negative if all the criteria in Table 7 are met.

Pennsylvania TB Manual : Control January 2020 MULTIDRUG -RESISTANT (MDR) TB DISEASE In most cases it is acceptable to discharge an MDR patient from the hospital when all the criteria in Table 8 are met. However, b ecause the transmission of MDR TB can have severe consequences for immunocompromised individuals and children less than 5 years of age, the decision to discharge an MDR patient from the hospital to home must be made in consultation with the PA TB Program, the state TB consultant and/or the Global TB Institute, and the TB clinician and nurses for the jurisdiction that with provide follow -up care. TABLE 8: HOSPITAL DISCHARGE O F MULTIDRUG -RESISTAN T CASES OF TB Criteria for Hospital Discharge to Home: Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Multidrug -Resistant TB A specific plan exists for follow -up care with the local TB control program AND An appropriate treatment regimen has been initiated and DOT has been arranged AND No children less than 5 years of age or persons with immunocompromising conditions are present in the household AND All immunocompetent household members have been previously exposed to the patient AND Suitable arrangements have been made so that the regimen can be continued and properly monitored on an outpatient basis, specifically by DOT RELEASE SETTINGS Patients with suspected or confirmed infectious TB disease should not be released to healthcare settings or homes where the patient can expose others who are at high risk for progressing to TB disease if infected, such as HIV -infected persons or young children. Hospitalized patients returning to a congregate setting (e.g., a homeless shelter or detention facility) should have three consecu tive AFB -negative smear results of sputum specimens collected more than eight hours apart before being considered noninfectious. Patients who have positive AFB sputum smear results should not be directly discharged from the hospital to any of the followin g living environments: Congregate living site (e.g., shelter, nursing home, jail, prison, group home, another hospital) Living situation where infants and young children also reside Living situation whe re immunosuppressed persons also reside Living situati on where home health aides or other social service providers will be present in the home for several hours a day to care for the person or family member Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 9-13 9 - Infection Control January 2020 RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS Patients suspected of having infectious TB either are diagnosed during an outpatie nt workup, or if admitted to a hospital, are often sent home after starting treatment. Patients are sent home, even though they may still be infectious, because they are most likely to transmit TB to household members before TB has been diagnosed and treat ment has started. However, TB patients and members of their household can take steps to prevent the spread of TB in their home until the patient becomes noninfectious. ADMINISTRATIVE CONTR OLS IN THE PATIENT'S HOME Have a policy and procedure for managing i nfectious patients at home. To standardize care, the following information should be included: Definition of key terms: Infectious case and noninfectious case Treatment of cases at home whenever possible: Treat patients at home if their condition does not otherwise require hospitali zation. Window period treatment policy: Ensure that candidates for window period treatment in the home have completed their evaluation and are on medication before the TB patient is discharged home (or as soon as possible if they were not hospitalized). Education: Educate infectious patients, family, care providers, and close contacts regarding the purpose of isolation, their responsibility to adhere to the isolation requirements, and the consequences of not volunt arily complying with isolation. Home isolation: Consider having infectious cases in isolation sign a Disease Treatment Agreement consistent with the policy and procedures in effect in your jurisdiction. This document should include any legal consequences should t he patient fail to voluntarily comply with the terms of the agreement . ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRO LS IN THE PATIENT'S HOME Generally, there are no special engineering recommendations. However, patients and their families can be advised to do the following: Have tissues available for patients to cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing. Keep windows and doors open (weather permitting) to increase the ventilation and dilution of infectio us droplet nuclei in the house. If a sputum sample needs to be collected at home, do so in a well -ventilated area away from other residents (e.g., bathroom w ith an exhaust fan). If possible, collect the sputum in an outdoor area away from open windows or doors. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 9-14 9 - Infection Control January 2020 RESPIRATORY PROTECTI ON IN THE PATIENT'S HOME Patients: Patients do not need to wear masks at home. Give patients regular surgical -type masks and advis e them to wear them at medical appointments until they are no longer infectious. Do not give patients respirators (N -95 or higher) Healthcare Workers: Healthcare workers should wear respirators when entering the home or a closed area to visit with infectio us patients. The respirators should be National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) -appro ved (N -95 or higher). Healthcare workers should be provided with respirators after appropriate education and fit testing. OTHER RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS Motels: Homeless persons with infectious TB may be housed in a motel that has outside acce ss to rooms (not via hallways). The motel manager must be advised of the following: The patie nt is in respiratory isolation. The manager should report to lo cal SHC or CMHD staff if the manager becomes aware that the patient does not stay in the room or has guests. The manager should advise motel staff that they are not to enter the room while the patient resides at the motel. (Arrangements should be made that once a week, the patient sets out linens that need to be replaced. The staff can knock on the door and leave the linens for the patie nt to make his or her own bed.) Upon release from isolation, the room should be aired out for one day before staff enters to clean. Afterwards, routine cleaning done between guests is sufficient, and there are no additional special cleaning requirements. Local SHC or CMHD staff will be delivering medication to the p atient (specify the frequency). Arrangements have been made f or food delivery to the patient. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 9-15 9 - Infection Control January 2020 Healthcare Facilities or Residential Settings : Patients with infectious TB should be in appropriate respiratory isolation (airborne infection isolation rooms) when housed in healthcare facilities or residential settings. If a facility does not have the capability to provide appropriate respiratory isolation, the patient should be transferred to a facility that can accommodate respiratory isolation until the patient is noninfectious. Once noninfectious, the person may return to the original facility. RETURN TO WORK, SCHO OL, OR OTHER SOCIAL SETTINGS The decision of when to allow a patient to return to work, school, or other social settings should be made in consultation with the TB clinician . The decision to permit a patient to return to work, school, or other social sett ings is based on the following: The characteristics of the patient with TB disease (e.g., whether the patient is likely to adhere to the regimen and follow treatment instructions) The characteristics of the TB disease itself (e.g., multidrug -resistant versus The duration of current treatment (e.g., the patient has received standard multidrug antitubercul osis therapy for two to three weeks or, if the patient has AFB sputum sme ars that are negative or barely positive, the minimum threshold for treatment is four to seven days) The environment(s) to whic h the patient will be returning DRUG -SUSCEPTIBLE TB DISEASE Patients with drug -susceptible TB are no longer considered infectious when they meet all the criteria in Table 9.

PATIENT SELF -TRANSPO RT Vehicle windows should be open and any recirculating air controls should be turned off. If possible, only household members should accompany the patient. Any members of the patient's hous ehold who accompany the patient do not need to wear surgical masks. If the only source for transport is a friend or relative who is not a member of the patient's household: o The person accompanying the patient should be given a respirator (N -95) to wear during transport (due to the confined space and lack of ongoing exposure). o The patient should sit in the back seat and wear a surgical mask. o Car windows should be opened and any recirculating air controls should be turned off. The patient should wear a surgic al mask after leaving the vehicle. TRANSPORT BY HEALTHC ARE WORKERS Healthcare workers should wear respiratory protection (N -95) while in the vehicle.

A contact investigation is the process of identifying, examining, evaluat ing, and treating all persons who are at risk for infection with M. tuberculosis due to recent exposure to a newly diagnosed or suspected case of pulmonary, laryngeal, or pleural TB. The primary goals of a contact investigation are to : Stop further transmi ssion of TB by finding and treating previously undetected cases of TB disease, and Prevent future cases of TB disease by finding and treating persons with latent TB infection (LTBI) . Except in rare cases, every case of TB begins as a contact to a person wi th active pulmonary, laryngeal, or pleural TB disease a 30%1 of all TB contacts have LTBI and are at risk of progressing to TB disease if not diagnosed and treated for LTBI. One percent of all TB contacts have TB disease at the time of the contact investigation and need treatment. Identifying and treating individuals with TB disease and LTBI through the proper conduct of contact investigations would lead to substantial personal and public health benefits and facilitate progress toward elimi nating TB in the United States. 1 CDC. \"Guidelines for the Investigation of Contacts of Persons with Infectious Tuberculosis: Recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and Manual 10-2 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 POLICY A contact investigation is required for all laboratory confirmed cases of infectious TB, including TB disease of the lungs, airways, or larynx. A contact investigation should be started for all suspected cases of infectious TB , even before the case is confirmed . This includes persons with acid fast bacilli (AFB) positive sputum smears , abnormal chest x -ray (CXR) findings consistent with TB disease and any other test results that suggest TB disease . If it is later determined that the suspect case does no t have infectious TB disease, the contact investigation should be stopped. A contact investigation should be started as soon as a suspected or confirmed case of infectious TB is reported to health a uthorities. The initial steps of the investigation includ e reviewing the patient's medical information and interviewing the patient within 1 to 3 days of the case being reported. RESPONSIBILITY 28 Pa Code \u00a7 27.1 61b requires that \"a human household contact or other close human contact shall be required to have a TB test or a chest x -ray, or both. If the person refuses, enforcement shall be accomplished as designated in \u00a7 \u00a7 27.82 and 27.83 (relating to request to submit to examination ; and court ordered examinations). If evidence of tuberculosis in contacts is found on chest x -rays or by symptoms, laboratory studies shall be conducted to determine if the contacts represent a public health threat\". Public h ealth departments - the local state health center (SHC) or county or municipal health department (CMHD) - have overall responsibility for co nducting and overseeing contact investigations for all suspected and confirmed cases of infectious TB in their jurisdiction , regardless of whether the case was identified by a public provider, private physician or medical staff at health care facilities such as hospitals, long -term care facilities and schools. The local public health nurses (PHNs) will work with private physicians and medical staff at health care facilities to plan and conduct the contact investigation and will coordinate with other public health staff to ensure that contacts who live outside the jurisdiction are tested and evaluated for TB. The st ate TB program manager, state medical consultant(s) and the Global TB Institute at Rutgers are available for consultation in planning contact investigations. The state TB program manager should be notified immediately of all contact investigations that may involve significant numbers of contacts such as those occurring in schools, colleges, large industries, hospitals, nursing homes, correctional facilities, etc. Tuberculosis disease which occurs in a federal, state or local government institution (correct ional facility, public welfare institution, hospital) must be reported to the state TB program . Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-3 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 PHNs must coordinate with the staff of the institution to assure that a contact investigation is completed , either by a collaborative effort between the local health department and the institution or by the institution in consultation with the local health department . If contact investigations by the institution are delayed or not started , public health nursin g staff must notify the ir supervisor , who will notify the state TB program manager . Private physicians may conduct a contact i nvestigation for their patients but the local public health staff is responsible for ensuring that a complete contact investigation is done and should offer to conduct the investigation for the physician. DECIDING TO INITIATE A CONTACT INVESTIGA TION Consider a contact investigation for any patient with confirmed or suspected pulmonary, laryngeal, or pleuropulmonary TB. Refer to Figure 1 to help determine whether to start a contact investigation.

In these situations, public health staff need to decide which contact investigations are assigned the highest priority. Generally, the highest priority should be assigned to those contact investigations where the case is likely to be highly infectious , is in a congregate or other setting where the likelihood of transmission is high , or where the contacts are at increased risk for rapid pr ogression to TB disease. HIGHLY INFECTIOUS CA SES Highly infectious cases generally have one or more of the following characteristics: Pulmonary, laryngeal or pleural Cavities on CXR Frequent or long -term coughing, sneezing, or singing - actions that spread droplets containing M. tuberculosis in the air SETTINGS WHERE TRANS MISSION OF TB IS LIK ELY Transmission is more likely in settings where there is a high concentration of M. tubercul osis in the air. The concentration of M. tuberculosis bacteria in the air is affected by: Room s ize Ventilation Air-cleaning system M. tuberculosis is more likely to be transmitted in small, crowded spaces that lack ventilation than in large well -ventila ted spaces. Settings with air -cleaning systems such as high -efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and ultraviolet lights can decrease the concentration of M. tuberculosis bacteria in the air. In addition to the above criteria, the activities in a given setting should also be considered. For example, medical procedures such as bronchoscopy, sputum induction, TB wound irrigation or autopsy of TB cases can all aerosolize TB bacteria and increase t he concentration of M. tuberculosis in the air. Contact investigations involving settings where these procedures are done should be assigned a high priority. CONTACTS AT HIGH RIS K OF RAPID PROGRESSI ON TO TB DISEASE Contacts infected with M. tuberculosis who are at particularly high risk for rapidly progressing to TB disease include: Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-6 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 Children less than 5 years of age ; and Persons with weakened immune systems due to o HIV infection ; or o Immunosuppressive therapy (including TNF -alpha antagonists, prolonged use of high-dose adrenocorticosteroids, or medications received after organ transplantation to reduce the risk or organ rejection ) Contact investig ations including the above high -risk patients should be given priority for initiation and completio n. CONTACT INVESTIGATIO N PERSONNEL A TB contact investigation involves many different steps and procedures. Depending o n the size of the investigation and the resources available, the investigation may be done by one or two individuals or a contact inves tigation team. The public health staff involved in a contact investigation may include: Nurse case managers Field investigators Outreach workers Epidemiologists and surveillance staff TB program manager TB medical consultant Ideally, one person should be assigned responsibility for the overall management of the investigation to ensure all activities are completed and done properly. In some situations, infection control professionals or other staff from the facility where exposure occurred may also partici pate in the contact investigation. KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS NEEDED TO DO A TB C ONTACT INVESTIGATION The person in charge of the overall contact investigation (the \"contact investigator\") and other members of the contact investigation team should have the follo wing knowledge and skills: A basic understanding of TB transmission and pathogenesis. o A useful resource is CDC Tuberculosis Self -Study Module 1: Transmission and Pathogenesis of Tuberculosis . Available at: https://www.cdc.gov/tb/education/ssmodules/pdfs/2017SelfStudy_Module1.pdf Effective communication skills to build trust and rapport with the case patient during interviews. o A helpful resource is the Effective Intervi ewing for T uberculosis Contact Investigations video and checklist issued in 201 9 by the Global TB Institute at Rutgers and a vailable at : http://globaltb.njms.rutgers.edu/educationalmaterials/productfolder/ci_video.php Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-7 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 Data collection, management and analysis . Cont act investigations typically involve a large amount of demographic, medical and epidemiological data that needs to be systematically collected, organized and analyzed. The contact investigator needs to decide which data need to be collected, who is respons ible for collecting it and how, and how the data is to be safeguarded and managed. An understanding of TB genotyping . Genotyping is done for each c ulture -positive case of TB and identifies the specific strain of M. tuberculosis that has infected the patien t. Because genotyping is done on positive cultures, the resulting information isn't available to the investigator until later in the contact investigation. When the genotyping data is available, it can confirm , disprove or detect connections among TB cases . For example, two cases with the same genotype may not know one another but may have been exposed to the same infectious case of TB years earlier. Genotyping data is also key to iden tifying an emerging outbreak of TB cases. o For more information on genotyping, see CDC Tuberculosis Self -Study Module 9: Tuberculosis Outbreak Detection and Response. Available at: https://www.cdc.gov/tb/education/ssmodules /pdfs/Module9.pdf SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO A CONTACT INVESTI GATION Contact investigations should be done using a systematic process that includes the following 10 steps: 1. Review all existing information about the case 2. Do an initial calculation of the infecti ous period and estimate the patient's degree of infectiousness 3. Interview the case patient 4. Review the information gathered to date and prepare a plan for the contact investigation 5. Refine the patient's infectious period and degree of infectiousness 6. Prioriti ze contacts 7. Conduct field visits 8. Conduct contact assessments 9. Determine whether to expand or conclude an investigation 10. After completing the contact investigation, evaluate the contact investigation activities and results and note improvements for future inv estigations Highlights of key steps are described in the following pages. For an in -depth review of each of the above steps, refer to CDC Tuberculosis Self -Study Module 8: Contact Investigations for Tuberculosis, pages 16 -56. Available at: https://www.cdc.gov/tb/education/ssmodules/pdfs/Module8.pdf Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-8 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 CALCULATING THE INFE CTIOUS PERIOD The infectious period is the time during which a case is potentially capable of transmi tting M. tuberculosis . Because there is no well -established method of determining the start, duration and end of the infectious period, it must be estimated. Estimating the infectious period helps the investigator focus on those contacts who were most likely exposed to M. tuberculosis while the case was infectious. Estimating the Start of the Infectious Period For TB cases that have positive sputum smears or ev idence of cavitation on their CXR , the minimum start date of the infectious period is usually three months before the onset of coughing or other respiratory symptoms, or three months before the first finding consistent with TB disease (e.g., an abnormal CXR consistent with TB disease), whichever is earlier. Example 1: The patient recalls that his or her symptoms began on November 1. In this case , it is estimated the start of the infectious period was August 1. Example 2: The patient doesn't remember when h is or her symptoms began or was never symptomatic. However, a CXR taken on September 1 indicated a cavity in the right lung. In this case , it is estimated the start of the infectious period was June 1, or three months before the CXR was done. For TB cases with TB symptoms and negative sputum smears, the start date of the infectious period would be three months before the onset of symptoms or three months before the first finding consistent with TB disease, whichever is earlier. For TB cases with no symptoms , negative sputum smears and no cavities , the start of the infectious period is 1 month (4 weeks) before TB disease was first susp ected by a healthcare provider. These recommendations ar e summarized in Table 1. Public health nurses are encouraged to confer with the local TB clinician if they have any concerns about estimating the start of the patient's infectious period. Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-9 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 Table 1: Recommendations for Estimating the Start of the Infectious Period Characteristics of TB Case Recommended Minimum Beginning of the Infectious Period Respiratory TB Symptoms Sputum Smear Positive Pulmonary Cavity on Chest X-ray Yes No No 3 months before symptom onset or first finding consistent with TB disease, whichever is earlier Yes Yes Yes 3 months before symptom onset or first finding consistent with TB disease, whichever is earlier No No No 1 month (4 weeks) before date of suspected diagnosis No Yes Yes 3 months before first finding consistent with TB disease Estimating the End of the Infectious Period TB patients rapidly become less contagious while receiving treatment , but the exact rate of decrease cannot be predicted for individual patients , and a subjective determination is required for each. In general, for the purposes of a contact investigation , the infectious period is over when exposure to contacts has ended (e.g., the patient is isolated under airborne infection isolation procedures) OR when the index patient meets all three of the following criteria: 1. The TB patient is on an appr opriate treatment regimen - such as RIPE therapy (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol ) for pan -susceptible patients - for at least two weeks 2. The TB patient has diminished symptoms 3. The TB patient exhibits mycobacteriologic response (e.g., decrease in grade smear positivity detec ted Extend the infectious period if the treatment regimen is ineffective. Signs of infectiousness: Any TB case with signs of continued infectiousness should be continually reassessed for recent contacts. High -risk contacts: Apply more stringent criteria for setting the end of the infectious period if high-risk contacts are involved. A patient returning to a congregate living setting , Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-10 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 or to any setting in which high-risk persons might be exposed , should have at least three consecutive negative AFB sputum smear results from sputum co llected more than eight hours apart (with one specimen collected during the early morning) before being considered noninfectious. Figure 1.1 shows an example of ho w to determine an i nitial estimate for the beginning and the end of the infectious period for a patient with a posi tive sputum smear result and symptoms of TB disease. Figure 1.1 - Example of determining the start and end of t he infectious period for a smear positive patient ( case ) with TB symptoms Figure 1.2 shows an example of ho w to determine an initial estimate for the beginning and the end of the infectious period for a patient with a negative sputum smear result, no TB symptoms and . Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-11 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 Figure 1.2 -Infectious period estimate for a smear negative patient (case ) without TB symptoms and no cavities on chest x -ray Estimating the Patient's Degree of I nfectiousness The greater the degree of a patient's infectiousness, the more likely that transmission occurred. An initial estimate of the degree of infectiousness can be made during the pre -interview phase of the contact investigation and revised after the patient int erview and as the investigation continues. Table 2 lists the factors that should be considered when estimating the patient's degree of infectiousness. Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-12 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 Table 2 : Factors Associated with Infectiousness and Noninfectiousness Factors Associated with More Infectiousness Factors Associated with Less Infectiousness Presence of a cough No cough Cavity in the lung No cavity in the lung Acid-fast bacilli on larynx Extrapulmonary (non -respiratory) TB Patient not covering nose or mouth when coughing or sneezing Patient covering mouth or nose when coughing or sneezing Not receiving adequate treatment of having prolonged illness Receiving adequate treatment for two weeks or longer Undergoing cough -inducing procedures Not undergoing cough -inducing procedures Positive sputum cultures Negative sputum cultures INTERVIEWING THE PAT IENT The foundation of an effective contact inve stigation is the patient interview, and it is very important that the investigator is trained and skilled in conducting patient interviews. If the case investigator does not establish trust and rapport with the patient, he or she is unlikely to obtain the information necessary to identify and medically evaluate persons who were exposed to M. tuberculosis during the case patient's infectious period. For more information, see the 2019 video Effective Interviewing for Tuberculosis Contact Investigations by the Global TB Institute at Rutgers: http://globaltb.njms.rutgers.edu/educationalmaterials/productfolder/ci_video.php . A companion interview guide is included as Appendix B to this ch apter. Note: One of the National TB Indicators Project ( NTIP ) objectives for 202 5 is to increase the proportion of TB patients with AFB -positive sputum smear results who have contacts elicited. To gather information about contacts who may have been exposed to M. tuberculosis, the investigator should ask the patient: Where he or she s pent time during the infectious period , and for each place : o The amount of time spent there o Physical characteristics of the place e.g., room size, crowding, and ventilation What activities or events he or she participated in during the infectious period , including : o On a typical day Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-13 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 o Any special events or holiday celebrations o Any volunteer activities especially in day care, a school, a hospital or nursing home Whom he or she spent time with during the infectious period, particularly : o Any children less than 5 years of age o Anyone with a medical condition that weakens the immune system o Anyone who had TB symptoms such as coughing, weight loss, and fatigue For each contact listed, the in vestigator should obtain locating information such as a phone number or home or workplace address. During the interview, t he investigator needs to be sensitive to situations where the case patient may be reluctant to identify contacts who live in the Unit ed States illegally or who misuse alcohol or illegal drugs. The investigator needs to reassure the case patient that all information is kept confidential and explain the importance of testing contacts to eliminate further spread of TB disease. Additional goals of the interview are to: Describe the contact investigation process. A case patient who understands why and how a contact investigation is done is more likely to provide information. Educate the case patient about TB disease. The case patient may ha ve little or no knowledge of TB, may h ave misconceptions about TB, or may be reluctant to seek information due to stigma about the disease. Confirm or correct information obtained during the pre -interview phase of the investigation , especially about any pe rsonal history of TB disease and/or TB symptoms and any contact during their lifetime with other individuals who had TB. The initial patient interview should be done 1 to 3 days after the health authority receives notice of an infectious case. A second int erview should be scheduled 1 to 2 weeks later, which allows the patient time to adjust to their TB diagnosis and treatment. Additional interviews can be scheduled as needed or conducted during routine visits to provide directly observed therapy (DOT) and a ssess the patient's response to treatment. All interviews should be done in person and can occur in the hospital, TB clinic, the patient's home, or any other location that is convenient for the patient and that respects his or her privacy. Unless there are extenuating circumstances , at least one interview should be done in the patient's home so that the investigator can look for clues that young children or other adults live with or frequently visit the patient and may have been exposed to TB. For more information about strategies for conducting effective patient interviews see CDC Tuberculosis Self -Study Module 8: Contact Investigations for Tuberculosis . Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-14 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 FLIGHT INVESTIGATION S For patients suspected or confirmed of having infectious pulmonary TB, be sure to ask about any travel during the estimated infectious period. If the patient travelled by air during the past six months on a flight lasting eight hours or more, ask the patient for specifics , including the date of the flight, the airline, the fl ight departure and destination cities and where the patient sat on the plane. Notify the state TB program manager immediately and provide him or her with the flight information. The TB program manager will then contact CDC's Division of Global Migration an d Quarantine (DGMQ) office at the Philadelphia International Airport and a DGMQ officer will schedule a teleconference with the state and local public health personnel familiar with the case to review the facts and determine next steps. REVIEW INFORMATION AND DEVELOP AN INVE STIGATION PLAN After the case investigator has interviewed the patient, he or she should meet with his or her supervisor to review all the information obtained to date and develop a plan for the remainder of the investigation. For a lar ge, challenging (e.g., the index case is multi drug or extensively drug - resistant) or complicated (e.g., contacts have been identified in multiple jurisdictions) investigation , a contact investigation team may be established. As part of the planning proce ss, the investigator or team should: Refine the calculation of the infectious period and degree of infectiousness for the case based on any new information obtained after the initial estimates were prepared Prioritize contacts for assessment Prioritize pla ces where contact with the case occurred for field visits If appropriate , (e.g., a high -volume contact investigation, a contact investigation in a school, or for a multi -drug or extensively -drug resistant case) establish a communication plan among all personnel involved in the conduct of the contact investigation Clarify any jurisdicti onal issues Establish timeframes and methods for investigation activities, data collection and management Determine stakeholders in the investigation Determine potential media interest in the investigation Schedule case conferences or meetings to review pr ogress and resolve challenges The investigation plan should be written and include where to conduct field visits, which contacts are considered a priority for assessment, and a timeline for accomplishing these tasks. If the health department has multiple T B cases requiring contact investigations, the information in the plan should be used to help prioritize which contact investigations require immediate attention and resources. The plan should be considered a work in progress and be updated as needed throug hout the investigation. Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-15 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 PRIORITIZE CONTACTS During the planning meeting, the investigator should use information from the initial interview of the index patient to prioritize contacts for assessment. The priority assigned to each contact should be based on: How much ti me (duration and frequency) the contact spent with the index patient; The distance from the index patient during exposure as well as environmental factors (outdoors, indoors with ventilation, ind oors without ventilation, etc.); and Any medical conditions of the contact that place him or her at increased risk for progressing to TB disease once infected. These concepts are illustrated in the concentric circle model . Concentric Circle Model in TB Control Identifying Contacts at Risk of Exposure The priority assigned to each contact should be based on both: The infectiousness and likelihood of transmission by the case ; and The contact's risk of progressing to TB disease once infected . Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-16 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 The assignment of contacts as high, medium or low priority should be done in consultation with supervisory clinical and management staff or during a case conference with the contact investigation team. Dividing contacts into these three levels provides a system to reach high - priority contacts first, then medium -priority contacts, a nd finally low-priority contacts. The priority scheme directs resources to the following essential actions: o Identif ication of contacts who are secondary active TB cases ; o Identif ication of contacts who have recent M. tuberculosis infection \u2014the most likely to benefit from treatment ; and o Identif ication of contacts who are most likely to progress to TB disease if they are infected (i.e., high-risk contacts) or who could suffer severe morbidity if they had TB disease (i.e., vulnerable contacts) .

The purpose of the field investigation is to identify contacts and evaluate the environmental characteristics of the place in which expos ure occurred. During field investigation s, the investigator should : Observe environmental characteristics such as room size, crowding, and ventilation . Air volume, exhaust rate, and circulation predict the likelihood of transmission in an enclosed space. In large indoor settings, the degree of proximity between contacts and the index patient can influence the likelihood of transmission. The volume of air shared between an infectious TB patient and contacts dilute the infectious particles. Local circulation and overall room ventilation also dilute infectious particles, but both factors must be considered because they can redirect exposure into spaces that were not visited by the index patient. Identify additional contacts (especially children) and the ir locating information, such as phone numbers and addresses . Look for evidence of other contacts who may not be present at the time of the visit (for example, pictures of others who may live in or visit the house, shoes of others who may live in the house or toys left by children). Interview and test high - and medium -priority contacts who are present and arrange to let them know of the results . Educate the contacts about the purpose of a contact investigation, the basics of transmission, the risk of transmitting M. tuberculosis to others, and the importance of testing, treatment, and follow -up for LTBI and TB disease . Refer contacts who have TB symptoms for a medical evaluation, including sputum collection. The investigator and other healthcare personnel s hould remember to follow infection control precautions while visiting a potentially infectious TB patient at home or in any other location. These precautions may include wearing personal protective equipment (i.e. N95 or N100 respirators). Another critical consideration during field investigations is safety. The investigator should become familiar with policies and recommendations of local law enforcement agencies and health department administration regarding personal safety. Current information on local high - risk areas for crime can be very valuable in planning and conducting safe field visits. Genera l safety precautions that are recommended for the investigator and other healthcare worker s include the following: Wearing a photo ID Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-19 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 Working in pairs when visiting a potentially dangerous area Informing supervisor/office staff of your itinerary and expec ted time of return, especially if you anticipate problems TIME FRAMES FOR INTE RVIEWING THE INDEX PATIENT AND INVESTIGATING POTENTIAL TRANSMISSI ON SITES Because of the urgency of finding other infectious cases associated with the index patient, the first in terview should be done within one to three business day s of the index patient being diagnosed, as outlined in Table 6: Time Frames for Investigating the Index Patient and the Sites of Transmission .

CONTACT EVALUATION A ND TREATMENT In addition to the investigation of the index patient and transmission sites, a contact investigation also involves contact follow -up. Every new case of TB was initially a contact to someone with infectious TB, which highlights why the proper evaluation and treatment of contacts is an essenti al component of the contact investigation process. Note: The NTIP objectives for 202 5 include three objectives concerning the evaluation and treatment of contacts: Examination - For contacts to AFB sputum -smear positive TB cases, increase the proportion wh o are examined for LTBI and TB disease. Treatment Initiation - For contacts to AFB sputum -smear positive TB cases (who are) diagnosed with LTBI , increase the proportion who start treatment . Treatment completion - For contacts to AFB sputum -smear positive TB cases who have started treatment for LTBI, increase the proportion who complete treatment. Refer to Table 7: Time Frames for Contact Evaluation and Treatment to monitor the progress of the investigation and determine whether additional resources are needed for finding, evaluating, and treating the high - and medium -priority contacts.

The initial encounter also provides opportunities to administer a TB test and t o schedule further evaluation. The medical evaluation is complete when the contact's diagnosis of tuberculosis infection or TB disease has been determined. A normal exception to this schedule is the delay in waiting for final mycobacteriology results, but this applies to relatively few contacts. Source: Adapted from CDC.

EVALUATION, TREATMENT, AND FOLLO W-UP Complete evaluation, treatment, and follow -up for high - and medium -priority contacts, as specified in the contact investigation plan. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the following: Complete an initial assessment of each high - and medium -priority contact that includes a face-to-face encounter in which an impression of each contact's general health is formed and a TB test is administered. Medically evaluate each high - and medium -priority contact to determine whether TB disease or LTBI is present or absent. Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-22 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 Timely initiation of treat ment is especially important for high -priority contacts and for contacts likely to progress to TB disease if they are infected (i.e., high-risk contacts ) or contacts who could suffer severe morbidity if they had TB disease (i.e., vulnerable contacts). Use the same diagnostic methods for all contacts, except when they have medical or constitutional conditions making TB more likely or more difficult to diagnose. In contacts of an infectious case who are foreign -born or BCG -vaccinated, i nterpret a positive TST as evidence of recent M. tuberculosis infection . Evaluate these contacts for TB disease . If a diagnosis of TB disease is excluded, encourage them to complete the shortest regimen of LTBI treatment appropriate for the specific patient . Use the tables on the following pages to determine the evaluation activities for contacts in these different risk groups and priority rankings: 1. Table 8: Immunocompromised Contacts and Children Less than 5 Years of Age 2. Table 9: Immunocompetent Adults and Children 5 and Older (High and Medium - Priority Contacts) 3. Table 1 0: Contacts with Prior Positive Tuberculin Skin Tests IMMUNOCOMPROMISED CO NTACTS AND CHILDREN LESS THAN 5 YEARS OF AGE Refer to Table 8 to select evaluation, treatment, and follow -up activities for contacts who are immunocompromised and/or less than 5 years of age . Evaluate these contacts with medical history, physical examination, CXR , and IGRA or TST . Based on the results of these evaluations, take the actions in Table 8. The American Thoracic Society (ATS ), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that contacts less than 5 years of age be treated for presumptive LTBI - even if their first IGRA or TST is negative - once a diagnosis of TB disease has been eliminated. In those instances where these high priority contacts may not be evaluated in TB clinic for a month or longer, discuss with the TB clinician the feasibility of starting LTBI preventative treatment (also known as window prophylaxis) immediately.

WHEN TO EXPAND A CON TACT INVESTIGATION GUIDELINES FOR EXPAN DING AN INVESTIGATIO N Throughout the contact investigation process, it's important to continually review findings to determine whether it's necessary to expand the scope of the investigation. Any decision to expand a contact investigation should be based on the TB test results for the medium and high priority contacts. If evidence emerges indicating re cent transmission of TB, then it's likely the scope of the investigation needs to expand. Evidence of recent transmission of TB disease includes: TB disease in any contact LTBI in contacts less than 5 years of age A change in contacts' IGRA or TST result from negative (i.e., for the initial test) to positive (i.e., 8 to 10 weeks after the last exposure to the case) A greater than expected rate of TB disease among the priority contacts . An infected contact who develops TB disease is referred to as a second ary case of TB . A separate contact investigation should be considered for each secondary case of TB. Secondary transmission of TB may also indicate that a TB outbreak is occurring, especially if the genotypes match. A greater than expected prevalence of LTBI among case contacts , with prevalence defined as the percentage of persons with LTBI in a defined population. A commonly used threshold for expanding a contact investigation is a LTBI prevalence rate of 10% or more among case contacts. Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-27 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 If TB disease occurs in a contact who was originally considered a low priority for evaluation, this may indicate a need to expand the contact investigation. Generally, if any of the above examples of recent transmission are detected, then expanding the contact investigation to include contacts originally assigned a lower priority should be considered . When results from an investiga tion indicate that it should be expanded, but resources are insufficient, contact the next higher level in public health administration (e.g., the local nurse supervisor and the state TB program manager ). Do not expand a contact investigation to lower -priority contacts u nless : o There is evidence of recent transmission ; or o There is a unique situation that has been reviewed with the state TB program and the state TB medical consultant and the latter has recommended expansion of the contact investigation. Review the incoming results of the contact investigation at least weekly to reassess the scope and elements of the plan. OVERVIEW OF ONGOING CONTACT INVESTIGATIO N ACTIVITIES Ongoing contact follow -up includes testing, medical evaluation, and treatment. Information from contact follow -up guides decisions about whether to expand a contact investigation. Refer to Table 12: Overview of Ongoing Management Activities and Maximum Time Frames to monitor the progress of ongoing contact follow -up and to determine when to decide whether to expand the investigation. TABLE 12: OVERVIEW OF ONGOING MANAGEMENT ACTIVITI ES AND MAXIMUM TIME FRAMES FOR THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NUR SE Activity Purpose Maximum Time Interval Review all documentation To ensure that contact list is complete Ongoing Review and assess completeness of each contact's medical follow -up and treatment plan To ensure appropriate and complete medical follow -up 5 business days after each contact's medical evaluation is completed* Review and assess the timeliness of initiating the treatment plan To avoid delays in treatment initiation, particularly in high -risk contacts 10 business days after each contact's medical evaluation is completed* Determine if transmission occurred To decide whet her to expand investigation At completion of follow -up testing, or if secondary cases are identified Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-28 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 Activity Purpose Maximum Time Interval Obtain and review drug - susceptibility results To determine if contacts are receiving appropriate treatment for LTBI 1 to 2 months after the index patient's initial sputum collection date Repeat the TB test if contact initially tests negative To determine if contact has converted (TB Class I to TB Class II) 8 to 10 weeks after each contact's initial TB test or last exposure to the index patient Reevaluate contacts who se TB test was initially negative and started on LTBI treatment (Window Period Treatment for a TB Class I Contact) To determine if treatment for LTBI should be continued 8 to 10 weeks after each contact's initial TST or last exposure to the index patient before the end of the infectious period Assess contacts' adherence with medical follow -up and TB medication To remove barriers and ensure timely and complete evaluation and follow -up Monthly, at time of each visit Ensure contacts ar e monitored for adverse reactions and toxicity of LTBI treatment regimens To prevent development of adverse effects and toxicity from drug regimens At least monthly while on LTBI treatment in either nurse directed or MD TB clinics Evaluate problems and concerns that arise and may delay or hamper contact investigation To remove barriers and ensure timely and complete evaluation and follow -up Whenever problems are identified Collect and analyze data to evaluate the contact investigation To pr ovide epidemiologic analysis of investigations and to measure performance using indicators that reflect performance objectives Ongoing Ensure the data for all contacts is complete in PA-NEDSS so the TB program manager can accurately complete the Aggregate Reports for Tuberculosis Program Evaluation (ARPE) form To report on investigation to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Ongoing Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-29 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 Activity Purpose Maximum Time Interval * The medical evaluation is complete when the contact's status relative to M. tuberculosis infection or TB disea se has been determined. A normal exception to this schedule is the delay in waiting for final mycobacteriology results, but this applies to relatively few contacts. Third TB test: In rare circumstances, an infectious index patient with advanced disease can stay infectious for several months. In these circumstances, the second TB test for negative contacts should be performed in the usual time frame (8 to 10 weeks). This will identif y any contacts who have already converted so they can be evaluated for treatment. However, any household members who se second TB test is negative and have continued exposure to the infectious index patient should have a third TB test 8 to 10 weeks after the index patient becomes noninfectious. This is especially true for contacts who are infants in a household where a resident is culture positive after 3 months or has multidrug - resistant TB. For example, a household member with continued exposure to an infectious index patient had a negative second TB test on 3/12/2007. The last date the index patient was infectious was 3/5/2007. The household member should have a third TB test 8 to 10 weeks from 3/5/2007.

Management of care and follow -up of individual index patients and cont acts 2. Epidemiological analysis of an investigation in progress and overall investigations 3. Program evaluation via performance indicators that reflect performance objectives The public health nurse and the state TB program both have roles in collecting and analyzing the data related to contact investigations.

Pennsylvani a TB Manual 10-32 10 - Contact Investigation January 2020 EVALUATION OF A CONT ACT INVESTIGATION At the completion of a contact investigation, a review and evaluation of the investigation activities should be done by the contact investigator or contact investigation team and the appropriate supervisor(s) . Evalu ating the effectiveness of a contact investigation plan can be very helpful in improving the contact investigation process and, by extension, the overall effectiveness of the TB control program. The objective of the review is to identify what went well, w hat didn't, and how the investigator or investigation team would do things differently in the future. The findings should be documented in a succinct report so that what was learned can be applied to future contact investigations. TB OUTBREAK INVESTIGA TION If data from a contact investigation or surveillance indicate a potential outbreak, conduct an outbreak investigation. A TB outbreak warns of potential extensive transmission. An outbreak implies that 1) a TB patient was infect ious, 2) contacts had significant exposure to the infectious case , and 3) the interval since exposure has been sufficient for infection to progress to disease. An outbreak investigation involves several overlapping contact investigations, with a surge in the need for public health r esources. More emphasis on active case finding is recommended, which sometimes means that more contacts than usual should have CXR s and specimen collection for mycobacteriology. For more information about the conduct of an Outbreak Investigation, see Chapter 13.

April 2021 Chapter 11: Targeted Testing for TB INTRODUCTION PURPOSE Targeted testing refers to the screening of asymptomatic adults in populations at increased risk for tuberculosis using either an interferon -gamma release assay (IGRA) blood test or the Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) . This chapter summarizes national and Pennsylvania state guidelines concerning targeted testing to screen for latent TB infection (LTBI) . BACKGROUND The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and other U.S. and international healt h organizations agree that a key strategy for reducing the transmission, morbidity and mortality of active TB disease is the identification and treatment of LTBI. After nearly two decades of decline, the U.S. TB incidence rate has stalled at about three ca ses per 100,000 persons. A key factor in the lack of further progress is the number of people in the U.S. estimated by the CDC to have LTBI - as many as 13 m illion, or about 1,400 people with LTBI for each case of TB disease - representing a vast reservoir of potential new cases of TB disease. Without treatment, about 10 percent of people with LTBI will develop TB disease in their lifetime. For certain groups, h owever, the risk is much higher: Individuals with untreated LTBI and uncontrolled diabetes have a bout a 30 percent risk of developi ng TB disease in their lifetime. Persons with untreated LTBI and HIV have a 7 to 10 percent risk of developing TB disease per year. Fortunately, LTBI treatment is appro ximately 90 percent effective in preventing the progression to active TB disease. U.S. e pidemiologic data indicates that more than 85 per cent of new TB cases are due to the progression from LTBI to TB disease (sometimes referred to as the reactivation of LTBI), and about 70 percent of TB cases occur in non-U.S. born people. Since 2007, overseas screenin g of U.S. bound immigrants and refugees has included routine culture and drug susceptibility testing in addi tion to smear microscopy, resulting in the Until further notice, refer to the CDC website for current guidance about COVID -19 mRNA vaccines and TB testing . Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 11-2 11- Targeted Testing for TB Rev. April 2021 identification and treatment of smear negative/culture positive TB cases before U.S. arrival and a corresponding decrease in the importation of TB cases. However, overseas screening procedures do not require the treatment of LTBI prior to U.S. arrival and therefore do not prevent the importation of LTBI. POLICY In Pennsylvania , there are four primary groups for TB test ing: Persons who show or report signs and symptoms of TB are evaluated for TB disease as described in Chapter 5, Diagnosis of LTBI and TB Disease , and reported as suspected cases of TB as described in the \"Reporting TB\" section in this chapter. Close c ontacts to infectious TB cases are evaluated as described in Chapter 10, Contact Investigation. Targeted testing for LTBI is conducted among persons at increased risk for LTBI and/or progression to TB disease. Other individuals may be tested for TB as mandated by local administrative or legal requirements. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 11-3 11- Targeted Testing for TB Rev. April 2021 2016 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TB SCREENING In September 2016, the USPSTF recommended screening for LTBI among asymptomatic adults ages 18 and older in populations at increased risk, including: People who were born in, or are former residents of, countries with a high prevalence of TB; and People wh o live or have lived in high -risk group settings such as nursing homes or other long-term care facilities, homeless shelters and correctional facilities. The USPSTF also assigned a \"B\" grade to testing for TB in populations at increased risk. Under current law, preventive services with a USPSTF grade of A or B are covered without cost - sharing (e.g., co -payment or deductible) by many health insurance plans or policies. In supporting the USPSTF position, the CDC added its recommendation that the following groups also be tested for TB: People who h ave spent time with a person who has infectious TB ; People with certain health conditions that weaken the immune system, including h uman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, diabetes, substance abuse (e.g. smoking , alcohol abuse, or injection drug use) and severe kidney disease ; People taking medications that suppress the immune system such as corticosteroids and TNF inhibitors; and Health care personnel and others who work in places at high risk of TB transmission . The USPSTF recommendation is likely to reduce cost barriers to TB testing and the availability of blood tests using the interferon -gamma release assay (IGRA) methodology and shorter treatment regimens , such as the 12 -dose once -weekly regimen , have the potential to overcome other barriers including the need for multiple clinic visits when testing with the TST and LTBI treatment regim ens which last up to nine months. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 11-4 11- Targeted Testing for TB Rev. April 2021 IDENTIFYING GROUPS AT INCREASED RISK The CDC states that persons at risk for developing TB disease generally fall into one of the following two categories: Those who have an increased likelihood of exposure to persons with TB disease; and Those with clinical conditions or other factors associated with an increased risk of progression from LTBI to TB disease. Persons who are both at increased likelihood of exposure to TB disease and have a clinical condition or other factor that increases their risk of progression have a higher r isk of developing TB disease than those who fall into one category or the other. For example, an individual born in a high -TB-prevalence country who is HIV positive is at much higher risk of having active TB than a US -born individual with HIV infection. Table 1: Persons at Increased Risk for LTBI and/or Progression to TB Disease Increased Risk of LTBI Increased Risk For Progression to TB Disease High-priority contacts of persons who have smear -positive pulmonary or laryngeal TB Infants, children, and adolescents exposed to adults in high -risk categories Non-U.S. born person from, or recent traveler to, high prevalence countries including Mexico, the Philippines, Vietnam, India, China, Haiti, or other countries with high rates of TB Migra nt workers Persons with high rates of TB transmission: \u00ad Homeless persons \u00ad Injection drug users \u00ad Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection Persons living or working in congregate settings such as: \u00ad Hospitals, especially staff in nursing, emergency departments, and laboratories \u00ad Long -term care facilities \u00ad Homeless shelters \u00ad Residences for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients \u00ad Correctional facilities Persons with HIV infection Infants and children aged <5 years Persons infected with Mycobacterium TB within the previous 2 years Persons with a history of untreated or inadequately treated TB disease Persons with radiographic findings consistent with inactive or past TB disease Persons dependent on addictive substances (tobacco, alcohol, or injectable drugs) Persons with any of the following conditions or immunocompromising conditions: leuke mia \u00ad Other malignancies (e.g., carcinoma of head, neck, or lung) \u00ad Body weight 10% below ideal body weight \u00ad Use of immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids or tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF- ) antagonists \u00ad Organ transplantation malabsorption syndromes Pennsylvania TB Manual : Targeted Testing for TB Rev.

TB S CREENING : RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL Mass screening of the general population for TB is an inefficient method of finding infection and disease , and a poor use of limited financial and human resources. Screening should be prioritized to identify i nfected persons at increased risk of disease who would benefit from preventive therapy. To assist clinicians in determining which p atients are at risk and should be tested, the Pennsylvania (PA) TB Program has developed the following tools: Adult TB Risk Assessment and Adult TB Risk Assessment User Guide Pediatric TB Risk Assessment and Pediatri c TB Risk Assessment User Guide See Appendix A of this chapter for more information. HEALTH CARE PERSONNEL TB screening of health care personnel in inpatient and outpatient settings should be done in accordance with \" Tuberculosis Screening, Testing and Treatment of U.S. Health Care Personnel: Recommendations form the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2019\" (MMWR 2019;68:439 -443 at http://dx.d oi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6819a3 . The r isk assessment tools provided by the CDC and the PA TB Program ask the same three questions (temporary or permanent residence in a country with a high TB rate, current or planned immunosuppression, and close contact wit h someone with infectious TB) and either may be used. TB TESTS There are two types of tests for TB - the interferon gamma -release assay (IGRA) blood test and the tuberculin . Currently , two different IGRA bloo d test brands are available - QuantiFERON\u00ae (Qiagen) and T -Spot\u00ae (Oxford Immunotec). The advantages and disadvantages of both test types are summarized in the chart on the following page. Pennsylvania TB Manual : CMHD 11-6 11- Targeted Testing for TB Rev. April 2021 Test Type Advantages Disadvantages IGRA An IGRA has g reater specificity than a TST, so there are fewer f alse positive results with an IGRA in individuals who have had the Bacille Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine or who are infected with nontuberculosis mycobacteria . Cost effective - greater specificity means fewer patients are treated unnecessarily for LTBI Requires one patient visit to collect the blood sample for the test Results can be available within 24 hours Does not boost responses to subsequent tests Preferred over a TST for children 2 years of age and older with prior BCG vaccination Blood samples must be processed within 8 -30 hours of collection Test accuracy can be affected by errors in collecting or transporting the blood sample, or in running or interpreting the assay Typically costs more than tuberculin TST Costs less than an IGRA Preferred over an IGRA in children less than 2 years of age The TST is less specific than an IGRA. False positive TST results can occur in individuals vaccinated with BCG or infected with nontuberculosis mycobacteria Requires two patient visits - one to place the test and one to read the results Results must be rea d between 48 and 72 hours after the test was placed The TST c an boost the results of subsequent tests Both the IGRA and TST tests can detect the presence of Mtb in the body, but neither test can differentiate between LTBI and active TB disease nor predict which patients with LTBI will progress to active TB disease. Patients with documented evidence of either a previous IGRA or TST positive test result or a history of TB should not be tested with an IGRA or TST. Once a patient tests positive, they will always test positive - even after completing treatment for LTBI or TB disease. Individuals with a positive IGRA or TST test result , or individuals with a negative IGRA or TST test result who are at high risk of TB exposure (e.g., close contacts of sputum -smear positive cases TB cases, especially young children or person s with weakened immune systems) should be evaluated for TB as described in Chapter 5, Diagnosis of LTBI and TB Disease .

Prioritize persons at risk for progression If health system resources do not allow for testing of all non-U.S. born persons from a country with an ele- vated TB rate, prioritize patients with at least one of the following medical risks for progression: diabetes mellitus smoker within past 1 year end stage renal disease leukemia or lymphoma silicosis cancer of head or neck intestinal bypass/gastrectomy chronic malabsorption body mass index 20 history of chest x -ray findings suggestive of previous or inac tive TB treatment) . Includes fibrosis -calcified nodules but not a solitary calcified nodule or isolated pleural thickening. Test for TB infection and if positive evaluate for active TB di sease. U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) The USPSTF has recommended testing persons born in or former residents of a c ountry with an elevated TB rate and persons who live in or have lived in high - risk congregate settings such as correctional facilities, nursing homes and homeless shelters. Because the in- creased risk of exposure to TB in congregate settings varies substant ially by facility and local health jurisdic- tion, clinicians are encouraged to follow local recom- mendations when considering testing persons from these congregate settings. The USPSTF did not review data supporting testing among close contacts to persons w ith infectious dis- ease or among persons who are immunosuppressed because these persons are recommended to be screened by public health programs or clinical stand- ards of care. Children This risk assessment tool is intended for adults. A sep- arate risk assessment tool for children is also available on our website . Mandated testing Certain populations may be mandated for testing by statute, regulation, or policy. This risk assessment does not supersede any mandated testing for healthcare workers, school employees or volunteers, and residents or employees in co ngregate settings such as correctional institutions, nursing homes , homeless shelters and others . Age as a factor Age (among adults) is not considered in this risk as- sessment. However, younger adults have more years of expected life during which progression from latent TB infection (LTBI) to active TB disease could develop . Some programs or clinicians may prioritize testing of younger non-U.S. born persons when all non-U.S. born persons are not tested. An upper age limit for testing has not been established but could be appro- priate depending on individual patient TB risks, comorbidities, and life expectancy. Foreign travel or residence Travel or residence in countries with an elevated TB rate may increase the risk for TB exposure in certain circumstances (e.g. extended duration, likely contact with persons with infecti ous TB, high prevalence of TB in travel location and non -tourist travel). The duration of at least one consecutive month to trigger testing is intended to ident ify travel or residence most likely to involve TB exposure. TB screening tests can be falsely negative within eight weeks after exposure, so results are best obtained eight weeks after retu rn from travel. When to repeat a test Re-testing should only be done in persons who previ- ously tested negative and have new risk factors since the last assessment. Such risk factors include new close contact with an infectious TB case , new immu- nosuppression, and can also include foreign travel in certain circumstances. When to repeat a risk assessment The risk assessment should be administered at least once. Persons can be screened for new risk factors at subsequent preventive health visits . Tuberculosis Risk Assess ment Guide - Adults IGRA preference in BCG vaccinated persons Because IGRA tests have increased specificity for TB infection in persons vaccinated with BCG, an IGRA is preferred over the tuberculin skin test ( TST) in these persons. Most persons born outside the U.S. have been vaccinated with BCG. Previous or inactive tuberculosis Chest x -ray findings consistent with previous or inac- tive TB include fibrosis or non -calcified nodules, but not include a solitary calcified nodule or isolated pleural thickening. Persons with a previous chest x-ray showing findings consistent with pre vious or in active TB should be tested for TB infection and evaluate d for active TB dis- ease. A negative test for TB does not rule out active TB disease It is important to remember that a negative IGRA or TST result does not rule out active TB disease . In fact, a negative IGRA or TST in a patient with active TB dis- ease can be a sign of extensive disease and poor out- come. Symptoms that should trigger evaluation for active TB disease Patients with any of the following symptoms that are otherwise unexplained should be evaluated for active TB disease : cough for more than two to three weeks, fever , night sweats, weight loss, and hemoptysis. How to evaluate for active TB disease Evaluate for active TB disease with a chest x -ray, symptom screen, and - if indicated - sputum AFB smears, cultures and nucleic acid amplification test- ing. A negative IGRA or TST does not rule out active TB disease. Most patients with LTBI should be treated Persons with risk factors who test positive for TB in- fection should generally be treated once active TB dis- ease has been ruled out. However, clinicians should not feel compelled to treat persons who have no risk factors but test positive for TB infection . Emphasis on short course treatment of LTBI Shorter regimens for treating LTBI have been shown to be as effective as 9 months of isoniazid and are more likely to be completed. Use of these shorter reg- imens is preferred in most patients. Drug -drug inter- actions and contact to drug -resistant TB are typical reasons these regimens cannot be used . Additional studies are needed to understand the safety of 3HP during pregnancy. Shorter duration treatment regimens Medication Frequency Duration Isoniazid + rifapentine (3HP) Weekly 12 weeks1 Rifampin Daily 4 months2 1 11-12 doses must be taken in 16 weeks for treatment completion 2 120 doses must be completed in 6 months for treat- ment completion Current recommendations concerning the admin- istration of 3HP are available on our website . Patient refusal of recommended LTBI treat- ment Refusal should be documented. Recommendations for treatment should be made at future encounters with medical services. If treatment is later accepted, TB disease should be ex cluded, and a chest x -ray repeated if it has been more than six months since the initial evaluation, or more than three months if there is immunosuppression, or the prior chest x -ray was abnormal and consistent with potentially active TB disease.

Provider: ________________________________________ Assessment Date: ________________________________ Pediatric Tuberculosis (TB) Risk Assessment Guide Special considerations for young children Children less than 5 years of age exposed to an infec- tious case of TB should receive TB testing and a full medical evaluation. An IGRA may be us ed in children 2 years of age and older . Regardless of the IGRA or TST result, a chest x -ray should be done to r ule out active TB disease. Children less than 5 years of age exposed to an infec- tious case of TB typically receive window prophylaxis treatment to prevent an early yet undetectable TB in- fection from rapidly developing into TB disease. Chil- dren less than 2 years of age are significantly more likely than adolescents or adults to progress to active TB disease after infection and to develop life -threat- ening disease such as TB meningitis Clinicians evaluating children for latent TB infection (LTBI) or active TB disease are strongly encouraged to contact the TB Program at 717 -787-6267 to request a medical consultation with the state pediatric TB con- sultant. Avoid testing children at low risk Routine testing of children without risk factors is not recommended and may result in unnecessary evalua- tions and treatment because of falsely positive test results. Mandated testing Certain populations may be mandated for testing by statute, regulation, or policy. This risk assessment does not supersede any mandated testing for stu- dents, residents in congregate settings and others. Testing can also be considered in children with fre- quent exposure to adults at high risk of TB infection , such as those with extensive foreign tra vel in areas with high TB rates. Patients with LTBI should be treated Children with risk factors who test positive for TB in- fection should be treated once active TB disease has been ruled out with a physical exam, chest x -ray and - if indicated - sputum smears, cultures and nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) . However, clinicians should not feel compelled to treat children who have no risk factors but test positive for TB infection . When to repeat a risk assessment and testing Risk assessment s should be completed for ne w pedi- atric patients , children thought to have new potential exposures to TB since the last assessment, and during routine pediatric well -child visits. Repeat risk assessments should be based on the activities and ri sk factors specific to the child. Children who volunteer or work in health care settings might require annual test- ing and should be considered separately. Retesting should only be done in children who previ- ously tested negative and have new risk factors since the last assessment (unless the y were less than 6 months of age at the time of testing). In general, new risk factors would include new close contact with an infectious TB case , new immunosupp ression, a close family member with a newly positive TB test result , or even foreign travel (see \"Foreign Travel or Resi- dence\") . Immunosuppression The exact level of immunosuppression that predis- poses to increased risk for TB progression is unknown. The threshold of steroid dose and duration used in the Pediatric TB Risk Assessment are based on data in adults and in accordance with recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for live vaccines in children receiving immuno- suppression. Foreign travel or residence Travel or residence in countries with an elevated TB rate may increase the risk for TB exposure in certain circumstances (e.g., extended duration, likely contact with persons with infectious TB, high prevalence of TB in travel location, non -tourist travel). The duration of at least one consecutive month to trigger testing is in- tended to identify travel or residence most likely to involve TB exposure . TB screening tests c an be falsely negative within eight weeks after exposure, so results are best obtained 8 eight weeks after a child's return. IGRA preference in non-U.S. born children 2 years of age or older Because IGRAs have increased specificity for TB infec- tion in children vaccinated with BCG, an IGRA is pre- ferred over the tuberculin skin test (TS T) for non -U.S. born children 2 years of age and older. IGRAs can be used in chil dren less than 2 years of age, but there is an overall lack of data in this age group, which com- plicates the in terpretation of test results. In BCG vac- cinated immunocompetent children with a positive TST, it may be appropriate to confirm a positive TST with an IGRA. If an IGRA is not d one the TST result should be considered the definitive result. Pediatric Tuberculosis Risk Assess ment Guide A negative test for TB does not rule out active TB disease It is important to remember that a negative IGRA or TST result does not rule out active TB disease . A neg- ative IGRA or TST in a patient with active TB disease can be a sign of extensive disease . Any suspicion for active TB disease or extensive exposure to TB should prompt an evaluation for active TB disease, including physical exam, symptom review, and two -view chest x-ray. Emphasis on short course treatment of LTBI Shorter regimens for treating LTBI have been shown to be as effective as 9 months of isoniazid and are more likely to be completed. Use of these shorter reg- imens is preferred in most patients, although the 12 - week regimen is not recommended for children less than 2 years of age or children on antiretroviral med- ications. Drug -drug interactions and contact to drug - resistant TB are other contra -indications for shorter regimens. Additional studies are needed to under- stand the safety of 3HP in pregnancy. Shorter duration treatment regimens Medic ation Isoniazid Rifampin Daily 4 months2 1 11-12 doses must be taken in 16 weeks for treatment completion 2 120 doses must be completed in 6 months for treat- ment completion Current recommendations concerning the admin- istration of 3HP are available at www.health.pa.gov on the tuberculosis program page for health care pro- viders. Refusal of recommended LTBI treatment Refusal should be documented . Recommendations for treatment should be made at future encounters with medical services. If treatment is later accepted, TB disease should be excluded, and a chest x -ray repeated if it has been more than six months from the initial evaluation for child ren 5 years of age and older and three months for children less than 5 years of age . Symptoms that should trigger evaluation for active TB disease Patients with any of the following symptoms that are otherwise unexplained should be evaluated for active TB disease : cough for more than two to three weeks, fever , night sweats, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, hemoptysis or excessive fatigue Resources Fact sheets for the LTBI regimens 3HP, rifampin alone and isoniazid alone are available at: https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/ltbi.htm Information about the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation to use an IGRA to test children 2 years of age and older is available at : https://redbook.solutions.aap.org/chapter.aspx?sectionid =189640207&bookid=2205 The Pennsylvania Pediatric Risk Assessment form is available on our website .

The injection should be made with a disposable 27 -guage tuberculin syringe, intradermally (just below the surface of the skin), with the needle bevel facing upward. This should produce a discrete, pale elevation of the skin (a wheal) , 6 mm to 10 m m in diameter (see Figure 3). Institutional infection control guidelines (e.g., the use of gloves) should be followed. Figure 3: Administering the TST READING THE TST The reaction to the TST should be read by a healthcare worker trained to read TST results 48 to 72 hours after the test was placed. Reactions to PPD usually begin 5 to 6 hours after injection, reach a maximum at 48 to 72 hours, and subside over a period of a few days. Positive reactions, however, often persist for up to a week or longer. Never ask a patient to read his or her own skin test. Pennsylvania TB Manual 11B-2 11B-Tuberculin Skin Test January 2020 The TST is read by palpating the site of the injection to find an area of induration (firm swelling). The diameter of the induration should be measured ACROSS the forearm (see Figures 4.1 and 4.2). Induration should always be measured and recorded in milli meters. If no induration is found, \"0 mm\" should be recorded. Figure 4.1: Reading the TST Correctly This is correct - only the induration is being measured . The correct example below measures 10 mm. Figure 4.2: Reading the TST Incorrectly This is incorrect - the erythema is being measured. The incorrect example below measures 30 mm. Pennsylvania TB Manual 11B-3 11B-Tuberculin Skin Test January 2020 INTERPRETING TST REA CTIONS The interpretation of TST reactions depends on the measurement (in millimeters) of induration and the person's risk of acquiring latent TB infection or the risk of progression to TB disease if infected (see Table 2). Table 2: Interpreting the TST Reaction Pennsylvania TB Manual 11B-4 11B-Tuberculin Skin Test January 2020 TST FALSE -POSITIVE A ND FALSE -NEGATIVE RE ACTIONS Several factors can lead to false -positive or false -negative reactions with the TST skin test as listed below. Table 3: False -Positive and False -Negative Reactions to the TST Pennsylvania TB Manual 11C-1 11C - 2016 Guidelines for January 2020 the Diagnosis of TB CHAPTER 11, APPENDIX C: GUIDELIN ES RE: DIAGNOSIS OF TB IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN In December 2016, a taskforce supported by the American Thoracic Society (ATS), Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the CDC - with participation by Fellows of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) - issued updated clinical practice guidel ines for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children. Overall, the ATS/IDSA/CDC guidelines are based on the likelihood of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and the likelihood of progression to TB disease as illustrated in Figure 1, below. Figure 1: Paradigm for Evaluation of Those with TB Infection Based on Risk of Infection, Risk of Progression to Tuberculosis, and Benefit of Therapy Groups with Increased Likelihood of Infection with Mtb Benefit of Therapy TB Infection Testing Strategy Household contact or recent exposure to an active case Yes Likely to be infected Low to intermediate risk of progression (TST > 10mM) Likely to be inf ected High risk of progression (TST > 5mM) Mycobacteriology laboratory personnel Not demonstrated Immigrants from high -burden countries (>20 cases per 100,000) Not demonstrated Residents and employees of high -risk congregate settings Yes None Not demonstrated Unlikely to be infected (TST > 15mM) Risk of Developing TB if Infected Low Intermediate (RR 1.3 - 3) High (RR 3 - 10) No Risk factors Clinical predisposition: Diabetes Chronic renal failure Intravenous drug use Children less than age 5 years HIV infection Immunosuppressive therapy Abnormal CXR consistent with prior TB Silicosis Benefit of Therapy Not demonstrated Yes Risk of Infection Pennsylvania TB Manual 11C-2 11C - 2016 Guidelines for January 2020 the Diagnosis of TB Note: In developing a diagnostic approach for the evaluation of those with suspected TB infection, (the taskforce) recommends the physician weigh the likelihood of infection, the likelihood of progression to tuberculosis if infected, and the benefit o f therapy (Horsburg and Rubin, Clinical practice: Latent tuberculosis infection in the United States. N Engl J Med 2011; 364: 1441 - 8). Recommendations were formulated for each of the 3 groups illustrated above. These groups are concordant with current recommendatio ns for the interpretation of the tuberculin skin test (American Thoracic Society; Targeted tuberculin testing and treatment of latent 2000; 49:1 -51). Pennsylvania TB Manual 11C-3 11C - 2016 Guidelines for January 2020 the Diagnosis of TB The guidelines also provide testing strategies using either the I GRA blood test or the TST. In June 2018 - eighteen months after the ATS/IDSA/CDC guidelines were published - the 31st edition of the American Academy of Pediatrics Red Book was issued. The updated Red Book included the following recommendations for testing infants or children: For children 2 years of age or older, either an interferon gamma -release assay (IGRA) blood tes t or a TST can be used. An IGRA is preferred for children who: o have had the Bacille Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine (to avoid a false -positive TST result caused by a previous BCG vaccination), and/or o are unlikely to return for a TST to be read. For childre n younger than 2 years of age the tuberculin skin test (TST) is the preferred test for the detection of M. tuberculosis infection. A chest X -ray (CXR) should be done to rule out active TB, regardless of the TST/IGRA result. A negative TST or IGRA TB test d oes not rule out a diagnosis of TB. Figure 2 on the following page reflects both the 2016 ATS/IDSA/CDC guidelines and the 2018 Red Book recommendations for testing children. Pennsylvania TB Manual 11C-4 11C - 2016 Guidelines for January 2020 the Diagnosis of TB Figure 2: Summary of Recommendations for Testing for TB Infection Group Testing Strategy ATS/IDSA/CDC 2016 Guidelines AAP 2018 Red Book Likely to be infected High risk of progression (TST > 5mM) Adults Acceptable: IGRA Preferred: IGRA Acceptable: IGRA or TST Consider testing with an IGRA and a TST where a positive result from either test would be considered positive2 Children <2 years of age3 Preferred: TST Acceptable: IGRA (in BCG vaccinated children) Acceptable: IGRA or TST Likely to be infected Low to intermediate risk of progression (TST > 10mM) Preferred: IGRA where available Acceptable: be infected (TST > 15mM) Testing for TB infection is not recommended necessary: Preferred: IGRA Acceptable: IGRA or TST Consider dual testing where a positive result from either test would be considered negative4 1 In the 2016 testing guidelines issued by the ATS, IDSA, and the CDC, the TST was listed as the preferred test for children < 5 years of age. In the American Academy of Pediatricians (AAP) Red Book published in June 2018, however, the AAP listed the TST as the preferred test for children < 2 years of age. The above chart reflects the updated AAP recommendation. 2 Performing a second diagnostic test when the initial test is negative is a strategy to increase sensitivity. This may reduce specificity, but the taskforce decided that this is an acceptable trade -off in situations in which the consequences of missing a diagnosis of TB infection (i.e., not treating individuals who may benefit from therapy) exceed the consequences of inappropriate (i.e., hepatotoxici ty). 3 In the 2016 testing guidelines issued by the ATS, IDSA, and the CDC, the TST was listed as the preferred test for children < 5 years of age. In the American Academy of Pediatricians (AAP) Red Book published in June 2018, however, the AAP listed the TST as the preferred test for children < 2 years of age. The above chart reflects the updated AAP recommendation. 4 Performing a confirmatory test after an initial positive result is based upon both the evidence that false -positive results are common among individuals not likely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb ) and the committee's presumption that pe rforming a second test on those patients whose initial test was positive will help identify false -positive results. Pennsylvania TB Manua l: ber 2021 CHAPTER 11, APPENDIX D Page intentionally left blank Pennsylvania TB Manua l 11E-1 11E - Implementing Targeted Testing Novem ber 2021 CHAPTER 11, APPENDIX E: IMPLEMENTING TARGETED TESTING The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ha s estimated that over 85% of new TB cases are due to progression from latent TB infection (LTBI) to TB disease. Treating LTBI - particularly in individuals with a one or more risk factors for progression to TB disease - prevents TB disease. The Pennsylvania TB program encourages local jurisdictions to develop and implement pilot targeted testing program s with community partners who serve or employ individuals at increased risk of TB . Initially , it may be most beneficial to conduct pilot programs in jurisdictions : With a TB morbidity rate above the state average , and/or Where there are clear opportunities for building relationships with community partners such as federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and agricultural business es that employ seasonal migrant workers . The kno wledge and experience gained from pilot programs can then be shared, summarized, and applied to additional targeted testing programs across the state . The Pennsylvania TB Program has developed the following Quick Start Checklist to ass ist local jurisdictions in designing and implementing a pilot targeted testing program . The checklist is based on several resources including a guide de veloped by the Curry International TB Center, a CDC TB Center of Excellence ; the experience of TB programs in Colorado, Houston , and Genesee and Orleans counties in western New York as shared during the 2021 National TB Controllers Association (NTCA) conference ; and input from high morbi dity jurisdictions in Pennsylvania . BACKGROUND Before proceeding to the Quick Start Checklist, review the following information about groups and individuals at increased risk of TB. Non-U.S. Born Individuals Over the past several years , 75% or more of new TB cases in Pennsylvania were in persons born outside the U.S. In 2019, the eight most frequently reported birth countries for non-U.S. born TB cases diagnosed in Pennsylvania were India, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Liberia, Pakistan, and the Dominican Republic. However, t he countries list ed can shift from year to year due to major changes in migration patterns . Non-U.S. born persons enter ing the U.S. using a nonimmigrant visa are not tested for TB prio r to U.S entry. In contrast, immigrant s and refugee s seeking permanent residence in the U.S. are tested for TB prior to U.S. entry . For more information, refer to Chapter 15 of this manual, titled : B1 And B2 Electronic Disease Notifications (EDNs). Pennsylvania TB Manua l 11E-2 11E - Implementing Targeted Testing Novem ber 2021 According to the CDC, about 5 to 10% of persons with untre ated LTBI will develop TB disease at some time in their lives. About half the people who develop TB will do so within the first two years after being infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), but individuals can progress from LTBI to disease at any time. As shown in the following bar chart, U.S. data reported by the CDC indicate that among non-U.S. born persons diagnosed with TB disease in 2019 : \u00ad 42% were diagnosed less than 10 years after U.S. arrival , \u00ad 47% were diagnosed 10 or more years after arrival , and \u00ad The U.S. arrival date was unknown for 12% of the non -U.S. born cases . TB and Diabetes Up to 30% of persons with diabetes and untreated LTBI will progress to TB disease in their lifetime. The percentage is higher for those diabetics whose blood sugar levels are poorly controlled (e.g., an A1c greater than 9%1). Diabetics who develop TB disease often have atypical presentations, a longer period of infectiousness, and more drug -drug interactions . The risk of TB relapse in diabetics is 4 times higher than for persons without diabetes. The risk of death while being treated for TB is nearly 5 times higher in diabetics than in persons without diabetes. TB and HIV Persons with untreated LTBI and untreated HIV infection have a 7 to 10% chance per year of develop ing TB disease. Among people with latent TB infection, untreated HIV infection with low CD4 counts is the strongest known risk factor for progressing to TB disease. A diagnosis of TB disease in a person with HIV infection meets the definition of Stage 3 HIV2, formerly known as acquired immune defici ency syndrome . Children \"A diagnosis of LTBI or T B disease in a young child is a public health sentinel event often representing recent transmission \"3. There is a very high risk of progression from LTBI to TB disease in infants, often leading to very serious and debilitating disease. The risk of progression is generally low in 1 As defined in the Uniform Data System Reporting Requirements for 2021 Health Center Data , page 121 2 https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6303a1.htm#Appendix 3 Red Book: 2021 -2024 Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases , American Academy of Pediatrics , Kimberlin DW, Barnett ED, Lynfield R, Sawyer MH, eds. 786 -814 < 1 yr. = 14% 1 = 17% 5 -9 yrs. = 11% 10-19 yrs. = 17% > 20 yrs = = 12% Pennsylvania TB Manua l 11E-3 11E - Implementing Targeted Testing Novem ber 2021 children ages 5 -10 years (sometimes referred to as the \"safe school years\") the n rises during adolescence, though not to the level seen in infancy4. Children with any of the following conditions are at increased risk of progression from LTBI to TB disease: HIV infection, Hodgkin disease, lymphoma, diabetes, chronic renal failure, and malnutrition . Treatment with the following medications also increases the risk of progression from LTBI to TB disease : prolonged or high -dose corticosteroid therapy, chemotherapy, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF -alpha) antagonist . Other Considerations There can be an increased risk of TB infection in congregate settings such as nursing homes, shelters, and correctional facilities , and in Pennsylvania these facilities are required to have and carry out TB testing protocols. Similarly, the Pennsylvania Public School Code mandates certain school health services, including TB testing upon entry to the school s ystem (in kindergarten or first grade) and again in ninth grade. School districts can request a modification to either exempt the district from testing students for TB or modify the requirement, e.g., to test newly arrived students from all foreign countri es or just those countries classified by the World Health Organization as having a high incidence of TB. Regardless, if there are districts where students are known to frequently travel outside the U.S., it may be beneficial for local health department personnel to meet with school district leadership to discuss TB testing of students upon their return from countries with a high incidence of TB. 4 Marais BJ, Gie RP, Schaaf HS, Hesseling AC, Obihara CC, et al.

Children 2 years and older can be tested with either the TST or the interferon gamma -release assay (IGRA) blood test. However, due to the high incidence of fals e-positive TSTs in persons with a history of Bacille Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination, an IGRA blood test is preferred over a TST for children 2 years of age and older previously vaccinated with BCG. Pennsylvania TB Manual 12-1 12- Laboratory Services January 2020 Chapter 1 2: Laboratory Services INTRODUCTION PURPOSE Use this chapter to get contact information for laboratories , determine which tests are available and the tests' turnaround times and identify the appropriate laboratory to perform specific test s. The diagnosis of TB, management of patients with the disease, and public health TB control services rely on accurate lab oratory tests. Laboratory services are an essential component of effective TB control, providing key information to clinicians (for patient care) and public health agencies (for control services). POLICY Public health laboratories should ensure that clinic ians and public health agencies within their jurisdictions have ready access to reliable laboratory tests for diagnosis and treatment of TB. Effective TB control requires timely, complete, and accurate communication among the laboratory system, TB Program, and healthcare provider. Reporting requirements: Healthcare practitioners and healthcare facilities must report within five days any suspected or confirmed active TB disease from all sites after being identified by symptoms, appearance, or diagnosis. A person in charge of a clinical laboratory in which a laboratory test of a specimen derived from a human body yields results significant from a public health standpoint shall promptly report the findings no later than the next work day after the close of b usiness on the day on which the test was completed. This includes: positive AFB smears, cultures, nucleic acid amplification tests and results of drug susceptibility testing.

SPECIMEN COLLECTION Sputum is phlegm from deep in the lungs. The important characteristics needed in sputum specimens are freshness and actual sputum, rather than saliva. An early morning specimen is best, so when collecting a set of three sputum specimens, at least one of them should be an early morning specimen. To isolate mycobacteria from clinical materials successfully, handle specimens carefully after collecti on. For optimal results, collect specimens in clean, sterile containers and keep them in conditions that inhibit the growth of contaminating organisms, since most specimens will contain bacteria other than mycobacteria. Refer to Table 3 to review the metho ds used to collect various specimens and the type of specimens obtained for pulmonary TB. During procedures in which aerosols may be produced, use appropriate respiratory protection and environmental controls. For more information, refer to the CDC's \"Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health - care Settings, 2005\" ( MMWR 2005;54[No. RR -17]) at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5417.pdf . TABLE 3: SPECIMEN COLLECTION METHODS AND TYPES FO R PULMONARY TB Pulmonary Tuberculosis Collection Method Specimen Type Spontaneous sputum collection occurs when the patient can cough up sputum without extra assistance. 5-10 ml of sputum from deep in the lung Induced sputum collection should be considered if a patient needs assistance in bringing up sputum.* 5-10 ml of sputum from deep in the lung Gastric aspirates can be submitted for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in young children who cannot produce sputum. 15 ml of gastric contents Consult laboratory for special collection and handling process Must be neutralized with sodium bicarbonate. Bronchoscopy can be used in the following situations: If a patient cannot produce sputum by the above three methods ; If a patient has a substantial risk of drug -resistant TB and has initial routine studies t hat are ; Bronchial washings Bronchoalveolar lavage Transbronchial biopsy Pennsylvania TB Manual 12-5 12- Laboratory Services January 2020 Pulmonary Tuberculosis Collection Method Specimen Type In a patient in whom there is suspicion of endobronchial TB; or If a variety of clinical specimens for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB or other possible diseases need to be obtained . * It is important to specify if the sputum is induced or not, because induced sputum is \"more watery\" and appears to be just saliva. Some laboratories may throw out induced sputum and report it as an inadequate specimen.

Please complete all the sections including the date of birth. It is especially important to specify if the sputum is induced or not, because an induced sputum generally is \"more watery\" and appears to be just saliva. Some private laboratories may throw out the specimen and report it as an \"inadequate specimen.\" 1. Indicate type(s) of testing requested. 2. Make sure the specimen and laboratory requisition are packaged into appropriate shipping containers, per laboratory instructions. 3. If possible, send the specimen on the day it is collected. If this is not possible, refrigerate the specimen until it is sent on the next day. 4. Do not keep specimens to send all three on the same day. Make every effort to submit specimens to the laboratory w ithin 24 hours of collection. Normal flora can overgrow any mycobacteria in the specimen and make it unusable. If specimens cannot be submitted within 24 hours, keep in mind that most laboratories will not run a specimen more than five days old. Know how l ong it takes the specimen to get to the laboratory from the time it leaves your hands and submit specimens accordingly. HOW TO DIRECT A PATI ENT TO PERFORM SPONT ANEOUS SPUTUM COLLEC TION AT HOME If a patient will be collecting sputum specimens at home, provide the following guidance: Put a mark at the 5 ml level on the sputum tubes (if not already marked) to show the patient the minimum amount of sputum needed. (Most laboratories consider 5 to 10 ml an adequate amount.) Review with the patient how to co llect sputum. Make arrangements for a healthcare worker to pick up the specimen or for the patient, a family member, or a friend to drop off the specimen. Pennsylvania TB Manual 12-9 12- Laboratory Services January 2020 Click here to see a pictorial explanation of the proper method for collecting sputum . INDUCED SPUTUM COLLE CTION AT A HEALTHCAR E FACILITY If the patient cannot produce sputum spontaneously, arrange for induced sputum to be collected at a facility. Facilities where sputum can be collected in clude the respiratory therapy department of a local hospital, TB clinic, or laboratory. Facilities should have appropriate respiratory protection, environmental controls, and policies and procedures. HOW TO COLLECT GASTR IC ASPIRATES This information is provided for guidance to private healthcare professionals. The following are basic guidelines for collecting gastric aspirates: Collect the specimen after the patient has fasted for 8 to 10 hours and, preferably, while the patient is still i n bed. Collect a specimen daily for three days. For additional information on how to collect a gastric aspirate and prepare the specimen for transport, see the guide and Francis J. Curry National Tuberculosis Center's online video Pediatric TB: A Guide to the Gastric Aspirate (GA) Procedure, please copy and paste this link in your browse r: http://www.currytbcenter.ucsf.edu/catalogue/epub/index.cfm?tableName=GAP BRONCHOSCOPY OR COLL ECTION OF EXTRAPULMO NARY SPECIMENS If TB staff are consulting with physicians before the specimens are collected, the physician should be reminded to send part of the specimen (not in formalin) to the microbiology laboratory for AFB smear and culture, in addition to any other tests or patho logy examinations the physician plans to obtain . (Note: if a specimen is placed in formalin, then a pathology test must be requested via the BOL; refer to Table 2 in this chapter.) In addition, a post -bronchoscopy sputum specimen should be sent for AFB sme ar and culture. Bronchoscopy: Refer the patient to a local specialist. Extrapulmonary specimens: These specimens will be collected by the physician performing the diagn ostic work -up. DOH is responsible for the testing of TB specimens only. Routine bacteriology culture and susceptibility testing must be performed at clinical laboratory. SPECIMEN SHIPMENT There are three main categories of transportation methods: medical couriers, ground transportation, and air transportation. Category B In fectious Substances (raw diagnostic specimens, such as sputum, blood, or tissue) can be mailed through the US Postal Service (USPS), shipped by private carrier (e.g., Federal Express, Airborne Express, etc.), or Pennsylvania TB Manual 12-10 12- Laboratory Services January 2020 transported by a medical courier. Tuberculos is mycobacterium cultures (or culture isolates suspected of being mycobacteria) are Category A Infectious Substances and can be transported only by a medical courier or shipped by private carrier as dangerous goods. Category A Infectious Substances cannot be mailed through the US Postal Service. Each category requires different packaging requirements to provide increased levels of protection against leaks and contamination. For more information, contact TB lab supervisor, PA State Laboratory at 610 -280- 3464.

January 2020 Chapter 1 3: TB Surveillance in Pennsylvania INTRODUCTION PURPOSE This chapter includes information about: The importance of surveillance in TB prevention and control , When to report suspected and confirmed cases of TB , The role of genotyping in TB surveillance , and PA-NEDSS BACKGROUND In public health, surveillance refers to the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, interpretation and reporting of data about a health -related event. In the U.S., the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) facilitates the transfer of public health surveillance data from the healthcare system to public health departments. In Pennsylvania, TB surveillance data is entered in and reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevent ion (CDC) from Pennsylvania's version of the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (PA -NEDSS). The data elements collected in PA -NEDSS are based on the Report of a Verified Case of TB (RVCT) form developed by the CDC. Currently, data about the d iagnosis and treatment of latent TB infection (L TBI) is reportable to the CDC for just two groups - contacts to active cases of TB and immigrants and refugees with a B2 medical classification. It is the responsibility of private healthcare providers to rep ort suspected or confirmed cases of active TB disease in accordance with 28 Pa Code \u00a7 27.21a. Public health staff shall process electronic reports and enter TB case data in PA -NEDSS on a timely basis. Many laboratories also report TB diagnostic data direct ly into PA -NEDSS. State TB program personnel are responsible for reviewing PA -NEDSS case data for accuracy and completeness, patient de -duplication, merging investigations, managing out -of-state reports, updating the questionnaires as needed, counting cases that meet the criteria for TB disease and closing counted TB cases once all available data ha s been entered and transmitted to CDC. Every Sunday night (or per request) information entered in PA -NEDSS on any new or revised counted TB case since the previous Sunday is automatically downloaded to the CDC. Pennsylvania TB Manual 13-2 13 - TB Surveillance in Pa. January 2020 TB surveillance data is used on local, state and national levels to: Determine TB patterns and trends; Identify potential tuberculosis (TB) outbreaks, recent transmission of TB, multi -drug resistance, and deaths; Identify high -risk populations and settings; Establish priorities for prevention and control activities; and Strategically plan the use of limited hu man and financial resources. Surveillance data is also used to evaluate whether quality standards are being met, determine the effectiveness of health programs, and measure progress toward TB elimination. LAWS AND REGULATIONS Pennsylvania laws and regulati ons related to TB reporting are included in 28 Pa. Code \u00a7 27.21a, \u00a7 27.22, and \u00a727.4, which can be viewed at https://www.pacode.com/secure/data/028/chapter27/subchapBtoc.html . CASE DEFINITIONS In the fourth quarter of each year, the CDC issues its summary of Reported Tuberculosis Cases in the United States for the previous calendar year. The appendices to that report include \"Tuberculosis Case Definition for Public Health Surv eillance\" (Appendix A) and \"Recommendations for Reporting and Counting Tuberculosis Cases\" (Appendix B). Both are helpful resources for public health personnel involved in reporting and/or counting tuberculosis cases. Clinical Case Definition Appendix A of the CDC annual report of TB cases defines a clinical case of TB as a case that meets ALL the following criteria: A positive tuberculin skin test (TST) result or a positive interferon gamma release assay for M. tuberculosis ; Other signs and sy mptoms compatible with TB (e.g., abnormal chest radiograph, abnormal chest computerized tomography scan or other chest imaging study, or clinical evidence of current disease) ; Treatment with two or more anti -TB medi cations ; and A completed diagnostic evaluation . Pennsylvania TB Manual 13-3 13 - TB Surveillance in Pa. January 2020 Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis Appendix A of the CDC annual report defines the laboratory criteria for diagnosis as any one of the following: Isolation of M. tuberculosis complex from a clinical specimen ;1 Demonstration of M. tuberculosis complex from a clinical specimen by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)2; or Demonstration of an acid -fast bac illi in a clinical specimen when a culture has not been obtained, cannot be obtained or is falsely negative or contaminated. A confirmed case of TB is a case that meets the clinical case definition or is laboratory confirmed. Within the two types of case definitions, cases are further classified by morbidity verification. Morbidity verifications identify the criteria used to determine that the definition of a confirmed case of TB is met. Morbidity verifications for a clinical case of TB are clinical cas e definition or provider certified/diagnosed at clinic. Morbidity verifications that meet the laboratory criteria for diagnosis are: positive culture, positive nucleic acid amplification, and positive smear. REPORTING TUBERCULOS IS The CDC recommends immediate reporting of a suspected or confirmed case of TB to the jurisdictional health agency. In Pennsylvania, 28 Pa Code \u00a727.21a(b)(2) requires that suspected or confirmed cases of active TB disease (all sites) must be reported withi n five work days after being identified by symptoms, appearance or diagnosis. Reports may be submitted electronically via the PA - NEDSS or by calling the local state health center (SHC) or county or municipal health department (CMHD). For laboratories, 28 Pa Code \u00a727.22 requires that a person who is in charge of a clinical laboratory in which a laboratory test of a specimen derived from a human body yields results significant from a public health standpoint shall promptly report the findings no later than the next work day after the close of business on the day on which the test was completed. This includes confirmation of positive s mears or cultures and results of drug susceptibility testing. TB is suspected in a patient who 1) has had recent contact with a person known to have active TB or 2) who has signs and symptoms of active TB (such as a persistent cough that lasts for two or more weeks) and is currently undergoing a medical evaluation for TB. For more information about reporting TB, see TABLE 1: REPORTING C ONFIRMED OR SUSPECTED CASES OF T B. Pennsylvania TB Manual 13-4 13 - TB Surveillance in Pa. January 2020 TABLE 1: REPORT ING CONFIRMED OR SUSPECT ED CASES OF TB What Condition/ Test Result Who Reports When to Report How to Report Confirmed or suspected cases of TB disease. Confirmation by laboratory tests is not required. This includes pulmonary and extra - pulmonary cases. TB clinicians Other healthcare providers Hospitals Other similar private or public institutions Anyone providing treatment to the confirmed or suspected case Note: The attending TB clinician or other healthcare provider must report even if the laboratory is also reporting the test results. Suspected or confirmed active cases (all sites) must be reported within 5 work days after being identified by symptoms, appearan ce or diagnosis. Information can be called in or faxed to the local SHC or CMHD. An on -line report can be made www.nedss.state.pa.us Sputum smears positive probes positive (Mtb) complex All laboratories that perform TB testing In-state laboratories that send specimens for out -of-state testing Note: The l aboratory must report even if the attending TB clinician or other healthcare provider is also reporting. Promptly, no later than the next work day after the close of business on the day the test was completed. Test results can be reported via an electronic lab report (ELR) submitted to PA - NEDSS. An on -line report can be manually entered at www.nedss.state.pa.us Pennsylvania TB Manual 13-5 13 - TB Surveillance in Pa. January 2020 PA-NEDSS The Pennsylvania National Electronic Data Surveillance System (PA -NEDSS) is a w eb-based application that allows for the secure communication of laboratory results, clinical data, and the diagnosis and treatment of reportable health conditions between laboratories, hospitals, private medical practices and public health departments. Tu berculosis is specified in Pennsylvania Code Title 28, Chapter 27 as one of several reportable diseases in the state. Information documented in PA -NEDSS is used by the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH) to routinely submit reportable public health dat a to the CDC. PA-NEDSS is accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week via : https://www.nedss.state.pa.us . Access is limited to authorized users. All confirmed and suspected cases of TB must have a PA -NEDSS investigation initiated. The data elements collected in PA -NEDSS are based on the Report of a Verified Case of TB (RVCT) form developed by the CDC and constitute the basis for substantiating a ca se of TB. A PA-NEDSS investigation should also be initiated for all cases of LTBI diagnosed or treated in a SHC or CMHD . For information on how to initiate a TB investigation and the information required for a TB investigation in PA -NEDSS, please refer to the \"Tuberculosis Reference Guide\". The \"Tuberculosis Reference Guide\" can be located under \"Training Materials\" on the PA -NEDSS home screen after log in. MANAGING NON -ELECTRO NIC REPORTS IN PA -NEDSS All laboratory reports for suspected and confirmed cases of TB must be entered in PA -NEDSS. Health care professionals and laboratories who don't report directly into PA-NEDSS can use the laboratory report form to provide test results. Public health staff must enter into PA -NEDSS any hard copy reports not submi tted electronically by a provider or laboratory and retain a copy in the patient's chart. For tests performed at the BOL, results will be reported directly into PA -NEDSS and via fax to the submitting entity or health care professional. GENOTYPING In Augu st 2017, the CDC announced the establishment of the National Tuberculosis Molecular Surveillance Center (NTMSC) at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, which has done CDC -sponsored genotyping since the early 1990's. The NTMSC is part of th e CDC's Antibiotic Resistance Laboratory Network and began parallel testing of all Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with both conventional genotyping and whole genome sequencing (WGS) in 2018. WGS genome than conven tional genotyping. In 2021, after three years of parallel testing, WGS will become the standard method for analyzing patterns of transmission with the added benefit of the identification of recent transmission. Pennsylvania TB Manual 13-6 13 - TB Surveillance in Pa. January 2020 All U.S. TB programs can use the NTMSC at no cost to patients, healthcare providers, or health departments, but the isolates to be tested must be submitted via the state's public health laboratory. Therefore, an isolate for each case of culture positive TB in Pennsylvania should be sent to the Burea u of Laboratories (BOL) in Lionville (Exton). The BOL will then submit the isolates to the MDHHS for genotyping. Genotyping provides valuable information about the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and transmission of Mycobacterium TB (Mtb) . As a result, it is a key tool for TB programs in the early detection and control of TB outbreaks, the discovery of unsuspected relationships between cases, and the identification o f incorrect TB diagnoses based on false -positive test results. Note: One of the National TB Program Indicators Project (NTIP) objectives for 2025 is to increase the proportion of TB patients with a positive culture result who have a MTBC (Mycobacterium tub erculosis complex) genotyping result reported. Genotyping identifies specific strains of Mtb based on an analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). As mycobacteria reproduce, their DNA is typically reproduced without alteration from generation to generation . Over time, however, spontaneous mutations in DNA occur at a low frequency, ultimately resulting in the diversity of Mtb strains that we see today. The diversity of TB strain s and specificity of genotyping methods provide a means to: Determine whether TB cases with matching genotypes are part of the same transmission chain; Differentiate between reactivation - where a patient previously treated for and cured of TB has a subsequent episode of TB disease caused by the same strain of M. tuberculosis as the f irst episode - and reinfection - where a subsequent episode of TB disease is caused by a different strain of M. tuberculosis ; and Identify false positive M. tuberculosis cultures. It's estimated that about 2% of M. tuberculosis cultures are false positive s, usually due to mislabeling of the isolate or cross -contamination. When two or more M. tuberculosis isolates match by genotype they are referred to as a \"genotype cluster\". A \"cluster\" refers to the possibility that the cases may be transmission related and triggers an investigation to determine whether the patients share overlapping timeframes (i.e., dates and times) or physical locations (e.g., wor ksite, method of transportation, social gatherings) where TB transmission may have occurred. If not, then it's unlikely the patients are both part of the same transmission chain but may share an unidentified index case. Refer to Appendix A of this chapter for more information about cluster investigations. Genotyping can also identify strains of M. Bovis associated with Bacille Calmette -Guerin (BCG ), an attenuated vaccinate young children against TB meningitis or disseminated TB in countries with a high incidence of TB or 2) as a form of immunotherapy to treat bladder cancer. Such cases are often reported as Bovis BCG or attenu ated Bovis , identified by a spoligotype (a poly -morphism in the repeat units of DNA used to identify Mtb complex strains) ending in \"600\" and a MIRU (a rapid genotyping method using mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units) with \"x, y, or z\" as the seco nd character. Pennsylvania TB Manual 13-7 13 - TB Surveillance in Pa. January 2020 TB OUTBREAK In Module 9 of the Self -Study Modules on Tuberculosis, the CDC states that a \"TB outbreak is generally defined as a situation where there are more TB cases than expected within a geographic area or population during a particular time period, and there is evidence of recent transmission of M. tuberculosis among those cases\". The time period generally refers to a situation where TB transmission occurred within the previous 2 -year period, implying that patients who are part of an outbreak were exposed to an infectious case of TB in the recent past, not several years ago and then pro gressing over time from LTBI to TB disease. Because an outbreak indicates that there is ongoing - and possibly extensive - transmission of TB, a TB outbreak should always be considered a public health emergency. A potential outbreak is detected through th e following activities: Observations from public health staff and others in the community TB contact investigations TB case surveillance TB genotyping During these activities, public health staff should be alert for signs of more TB cases than expected and evidence of recent transmission among those cases. For more information about TB outbreaks, refer to Module 9 of the CDC Self -Study Modules on Tuberculosis at: https://www.cdc .gov/tb/education/ssmodules/pdfs/Module9.pdf . Top of Document or Top of Chapter 1 Use of rapid identification techniques for M. tuberculosis , such as DNA probes and mycolic acid high - pressure liquid chromatography performed on a culture from a clinical specimen, are acceptable under this criterion. 2 For clinical purposes, a NAAT must be accompanied by a culture for mycobacteria species. A culture isolate of M. tuberculosis complex is required for complete drug susceptibility testing and for genotyping. For surveillance purposes, CDC will accept result s from NAATs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and used according to the approved product labeling on the package insert, or a test produced and validated in accordance with applicable FDA and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment s (CLIA) regulations. Pennsylvania TB Manual 13A-1 13 - Cluster Investigations January 2020 CHAPTER 13, APPENDIX A: CLUSTER INVESTIG ATIONS A TB cluster is two or more cases of TB with matching genotypes in a specific geographic area over a particular period of time . In some cases, a TB cluster can cross several jurisdictions (cities or counties) and still be in relatively close proximity to qualify as a cluster. The purpose of a cluster investigation is to determine epidemiological linkages between the cases to pr event further transmission of TB. If the linkages between the cases are known, a cluster investigation is not necessary. Cluster investigations are initiated when one of the following occurs: The TB Program receives a cluster alert notification from the CDC's TB Genotyping Information Management System (TB GIMS ) The local jurisdiction or TB Program becomes aware of two or more cases with matching genotypes or PCR type and linkages are unknown If a jurisdiction becomes aware of two or more cases with matchi ng genotypes, the jurisdiction should alert the TB program manager who will initiate the cluster investigation. The jurisdiction should provide the PA -NEDSS investigation numbers and any known epidemiological links. The TB program manager will initiate t he following when notified of a cluster with unknown linkages: 1. Review genotyping results in TB GIMS to include running the national distribution report. 2. Complete a cluster investigation chart to include the following information from each PA-NEDSS investig ation: Patient initials NEDSS investigation number Accession number County of residence Street name Town/city Age at investigation Gender Date of diagnosis Date of US entry Country of birth Risk factors Occupation Reason evaluated Symptom onset/infectious start date Pennsylvania TB Manual 13A-2 13 - Cluster Investigations January 2020 Diagnostic test results Co-morbidities Health -care providers Other pertinent information as available 3. Look for evidence of laboratory contamination and discuss with the PA Department of Health Bureau of Laboratories (BOL) if war ranted. 4. Review investigations for any common contacts or locations. 5. Schedule a conference call to discuss the cases. Cluster investigation team members should include the assigned community/public health nurse and nurse supervisor, TB program manager, TB surveillance coordinator, TB medical consultant and BOL staff if appropriate. 6. Conduct the conference call as soon as possible, but no later than two weeks after receiving notification of a cluster. Participants on the call should: Briefly review each case and look for commonalities ; Determine if additional patient interviews need to be conducted ; and Identify next steps. The TB program manager will document next steps , identif y outcomes and disseminate to the call participants. 7. Participants will conduct follow -up activities as warranted and report outcomes back to the TB program manager. 8. Participants should document actions in PA -NEDSS investigation notes as it relates to each patient. 9. The TB program manager will update the clust er chart with new information, next steps and outcomes , and disseminate updates as the investigation progresses. 10. The TB program manager will conclude the cluster investigation by sending a final summary email regarding the outcome of the cluster investigation. Pennsylvania TB Manual 14-1 14 - Nontuberculous Mycobacteria January 4: Nontuberculosis Mycobacteria INTRODUCTION Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) occur naturally in the environment and are related to the bacteria that cause tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy. The highest concentrations of NTM bacteria are found in soil and water, including both natural and treated water sources. To date, more than 180 species of NTM have been identified . The number of identified species continues to increase due to improved culturing techniques in the mycobacteriology lab and more precise differentiation between individual NTM species. The top three most f requently reported NTM isolates in the U.S. are M. avium complex (MAC), M. kansasii , and M. abscessus . MAC organisms are the most common disease -causing NTM species. Most people exposed to NTM do not become sick, but persons who are immunocompromised or have existing lung disease are at increased risk for developing NTM disease. Persons with third stage human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection - known as acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS - are known to be at increased risk of NTM disease . However, now the prevalence of NTM disease appears to be increasing among people without AIDS and NTM infections are being seen in new settings with new clinical manifestations. The diagnosis of NTM may be challenging because the tuberculin skin test (TST) cannot distinguish between TB and NTM . Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) tests have greater specificity than a TST and are unaffected by most NTM bacteria but positive IGRA results have been documented in cases of infection with three specific types of NTM bacteria - M. kansasii , M. szulgai , and marinum . Some symptoms associated with TB and NTM are also commonly seen with other respiratory conditions including bronchiectasis, bronchitis, pneumonia and chronic ob structive pulmonary disease (COPD ). Though rare, patients can be infected with both TB and NTM and a specimen culture - which differentiates between TB and NTM at the species level - takes approximately 8 weeks . Once diagnosed, NTM treatment is typically managed by a pulmonolog ist or infectious disease specialist and requires several antibiotics and a minimum of 12 months of treatment. Like TB, NTM infections can occur throughout the body but the most common sites are the lungs, lymph nodes, and skin or soft tissues. In addition to pul monary disease, NTM may cause disseminated disease, lymphadenitis, and skin and soft tissue infections. Disseminated disease is most frequently seen in severely immunocompromised patients. Since NTM disease has not been shown to be transmissible, and curre nt communicable disease reporting laws are limited to M. tuberculosis or M. tuberculosis complex, NTM pulmonary disease is not reportable to the Pennsylvania Department of Health. Pennsylvania TB Manual 14-2 14 - Nontuberculous Mycobacteria January 2020 PATHOGENESIS Unlike TB, the precise mode of NTM transmission to humans has n ot been confirmed, but it is highly likely the bacteria are ingested or inhaled. No evidence of animal -to-human or human -to- human NTM transmission has been reported in the literature. Persons who are immunocompromised due to a medical condition (e.g. HIV) or immuno - suppressive treatment (e.g., TNF -alpha inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis) or who have preexisting lung disease or damage (e.g., bronchiectasis, COP D, or asthma) are at increased risk for developing NTM lung disease. In persons with HIV i nfection : MAC is the most common NTM organism causing pulmonary disease. Disseminated NTM infections may develop when CD4 T -lymphocyte levels fall below 50\u00b5l. It should be emphasized that most persons with NTM pulmonary disease are not HIV infected. NTM p ulmonary disease may present with clinical manifestations and a radiographic appearance like those for TB disease. DIAGNOSIS OF NTM DIS EASE Diagnosis of NTM disease is often delayed because current TB screening tests can't differentiate between TB and NTM , some symptoms for both diseases are also common to other respiratory conditions and a specimen culture - which differentiates between TB and NTM - takes approximately 8 weeks. Both prior Bacille Calmette -Guerin vaccination and NTM infection can yield a positive result with the tuberculin skin test (TST) when screening for TB . The package inserts for QuantiFERON (QFT) and T -Spot indicate both tests are unaffected by most NTM bacteria, but positive IGRA results have been documented in cases of infection with M. kansasii , M. szulgai , and M. marinum . One or more symptoms of TB and NTM disease - a persistent cough, fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, fever and less frequently shortnes s of breath and coughing up blood - are also seen with other respiratory conditions including bronchiectasis, bronchitis, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . For more information about the diagnosis of NTM disease, refer to t he 2007 ATS/IDSA guidelines titled \"Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention of Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Diseases\". A single sputum culture positive for NTM , especially one with a small number of organisms, is generally not enough to support a diagnosis of NTM lung disease . Clinical, radiographic and microbiologic criteria are equally important and all must be met to diagnose NTM lung disease. Any patient being treated as a pulmonary TB suspect, but not responding well to treatment , may be suspected of having T B and NTM co -infection or NTM lung disease alone, which can only be confirmed or ruled -out by a specimen culture . Pennsylvania TB Manual 14-3 14 - Nontuberculous Mycobacteria January RISK FACTORS FOR PUL MONARY NONTUBERCULOU S MYCOBACTERIAL DISE ASE Various host defense dynamics and immune defects are associated with NTM. Disseminated NTM is a manifestation of either an acquired or a genetic immunologic defect. Susceptibility to pulmonary NTM disease is poorly understood but associations include: 1. Genetic syndromes with specific mu tations in interferon -y and interleukin -2 2. Slender body type in post -menopausal women with features including thoracic scoliosis, pectus excavatum, and mitral valve prolapse 3. pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, and cystic fibr osis 5. Prior pulmonary TB TREATMENT The Pennsylvania Department of Health does not provide treatment for NTM infection . However, in those instances where patients are co-infected with TB disease and NTM, it is necessary to treat both conditions to ensure the successful treatment of TB. When a patient is co-infected with TB and NTM , the public health nurse and/or TB clinician should refer the patient to a pulmonologist or infectious disease specialist for the treatment of NTM. The treatment of NTM differs somewhat from the treatment of TB. The c hoice of the drug treatment regimen is optimally based on the identified NTM species, in vitro susceptibility testing, and clinical pre sentation. Drug regimens used in the treatment of pulmonary NTM disease may include a macrolide (e.g., clarithromycin or azithromycin ) as well as first - and second -line anti -TB medications. Table 1 lists examples o f drug regimen options for the treatment of the most common NTM species . It's important to know the common treatments for NTM disease in the event he or she is coordinating care for patients coinfected with TB and NTM. For more detailed inform ation about t he treatment of M. avium complex , M. kansasii and M. abscessus , see the section of the 2007 ATS/IDSA guidelines titled \"NTM Species: Clinical Aspects and Treatment Guidelines \". Pennsylvania TB Manual 14-4 14 - Nontuberculous Mycobacteria January 2020 TABLE 1: DRUG TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR NTM LUNG DISEASE NTM Species Treatment Guidelines for Pulmonary Disea se M. avium complex (MAC) Treat with a macrolide such as clarithromycin or azithromycin, with ethambutol and An injectable aminoglycoside such as streptomycin or Amikacin may be added in severe, previously treated, or cavitary disease. Macrolide -resistant disease requires extensive drug treatment, and consultation should be sought with an expert experienced in MAC therapy. M. kansasii For rifampin susceptible isolates, t reat and include a three -drug regimen to which the organism is susceptible. M. abscessus Consultation with experts is strongly recommended. Combination of surgical resection of focal disease combined with multidrug therapy (macrolide and one or more parental agent such as Amikacin, cefoxitin, or imipenem, in addition to oral agents) may increase the chance of cure. All patients receiving pulmon ary NTM treatment should have close clinical monitoring with frequent sputum examinations for mycobacterial culture throughout treatment. M. avium complex pulmonary disease treatment should be continue d until sputum cultures are consecutively negative for 12 months while on treatment. Since sputum conversion usually requires 3 to 6 months of treatment, the typical patient with MAC will be treated for 15 to 18 months. Patients on MAC treatment are likely t o respond best the first time they are treated ; for that reason, it is very important that patients receive the recommended multidrug therapy the first time they are treated for MAC. M. kansasii pulmonary disease treatment should also be continue d until s putum cultures are consecutively negative for 12 months while on treatment. Least responsive to treatment is disease due to M. abscessus , a rapidly growing NTM species that is resistant to the standard antituberculosis drugs. Currently the only predictably curative treatment of M. abscessus lung disease is surgical resection of the involved lung tissue combined with multidrug chemo therapy . NURSING IMPLICATIONS The community health nurse ( CHN ) can play a major role in the recogn ition of pulmonary NTM disease . It's common for patients suspected of having TB to begin treatment before the final culture results are available. However, if the patient is not responding to treatment , that may suggest that the patient has either NTM dise ase alone or TB and NTM disease co -infected with TB and NTM , the CHN may play an important role in encouraging compliance with the NTM treatment regimen. The lengthy regimen can be difficult, and poor compliance can lead to treatment failure . Pennsylvania TB Manual 14-5 14 - Nontuberculous Mycobacteria January 2020 No evidence of animal -to-human or human -to-human NTM transmission has been reported, and pulmonary NTM disease without TB does not pose a public health threat. Therefore, contact investigations are not needed for cases of NTM pulmonary disease and p ublic h ealth legal interventions such as health orders do not need to be considered . If the final culture report returns with the identification of NTM instead of TB, the public health nurse's responsibility for managing the patient's treatment ends, but it's strongly recommended that the community health nurse and/or the TB clinician refer the patient to the pulmonologist or infectious disease physician who will oversee the treatment of NTM disease.

Before leaving for the United States, these individuals are required to undergo medical examinations by overseas panel physicians following guidelines provided to the U.S. Department of State by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CD C is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Secretary of HHS has the \"statutory responsibility for preventing the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases into the United States\" .1 The purpose of the overseas medical examination is to identify whether the immigrant or refugee has a medical condition that would prevent him or her from entering the United States (Class A), or a medical condition that is admissible but that might requir e extensive medical treatment or follow -up (Class B). Class A conditions include , but are not limited to, a communicable disease of public health significance , such as active infectious tuberculosis (TB). Class B conditions include inactive, non-infectious pulmonary TB or extrapulmonary TB (B1) and latent TB infection (B2). Medical follow -up is recommended for individuals with a B1 or B2 condition upon their arrival in the U.S. Newly arriving immigrants and refugees with Class A and Class B medical conditio ns are required to provide a copy of their panel medical exam documents to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents . CBP personnel then submit the documents to the CDC quarantine station with jurisdiction for the specific U.S. port of entry. Within 24 to 48 hours, the quarantine statio n sends the forms to the CDC Electronic Disease Notification (EDN) system data entry center in Atlanta, Georgia. Once the information is recorded in the EDN system, notifications of B1 or B2 arrivals are sent electronically to the applicable state healt h department, which forwards the information to the appropriate local jurisdiction. In Pennsylvania, the local jurisdiction is a Pennsylvania Department of Health (PADOH) state health center (SHC) or a county or municipal health department. The local jurisdiction is responsible for contacting the newly arrived immigrant or refugee, scheduling an appointment for the individual to come into the TB clinic, and evaluating the individual for latent TB infection or active TB. All information pertinent to the U.S. evaluation, diagnosis and - where applicable - treatment of each immigrant or refugee is documented by 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Disease surveillance among newly arriving refugees and immigrants - electronic disease notification system, United States, 2009. MMWR 2013;62(No. SS -7):1-20 Pennsylvania TB Manual 15-2 15 - B1/B2 Electronic February 2022 Disease Notifications (EDN s) the local jurisdiction on the EDN Worksheet and submitted to the PADOH TB Program central office for data entry in the EDN system. POLICY SHCs and county or municipal health departments must complete timely TB evaluations of newly arrived immigrants and refugees in order to diagnose and treat TB or active TB disease, thereby preventing new cases and the spread of active disease. The timely c ompletion of TB evaluations is a condition of the prog ram funding provided by the CDC , and CDC grantees are expected to strive to meet or exceed the four objectives for the evaluation and care of immigrants and refugees as specified in the National Tubercu losis Indicators Project (NTIP) ,2 as follows: Examination initiation: The local jurisdiction should initiate a medical examination within 30 days of notification f or immigrants and refugees with abnormal chest radiographs (X -rays) read overseas as consistent with TB. Examination completion: The local jurisdiction should complete a medical examination within 90 days of notification for immigrants and refugees with abnormal chest X -rays read overseas as consistent with TB . Treatment initiation: For im migrants and refugees with abnormal chest x -rays read overseas as consistent with TB who are diagnosed with latent TB infection or have radiographic findings consistent with prior pulmonary TB (ATS/CDC Class 4) on the basis of examination in the U.S., for whom treatment was recommended, increase the proportion who start treatment. Treatment completion: For immigrants and refugees with abnormal chest x -rays read overseas as consistent with TB who are diagnosed with latent TB infection or have radiographic fi ndings consistent with prior pulmonary TB (ATS/CDC Class 4) on the basis of examination in the U.S., and who have started on treatment , increase the proportion who complete treatment. EDN PROCEDURES Completing the EDN Worksheet Within the first week a fter receiving notification that an immigrant or refugee in need of a TB evaluation has entered the local jurisdiction, the community health nurse (CHN) assigned by the SHC or the public health nurse (PHN) assigned by the county or municipal health department will begin efforts to contact the patient to schedule an appointment for a medical evaluation in the TB clinic. For refugees, the nurse should reach out to the appropriate refugee resettlement agency fo r their assistance in locating the patient. 2 To find the NTIP targets currently in effect, search the internet for 'CDC TB NTIP targets.' Pennsylvania TB Manual Electronic February 2022 Disease Notifications (EDN s) At a minimum, the following attempts should be made to contact an immigrant o r refugee for evaluation: three telephone calls (at least one per week), one letter to be sent after first failed telephone call, and one home visit. If the individual is not home, leave a general letter addressed to the individual in a sealed envelope asking the individual to contact the health department ). All attempts to reach the individual should be recorded in the investigation n otes section of the NEDSS record. At the completion of the medical evaluation, or when it has been determined that the evaluation cannot be completed because the patient could not be found, was lost to follow -up, refused evaluation, moved to another stat e within the U.S. or moved outside the U.S., the assigned nurse should complete Sections C (U.S. Evaluation), D (Evaluation Disposition in U.S.) and questions E1 through E4 (U.S. Treatment for TB Disease or latent TB infection) of the EDN follow -up workshe et following the guidance provided in Appendix C of this document. Once completed, SHC staff should submit the EDN follow -up worksheet encrypted via the TB Program Resource Account ( TB_Program_Central_Office@pa.gov ); county and municipal health departments should submit the worksheet via encrypted email to the TB Program Resource Account or via fax to 717 -971-3001 . For patients w ho started treatment following completion of the U.S. medical evaluation, the completed EDN follow -up worksheet should be submitted to the TB Program Central Office on two occasions - first after completing the U.S. medical evaluation and again after the p atient either completes the full course of treatment or stops taking the anti -TB medications. If an immigrant or refugee moves out of state after the TB evaluation is initiated but before it is completed, SHC and county or municipal staff should complete as much of Section C of the EDN worksheet as possible, answer PHPA or the PHPAA. For these cases , SHC and county or municipal staff should also complete an Interjurisdictional Notification (IJN) f orm and fax it to the TB Program central office at 717 -971-3001 . If an immigrant or refugee moves out of state before the TB evaluation is initiated, SHC an d county or municipal staff should answer questions D2a and D2c and return the EDN worksheet to the PHPA via the TB Program Resource Account . It is not necessary to complete an IJN form in cases where the patient moves out of state before the TB evaluation is initiated. Upon return of the EDN worksheet to the TB P rogram central office, SHC and county or municipal staff must update the corresponding investigation in PA-NEDSS (Pennsylvania's version of the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System) . If no further contact with the patient is needed, the PA-NEDSS investigation can be closed. Pennsylvania TB Manual 15A-1 15A - Frequently Asked Questions January 2020 CHAPTER 1 5, APPENDIX A: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUE STIONS Q. Do the tests performed during the overseas panel examination need to be repeated in the US? A. It is at the discretion of the TB clinician to determine what tests are needed to evaluate the patient. Any immigrant or refugee with any EDN classification, having an abnormal CXR overseas and negative smear and culture, should have a repeat CXR in US a nd an IGRA. However, if the IGRA was positive overseas, there is no need to repeat it in the US. If the US CXR is abnormal, obtain three sputa specimens for smear, culture and a NAAT and an IGRA if one was not performed. Q. Should children with a B2 class ification and a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) overseas have a repeat TB test in the U.S.? A. Yes, children should be retested for TB in the U.S. An IGRA is preferred for children 2 years of age and older, while a TST is recommended for children less than two years of age. Q. An adult with a B2 classification had an IGRA overseas. Does the test need to be repeated in the U.S.? A. As of October 1, 2018, all immigrants and refugees undergoing a panel exam overseas are to be tested for TB with an IGRA. CDC DTBE does not have enough data to comment on any discordance between overseas and U.S. IGRA results. Therefore, any decision to re-do the IGRA in the U.S. is at the TB clinician's discretion. Q. Is a U.S. CXR recommended for all immigrants and refugees whose overseas TST or IGRA was negative? A. If the overseas CXR was normal and the U.S. IGRA or TST is negative, there is no need to repeat the CXR. However, any abnormal overseas CXR needs to be re -evaluated by repeating the CXR and administering an IGRA in the U.S. This is true regardless of whether the overseas CXR was 'abnormal - not suggestive of TB' and/or the overseas smears and cultures were negative. Q. If an immigrant or refugee has an overseas CXR read as 'abnormal, no t suggestive of TB' should the CXR be repeated in the U.S.? Pennsylvania TB Manual 15A-2 15A - Frequently Asked Questions January 2020 A. Yes. Any abnormal overseas CXR needs to be re -evaluated by repeating the CXR and administering an IGRA in the U.S. This is true regardless of whether the overseas CXR was 'abnormal - not sugge stive of TB' and/or the overseas smears and cultures were negative. Q. What U.S. testing is recommended for an immigrant or refugee whose overseas CXR was abnormal but whose pre -immigration smears and cultures were negative? A. Any abnormal overseas CXR needs to be re -evaluated by repeating the CXR and administering an IGRA in the U.S. This is true regardless of whether the overseas CXR was 'abnormal - not suggestive of TB' and/or the overseas smears and cultures were negative. If the U.S. CXR is also abnormal, three repeat sputa specimens should be obtained for smear and culture with at least one specimen tested with a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) to rule out active TB disease. If the U.S. CXR is normal and the U.S. IGRA is positive, the pati ent should be offered treatment for LTBI. Treatment should be strongly recommended if the patient is from a high TB incidence country. If the U.S. CXR is normal and the U.S. IGRA is negative, no further testing is needed. Q. What follow -up should be done for an immigrant or refugee whose U.S. CXR is abnormal but the U.S. IGRA is negative? A. In this case the answer depends on whether the patient is symptomatic, what specifically the U.S. CXR showed and the clinician's judgment. An asymptomatic patient with a negative CXR and IGRA or TST can still have early TB disease, so depending on what the CXR shows the physician may want to order a CT scan of the chest and/or sputa to be collected for smear, culture and possibly a NAAT. If the patient is symptomat ic, however, sputa should be collected for smear, culture and possibly a NAAT. Q. A recent immigrant to our jurisdiction has a B2 classification and was enrolled in PTOPS. What is PTOPS? Does participation in PTOPS affect the U.S. EDN evaluation? A. The P reventing TB Overseas Pilot Study, or PTOPS, is a CDC -funded pilot study at an overseas panel site in Vietnam. In the study, immigrants bound for the U.S. are tested for TB and, if diagnosed with LTBI, offered the INH + Rifapentine (3HP) regimen to start i n Vietnam and complete prior to immigration or shortly after arriving in the U.S. For PTOPS participants who completed treatment with 3HP, document that they did so on the EDN form and send the completed EDN form to the TB program. Physicians or nurses w ho have other questions about EDN evaluations are encouraged to call the PA TB program at 717 -787-6267. 2022 CHAPTER APPENDIX B Page intentionally left blank Penn sylvania TB Manual February 2022 15C-1 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE EDN FOLLOW- UP WORKSHEET General Instructions Write legibly. Send only the EDN follow -up worksheet to the central office staff. Do not send the Alien Information Chart or medical information. If needed, the central office staff can access that information via the EDN system. Do not send progress notes. A NEDSS investigation is initiated for each EDN received. Information in the progress note should be recorded in the investigation notes section of the patient's NEDSS investigation. Please submit your EDN follow -up worksheets to the TB central office staff as follows: o State health centers - encrypted via the TB Resource Account o TB_Program_Central_Office@pa.gov o County or municipal health departments - via fax to the TB Program at 717-971- 3001 or encrypted via the TB Resource Account TB_Program_Central_Office@pa.gov If you have questions about how to complete the EDN worksheet, call the TB Program central office at 717-787-6267 and ask to speak with the PHPA. Question-Specific Guidance for Completing the EDN Follow -Up Worksheet Sections A (Demographics) and B (Jurisdictional Information) of the EDN follow -up worksheet are prepopulated by the EDN system. Sections C (U.S. Evaluation), D (U.S. Evaluation Dispositi on), E (U.S. Treatment for TB Disease or Latent TB Infection), F (Evaluation Site Information), G (Treatment Site Information) and H (Comments) of the worksheet are completed by medical personnel at the state health center or county or municipal health department with jurisdiction for the geographic area where the patient lives. The completed EDN follow -up worksheet is then submitted to the TB central office, where it is reviewed for completeness and the data entered into the EDN system. Penn sylvania TB Manual Question-specific guidance for completing the EDN follow -up worksheet is provided in the chart that begins below. Question Number Question Comment(s) C1. Date of first U.S. test or provider/clinic visit? 1. To answer C1, enter the earliest of the following: a. The date a TST skin test was administered, blood was drawn for an IGRA, or a chest x -ray (CXR) was done in the U.S., or b. The date the patient was first seen and evaluated for a TB condition by a medical provider in the U.S. 2. If no diagnostic tests were completed and the patient was not seen in the U.S. by a medical provider, then leave C1 blank. TIP: If C1 is blank, the EDN system will only accept \"Did not initiate evaluation\" in response to question D2a. C2a. Was a TST administered in the U.S.? answer questions C2b, C2c, C2d Check \"Yes\", \"No\" or \"Unknown\" based on information from the DS forms or the patient's verbal history. C3a. Was an IGRA performed in the U.S.? If answer questions C3b, C3c, Check \"Yes\", \"No\" or \"Unknown\" based on information from the DS forms or the patient's verbal history. C4. Pre-immigration CXR Answer \"Yes\" to C4 only if you have the pre- immigration CXR film or disc. If there is no CXR film or disc, answer \"No\". If a CXR film is available, but lacks documentation of patient's name and birthdate, then answer \"Unknown\". TIP: The CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine plans to gradually implement a new process where the overseas panel physician will upload a patient's CXR to a system that will make this information available in the EDN file. Over time, this should significantly increase the percentage of arriving immigrants and refugees with a pre-immigration CXR that can readily be viewed by the U.S. physician. C5. U.S. interpretation of pre- immigration CXR If the U.S. interpretation of the pre- immigration CXR is \"Abnormal,\" then you must also check the appropriate either: Penn sylvania TB condition.\" Check \"Unknown\" if no CXR film or disc is available. Tip: The U.S. interpretation must be based on a review of the CXR film or disc, not the notes documented on Form DS-3030. C6a. U.S. domestic CXR done? If \"Yes,\" enter the date (mm/dd/yy) of the U.S. CXR in response to C6b. C7. Interpretation of U.S. CXR Similar to C5, if \"Abnormal\" is checked here, then you must also check the appropriate sub-category. C8. Comparison of the U.S. and pre-immigration CXRs TIP: The EDN System requires a response to this question. 1. If C4 and C6a are both \"Yes,\" answer C8 by checking \"Stable,\" \"Improving\" or \"Worsening\" as appropriate. 2. If the response to C4, C6a or both is \"No,\" then the response to C8 is \"Unknown.\" C9a. Completed treatment pre- immigration? If the patient completed treatment pre- immigration for either TB disease or latent TB infection check \"Yes\" C9b, C9c, C9d, C9e and C9f. TIP: Panel physician refers to the physician who did the pre-immigration exam overseas. C9b. If treated for TB disease, was treatment completed... If the response is \"treatment completed after panel physician diagnosis (as documented on the DS 3030)\", then check the appropriate sub-category: 1. At designated DOT site 2. At non-designated DOT site 3. Other, specify TIP: Designated DOT site refers to a site that meets U.S. requirements for providing DOT as defi ned by the CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (DGMQ). The site can be either a panel physician's clinic or the local national TB program. Non- designated means the DOT site has not been designated by the DGMQ as meeting U.S. requirements. The DGMQ has little or no confidence in the quality or quantity of treatment provided at a non-designated DOT site. Penn sylvania TB Manual February Question C10a. Arrived in the U.S. on treatment? If \"Yes,\" then you must also: 1. Answer C10b by checking either \"TB disease\" or \"LTBI\" as appropriate; and 2. Enter the start date of treatment in C10c (or check the box if the start date is unknown). C11a. Pre-immigration treatment concerns? TIP: The EDN System requires a response to this question. 1. If C9a and C10a are both answered \"No,\" then check \"No\" in response to C11a. 2. If C11a is \"Yes,\" select the appropriate sub-category: a. \"Treatment duration short\"; \"Incorrect treatment \"Yes\" or \"No\" in response to the question \"Sputa collected in the U.S.\" TIP: This question pertains only to sputa collected in the U.S. and covers all results regardless of the specimen collection method - including sputum induction, bronchoscopy and bronchial lavage. D1a. Evaluation disposition date in the U.S. To answer D1a, enter the date when the U.S. evaluation disposition recorded in D2a was made. TIP: The EDN System requires a response to D1a whether the patient was seen in the U.S by a health care provider or not. D1b. State/jurisdiction of evaluation disposition in U.S. Enter the name of the Pennsylvania state health center or county or municipal health department that determined the evaluation disposition. D2a. Evaluation disposition in U.S. There are three main options for answering D2a: 1. Completed evaluation; 2. Initiated evaluation/not completed; or 3. Did not initiate evaluation. Check \"Initiated evaluation/not completed\" if the patient completed a diagnostic test or was seen in the U.S. by a medical provider but was lost to follow- up, moved to another jurisdiction or died before the U.S. evaluation was completed. Penn sylvania TB Manual February 2022 15C-5 Comment(s) Check \"Did not initiate evaluation\" if no diagnostic tests were completed and the patient was not seen in the U.S. by a medical provider. Next, answer the appropriate follow- up questions: If \"Completed Evaluation\" is checked, answer treatment Check \"No.\" initiate evaluation\" is checked, answer D2c by checking all of the following that apply: Not located Lost to follow- up Refused evaluation Unknown Moved with U.S., transferred to (specify state or local jurisdiction) Moved outside U.S. Died Other (specify) D3. Diagnosis 1. Class 0 and Class 1 have been combined on the revised EDN form. Check Class 0 if the patient has no evidence of latent TB infection and no history of exposure to active TB (Class 0), or if the patient has no evidence of latent TB infection but does have a history of exposure to active TB (Class 1). 2. Check Class 2 for a diagnosis of latent TB infection, no disease 3. Check Class 3 for TB disease and indicate whether the TB site is pulmonary, extra- pulmonary or both. 4. Check Class 4 when the patient has a history of TB disease, was treated for active TB, and has no current signs or symptoms of active TB. D4. If Diagnosed with TB Disease in D3 To answer D4, enter a zero (0) followed by the patient's NEDSS investigation number in the space provided for the RVCT number. TBLISS (the TB Latent Infection Surveillance System) is not currently used in PA. E. U.S. Treatment for TB Disease or Latent TB Infection TIP: Complete Section E only if treatment for LTBI or active TB is recommended in D2b. Penn sylvania Question E1. U.S. Treatment Initiated 1. If E1a is \"No,\" answer E1b by checking all sub- options that apply (patient declined against medical advice, died, currently on treatment, contraindication for treatment, was lost to follow- up, etc.). 2. If E1a is \"Yes,\": a. Answer E1c by checking either \"Treated for TB Disease\" or \"Treated for LTBI\", b. Enter the treatment start date in E2; and c. Enter the name of the state or local jurisdiction where treatment occurred in E3. E4. LTBI Regimen If the answer to E1c is \"Treated for LTBI\" specify the initial LTBI regimen by checking the prescribed regimen, e.g., isoniazid 9 months, isoniazid/rifapentine 3 months, rifampin 4 months, isoniazid/rifampin/ethambutol/pyrazinamide [RIPE], Unknown, or other (specify). TIP: RIPE is listed as a LTBI regimen because some patients suspected of having TB disease are started on RIPE treatment and later determined to have latent TB infection, not TB disease. By the time the final diagnosis is made, some patients have completed enough RIPE therapy to be considered adequately treated for latent TB infection. AT THIS POINT, SEND THE EDN WORKSHEET TO THE CENTRAL OFFICE STAFF AND KEEP A COPY FOR YOUR FILES. E5. U.S. Treatment Completed 1. For E5a, check: a. \"Yes\" when the patient completes the full course of treatment and enter the date of the last dose in E6. b. \"No\" if the patient started but did not complete treatment. i. Next, answer E5b by checking all the reasons why the patient did not complete therapy; and ii. Enter the date the last known dose was taken in E6. c. \"Unknown\" if contact with the patient is lost and enter the date the last known dose was taken in E6. 2. Resend the EDN worksheet to the central office staff so they can complete entering the data into the EDN system. TIP: If known, enter the actual date the patient stopped taking therapy in response to E6. If the actual date isn't Penn sylvania TB Manual February 2022 15C-7 Worksheet Question Number Question Comment(s) known, enter your best estimate based on the information available (e.g., date of last clinic visit). TIP: If the response to E5a is no or unknown, and the reason is included as one of the responses listed for E5b, then there is no need to write- in a response to \"reason therapy stopped\" under E6. F. Evaluation Site Information Enter the health care provider's name, the clinic name and the clinic phone number. G. Treatment Site Information If different from Section F, enter the health care provider's name, the clinic name and the clinic phone number. Otherwise, check the box \"Same as evaluation site information\". H. Comments Add any comments relevant to the case. Pennsylvania TB Manual 16-1 16 - TB Patients Lost to Follow -Up January 2020 Chapter 16: TB Patients Lost to Follow -Up BACKGROUND Patients with active TB disease who do not complete treatment are at increased risk of relapsing and/or developing resistance to one or more of the drugs commonly used to treat TB. Patients treated for pulmonary TB and deemed non -infectious at the time they were lost to follow -up pose a public health risk if they relapse. Patients with extra -pulmonary TB wh o were lost to follow -up may also pose a public health risk if they relapse and their TB disease spread s to the lungs or airway. PURPOSE The purpose of the policy is to establish a systematic approach to the prompt reporting of any patient with active TB disease who is lost to follow -up. PROCEDURE S 1. The public health nurse (PHN), community health nurse (CHN) or outreach worker will notify their supervisor immediately when a patient with active TB disease misses any appointment for directly observed therapy (DOT) . 2. When notified about a third consecutive missed appointment , the Nurse Supervisor will report the missed doses to the state TB program manager and document the notification in the patient's NEDSS investigation within 24 hours . 3. The PHN , CHN or outreach worker will take the following steps to locate the patient within the first 48 hours after the second missed dose. All actions should be documented in the patient chart and the NEDSS investigation . a) Call the patient at his or her last known phone number. b) Following your local procedure, s end a letter via certified mail to the patient's last known residence . c) Visit the patient's home or other place of residence. If the patient isn't there, ask other family members, residents or neighbors where the patient may be located . d) If the patient is employed and it is appropri ate to do so, contact the employer for any information about the patient's whereabouts. e) Check other locations frequented by the patient, such as bars, shelters, places of worship, food banks, etc. f) Check with the local post office, welfare office, social security office and morgue . g) Once the above actions have been completed - and within five working days of the patient's third missed dose - a conference call should be scheduled among the PHN or CHN , the nurse supervisor, TB clinic physician (based u pon availability) , state TB Pennsylvania TB Manual 16-2 16 - TB Patients Lost to Follow -Up January 2020 medical consultant and state TB program manager to discuss whether all avenues to locate the patient have been exhausted, additional steps to locate the patient need to be taken , or the case can be closed. 4. If the patient is located, identify and address any barriers to the patient continuing treatment , such housing instability or being homeless, lack of transportation, food insecurity, or other physical or mental health issues. a) If appropriate, request Reimold funds to address barriers to treatment such as a lack of housing, nutrition, or transportation. 5. If the patient left the jurisdiction and their new location is known, t he PHN or CHN will forward that information as follows: a) Movement between jurisdictions within Pen nsylvania can be reported directly to the state health center or county or municipal health department with responsibility for the patient's new location. b) Movement outside the state of Pennsylvania must be reported using an Interjurisdictional Notification form . (See Interjurisdictional Transfer Procedures for instructions.) c) If the patient has left the United States and their overseas location is known, contact the Migrant Clinicians Network for their help arranging continued treatment of the patient. (See Interjurisdictional Transfer Procedures for instructions.) If the patient is not located , document in PA-NED SS as well as the patient chart and submit the investigation in PA -NEDSS to \"Waiting for Central Office Review\" for closure. Pennsylvania TB Manual 17-1 17 - Reimold Fund November 2021 Chapter 1 7: Reimold Trust Fund BACKGROUND The Reimold Fund was established to assist patients with latent TB infection (LTBI) , active TB disease and presumptive TB disease. The Reimold F und may be used to 1) keep a patient isolated if they do not have a place to stay, 2) purchase food needed for proper nutrition, and 3) secure transportation to medical appointments. Often, TB patients are unable to work during the infectious period, and this puts a strain on the patient and the family. All efforts should be made by the community health nurse (CHN) to connect patients with soc ial services such as the food bank, county assistance office, human service agencies, Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), etc. Reimold funds may be used to pay utility bills or purchase clothing that cannot be funded through other community or government assistance programs. The Reimold F und may also be utilized to purchase items that can motivate patients to be compliant with treatment. POLICY The Reimold Fund may be utilized by the state health centers (SHCs) as well as county and municipal health departments (CMHDs) . The Reimold Fund is to be used when enablers and incentives , such as meals, food coupons and local transportation , are necessary to assure pat ients complete their treatment or when patients are unable to meet their basic needs like housing, utilities and food. The requests for funds are initiated by the district offices or CMHDs on behalf of their patients . The TB Program considers special requests to spend more than the allocated amounts. Regardless of the amount of the request, the Request for Use of Reimold Fund F orm must be completed and maintained on file. The completed form is required to be submitted with the request for an expenditure adjustment. Approval from the TB Program is not required unless expenditures for a specific patient exceed $300 in a fiscal year . Requests that exceed $300 in a fiscal year for a patient must be pre- approved by the TB Program and Comptroller 's Office . The fund may be used for : patients on LTBI treatment; patients who have presumptive active TB disease; and/or patients who have active TB disease. Pennsylvania TB Manual 17-2 17 - Reimold Fund November 2021 PROCEDURES 1. Complete a Reimold Fund Request f orm For SHC s - a Department of Health community health n urse supervisor (CHNS) will complete and sign the SHC Request for Use of Reimold Fund form . For CMHDs - a CMHD designee will complete and sign the CMHD Request for Use of Reimold Fund form . The completed request form shall be submitted as soon as possible in advance of the needed service. All sections, except the \" TB Program Central Office Only \" box, must be completed. The form shall be completed as follows: o Each request shall be for only one patient . o The request shall be specific for : - the item or service requested, - the cost of the item or service , - length of time the service will be needed, and - justification for the expenditure for the item or service. *Cost of the transportation, subsistence and hotel rooms shall not exceed the current reimbursable allowances as specified in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania directives . For SHCs - obtain the signature of the community health nurse administrator (CHNA) . For CMHDs - obtain an authorized signature. For SHCs - All Reimold request forms, regardless of the amount requested, must be submitted to the TB Program for record keeping purposes. I f the request exceeds $300 for the state fiscal year for the patient, approval from the TB Program and Comptroller must first be received before the purchase can be made by the district office. All Reimold request forms shall be submit ted to the TB Program via the resource account (TB_Program_Central_Office@pa.gov ). Approval from the TB Program and Comptroller for requests over $300 will be email ed to the submitter. Example 1: In January 2021, a Reimold request is processed in the amount of $200 for a patient for groceries. A pproval from the TB Program is not required , as the request is less than $300 ; however, the Reimold request form must be submitted to the TB Program for record keeping purposes. Example 2: In February 2021, a Reimold request is processed in the amount of $200 for a patient for transportation. This is the patient's first Reimold request. Approval from the TB Program is not required, as the request is less than $300 , but a copy of the Reimold form must be submitted . In March of 2021, a Reimold request is completed for the same patient in the amount of $150 for groceries. Approval from the TB Program and Comptroller is required because the amount of this request and the pr evious request in the same fiscal year exceeds $300. Pennsylvania TB Manual 17-3 17 - Reimold Fund November 2021 Example 3: In January of 2021 , a Reimold request is processed in the amount of $400 for rent. Approval from the TB Program and Comptroller is required. Example 4: In June of 2021, a Reimold request is processed for a patient in the amount of $200 for groceries. TB Program approval is not requested , as the request is less than $300. In July of 2021, a Reimold request is completed for the same patient in the amount of $250. Approval from the TB Program is not required. While the total amount for the patient exceeds $300, July is the start of a new fiscal year , so the amount does not exceed $300 in the same fiscal year ; therefore, approval is not required. In both cases, the Reimold request form must still be submitted to the TB Program. For CMHDs - all requests from CMHDs shall be submitted to the TB Program via the resource account (TB_Program_Central_Office@pa.gov ) for approval and purchase/payment of items requested All requests received will be logged in the Reimold fund spreadsheet by TB Program staff. For requests over $300, TB Program staff will prepare the Reimold approval memo which will route from the TB Program C lerk Typist 3 - TB Program Manager - TB/STD Division Director - Bureau of Communicable Diseases (BCD) Director. Upon approval of the BCD Director, the CT3 will submit the memos and Reimold form to Comptroller. Upon approval, the CT3 will email the approval to the submitter if a SHC. CMHD request approvals, will be emailed to the TB Program Administrative Assistant and TB Program Manager. 2. For approved requests , the purchaser (district office for SHC requests or TB Program for CMHD requests) will prepare a general invoice for each patient receiving service. If only one vendor provided a service, a single invoice will suffice. If multiple services were provided to one patient (or family), but by different vendors, a general invoice must be prepared for each service provided for the patient (family). A receipt must be obtained for the item/service purchased. If paying rent, a copy of the lease or a written statement from the landlord stating the amount of the rent must be obtained. Under no circumstances will cash be given directly to the patient. 3. The CHN will document ( in the plan of care in the patient's record ) the type of inducement/enabler given to the patient and the cost of the item. 4. Staff in the TB Program will work with the CMHD for the purchase of the Reimold- funded item or service. 5. Staff in the district office and TB Program will maintain a record of all disbursements. 6. Bureau of C ommunity Health Systems (BCHS) will submit a request for an expenditure adjustment (EA) to the TB Program via the resource account (TB_Program_Central_Office@pa.gov ). The TB Program will also complete an EA for any CM HD requests to post costs to the Reimold fund. 7. Upon approval, submit the EA, EA backup documentation, and TB Program approval to the Budget Office to process the EA .

Pennsylvania TB Manual 18-1 18 - Do Not Board List January 2020 Chapter 18: Do Not Board List BACKGROUND1 In 2007, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented a public health Do Not Board (DNB) list. Use of the list is limited to those communicable disease s that would po se a public health threat if the infected traveler were to be permitted to board a flight. Because infectious tuberculosis (TB) is spread from person to person via the air, individuals with infectious TB pose a public health risk to fellow t ravelers if they fly on commercial aircraft. To qualify for placement on the DNB list, individuals must meet the first criteria listed below and any one of the other three criteria (#2-4): 1. The individual is known or reasonably believed to be infectious or reasonably believed to have been exposed to a communicable disease that would be a public health threat if the individual were to be permitted to board a commercial aircraft or travel in a manner that would expose the public . 2. The individual is not aware of his or her diagnosis, has been advised regarding the diagnosis and is non -compliant with public health requests, or is unable to be located . 3. The individual is at risk of traveling on a commercial flight or of traveling internationally by any means . 4. The individual's placement on the DNB list is necessary to effectively respond to outbreaks of communicable disease or other conditions of public health concern. Airlines have been instructed not to issue a boarding pass to an individual on the DNB list for any domestic or international commercial flight arriving in or departing from the United States. To remove an individual from the DNB list, HHS and CDC require a written statement from the treating physician or public health authority that the individ ual is no longer infectious. POLICY To reduce the risk of TB transmission, any TB patient meeting criteria #1 and #2, #3 or #4 above must not be permitt ed to board a commercial flight or travel internationally by any means of transportation. Public health personnel who learn of such a patient should take immediate 1 Source: Criteria for requesting federal travel restrictions for public health purposes, including for viral hemorrhagic fevers; Federal Register; Vol. 80, No. 59; pgs. 16400 -16402 Pennsylvania TB Manual 18-2 18 - Do Not Board List January 2020 steps, as outlined in the following section, to discuss the case with the proper state and federal public health agencies a nd determine whether to add the patient to the DNB list. PROCEDURES 1. Upon identification of a patient who is believed to meet the criteria for the DNB list and is a flight risk, health department staff from the local jurisdiction will notify the TB Program Central Office immediately by calling 717-787-6267 during normal business hours (Monday - Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.). After normal business hours or on weekends , health department staff from the local jurisdiction should call the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (DGMQ) at the Philadelphia Quarantine Station - located in Terminal A of the Phila delphia International Airport - at 215-365-6401. Someone is on call at that number 24 hours a day , 365 days a year. 2. Health department staff from the local jurisdiction should e nsure the patient's NEDSS investigation is updated with all pertinent information, including: a. Laboratory results (smear, culture, nucleic a cid amplification test [ NAAT ], drug susceptibilities) ; b. Chest radiograph results ; c. Treatment regimen ; d. Investigation note indicating patient's level of compliance ; and e. Investigation note including all known flight information. For each flight segment, provide the travel date, departure airport, departure time, airline, flight nu mber, scheduled flight duration and destination airport if known. 3. TB Program Central Office st aff will contact DGMQ to a rrange a conference call to discuss the case and agree on the action(s) to be taken. Call participants should include staff from: a. State health center or county /municipal health department managing the investigation ; b. TB Program Central Office; and c. DGMQ . 4. After the conference call, the TB program manager or p ublic health program a dministrator will record action steps identified in NEDSS under investigation notes . Health department staff from the local jurisdiction will im plement action steps as discussed. If the patient is placed on the DNB list, he or she can be removed fro m the DNB list when no longer infectious. This is accomplished by providing DGMQ with a written statement from the treating physician or public health authority attesting that the individual is no Pennsylvania TB Manual 18-3 18 - Do Not Board List January 2020 longer infectious. For a patient to be permitted to board a commercial flight, the criteria listed in the chart on the following page must be met: Condition Criteria AFB smear positive or chest x -ray with cavity Treatment with an appropriate drug regimen for more than two weeks ; and Three negative smear results MDR or XDR TB Treatment for more than four weeks ; Currently on appropriate treatment ; Three negative smear results ; and Two or more negative culture results after more than two weeks of treatment with no subsequent positive cultures Questions regarding this process should be directed to the TB Program Central O ffice staff at 717-787-6267 . Pennsylvania TB Manual 19-1 19 - Cohort Review April 2021 Chapter 19 : Cohort Review BACKGROUND Cohort review is a systematic review of the clinical and case management of tuberculosis ( TB) patients and their contacts. A \"cohort\" is a group of TB cases counted over a specific period. In Pennsylvania, the state TB program conducts at least one cohort review annually. Cohort reviews may be held in person or virtually. County and municipal healt h departments (CMHDs) can participate in the state TB program cohort review and/or organize and conduct their own cohort review. The cohort review process serves as a method for evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the program, increases accountabili ty related to outcomes, and assists in identifying areas where public health staff need additional training and education. It is important to note that cohort review is a mandated activity per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Cooperative Agreement. Ideally, all cases in the cohort are reviewed but it is equally appropriate to present a subset of cases based on pre -defined criteria such as sputum smear or culture positive (i.e., i nfectious) cases, cases with challenging medical and/or case management issue s, and cases that offer learning opportunities distinct from textbook cases of TB. At the end of each cohort review, the TB program issues a written summary of the meeting to include: Cohort findings , Strengths and weaknesses , Suggestions for improvement , and Educational points. The summary is based on information available at the time of cohort review and is distributed to public health nurses in the state Bureau of Community Health Systems (BCHS) and the CMHDs. OVERVIEW OF THE COHORT REVIEW PROCESS During cohort review , the care, case mana gement and outcomes of individual TB cases are reviewed by a group that typically includes : State TB program staff; State TB medical consultant(s) and local TB clinic physician s; Public health nurses and supervisors ; and Pennsylvania TB Manual 19-2 19 - Cohort Review April 2021 Public health laboratory staff. SELECTION OF CASES FOR REVIEW Two months prior to a scheduled cohort review, the TB program manager will ask BCHS and CMHD nurse supervisors to submit TB cases for presentation along with a brief explanation for why the case is of educat ional value to all participants . The TB program manager and surveillance coordinator will collaborate on reviewing the cases submitted, add any other cases based on their review of surveillance data, and determine the final list of cases to be presented. The selected cases will cover a variety of challenges including , but not limited to, diagnosis, treatment, identifying and managing side effects/adverse events, case management , contact investigatio n and interjurisdictional collaboration . ROLES OF THE COHORT REVIEW PARTICIPANTS TB program staff plan and implement the review, develop and update the cohort review form, make the final select ion of the cases to be presented , review completed cohort revie w forms for accuracy and completeness , provide programmatic feedback during case reviews and write and issue a written summary of the results following the completion of cohort review. For each case selected for presentation , it is expected that the BCHS or CMHD nurse or case manager responsible for the care of the patient shall complete the cohort review form for the case, present the case , follow -up on any missing or inaccurate case information, update or correct the case record in PA -NEDSS as needed and share feedback from the medical consultants and/or TB program staff with the clinic staff who could not attend. If the nurse who cared for the patient is no longer providing TB care in the jurisdiction, it is recommended that the nurse superviso r present the case. The state TB medical consultants provide clinical feedback on the cases presented and provide education when the specifics of a case provide a \"teachable moment\". The consultants provide feedback and education constructively and withou t judgement to reinforce a culture of learning and continuous improvement. CASE INFORMATION TO BE PRESENTED A TB Program Cohort Review Presentation Guide Form (Appendix A of this chapter ) must be completed by the BCHS or CMHD nurse or case manager responsi ble for the care of the patient whose case is to be presented. Completed forms must be submitted to the TB program at least two weeks before cohort review . TB program staff review each form for accuracy and completeness and give feedback about any errors to be corrected or omissions to be addressed. The following information is typically included in each case presentation: Patient demographics, e.g., age, sex, birth country, and dat e of U.S. arrival (if applicable) Pennsylvania TB Manual 19-3 19 - Cohort Review April 2021 Diagnosis (pulmonary or extra -pulmonary), site of TB disease, co -morbidities, symptomatic or asymptomatic, and status of HIV testing TB test information, including interferon gamma -release assay (IGRA) or tuberculin skin test, chest or computer assisted tomography (CT), specimen results, nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), sputum conversion (if applicable) and drug susceptibility test (DST) results Treatment information inc luding the initial regimen , treatment start date, treatment stop date (and the reason why) or the date treatment is likely to be completed , method of administration (i.e., directly observed therapy) , and whether th e patient was privately managed For cases of pulmonary, laryngeal and pleural TB , the number of c ontact s identified , evaluated, and tested as well as their diagnosis, treatment status and challenges related to contact evaluation and treatment Any care or case management challenges or obstacles and how they were addressed ADMIN ISTRATIVE PROCEDURES The state TB program completes the following steps to prepare for and conduct the annual regional cohort reviews . In preparation for cohort review, the TB program manager: Sets the cohort rev iew date(s) based on the availability of the state TB medical consultant(s) and , if cohort review is to be held in -person, the availability of an appropriate meeting space . Send s a \"Save the Date\" email for each cohort review session to the state TB medica l consultant(s), Bureau of Community Health Systems (BCHS) staff, state TB clinicians, state laboratory staff, TB program staff, and CMHD TB nurses, nurse supervisors and TB clinicians . Makes the final selection of cases to be presented at cohort. Case selection is based on pre-defined criteria such as sputum smear or culture positive (i.e., infectious) cases, cases with challenging medical and/or case management issues, and cases that offer learning opportunities di stinct from textbook cases of TB. Sends a notification email to BCHS and CMHD nurse supervisors to include the final list of the cases to be presented, the date (s) and time(s) for cohort review, the Cohort Review Presentation Guide Form , the instructions for completing the form (Appendix B of this chapter ), the due date for submission of completed cohort forms and any other pertinent information. Schedules a teleconference to review cohort review procedures with new attendees (on an as needed basis) . If cohort review is to be held in -person, the TB program manager also: Sends the completed case list to the BCHS Assistant Director for identification of staff attending cohort review. Pennsylvania TB Manual 19-4 19 - Cohort Review April 2021 Obtains necessary approval from the Bureau o f Communicable Diseases (BCD) Director to send a formal request to the BCHS Director requesting approval for the identified nurses to attend cohort review. The formal request includes a list of the cases to be presented and the presenter for each case, the date(s), time(s) and location(s) for cohort review, the Cohort Review Presentation Guide Form and the due date for submission of completed cohort forms and any other pertinent information. The day of cohort review: TB Program staff confirm who is in atten dance and that each attendee has signed and returned a confidentiality form. \u00ad For virtual cohort reviews, TB program staff monitor who has accepted the cohort review meeting notice and joined the meeting and confirmed that each attendee has signed the confidentiality form and emailed it to the TB resource account. \u00ad For cohort review s held in -person, TB program staff ensure that each participant 1) lists their name, email address, and organization name on the sign -in sheet and 2) reads , signs, and returns the confidentiality form. The TB program manager opens the cohort review by welcoming the participants, reviewing the purpose of cohort review, covering the ground rules, and briefly demonstrating how to present a case using the information from the case review form. One or both TB medical consultants adds their perspective that cohort review is not judgmental or punitive, but a forum for the constructive discussion of what is being done well and where there are opportunities for improvement, as well as an opportunity for impromptu education in response to specific case challenges and obstacles. Once all cases have been presented , the TB program manager summariz es the cohort findings, result s, and recommended actions for improvement. The TB program manager then asks the state TB med ical consultants for their perspective on the cohort findings, results, and reco mmended actions for improvement. After cohort review: TB program staff write and issue a summar y of the cohort findings , results , and recommend ed actions for improvement . As needed, TB program staff follow -up with the responsible BCHS or CMHD nurses to resolve any discrepancies in PA -NEDSS for the cases presented. A condensed version of the cohort review summary is also submitted as part of the TB Program's annual update to the Cooperative Agreement with the CDC. CMHD COHORT REVIEWS CMHDs have the option to participate in the TB program cohort review and/or to organize and conduct their own cohort review . If a CMHD elects to hold its own cohort re view, CMHD staff must: Conduct at least one cohort review per year; Pennsylvania TB Manual 19-5 19 - Cohort Review April 2021 Send to TB program staff a completed cohort review form for each case counted during the defined cohort period; Notify TB program staff 60 days in advance of the cohort review date so t hat TB program staff can participate; and Submit a report to TB program staff summarizing the results of the cohort review. The Philadelphia TB program has a separate cooperative agreement with the CDC and conducts their own cohort review with the underst anding that state TB program staff must be able to attend .

Pennsylvania TB Manual 20-1 20 - Window Prophylaxis January 2020 Chapter 20: Window Prophylaxis for TB-Exposed Children BACKGROUND The goal of window prophylaxis is to prevent an early yet undetectable TB infection from rapidly developing into TB disease in vulnerable patients. The timeframe between exposure to someone with infectious tuberculosis (TB) disease and when Mycobacteria TB can be detected by TB tests is typically a 'window' of 8 to 10 weeks , and the treatment of presumptive latent TB infection (LTBI) during this period is typically referred to as window prophylaxis. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)1 and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)2 all recommend window prophylaxis for children young er than 5 years of age who are contacts to a person with infectious TB - even if the child's initial TB test is negative - once a diagnosis of TB disease is eliminated. Window prophylaxis is especially important for children less than 2 years of age becau se they are significantly more likely than adolescents or adults to: Progress to active TB after infection; and Develop life TB disease (e.g., TB meningitis or disseminated TB). TB clinicians may also prescribe window prophylaxis for children 5 years of age or older, adolescents, or adults of any age who are immunocompromised or, for other medical reasons, are at increased risk of progression from LTBI to TB disease1. Clinicians evaluating children for LTBI or active TB disease are strongly encouraged to contact the TB Program at 717 -787-6267 to request a medical consultation with the state pediatric TB consultant. IDENTIFICATION Children who are candidates for window prophylaxis are most often identified during contact investigations. When public health staff conduct a contact investigation for a patient with infectious TB, be sure to ask whether they live with, care for or interact with children on a regular basis. If interviewing the patient in his or her home, be aware of the surroundings and 1 CDC. Guidelines for the investigation of contacts of persons with infectious tuberculosis. MMWR 2005;54(No. RR - 15):1 -37 2 American Academy of Pediatrics. Tuberculosis. In: Kimberlin DW, Brady MT, Jackson MA, Long SS, eds. Red Book: 2018 Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases . 31st ed. Itasca, IL: American Academy of 829 Pennsylvania TB Manual 20-2 20 - Window Prophylaxis January 2020 look for any evidence of a child in the household, e.g., toys or stuffed animals, a tricycle, children's clothing, a high -chair or booster seat, etc. TESTING Infants or children identified as contacts to an infectious case of TB should be tested promptly. For children younger than 2 years of age the tuberculin skin test (TST) is the preferred test for the detection of M. tuberculosis infection2. For c hildren 2 years of age or older , either a TST or an interferon gamma -release assay (IGRA) blood test can be used2. An IGRA is preferred for children who : o Have had the Bacille Calmette -Gu\u00e9rin ( BCG ) vaccine (to avoid -positive TST result caused by a previous BCG vaccination), and/or o Are unlikely to return for a TST to be read . A chest X -ray (CXR) should be done to rule out active TB , regardless of the TST/IGRA result . A negative TST or IGRA TB test does not rule out a diagnosis of TB. TREATMENT All children younger than 5 years of age who were exposed to a case o f infectious TB should receive a full diagnostic medical evalu ation, including a CXR . After the evaluation, p roceed as follows u nless otherwise directed by the TB clinician : For children with an initial TST result greater than or equal to 5 mm of induration or a positive IGRA : o If TB disease is ruled out by the diagnostic medical evaluation, start an d complete a full course of treatment for LTBI . For children with an initial TST result of less than 5 mm of induration or a negative IGRA : o If it has been less than eight weeks since the child's last exposure to TB, start the child on window prophylaxis once TB disease has been ruled out . Administer a second TST or IGRA 8 to 10 weeks after the child's last exposure to TB. If the second test is negative, window prophylaxis treatment can be discontinued. If the second test is positive, the child should be re -evaluated , including a repeat CXR to rule out TB diseas e, and treated accordingly for LTBI or TB disease. o If the initial TST or IGRA was a) administered eight or more we eks since the child's last exposure to the patient with infectious TB and b) the TST result was less than 5 mm of induration or the IGRA was negative , then no further evaluation or treatment is needed. In Pennsylvania, the standard of care is for c hildren younger than 5 years of age to receive window prophylaxis via directly observed therapy (DOT). DOT administration of window prophylaxis is recommended for children between the ages of 5 and 15 years. If field resources are limited, the decision whether to provide DOT should be made on a case by case basis with the TB clinician and the nurse supervis or. Pennsylvania TB Manual 20-3 20 - Window Prophylaxis January 2020 TIPS FOR GIVING TB M EDICATIONS TO CHILDR EN Given a lack of pediatric dosage forms for most anti -TB drugs, it can be very challenging to administer medication daily to a child over many months. Here are some tips: Explain to the parent(s) that the treatment is necessary to reduce the risk of the child developing more serious forms of TB such as TB meningitis. o Let the parent(s) know that if the second TST or IGRA is also negative, then the medication can likely be stopped. However, if the second test is positive, the infant or child has already started treatment by being given window prophylaxis. Engage the parent(s) in preparing the medication and giving it to the child. Be calm, hone st and soothing - but firm - with the child. Praise the child for taking the medication. Consider creating a pleasant routine around taking the medicine using distractions (a hand puppet or a spinner with lights) or small food rewards ( such as gummy worms). Crush the tablet(s) using a pill crusher, mix in a little warm water to create a slurry, and stir the slurry into a small amount of juice, yogurt, mashed banana, baby food or pudding to help mask the flavor of the pills . o If isoniazid (INH) is being combined with food or a beverage for dosing in children, be aware that INH absorption decreases when combined with glucose or lactose and should be mixed with low -glucose food or beverages such as sugar -free pudding3. For infants, consider administering the medication when the baby is hungry. o Put a small amount of the medication slurry in the tip of the bottle nipple when feeding an infant warm breast milk or formula. Do this repeatedly during the feeding until all the slurry mixture has been administered. Be sure that the chil d consumes all the food or beverage in which the medication has been mixed .

Pennsylvania TB Manual 21-1 21 - Testing for HIV/TB Coinfection January 2020 Chapter 2 1: Testing for HIV/TB Coinfection BACKGROUND Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is the most important known risk factor for progression from latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI) to TB disease. Individuals who test positive for LTBI and HIV infection , and remain untreated for both conditions , have a 7 to 10 percent chance per year of progressing from LTBI to TB disease. As illustrated below, that is significantly higher than the lifetime risk of progression of about 10% for persons with untreated LTBI and no other risk factors. In individuals who have TB disease and are HIV positive, each cond ition makes the other worse. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers a diagnosis of TB disease for someone who is HIV positive as evidence that he or she now has advanced to the third stage of HIV infection known as acquired immunode ficiency syndrome (AIDS )1. Today , of the people with TB disease who know their HIV status, about 5% are living with HIV. THIRD PARTY GUIDELIN ES In 2006, the CDC issued new recommendations for HIV testing2 designed to increase the early diagnosis of HIV infection by recommending that HIV screening be a routine part of medical care. The recommendations included the following: 1 Source https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/library/factsheets/coinfections/index.html#HIV -and-TB 2 Source https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5514a1.htm Pennsylvania TB Manual 21-2 21 - Testing for HIV/TB Coinfection January 2020 In all health -care settings, screening for HIV infection should be performed routinely for all patients aged 13 --64 years. All patients initiating treatment for TB should be screened routinely for HIV infection. HIV screening should be voluntary and undertaken only with the patient's knowledge and understanding that HIV testing is planned. Patients should be informed o rally or in writing that HIV testing will be performed unless they decline (opt -out screening). Concerning HIV testing in TB clinics, the CDC recommends the following: All patients in TB clinics should be tested for HIV, including patients with TB disease or LTBI; persons suspected of having TB because they exhibit the signs and symptoms of TB; and persons identified as contacts to a case of infectious TB disease3. All peopl e newly diagnosed with HIV infection should be tested for TB as soon as possible , even if they have no signs or symptoms of TB disease. People living with HIV and at ongoing risk for TB exposure should be tested annually. The risk for exposure to TB is the same for everyone - being in contact with someone who has an infectious case of TB disease4. PENNSYLVANIA STATE LAW The state laws governing issues of HIV test ing, consent, confidentiality, and counseling are : The Confidentiality of HIV -Related Information Act of Nov. 29, 1990, P.L. 585, No. 148, as amended by The Confidentiality of HIV -Related Information Act - Legislative Intent, Consent to HIV - Related Tests and Counseling Act of Jul. 7, 2011, P.L. 274, No. 59 The full text of Act 148 as amended by Act 59 can be found at https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/li/uconsCheck.cfm?yr=1990&sessInd=0&act=148 . OFFERING THE HIV TEST Consistent with the CDC's 2006 guidelines and the Act 59 Amendment, health care providers in Pennsylvania are expected to provide routine, opt -out HIV testing to their patients. How the provider offers the test makes a significant dif ference in patient acceptance. Here are some tips for framing the message: Normalize it! Introduce the HIV test as you would any other blood test. Emphasize that the HIV test is considered routine for everyone and is not being recommended due to a perceive d risk or suspicion of disease. 3 https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/testing/HIVscreening.pdf 4 https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/library/factsheets/hiv -and-tb.html Pennsylvania TB Manual 21-3 21 - Testing for HIV/TB Coinfection January 2020 Explain to patients diagnosed with or being treated for TB that it's especially important to know their HIV status since it can affect their prognosis and treatment plan. HIV TESTING PROCEDUR ES County and Municipal Health Departments County and municipal health departments (CMHDs) must comply with the provisions for HIV testing specified in the c urrent contracts with the Pennsylvania HIV and Tuberculosis programs. CMHDs and state health centers are advised to follow applicable laws , regulations and local procedures concerning HIV testing. TRAUMA -INFORMED CARE Despite significant advances in HIV treatment, a positive HIV test result remains a life -altering diagnosis for most patients. Also, many individuals have endured one or more forms of trauma, including a history of \u00ad or being witness to \u00ad physical or sexual abuse; being part of a minority or marginalized group ; social stigma ; food and housing instability ; addiction ; depression or other mental health issues. Health care providers are encouraged to follow the principles of trauma -informed care (as described in the following chart) when informing patients that they are HIV positive or have progressed to AIDS. Downloaded on December 28, 2018 from 22-1 22 - Cultural ly Competent Care January 2020 Chapter 2 2: Culturally Competent Care BACKGROUND The U.S. Census Bureau projects that over the next few decades the U.S. population will grow at a slower pace, age considerably and become more racially and ethnically diverse1. By 2030, net international migration to the U.S. is projected to overtake natural increase (defined as births minus deaths) as the primary driver of U.S. population growth. By 2045, just over 50% of the U.S. population will be Hispanic, black, Asian or multi -racial. The increasing diversity of the U.S. population challenges health care systems and individual health care providers to provide culturally competent services - especially considering that racial and ethnic diversity among U.S. physicians lags that of the country, with about 70% of primary care physicians identifying as white, though the percentage varies by primary care specialty (i.e. general, family, internal or pediatric medicine)2. The goal of culturally competent health care is to provide health care services that meet the social, cultural and linguistic needs of patients. Cultural competence can improve health outcomes and quality of care while also reducing health disparities among racial and ethnic groups3. As the cultural diversity of residents in Pennsylvania has increased over the past several decades, so too has the need to understand and practice culturally competent care. This document provides guidance for health care practices and individual health ca re providers implementing the principles of culturally competent care with their TB and other patients. CULTURAL COMPETENCE AND TUBERCULOSIS (TB ) Cultural competence is highly relevant to the provision of TB care and services. In 201 8, 70 percent of newly diagnosed cases of TB in Pennsylvania were in non-U.S. born individuals. When seeking help to diagnose and treat their illness, non-U.S. born patients often face barriers to medical care including misconceptions and stigma about TB, fear of isolation, los s of community, concerns about immigration status, instability in securing food, housing and transportation . Add in differences in the experience of illness across cultures and any one or more of these factors can challenge effective communication between physician and patient. KEY TERMS IN CULTURA LLY COMPETENT CARE There are important distinctions among the definitions for several key terms in cross -cultural care as defined below. Pennsylvania TB Manual 22-2 22 - Cultural ly Competent Care January 2020 Culture is the characteristics and knowledge of a group of people, including language, ethnicity, religion, values, customs, social habits, food, music and arts. Cultural bias is the tendency to interpret the actions and beliefs of someone from another culture through the lens of the observer's own culture. Cultural Competency is the knowledge and interpersonal skills that enable health care providers to understand, appreciate and work with individuals from other cultures. It involves an awareness and acceptance of cultural differences, self -awareness, knowledge of the patient's culture and the use of observation, listening and problem -solving skills. Cultural Knowledge is the familiarization with cultural characteristics, history, values, belief systems and behaviors of the members of another cultural group. Cultural Awareness is developing sensitivity to and understanding of another ethnic group. This usually involves internal changes in a person's attitudes and values. Cultural Sensitivity involves recognizing that differences and similarities exist between cultures - without assigning values to those differences. Diversity among and between groups of people exists on two levels. Individual characteristics that cannot be changed, such as age, race and ethnicity , are examples of primary diversity. Characteristics that can be influenced and can change over a person's lifetime, such as geographic location, marital status, religious beliefs, occupation and economic status are examples of secondary diversity. COMMON STRATEGIES IN PROVID ING CULTURALLY COMPE TENT CARE While the benefits of cultural competency are well -documented, it's equally important that health systems and medical facilities commit to providing culturally competent care. Common strategies for implemen ting culturally competent care include the following4: 1. Training - Training is essential to providing health care providers with the self - awareness, knowledge and interpersonal skills necessary to embrace and deliver culturally competent care to individuals from cultures other than their own. See the Resources section on page 22 -6 of this chapter for training resources. 2. Cultural Exposure - While it's not feasible to learn about all cultures in detail, prioritize learning about and experiencing the cultures o f patient groups represented in your practice. 3. Interpreter Services - For patients who do not speak or are not fluent in English, provide interpreter services in the language most comfortable to the patient. Determine whether interpreter services will be needed before meeting with the patient and schedule an interpreter accordingly. Use a professional, qualified interpreter. Some patients may prefer to be accompanied by a friend or relative , but avoid using friends or family as interpreters unless no other option is available. 4. Mirror the Community - As appropriate, hire physicians, nurses, outreach workers and office staff that mirror the racial and ethnic makeup of the community served. Because they speak the language and understand the cultural beliefs o f community members, Pennsylvania TB Manual 22-3 22 - Cultural ly Competent Care January 2020 they naturally create a more welcoming environment that can foster better communication. 5. Include Family and/or Community Members - A core principle in U.S. medicine is the protection of patient confidentiality, so adult patients are c ommonly seen alone. However, some cultures - and other groups such as the disabled or the elderly - may prefer or need a family member or close friend to be present during the physician visit. 6. Work with Community Leaders - Building relationships with comm unity leaders in business, places of worship, or non -traditional medicine can lead to a better understanding of community beliefs, social structure and traditions. Seek out instances where traditional beliefs overlap current medical practices and use those synergies to build credibility with patients and engage them in their care plan. 7. Provide Culturally Competent Patient Education - Wherever possible, provide patient education materials in the primary language of the patient. 8. Make Accommodations - If there are enough clinical resources, offer day and evening clinic hours to better meet the needs of your patients. For patients witho ut transportation, consider offering free tokens or tickets for public transportation. For health departments and large medical facilities, work with your local municipal or county transportation authority to see whether a public transportation stop can be added at or near your facility. GUIDANCE FOR HEALTH CARE PERSONN EL The following tips about the practice of culturally competent care are based on a presentation by Dr. Laszlo Madaras, a TB clinician who has extensive experience practic ing medicine in t he U.S. and overseas. The CONFHER Model The CONFHER5 model was designed as a tool to help clinicians apply cross -cultural concepts to patient care. The name of the model is an acronym, with each letter standing for a specific concept as follows : Communication Is the patient comfortable speaking English and can understand common health terms such as pain or fever? If not, use a professional medical in terpreter. Orientation Does the patient identify with a specific group? Where were they born? How long have they lived in the U.S.? Nutrition What are the patient's preferred foods? Are there any food taboos in their culture? Family Relationships How is fa mily defined and who is in the family? Who makes the decisions in the family? Is it important for family to be present when someone is sick? Pennsylvania TB Manual 22-4 22 - Cultural ly Competent Care January 2020 Health and Health Beliefs Some cultures believe illness is caused not by germs, but by evil spirits or something being out of balance. Education What is the person's educational level? Occupation? Religion Does the individual have any religious beliefs or restrictions that have an impact on healthcare and illness? Pennsylvania TB Manual 22-5 22 - Cultural ly Competent Care January 2020 Here are some questions that health care personnel might ask a patient when using the CONFHER model as a guide: Before meeting with a patient, try to determine whether they are comfortable speaking in English. If not, arrange for a professional medical in terpreter who speaks the patient's primary language to be available in person or via phone. Avoid asking a family member or friend to interpret unless no other option is available. Cross -Cultural Communication DO speak directly to the patient, even if using an interpreter. DO avoid using medical jargon. DO pay attention to nonverbal behavioral cues by the patient. DO encourage questions. DO respect the patient's privacy and modesty. Don't use family members - espe cially children - to interpret. Don't ignore cultural differences e.g., some cultures view looking at someone directly as a sign of aggression. Don't rely on brochures to communicate - they can reinforce your conversation but should not replace it. Don't shout - not being comfortable speaking English doesn't mean the person is hard of hearing. Pennsylvania TB Manual 22-6 22 - Cultural ly Competent Care January 2020 Behavioral Cues Be aware of the following behavioral cues when talking with a patient: If a patient shows signs of impatience or annoyance during your conversation, that may indicate intercultural misunderstanding. If a patient asks you personal questions, that may indicate a cultural need to establish trust and reassurance. Hesitation by the patient when talking with you may mean you've hit a cultural w all. Try to treat the patient the way he or she wants to be treated - not the way you like to be treated. If patients repeat your instructions exactly, it's possible they are repeating your words without understanding them. Rephrase your instructions and a sk the patient to restate in his or her own words. It's not possible for anyone to be familiar with all cultures or with all aspects of any one culture. However, by striving to be open -minded, non -judgmental and genuinely interested in understanding th e patient's cultural background and context, physicians can engender the trust and cooperation of patients from different cultures, ultimately resulting in a better health outcome for the patient. If you have questions about cultural ly competent care, contact the TB Program at 717 -787-6267.

The Interjurisdictional TB Notification (IJN) will assist Pennsylvania health departments to facilitate and standardize communication to enhance continuity and completeness of care. It should also improve outcome evaluation of verified cases. POLICY The Pennsylvania Department of Health's (PADOH) TB p rogram is responsible for the coordination of IJNs when a patient moves in or out of the commonwealth . Loca l state health centers (SHCs) and county/municipal health d epartments (CM HDs) should notify the PA DOH TB program central o ffice when a pa tient plans or moves to another jurisdiction out side of Pennsylvania. The local SHC s and CM HDs within the state are responsible to notify other local SHC s or CMHD s if a patient moves to their jurisdiction. An IJN is not required if a patient is transferrin g to another jurisdiction within the state of Pennsylvania . PROCEDURES I.TB cases transferring within Pennsylvania and the United States A.TB cases transferring into Pennsylvania : The TB p rogram's clerk typist III will: 1.Receive the IJN via fax from a state health department. 2.Stamp the date received on the IJN. 3.Provide the IJN to the TB TB surveillance c oordinator will: includ ing: a.referring jurisdiction (city, c ounty, state and date s ent); and b.contact person, phone and f ax. 2.Open a new investigation in NEDS S for the following case statuses with all pertinent information from the IJD 3.Fax to data into the interjurisdictional database . 5.File IJN in respective general o ffice file folders ( verified case/ close contact/LTBI). Create new folders each year. B.TB cases transferring out of Pennsylvania 1.SHC or CMHD staff will complete the IJN and submit it to the TB p rogram central office as follows: State health center s - via the TB Resource Account at TB_Program_Central_Office@pa.gov County or municipal health departments - via fax to the TB program at 717-971-3001 The clerk t ypist III will: 1.Receive the IJN via fax or in the TB Resource Account . 2.Stamp the date received on the IJN. 3.Provide the IJN to the TB surveillance c oordinator will: 1.Review the ensure all information is in PA-NEDSS. 2.Fax IJN to respective state health department TB c ontrol program in new state jurisdiction. 3.Enter data on IJN into the interjurisdictional database. 4.File IJN in respective general office file folders (Verified case/Close contact/LTBI). Create new folders each year. 5.For IJNs associated with an electronic disease n otification (EDN), review the EDN follow -up worksheet - ensur ing that it includes a notation of the patient's new address - and provide a copy to the clerk typist III. The clerk typist III will: 1.Enter the follow -up worksheet data into the EDN system to include processing the change in address. C. TB cases transferring to another county w ithin Pennsylvania SHC or CMHD staff will: 1.Contact new jurisdiction with all pertinent patient information. 2.Ensure patient information is updated and transfer to new jurisdiction in PA - NEDSS . II.International TB n otifications A.If a patient moves outside of the United States , an international TB n otification should be coordinated (with the patient's consent) with one of the services listed23-3 23 - IJNs (TBPCO 3.17.17) Pennsylvania TB Manual February 2022 below. Referrals must be noted in the patient's PA-NEDSS investigation indicating that a referral was sent. TB Net , part of the Migrant Clinicians Network Phone: 800-825-8205 or CureTB , a collaboration between the CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (DGMQ) and the San Diego County TB about interjurisdictional transfers outside the U.S. can be found on the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/tb/programs/international/default.htm . B.In cases where patient consent cannot be obtained and there is a public health risk due to active TB disease, the following procedures should be followed: SHC or CMHD staff coordinator will: 1.Review international TB form for completeness and appropriateness of referral. 2.If determined to be appropriate, f orward the international notification form to the appropr iate international jurisdiction . 3.Contact the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (DHMQ) at the Philadelphia airport in cases where a flight investigation or Do Not Board procedures may need to be initiated. III. IJN Definitions , Forms, and Instructions for Initiation and Completion A.Definitions Referring jurisdiction : The jurisdiction that i nitiates the i nterjurisdictional TB notification. For most verified active TB disease and s uspect cases, the referring jurisdiction will be the same as the reporting jurisdiction. Reporting jurisdiction : The jurisdiction that reports a v erified active TB disease patient to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and, therefore, counts the case in their jurisdiction. Receiving jurisdiction : The jurisdiction that receives the i nterjurisdictional TB notification. 23-4 23 Manual February 2022 RVCT : The Report of Verified Case of TB is the national form used to report a verified case to the CDC. Follow -up 2 ( F/U 2 ): The F ollow -up 2 is the national form used to report outcomes of verified cases to the CDC . B. Forms Interjurisdictional TB N otification : Provides a standard array of information to be transm itted to new jurisdictions for active TB disease and s uspect cases, contacts, persons with LTBI and source case findings. A copy of the Interjurisdictional TB Notification form can be obtained by going to the following webpage: http://www.tbcontrollers.org/docs/resources/IJN_Form_May2015 . Interjurisdictional TB Notification Follow -up: Provides a standard array of follow -up information to be transmitted bac k to referring jurisdictions. A copy of the Interjurisdictional TB Notification Follow -up form can be obtained by going to the following webpage: http://www.tbcontrollers.org/docs/resources/IJN_F ollowUpForm_November2014 . International TB Notification : Provides a stan dard array of information to be transmitted to a new ju risdiction for active TB cases. A copy of the IJN form c an be obtained by going to the following CDC webpage: https://www.cdc.gov/tb/programs/international/internat_proces.htm . Note: The IJN form should be initiated by the SHC or the CMHD and sent to the TB program central office . Interjurisdictional paperwork should be sent to the TB program prior to sending any paperwork to the patient's new jurisdiction. The TB program will then forward the IJD to the out -of-state jurisdiction. C.The following situations are when an IJN should b e initiated: 1.For active TB disease and s uspect cases who move out of the state . 2.When active TB disease and s uspect case patients will be moving out of the state for 30 days or more. Notification may be initiated for patients with shorter planned stays or less than 30 days of treatment remaining at the time of their move, at the discretion of the referring jurisdiction. (For example, if a patient must continue DOT after he/she move s, a notification should be initiated.) 3.For close contacts to AFB sm ear positive or smear negative a ctive TB disease pulmonary cases. If there are multiple contacts to the same case, they should have individual TB notifications sent. 4.For documented TB i nfectio n (LTBI convertors) who have initiated treatment and who will be moving out of the state for 30 days or more. The results and dates of the last negative skin test and the first positive skin test must be entered into the Contact/LTBI section of the IJN to provide information on when the skin test conversion occurred.23-5 23 - IJNs (TBPCO 3.17.17) i nfection (LTBI reactors) who have initiated treatment and who will be moving out of the area for 30 days or more. For LTBI patients, include specific risk factors for disease p rogression to assist receiving jurisdictions in prioritizing follow -up. 6.For investigation of close associates to a n active TB disease index case when that index case has a clinical presentation consistent with recently acquired disease (e.g. , children who are <3 years of age). Notifications should not routinely be sent to perform source case finding for a child with LTBI . D. The following situations are when initiation of an IJN is optional or not required. 1.Notification is optional for contacts, LTBI and source case findings. 2.Notifications should not be sent for contacts, LTBI and source case findings unless reasonable locating information , usually consisting of at least a street address or phone number, is available . 3.An IJN is not required if a patient moves to another jurisdiction in Pennsylvania. 4.An IJN is not required for B1/B2 patients who have not been evaluated or seen in a SHC or CMHD. E. Instructions for completing the IJN form Indicate when key information is unknown or pending ; do not just leave the section blank. 1.Referring jurisdiction i nformation : Complete all information to provide specific contact information for the receiving jurisdiction. 2.Referral c ategory : Specify the type of p atient referral. For verified cases, supply the RVCT number and the state that reported the case to the CDC. This will allow the receiv ing jurisdiction to ensure the f ollow -up form is sent to the reporting jurisdiction. Attach the RVCT form whenever possible. For classified immigrants , attach pertinent overseas forms when available. 3.Patient i nformation : Complete all information. If some elements are unknown, indicate this in the space provided. The emergency contact should be a relative or as sociate who is likely to have locating information about the referred patient. 4.Clinical i nformation: When some or all of the laboratory information is pending at the time of referral, the referring jurisdiction should indicate this and update the information when available. To ensure rapid transfer of information, updates should be acc omplished by faxing an updated n otification form or by calling the receiving jur isdiction. The tuberculin skin test ( TST) information in this section should be used for cases/suspects only. Attach copies of laboratory and X -ray information whenever possible. The \"Other \" section should include additional ty pes of tests including compu terized tomography ) - attach copies the whenever possible.23-6 23 - IJNs (TBPCO 3.17.17) Pennsylvania TB Manual February 2022 5.Contact/LTBI i nformation: This section should be used for contacts, convertors and reactors. The TB skin test #1 and #2 should be completed for all convertor referrals and for other referrals when appropriate. For contact referrals, exposure information should be completed to enhance appropriate investigation by the receiving jurisdiction. 6.Medications: Complete as indicated. Supply a dherence information that may be of import ance to the receiving jurisdiction for appropriate patient management. 7.Follow -up: All active TB disease and s uspect case referrals require an IJN follow -up form to be sent by the receiving jurisdiction. For other referral categories, the referri ng area should indicate if the f ollow -up form is requested. Note that the ultimate decision to provide follow -up for contacts and pat ients with LTBI is at the discretion of the receiving jurisdiction. F.Initiation of the IJN follow -up form The IJN follow -up form should be initiated by the SHC or the C MHD and sent to the TB p rogram central office . The TB program will forward the f ollow -up form to the proper jurisdiction. The situations when an IJN follow -up form should be initiated are: 1.An interjurisdictional TB notification f ollow -up form should be used to communicate back to the referring jurisdiction when final disposition of the patient is known. 2.Thirty -day status: At 30 days after notification was received, a status report should be sent to the referring jurisdiction. In instances when the patient is not located within 30 days, \"lost\" will be considered to represent the final disposition. If the patient is subsequently located, an update should be s ent to the referring jurisdiction using the follow -up form. 3.Interim status: This m ay be sent if an interim update in status is appropriate. 4.Final status: This is w hen a final status is known. G.Instructions for completing the IJN TB follow -up form 1.Date No tification Received: Receiving jurisdiction should indicate the date the IJN referral was received. 2.Status: a.Thirty days: At 30 days after notification was received, a status report should be sent to the referring jurisdiction. In instances when the patient is not located within 30 days, \"lost\" will be considered to represent the final disposition. If the patient is su bsequently located, an update should be sent to the re ferring jurisdiction using the f ollow - up form. b.Interim: This status s hould be used whenever updated information needs to be sen t to the referring jurisdiction. c.Final: This is t o be used at the time a fi nal status is known.23-7 23 - IJNs (TBPCO 3.17.17) Pennsylvania 3.Return f ollow -up form to: The receiving jurisdiction should complete this information using the contact information provided on the original IJN referral form. 4.Patient information : Complete as indicated. 5.Case: Final outcome in the receiving jurisdiction will be indicated. The follow - up form should be sent to the reporting jurisdiction. The original reporting area will be responsible for providing follow -up form results to CDC. 6.Suspect: The receiving juri sdiction will indicate whether the suspect case was active, and , if so, the method of verification. In some cases, the referring jurisdiction may still be the appropriate jurisdiction to report the case. If so, the receiving jurisdiction should also provid e a final follow -up status and follow -up form to the reporting jurisdiction. This section can also be used to provide follow -up information for individuals investigated as part of a source case finding. 7.Contact: Some jurisdictions may not provide follow -up on all contact referrals and should indicate, \"No follow -up performed\" on the 30 -day status report. If follow -up is performed, indicate the final outcome. Whenever possible, the receiving jurisdiction should attach contact follow -up information including screening dates and results, as well as treatment dates and outcome. This will assist the referring area in completing contact information required by the CDC. 8.LTBI : Some jurisdictions may not provide follow -up on all LTBI referrals and should indicate, \"no follow -up performe d\" on the 30 -day status report. If follow -up is performed and the patient is located, indicate the outcome. This section can also be used to provi de follow -up information for convertors.Pennsylvania TB Manual 24-1 24 - TB Services During a Public Health Emergency December 2020 Chapter 2 4: Providing T uberculosis (TB) Services During a Public Health Emergency BACKGROUND A public health emergency can be the result of an outbreak of an infectious disease, the emergence of a new pathogen, natural causes such as severe weather, accidents such as an explosion at a refinery or plant that releases toxic fumes or radiation, threats to public safety resulting in curfews or restricted access to certain geographic areas or acts of domestic terrorism. Even when redeployin g public and private healthcare resources to address a public health emergency, it remains critically important to continue provid ing TB services. T B is the world's deadliest infectious disease and kills about 1.5 million people worldwide every year - or more than 4,000 men, women and children per day . As the primary provider of TB services, public health personnel evaluat e patients for TB, treat patients diagnosed with TB disease or latent TB infection (LTBI), complete contact investigat ions for patients with infectious TB to prevent the spread of TB, assess patient response to treatment, and monitor patients for side effects and adverse reactions. During a public health emergency, public health personnel need to quickly devise and implement creative, efficient and safe ways to continue providing critical TB services - while also protecting their own health and safety . This document provides guidance for providing TB services during a public health emergen cy based on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention1 (CDC) , the Pennsylvania (PA) TB medical consultants and the PA TB program . PRIORITY TB SERVICES During the C OVID -19 outbreak , the CDC recommended prioritizing patient care services considering the following factors: The level of community transmission in the service area ; Characteristics of the populations to be served; Local capacity to implement effective prevention and control activi ties; and Availability of effective interventions 1 Specifically, the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) at the CDC Pennsylvania TB Manual 24-2 24 - TB Services During a Public Health Emergency December 2020 The first factor can be modified based on the nature of the specific public health emergency. Table 1: CDC Recommendations for Priority TB Services Based on Levels of Community Transmission lists the recommended priority TB services in situations where the community impact of the public health emergency is none to minimal or minimal to substantial. TABLE 1: CDC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRIORITY TB SERVICES BASED ON LEVELS OF COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION CDC Recommendations for Priority TB Services In Communities with None to Minimal Transmission In Communities with Minimal to Su bstantial Transmission Services for clients for whom medical management cannot be delayed or interrupted: Initial evaluation and treatment of patients with suspected or confirmed TB disease Clinical follow -up of patients on treatment for suspected or confirmed TB disease Directly observed therapy (DOT) of patients on treatment for suspected or confirmed TB disease Evaluation of high -risk contacts to infectious TB patients Treatment initiation of contacts diagnosed with TB disease or LTBIInitial evaluation and treatment of patients with suspected or confirmed TB disease Clinical follow -up of patients on treatment for suspected or confirmed TB disease Directly observed therapy (DOT) of patients on treatment for suspected or confirmed TB disease Evaluation of high -risk contact s to infectious TB patients Treatment initiation of contacts diagnosed with TB disease or LTBI Services that could be continued or delayed depending on local circumstances: Evaluation of low -risk contacts to infectious TB patients Targeted TB testing Evaluation of Class B immigrants and refugees Administrative TB screening Source: Interim CDC Guidance on Handling Non -COVID -19 Public Health Activities that Require Face -to-Face Interaction with Clients in the Clinic and the Field in the Curren t COVID -19 Pandemic; April 8, 2020. Download ed on June 9, 2020 at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/hcp/non -covid -19-client -interaction.html In addit ion to the above guidance, Dr. Edward Zuroweste, medical consultant to the T B program , recommends that i ndividuals (including t hose with EDN referrals) be prioritized for TB evaluation based on their risk of progressing from LTBI to TB disease. Individuals with the highest risk of progression - especially children - should be evaluated first. ALTERNATE METHODS OF PATIENT CONTACT Under normal circumstances, patients are seen in -person for a range of TB services. During a public health emergency , public health personnel are encouraged to increase the use of alternate methods of patient contact . Pennsylvania TB Manual 24-3 24 - TB Services During a Public Health Emergency December 2020 Telehealth Visits Telehealth visits are an acceptable alternative to in -person visits if : \u00ad The TB clinici an determines that the objectives of the patient visit can successfully be met through a telehealth visit. Factors to consider in making that determination include the rea son for the telehealth visit, the patient's medical history and current medical issues, and the patient's ability to communicate with the TB clinician or nurse. \u00ad The telehealth technology is compliant with the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Port ability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) . The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible for enforcing HIPAA regulations . The OCR has the authority not to impose penalties on healthcare providers for HIPAA violations during a public health emergency if \"patients are served on a good faith basis\". For the most up -to-date status o f HIPAA enforcement, refer to the health information privacy page on the HHS website at https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html . In-person Visits The following patients need to be seen in -person either in TB clinic or through a house call by the TB clinician : \u00ad Patients with TB disease who are not responding to treatment ; and \u00ad Any patients with TB disease or LTBI experiencing side effects or adverse reactions . TB clinicians may choose to visit a patient where they live in order to evaluate the individual for TB disease and/or monitor their response to treatment. Proper health and safety precautions should be followed by the clinician when visiting a patient , taking into account the need for personal protective equipment (PPE) and the nature of the patient's place of residence (e.g. , a private residence or a congregate setting such as a nursing home or homeless shelter ). Video DOT To optimize personnel resources during a public health emergency, video DOT may be used with the explicit approval of the TB clinician for appropriate TB patients and LTBI patients on the once -weekly, 12 -dose regimen of isoniazid plus rifapentine. As with telehealth visits, only those telehealth technologies compliant with HIPAA privacy protections should be used . DELIVERY OF TB MEDICATIONS TO PATIENTS Alternative methods of delivering TB medications to patients will likely be necessary during a public health emergency. Options include: Pennsylvania TB Manual 24-4 24 - TB Services During a Public Health Emergency December 2020 Provid ing the patient with enough medication to self -medicate until the next scheduled in - person DOT or clinic appointment ; Personally d eliver ing medication directly to the patient . Based on the specific circumstances, clinic personnel or outreach workers can deliver medications using a \"no-contact\" delivery procedure or with appropriate PPE ; and Implement ing curbside or drive -through medication delivery at the public health facility or a nearby parking area on specified dates and times or by individual appointment . The TB program does not recommend mailing medications to patients . COLLECTION OF SPECIMEN SAMPLES The collection and bacteriologic testing of specimen samples is a core element of the diagnostic p rocess. The initial clinical evaluation of a patient for TB should include specimen collection as appropriate. Refer to Chapter 5: Diagnosis of LTBI and TB Disease of the PA TB Manual for guidance on the collection and testing of specimen samples. PATIENT RECORDS While patient care is the priority , maintaining accurate, concise and timely patient records remains a key task during a public health emergency. During prolonged periods of long hours and multiple responsibilities , it becomes even more difficult to recall conversations and key information can be lost . Patient records should be maintained in accordance with local policies and procedures. If it's not practical to document progress notes in the patient's record during or immediately after a patient encounter, consider capturing the key points in notes orga nized by the PA National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (PA NEDSS) investigation number - avoiding the use of any personally identifiable information. Th e information can subsequently be entered in the patient's chart or electronic health record . Progress notes and other pertinent information should be entered as soon as practicable in PA NEDSS or any future surveillance system used by the PA Department of Health. In some instances, TB Program staff may provide alternate guidance concerning entry of surveillance data in PA -NEDSS. TB PATIENTS NEEDING HELP WITH BASIC NEEDS Patients having difficulty meeting their basic needs for food, shelter or transportation during a public health emergency will find it even harder to successfully complete their TB treatment. Local public health jurisdictions are encouraged to submit a req uest for Reimold funds to assist such patients . Refer to Chapter 17 : Reimold Trust Fund of the PA TB Manual for guidance on how to submit a request for Reimold funds. "}
