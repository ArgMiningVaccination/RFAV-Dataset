Ryze is a mushroom coffee brand that's used for physical and mental health benefits. The company suggests their product can support energy, focus, gut health and immunity. But does Ryze contain research-backed ingredients for supporting mental and physical health, or are these just marketing claims? Does the brand use any questionable additive ingredients? How do real users rate and describe the effects of Ryze? And what retailer sells Ryze coffee for the best price? In this article we'll answer all of these questions and more, as we analyze the ingredients in Ryze based on medical studies to give our take on whether the brand is likely to support optimal health, or if it's a waste of money. We'll feature unsponsored customer reviews, and provide a cost comparison to show which retailer sells Ryze for the best price. We'll also provide our thoughts on how Ryze compares to other adaptogenic coffee brands on the market, and which is the best. Ingredient Analysis The ingredients in Ryze's mushroom blend are shown above. All of the mushrooms used have research backing for supporting health. Here are a few examples: Reishi mushroom was shown in a 2017 clinical trial to support brain health and reduce neurodegeneration, but this was an animal study and not a human study. Turkey tail mushroom may support immune function according to a clinical trial published in the BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies journal. Overall, we're not convinced of the functional benefits of mushroom blends for any specific outcome, but these are nutritious whole food ingredients that have been used medicinally for thousands of years. We find this to be a safe and healthy blend. Where Ryze stands apart is that its other ingredients are entirely clean: Organic coffee provides caffeine that's likely to make this blend more nootropic than caffeine-free mushroom blends. Organic coconut milk and organic MCT oil are the flavoring and texture additives, and are nutritious whole foods. There are no unhealthy ingredients in this formulation, so we recommend Ryze Mushroom Coffee from a formulation perspective. We consider Ryze more likely to have a nootropic (cognitive-enhancing) effect than brands like MUD\\WTR due to the caffeine from the coffee included. But how do real users rate and describe the effects of Ryze? We'll feature unsponsored customer reviews in the next section. Real Users Try Ryze A YouTube creator named \"HunterTheHill\" has an entertaining video reviewing Ryze where he explains why he's not a fan of the taste: A YouTube creator named Lauren Vacula explains why she switched from regular coffee to Ryze mushroom coffee, and shares three Ryze coffee recipes: Does Ryze Cause Side Effects? Ryze mushroom coffee doesn't appear to have been studied in any clinical trials, which makes it challenging to determine potential side effects. However, we can make an educated guess based on the ingredients. Edible mushrooms have been consumed by humans for thousands of years, and the fact that Ryze uses whole plant ingredients rather than more potent extracts reduces the risk of side effects. Coffee can cause anxiety, heart palpitations and headaches according to a 2018 medical review, but we find this highly unlikely for Ryze coffee given that it only provides 48 milligrams (mg) of caffeine per serving, which is less than half of the dose in one standard coffee cup. Overall, we do not consider Ryze likely to cause side effects in otherwise healthy adults. There is no mention of side effects caused by the product on Ryze's website, and the brand actually suggests that their product may be a good fit for those who experience side effects from regular coffee. Where to Buy Ryze for the Best Price Ryze coffee is sold at a variety of online retailers. Here's a price breakdown at the time of publishing this article: Even though the brand's website requires a subscription, they offer a 30-day money-back guarantee, and it's so much cheaper than at third-party retailers that this seems to be the best bet. What are the Health Benefits of Functional Mushrooms? A YouTube video from the \"FreshCap Mushrooms\" channel discusses some of the potential health benefits of functional mushrooms, including the types used in Ryze: Pros and Cons of Ryze Here are the pros and cons of Ryze mushroom coffee in our opinion: Pros: All whole food ingredients Healthy formulation More nutritious than regular coffee Less likely to cause side effects than regular coffee Mushroom active ingredients may have functional benefits Cons: Doesn't appear clinically tested Some users complain about \"mushroom\" taste Get our most popular articles straight to your inbox Stay up-to-date on our research reviews Conclusion Ryze is one of the better mushroom coffee brands we've reviewed on Illuminate Health, primarily because it actually contains some coffee (which is more likely to have a stimulating and nootropic effect than mushrooms). The 48 mg of caffeine per serving is still enough to improve mental acuity, while being low enough to prevent everyone except the most sensitive individuals from experiencing caffeine side effects. The mushroom ingredients in Ryze are nutritious and likely to support overall health, but we haven't come across any convincing medical evidence that these mushrooms at these doses have any specific functional benefit (nor does the brand cite any on their product page). We do not consider Ryze likely to cause side effects in otherwise healthy adults. At the time of publishing this article, the brand's website has the best price on Ryze mushroom coffee by far. "}
