Lai Lehigh University kwl409@lehigh.edu September 30, 2019 Abstract Since Wake eld et al. (1998), the public was exposed to mixed information sur- rounding the claim that measles-mumps-rubella vaccine causes autism. A persistent trend to delay the vaccination during 1998{2011 in the US was driven by children of college-educated mothers, suggesting that these mothers held biases against the vaccine in uenced by the early unfounded claim. Consistent with con rmatory bias , exposures to negative information about the vaccine strengthened their biases more than expo- sures to positive information attenuated them. Positive online information, however, had strong impacts on vaccination decisions, suggesting that online dissemination of vaccine-safety information may help tackle the sticky misinformation.

A case in point is the media coverage on the safety of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Psychologists have documented in the laboratory that, when presented with ambiguous or mixed evidence, people tend to select and interpret information in a way that con rms their existing posi- tions, a tendency termed con rmatory bias (e.g., Oskamp, 1965; Darley and Gross, 1983). In this paper, we utilize the controversy over the link between the MMR vaccine and autism as a natural experiment to investigate how health decisions respond to mixed information and whether there is evidence that they are a ected by con rmatory bias. The MMR-autism controversy was initiated by Wake eld et al. (1998). Based on a self- selected sample of 12 children, the study claimed to have found a connection between the measles virus and the in ammatory bowel disease found in autistic children. The connection was somehow promoted as an evidence linking the MMR vaccine to the risk of developing autism. A substantial body of subsequent studies based on more rigorous research protocols and larger samples consistently reached an opposite conclusion (e.g., Taylor et al., 1999; Madsen et al., 2002). In 2004, based on a systematic review of research studies, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued its nal report concluding that no convincing evidence exists for the casual MMR-autism link.2In the same year, Wake eld et al. (1998) was partially retracted, followed by a complete retraction in 2010 in which the journal's editor noted that \\it was utterly clear, without any ambiguity at all, that the statements in the paper were utterly false.\" While by 2004 the issue was beyond debate in the scienti c community, the public was still presented with con icting messages, ranging from celebrities' anti-vaccination speeches to emotional stories from parents of autistic children to assurances of vaccine safety from authorities. Figure 1 presents, for the period 1998 to 2011, the annual proportion of children between 1Wake eld et al. (2010) surveyed evidence on the outcomes of mass media health campaigns and concluded that they could result in positive changes or prevent negative changes in health behavior. For example, they documented that campaigns aimed at reducing tobacco use and preventing cardiovascular diseases could produce measurable health bene ts. See also Jacobsen and Jacobsen (2011) who documented the e ectiveness of awareness campaigns in promoting earlier detection of diseases. 2The IOM was the predecessor of the Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. At the request of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, the Immunization Safety Review Committee was formed by the IOM to examine the safety of vaccines. The committee issued in total eight reports. The rst report on the MMR-vaccine link appeared in 2001. While ruling out the link at the population level, this rst report recommended further research to investigate rare individual cases. The 2004 report reached the conclusion that the existing body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal e ect between the MMR vaccine and autism and that the potential biological mechanisms for vaccine-induced autism proposed so far are sheer theoretical. 10.060.070.080.090.10 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 20 07 2008 2009 2010 2011NonUptake Rate YearMMR Vaccine NonUptake Rate in the U.S. Figure 1: MMR Vaccine Non-Uptake Rate in the US, 1998{2011 19 and 35 months of age whose immunization records indicated delay in the MMR immuniza- tion. The percentage, which represents our outcome variable, the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate, increased after Wake eld et al. (1998) was published. It went back down as studies disapproving the MMR-autism link were accumulating. Interestingly, the rate climbed back up drastically after 2004, the year when the IOM issued its nal report and when the public began to receive increasingly more mixed information about the safety of the vaccine. Prior studies using UK data indicated that more educated parents held stronger biases against the vaccine. The increase in the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate in the UK in response to Wake eld et al. (1998), from 1997 up to 2005, was found to be driven by children of more educated parents (e.g., Wright and Polack, 2006; Anderberg et al., 2011). A contemporaneous study by Chang (2018), which covered the period from 1995 to 2006, documented a similar educational gap in the US. Using 1998 as the base year, we evaluate annual changes in the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate in the US till 2011, dividing the sample by the college-education status of the mother. As the starting point of our principal investigation, we nd that the educational gap in the US was persistent and became even wider after the periods covered by these other studies. The nding suggests that the biases held by the more educated US mothers against the vaccine did not subside|in fact strengthened|after consensus was reached in the scienti c community that the vaccine does not cause autism. We estimate the di erential time trend of the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate of the college- educated group. Interpreting the di erential trend as measuring the strength of the educated mothers' biases, we investigate how exposures to information with di erent positions about the safety of the vaccine in uence the biases. Our identi cation strategy exploits state-year variations in a set of active and passive exposures to broadly de ned media information. We measure active exposures by the search intensity indexes of related topics obtained from Google Trends. For passive exposures, we manually review and classify relevant newspaper coverage retrieved from LexisNexis Academic and collect reported incidences of autism and MMR from the O\u000ece of Special Education Programs and the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly 2Report. We classify all information exposures in our sample into positive, ones that encourage immunization, and negative, ones that discourage immunization. Our main nding is the substantial asymmetry in the responses to positive and negative information about the MMR vaccine. A one-standard-deviation increase in exposures to neg- ative information strengthened the biases of the college-educated mothers by more than 35%; by contrast, a one-standard-deviation increase in exposures to positive information attenu- ated the biases by no more than 10%. The college-educated group responded more strongly to information consistent with their biases against the vaccine (e.g., news reports of unexplained increase in autism cases) than to information that is in opposition to the biases (e.g., reports citing the conclusion reached by the IOM). The nding provides population-level evidence of con rmatory bias at work in the rising trend of the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate in the US.3 Our study contributes to the literature on education gradients that are observed in a variety of health outcomes (e.g., Currie and Moretti, 2003; Lleras-Muney, 2005; de Walque, 2007; Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010). The study that is closest to ours in this literature is Chang (2018). We both documented an extended educational gap in the US in the responses to the MMR-autism controversy, partially corroborating the previous UK ndings.4Chang (2018) also studied the impacts of the media, focusing on newspapers, radio, and television. She found that the educational gap increased with greater media attention to the controversy. We di er in a number of ways. Some of the less crucial di erences are the longer periods we cover and our di erent media data, which include traditional newspaper coverage as well as online searches. With online information becoming an indispensable source of information for many people, our inclusion of this type of media provides a fuller picture of the information that may in uence vaccination decisions. The primary di erence between the two studies, however, lies in the di erent questions addressed. While Chang (2018) did not distinguish between positive and negative media coverage, our principal inquiry concerns the di erent impacts of information with alterna- tive positions about the MMR vaccine. A common explanation for health-related education gradients is that education allows more e ective absorptions of medical information, which are re ected in health behavior (Grossman, 1972). Our ndings point to a downside associ- ated with this better ability to absorb information: the initially absorbed information may 3Using a randomized controlled trial, Nyhan et al. (2014) obtained a complementary nding in which they showed that the e ectiveness of pro-vaccine messages may vary depending on parents' existing attitudes. 4Covering the period 1993{2004, Wright and Polack (2006) found that the MMR non-uptake rate increased signi cantly in almost all areas of England since 2000, where the non-uptake rate increased more slowly in areas with higher proportion of population with lower education. Anderberg et al. (2011) covered the period 1997{2005 and similarly documented an educational gradient since 1999. They, however, found that the UK educational gap vanished by the end of the period covered, whereas both Chang (2018) and our study found that in the US the gap persisted well into 2005 and beyond. A US study preceding our studies is Smith et al. (2008). They found a decline in MMR immunization in 1999 and 2000 and a limited in uence of newspaper coverage of the controversy during that period of time. 3hinder subsequent absorptions of more up-to-date and accurate information in the presence of cognitive biases. Our nding on the asymmetric responses to information suggests that the persistent decline in the MMR immunization of the more educated group, even after the vaccine has been proved safe, may be a consequence of this e ect. While Chang (2018) left the educational gap as a puzzle and discuss possible explanations, we provide a theoretical model and empirical evidence pointing to asymmetric responses to information, as would be driven by con rmatory bias, as a plausible culprit.5 This brings us to another contribution of our study. While laboratory evidence documents the existence of con rmatory bias, few studies have examined such biases in a real-world setting. To the best of our knowledge, our study presents the rst naturally occurring evidence consistent with the presence of con rmatory bias in health decisions.6 Our study also contributes a policy suggestion for what may be an e ective channel to counter the misinformation surrounding the MMR vaccine and for correct information to take root. We nd that among the di erent types of information considered online information has the strongest impact on vaccination decisions, and this is true not only for negative information but also for positive information. The nding suggests that online dissemination of vaccine-safety information may be an e ective way to tackle the adverse consequences of the previously circulated misinformation that lingered under the documented biases. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a more detailed account of the MMR-autism controversy, bringing to view the prevalence of mixed information during the period. Section 3 describes the data and the sample. Section 4 examines the di erential trend of the MMR vaccine non-uptake rates between children of college-educated and non-college- educated mothers. The trend analysis establishes the biases held by the more educated group against the vaccine. Section 5 analyzes, both theoretically and empirically, the asymmetric responses to mixed information about the MMR vaccine. Section 6 concludes with discussion 5Our ndings should not, however, be interpreted as suggesting that education contributes or leads to con rmatory bias. Psychologists consider con rmatory bias as a fundamental trait of human reasoning, and cognitive psychological studies provide no clear evidence that education levels are associated with higher or lower degree of the bias (e.g., Griggs and Ransdell, 1986; Jackson and Griggs, 1988; Calikli and Bener, 2015). This common human bias may or may not manifest in observed decisions. Education, by potentially creating di erential absorptions of information among the more and the less educated, provides a medium through which the bias can be registered in naturally occurring data, in a sense not too dissimilar to psychological studies using controlled laboratory tasks to detect the bias in experimental data. The interpretation of our ndings in this regard should be limited to that the documented asymmetric responses to positive and negative information by the college-educated group relative to the non-college-educated group provide evidence that di erent education levels allow con rmatory bias to exert di erent in uences on them. 6Since we do not observe actual information exposures at the individual level, our empirical method has relied on the assumption of homogeneous information exposures within states. The results we obtain are therefore \\intent-to-treat\" estimates, and our nding supporting the presence of con rmatory bias in vaccination decisions is a population-level evidence. Given that individual data on information exposures are unlikely to be available short of a controlled environment, this is probably the farthest one can go for studies relying on naturally occurring data. Andrews et al. (2018) presented evidence on con rmatory bias in the Associated Press Top 25 College Football Poll in which expert pollsters are tasked with assessing team quality. 4Table 1: Major Events Surrounding the MMR-Autism Controversy, 1988{2011 Year Event Classi cation 1998 (a) Wake eld et al.

We classify an event according to the perspective that it conveys to the public about the safety of the vaccine, whether it is positive (encouraging vaccination) or negative (discouraging vaccination). 5The classi ed events in Table 1 reveal that mixed information was prevalent during the controversy. Those who sent positive information to the public included health authorities, mainstream scientists, and the O\u000ece of Special Masters of the US Court of Federal Claims, commonly referred to as the \\Vaccine Court.\"7They all refuted the claim that childhood vaccines cause autism, by either conducting new and reviewing existing research, publishing books, or delivering ruling decisions [events (c), (d), (e), (k), (o), (r), (s), and (t)]. The outbreaks of mumps and measles in 2006 and 2008 among unvaccinated persons (Omer et al., 2009) also should have reminded the public of the importance of adhering to the childhood vaccine schedule [events (h) and (n)]. In fact, these outbreaks caused health organizations to actively advocate the bene ts of the MMR vaccine. Despite the assurance from the mainstream entities, ever since the publication and the media coverage of Wake eld et al. (1998), the conception that the MMR vaccine and autism are related took root among certain group of parents. Through articles and books, activists and celebrities promoted their views or personal experiences that the vaccine-autism link was real [events (f), (g), (i), (l), (p), and (q)]. The skepticism even fueled some conspiracy theory; a 2005 Rolling Stone article, which purported that health agencies colluded with pharmaceutical companies to cover up the risk of vaccines, almost threw the government into a trust crisis. The compensation made by the Vaccine Court for Hannah Poling, who su ered from a rare pre-existing disease with resulting developmental disorders that were ruled as worsened by vaccines, was perceived by some parents as tacit acknowledgement by the government that vaccines cause autism [event (j)]. Perhaps because there were no readily available explanations for the drastic increase in autism cases during the period, the purported link to the MMR vaccine was appealing to many parents and received wide publicity (Dannetun et al., 2005). To appreciate the scope of con icting information prevailed during the controversy, it is useful to review two other claims about the risks of childhood vaccines. One of the claims con- cerns thimerosal, a preservative that has ceased to be used in childhood vaccines since 2001.8 It has been suggested that the mercury-based preservative is linked to autism. Although the connection has been disputed by scientists (Stehr-Green et al., 2003; Verstraeten et al., 2003; Price et al., 2010), and thimerosal was never used in the MMR vaccine, the MMR-autism and the thimerosal-autism links were frequently referred to together. Some even mistakenly reported that the MMR vaccine contains thimerosal. The other claim concerns the immunization schedule. It has been suggested that the commonly followed schedule, which administers a large number of vaccines early in a child's 7The Vaccine Court administers the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a no-fault compensation program established under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, for persons allegedly injured by compulsory childhood vaccines. The court provides individuals with an alternative to the often costly and lengthy civil court proceedings. 8Baker (2008) discusses the interplay of concerns over vaccine preservatives, mercury poisoning, and autism that created the controversy over childhood vaccines. 6life, overwhelms and weakens the child's immune system. This, however, was also disputed by scientists (O\u000et et al., 2002). Since most information refers to the vaccine-autism link without di erentiating the di erent hypothesized causes, these claims, though not directly related to the MMR vaccine, may also a ect its non-uptake rate. 3 Data and Sample We proceed to describe our data, which consist of immunization records and a set of self- constructed measures of information exposures. 3.1 Immunization Records Our outcome variable, the MMR non-uptake rate, is obtained from the immunization records of the National Immunization Surveys (NIS). The NIS are a group of phone surveys used to monitor vaccination coverage among children and teens in the US. Sponsored and conducted annually by the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, the surveys randomly select phone numbers and enroll one or more age-eligible child or teen from the selected households. During the phone interviews, parents or guardians are asked a series of questions regarding their children's vaccinations. Demographics data are also collected. With the consent of parents, a questionnaire is further mailed to each child's vaccination provider(s) to collect information regarding the child's vaccination history. We obtain immunization records of children between 19 and 35 months of age.9To ensure reliability of the self-reported vaccination status, we restrict our sample to those with valid provider information.10In addition to the child's current vaccination status, the immuniza- tion records contain the following individual characteristics that we use in our analysis: the demographics of the child and the mother at the time of the survey, the socioeconomic status of the household, the type of the child's health care facility, and a state identi er. The sample covers the period 1988 to 2011, with observations of 271,487 children. Table 2 presents the summary statistics of the whole sample and of the sub-samples of children with college-educated and non-college-educated mothers. Children of college-educated mothers have a lower average MMR non-uptake rate.11The group is also more likely to be Caucasians, 9The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends children to receive two doses of MMR vaccine, the rst between 12 and 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years of age. We allow for temporary delays by using 19 months as the cuto ; children who meant to be on the immunization schedule would have received the rst dose of the vaccine by the time they reached 19 months of age. 10The NIS began to include cell phone numbers in their surveys enrollments in 2011. For consistency with other years, we restrict our 2011 sample to landline data. 11Our focus on mothers' education is shaped by data availability, in which the immunization records contain only the education level of the mothers. Nevertheless, with mothers typically playing a major role in child- 7Table 2: Summary Statistics: MMR Non-Uptake Rate and Samples are obtained from the immunization records of the National Immunization Survey, covering the period 1988 to 2011. The sampled children are divided according to whether the child's mother has received college education. Standard deviations are in parentheses. be married, and have a higher household income. 3.2 Information Exposures Using the state identi ers in the immunization records, we link the children in our sample to a set of state-level measures of information exposures. These self-constructed measures, caregiving, this data limitation does not pose a strong restriction for our purpose. 8which quantify the intensity of exposures to immunization-related information in each state and year, include 1) the prevalence rates of relevant diseases, 2) the counts of relevant coverage in local newspapers, and 3) the intensities of relevant online searches. We classify information exposures into positive and negative: the former refer to those that would encourage vacci- nations, potentially lowering the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate; the latter are expected to have the opposite e ect. We also distinguish between passive and active exposures. Disease prevalence and newspaper coverage are considered passive exposures, while online searches represent active exposures. We describe in details the constructions of each of these variables, the summary statistics of which are reported in Table 3. Our identi cation strategy exploits the variations in these variables over time in each state to assess their impacts on the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate. The underlying presumption is that the vaccination decisions of mothers in years with more frequent onsets of the diseases, more relevant newspaper coverage, and/or more intense online searches of related topics are more strongly a ected. Table A.1 in the Appendix reports the between- and within-state variations in each variable. There are considerable variations within states over time, which serve our identi cation well. Prevalence Rates of Relevant Diseases. We use autism and the three diseases pre- ventable by the MMR vaccine as the relevant diseases for constructing measure of one set of passive information exposures. We obtain data on autism from the O\u000ece of Special Edu- cation Programs, which maintains state counts of children with 13 types of disabilities who receive free public education under the Individual with Disability Education Act. The data on measles, mumps, and rubella are obtained from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Re- ports, which are compiled based on reports by state and territorial health departments to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as part of the National Noti able Diseases Surveillance System. For each state-year, we calculate the rate of autism out of the 13 disability counts to capture the prevalence of the disease. We expect that a higher prevalence of autism contributes to a stronger concern over the MMR vaccine; it is considered a negative passive exposure. For the prevalence of MMR, we calculate the rate of the three diseases relative to the number of state residents in each state-year. Philipson (1996) documented that a higher prevalence of measles induced a higher demand for measles vaccine. We similarly expect that a higher prevalence of the three diseases would result in a lower MMR vaccine non-uptake rate; the prevalence of MMR is considered a positive passive exposure. Newspaper Coverage. We search for and identify relevant newspaper coverage in the LexisNexis Academic database, which contains records of 295 US newspapers and was used in previous studies on media coverage of vaccines (e.g., Smith et al., 2008; Clarke, 2008). We search for news articles from 1998 to 2011 that contain the following ve sets of key- 9Table 3: Summary Statistics: Measures of Information Exposures Data Source Mean (SD) Classi cation A.

We screen out articles that focus solely on the link between autism and a speci c vaccine other than the MMR (e.g., the u and the Hib vaccine). Since these excluded articles are at best indirectly related to the MMR vaccine, they presumably have little impact on the non-uptake rate of the MMR vaccine. A total of 1,232 counts of news articles are identi ed as a result. Figure 2 presents the annual counts of identi ed coverage on the MMR-autism and vaccine- autism links.12Two patterns are apparent from the gure. First, most coverage on the MMR- autism link also covers the general vaccine-autism link. Second, although most coverage on the vaccine-autism link does not cover the MMR-autism link, there is an increasing trend that it does. It is plausible that coverage on the other hypothesized risks of childhood vaccines| the thimerosal preservative and the intense immunization schedule|may a ect the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate as well.13This observation justi es the inclusion of all 1,232 counts of coverage, some of which are obtained with keywords such as thimerosal and mercury, in evaluating the impacts of newspaper coverage on the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate. We use four attributes to characterize the contents of the identi ed newspaper coverage. For each coverage, we determine whether it has one or more of the following attributes and assign count to the applicable attribute(s): 1) an overarching position supporting immuniza- tion; 2) citing health authorities and/or scienti c evidence to support immunization; 3) citing anecdotal evidence against immunization; and 4) reporting increasing cases of autism and/or describing hardship in taking care of an autistic child. We aggregate the attribute counts by 12A news coverage is considered to be on the MMR-autism link if it mentions the MMR vaccine or the study by Wake eld et al. (1998). If it covers other childhood vaccines, with or without mentioning the MMR vaccine, it is considered to be on the vaccine-autism link. 13The spillover may also work in the opposite direction, in which the MMR-autism controversy may a ect the non-uptake rates of other childhood vaccines. As will be shown below, we nd evidence for this direction of spillover. Chang (2018) also obtained a parallel nding. 11the release year of the news and the location of the news outlet.14We then construct four variables by calculating the percentage of each of the four attributes in each state-year. The geographical and time variations in the variables are exploited for identi cation. We consider the percentages of news with attributes 1) and 2) as positive passive exposures and those with attributes 3) and 4) as negative passive exposures. Online Searches. We use the search indices from Google Trends to capture the intensity of online searches of immunization-related information. Launched in 2004, Google Trends compiles an index for a term after its search volume reaches a certain threshold. The quali ed search volumes, which exclude repeated queries from the same user in close temporal proximity, are normalized by the total searches on all topics of the region and time that the data points lie. The index ranges from 0 to 100 with a higher value indicating more intensive searches. For each state-year, we obtain the available indices for the following terms or phrases: \\autism,\" autism.\"15For missing values prior to 2004 or due to low search volumes, we use indices predicted based on time-varying state characteristics.16The indices for \\measles,\" \\mumps,\" and \\rubella\" are averaged to create a summary index for the diseases that the MMR vaccine seeks to prevent.17Online searches for the three infectious diseases are considered as positive 14While some national newspapers, such as The New York Times , have nationwide readership, the reader- ship may vary across states in a way that correlates with our outcome variable, the MMR non-uptake rate. In our main analysis, we therefore assign geographic areas to the news articles based on the immediate locations of the news outlets, counting, e.g., articles from The New York Times for New York only. We supplement this by performing robustness checks, excluding articles from the top national news outlets, which potentially o ers a cleaner state-level variation in news exposures. 15\\MMR autism controversy\" is a rather speci c phrase. The phrase in this exact form may not be searched as often as other relevant terms. Accordingly, unlike the other terms, for \\MMR autism controversy\" we obtain the index for the search topic instead of the search term. Search topics from Google Trends include all search terms that are related to the topic. In our analysis below, we also perform robustness check by excluding \\MMR autism controversy\" from the construction of measures of online information exposures. 16We rst estimate a linear regression model with the available data in and after 2004, regressing the search indices on a wide range of time-varying state characteristics. We then use the estimated coe\u000ecients to predict the values of the search indices prior to 2004 based on the state characteristics in those earlier years. The state characteristics (data sources) include proportions of uninsured children under 18 among all uninsured people (Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement), percentages of immigrants among state residents (Yearbook of Immigration Statistics), percentages of households with internet access (Current Population Reports on Computer and Internet Use in the United States), percentages of high school graduates (Current Population Reports on Educational Attainment in the United States), and levels of GDP (US Bureau of Economic Analysis). Since the extent of information seeking is likely to be a ected by news coverage (Niederdeppe et al., 2008), the state characteristics also include passive information exposures to capture the search interests of each keyword. The passive exposures that are included are counts of newspaper articles on the MMR-autism and the vaccine-autism links, autism prevalence rates, and reported cases of measles, mumps, and rubella at the state and year levels. We also make allowance for exible time e ects, including a linear, quadratic, and cubic time trends in the estimation. For the years with available data, the predicted indices are highly correlated with the actual data, which suggests that the imputed values provide reliable substitutes for the missing data. The correlations range from 0.5163 to 0.8146, with a mean value of 0.6817. In our analysis below, we also perform robustness check by omitting altogether the data before 2004. 17The search volume for \\measles\" is substantially higher than those for \\mumps\" and \\rubella\" during the period covered. This is perhaps not surprising given that the MMR-autism controversy was initiated on 12active exposures, while those for \\autism,\" \\MMR autism controversy,\" and \\ vaccine and autism\" represent negative active exposures. 4 Biases of College-Educated Mothers As the rst step of our analysis, we demonstrate that, relative to non-college-educated mothers, the college-educated held biases against the MMR vaccine. We divide our sampled children into two groups according to whether the child's mother is college educated (with a bachelor degree or above) or not and estimate the following equation separately for each group: yist \u0010Xist \u0000\u0015st \u0000 s \u0000\u0011t \u0000\"ist; (1) where the outcome of interest, yist, is an indicator of delayed MMR immunization of child i living in state sin yeart,Xistis a vector of individual characteristics, \u0015stis a vector of time- varying state characteristics, sis the state xed e ects capturing time-invariant heterogeneity across states, \u0011tis the year xed e ects, and \"istis the idiosyncratic error term. The year xed e ects, \u0011t, are the key variable of interest. They represent the annual changes in the estimated MMR vaccine non-uptake rates relative to those in 1998. The vector of individual characteristics, Xist, the summary statistics of which are reported in Table 2, includes the child's gender, rst-born status, age, race, and medical facility type (private, public, or mixed). It also includes the mother's martial status and age at the time of the survey, family income, and an indicator if the child has relocated from a di erent state.18The vector of time-varying state characteristics, \u0015st, which is also used in estimating the missing values of the Google Trends indices, includes proportions of uninsured children under 18, percentages of immigrants, and state population. Figure 3(a) plots the estimated coe\u000ecients of the year xed e ects for the two groups of children. Figure 3(b) plots the group-di erences in those coe\u000ecients. The di erences indicate a widening education gradient over time. The MMR vaccine non-uptake rates of both groups increased after the publication of Wake eld et al. (1998). While these initial increases were brief, lasting till 2001, the increase was more substantial for the college-educated group. By contrast, in the following years in which the non-uptake rates of both groups declined, a more substantial decrease was observed for the non-college-educated group. Interestingly, the subsequent assurance of vaccine safety by the medical community in the connection between the measles virus and autism. While our main analysis uses a summary index covering the three terms, we perform robustness check by excluding \\mumps\" and \\rubella\" from the construction of measures of online information exposures. 18Since dummy variables for mother and child age categories at the time of the survey are included in the regressions, the mother's age at child's birth is implicitly accounted for. 130.020.010.000.010.020.030.040.05 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011Change in NonUptake Rate YearChanges in MMR Vaccine NonUptake Rate to CollegeEducated NonCollegeEducated Group(a) Changes in MMR Vaccine Non-Uptake Rates 0.020.010.000.010.020.030.040.05 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011Differential Change in NonUptake Rate YearDifferential Changes in MMR Vaccine NonUptake Rate Between CollegeEducated and NonCollegeEducated Groups Relative to 19 88 (b) Di erential Changes in MMR Vaccine Non-Uptake Rates Figure 3: Annual Changes in MMR Vaccine Non-Uptake Rates Relative to 1998 2004 was met with an unfavorable response: the non-uptake rates climbed back up again in 2005. While the non-college-educated group showed no distinctly clear trend afterwards, the upward trend perpetuated for the college-educated group. The drastic increases for this group after 2006, which was not covered by Chang (2018), further deepened the di erence between the two education groups. The college-educated group contributed to most of the post-2004 increases in the overall MMR vaccine non-uptake rate as shown in Figure 1. The di erences in the annual changes of the non-uptake rates between the two groups suggest that, relative to the non-college-educated, the college-educated mothers held biases against the MMR vaccine. To evaluate the magnitude of the biases, we estimate the following equation using the full \u0000\"ist:(2) Equation (2) extends on (1) by including two additional interaction terms, college \u0002ln pt \u00011998 q andcollege \u0002post 2004, wherecollege is a dummy variable taking the value of one if the child's mother is college-educated and post 2004is another dummy variable taking the value of one for years after 2004. 14Table 4: Di erential Trends of the MMR Vaccine Non-Uptake Rates (1) (2) (3) (4) Division{Year State{ln(year) Note: The outcome variable is an indicator for delayed MMR immunization. college is a dummy variable for children with college-educated mother. The time trend, ln pt \u00011998 q, starts at time zero, which is year 1998. post 2004 is a dummy variable for years after 2004. Columns (1){(4) report estimation results from four di erent speci cations of area-speci c year xed e ects: none, region-speci c year e ects, division-speci c year e ects, and state-speci c log- linear year e ects. Regions and divisions are assigned based on the common practice of the Census. Standard errors clustered at the survey strata level are in parentheses. *** indicates signi cance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level. The termcollege \u0002ln pt \u00011998 qis the key variable of interest in equation (2). It is the di erential time trend of the non-uptake rate of the college-educated group, in which a log time trend is adopted to re ect the decreasing rate at which the di erences between the two groups increased over time, as is shown in Figure 3(b).19We use this di erential trend to capture the biases of the college-educated group formed since 1998; its estimated coe\u000ecient is interpreted as the strength of the biases . The other interaction term, college \u0002post 2004, identi es any deviation from the di erential trends following the release of conclusive information in 2004 assuring the safety of the MMR vaccine. Table 4 reports the estimated coe\u000ecients of the two interaction terms under four di erent speci cations of area-speci c year e ects.20The positive and signi cant coe\u000ecients of the time trend interaction, college \u0002ln pt \u00011998 q, suggest that the strength of the biases of the college- educated mothers increased over time: relative to the non-college-educated, these mothers were on average more and more reluctant over time to subject their children to the MMR vaccine. This nding, which is robust to the di erent area-speci c year e ects, corroborates the rudimentary analysis based on Figure 3 above. The coe\u000ecients of college \u0002post 2004are, on the contrary, small and insigni cant: the assurance of vaccine safety by the IOM, the partial retraction of Wake eld et al. (1998), and the other events happened in or after 2004, did not result in any meaningful deviation from the increasing trend of the MMR non-uptake rate of the college-educated group. We also estimate equation (2) using the non-uptake rates of other childhood vaccines and obtain similar ndings for hepatitis and pertussis immunizations. The result, which is reported in Table A.2 in the Appendix, suggests a spillover e ect of the MMR vaccine controversy to 19The time trend starts at time zero (year t \u00101998 q. The functional form is not critical to our results, which are robust to alternative speci cations such as linear or quadratic time trend. 20The regressions are weighted using the survey weights to obtain representative results. Standard errors are clustered at the survey strata level. 15other childhood vaccines. 5 Asymmetric Responses to Mixed Information The di erential trend of the MMR non-uptake rate of the college-educated group not only did not subside but in fact strengthened after the release of conclusive evidence in 2004 proving the safety of the vaccine. This raises the question of why such biases could sustain in the presence of information that is at odds with the biases. It is conceivable that mothers with di erent education levels were exposed to di erent information. However, meaningful responses were observed from both groups in 2004, suggesting that di erential availability of information is unlikely to be the major explanation for the perpetuating di erential trend. An alternative explanation would be that the two groups of mothers responded to in- formation di erently. Psychologists have long documented people's tendency to interpret information in ways that are partial to their existing beliefs. A consequence of this con rma- tory bias is that those who are susceptible to it respond to new information di erently from those who are immune or less susceptible, and how the responses are di erent depends on the orientation of the information, whether it is in line or at odds with existing beliefs.21In this section, we investigate how the documented di erential trend of the MMR non-uptake rate interacts with di erent information about vaccine safety. In Section 5.1, we utilize a stylized model of vaccination decisions to articulate the linkage between bias in information interpretation and asymmetric responses to positive and negative information. In Section 5.2, we examine empirically how college-educated mothers' vaccination decisions responded to positive and negative information asymmetrically in a way that is consistent with the implications of con rmatory bias. Having established the presence of these asymmetric responses to information, we further investigate from a policy vantage which type of information exposures has better potential to counter the adverse consequences of misinformation. Section 5.3 reports results from various robustness checks. 5.1 A Stylized Model of Vaccination Decisions We model the initial uncertainty about the safety of the MMR vaccine by two equally likely states of the world, S, which represents that the vaccine is safe, and H, which represents that it is harmful. Parents make vaccination decisions for their child, fully internalizing the child's interests in deciding whether to obtain the vaccine, y, or not,n. For expositional convenience, we assume that there is only one child in each household and hereafter refer to \\parent\" and 21Nickerson (1998) provides an informative review of this arguably most common bias in human reasoning and its manifestations in a variety of individual and social phenomena. 16\\household\" interchangeably.22 A child receives immunization bene t, z, from taking the vaccine regardless of whether it is safe or harmful. On the other hand, taking the vaccine imposes a health cost, a, if and only if it is harmful. The utility from taking the vaccine is therefore u pS;y q \u0010zif it is safe andu pH;y q \u0010z \u0001aif it is harmful. A child who is not vaccinated does not receive the immunization bene t and also is not exposed to any health risk. The utility from not taking the vaccine is therefore zero, i.e., u pS;n q \u0010u pH;n q \u00100. We assume that a \u00a5z \u00a50, which means that the immunization bene t does not justify taking the vaccine if it turns out to be harmful. Health bene t and cost of vaccinations typically depend on a number of individual factors such as living conditions and the child's intrinsic proneness to diseases. We further assume that zanda, while satisfying the parameter restriction above, are heterogeneous across households. Each household is identi ed by its bene t-to-cost ratio,z aP r0;1 s.23 Households receive information about the safety of the vaccine, modeled as noisy infor- mative signals about the state. To capture the historical development of the MMR-autism controversy, marked by the publication of Wake eld et al. (1998) and the subsequent studies drawing opposite conclusion, we assume that there are two instances of signal transmission. The two signals partition the time frame of our analysis into three periods: before the rst signal (t \u00100), in-between the two signals ( t \u00101), and after the second signal ( t \u00102). We consider two groups of households, a biased (b) and an unbiased (u) groups. In each of t \u00100;1;2, a unit mass of each group of households makes vaccination decisions in that period based on all previously and currently available information. We assume that the households in each group, represented by their bene t-to-cost ratio,z a, are uniformly distributed on r0;1 s. Each of the two signals, which is independently distributed, has binary realizations, sand h, with distribution Pr ps |S q \u0010Pr ph |H q P p1 2;1 q. Realized signal sis interpreted as a positive news and realized signal ha negative news regarding the safety of the vaccine.24Misper- ception of signal informativeness lies at the core of our model, which generates asymmetric responses to positive and negative news as a Bayesian outcome. The unbiased parents always objectively perceive that Pr ps |S q \u0010Pr ph |H q \u0010p P p1 2;1 q. For the biased parents, there are three possibilities: 1) if their existing beliefs are that SandHare equally likely, they are objective like the unbiased parents, 2) if their existing beliefs are that Sis more likely, they 22The one-child assumption is innocuous. It is very likely that a household will have the same vaccination decisions for all its children, and the parent's altruistic preferences can then be de ned over the average of the children's welfare. 23We use the weak inequality a \u00a5z \u00a50 instead of the strict inequality a \u00a1z \u00a10 for the parameter restriction out of technical consideration. It allows us to have the closed unit interval as the domain for the bene t-to-cost ratio. 24If we consider, e.g., the publication of Wake eld et al. (1998) and its subsequent retraction as the two signals, they are clearly not independent. Given that our objective is not on modeling the information sources but the responses to information, assuming the independence provides us with a parsimonious environment to focus on the issue of interests. 17misperceive that the signal is more informative than it objectively is when signal sis received, i.e., Pr ps |S q \u0010Pr ph |H q \u0010p1\u00a1p, and less informative than it objectively is when his re- ceived, i.e., Pr ps |S q \u0010Pr ph |H q \u0010p2 p, and 3) if their existing beliefs are that His more likely, the opposite holds where they misperceive that Pr ps |S q \u0010Pr ph |H q \u0010p1\u00a1pwhenh is received and that Pr ps |S q \u0010Pr ph |H q \u0010p2 pwhensis in ates or de ates the informativeness of the signals when their existing beliefs assign non-uniform probabilities to the two states.25 Parents choose yif and only if the expected utility from choosing yis no less than that from choosing n, and this reduces to the condition that the bene t-to-cost ratio is no less than the probability assessment that the vaccine is harmful. In period t \u00100, this condition for taking the vaccine under the prior isz a\u00a51 2. De ning the proportion of parents in a group who choose nas the group's vaccine non-uptake rate, N, we obtain the following baseline case against which the impacts of the signals are evaluated: Observation 1. In periodt \u00100, the vaccine non-uptake rate of the biased group, N0 b, and that of the unbiased group, N0 u, coincide at1 2.26 Upon receiving a signal, parents update their beliefs. The publication of Wake eld et al. (1998) is tantamount to the realization of an hsignal int \u00101. Parents making decisions in this period update beliefs from the uniform prior to Pr pH |h q \u0010p. The threshold for choosing ybecomesz a\u00a5p. Given that those households withz a pchoosen, we obtain the following comparison: Observation 2. After exposure to a signal hindicating that the vaccine is harmful, the vaccine non-update rates of both biased and unbiased groups increase from Nb 0 \u0010Nu 0 \u00101 2in period t \u00100toNb \u0010p \u00a11 2in periodt \u00101. In the empirical estimations, we interpret the size of the di erential trend of the vaccine non-uptake rate as the strength of the college-educated group's biases against the vaccine. The model counterpart of this is a di erence-in-di erence, Dt \u0010 pNb t pNu t \u0001Nu t \u00011 q, which we use to evaluate the impact of a signal on the biased group relative to that on the unbiased group. Given that Nb 0 \u0010Nu 0 \u00101 2andNb 1 ph q \u0010Nu 1 ph q \u0010p, we have that D1 ph q \u00100. The initial negative news in period t \u00101 has the same impact on the biased group as on the unbiased group, because the biased parents making decisions in this period perceive the informativeness of the hsignal as objectively as the unbiased parents. This is no longer the case, however, in period t \u00102. The biased parents making decisions in this last period of the 25We use this rather ad hoc yet convenient approach to model the e ect of con rmatory bias. See Rabin and Schrag (1999) for the pioneering theoretical work on con rmatory bias in economics. 26An non-uptake rate of 50% is certainly not an accurate re ection of reality. Our focus, however, is on thequalitative changes in the non-uptake rates in response to new information, not their absolute levels. 18model, having been exposed to all previously available information, hold non-uniform beliefs about the two states, and their misperception kicks in. During the subsequent stage of the MMR-autism controversy, parents were exposed to both positive and negative information about the vaccine. For the signal in period t \u00102, we accordingly consider both sandhand examine their impacts separately .27Consider rst the case where the second signal is s. Having been exposed to the previous hsignal, the parents' existing beliefs are that the vaccine is more likely to be harmful than safe. When receiving the second ssignal, the biased group discounts the signal informativeness and updates beliefs according to Pr pH |h;s;b q \u0010p p1 \u0001p2q p p1 \u0001p2 q \u0000 p1 \u0001p qp2: On the other hand, with one hand onessignals objectively perceived, the unbiased group's updated beliefs in period t \u00102 coincide with the uniform prior: Pr pH |h;s;u q \u0010p p1 \u0001p q p p1 \u0001p q \u0000 p1 \u0001p qp\u00101 2: Consider next the case where the second signal is h. The biased parents in ate the informa- tiveness of the signal. The updated beliefs of the two groups of parents are, respectively, Pr pH |h;h;b q \u0010pp1 pp1 only ifz a\u00a5Pr pH |h;second signal; bias status q. Given that those households withz a Pr pH |h;second signal; bias status qchoosen, we have the following pro le of vaccine non-uptake rates in period t \u00102:Nb 2 ph;s q \u0010Pr pH |h;s;b q, Nu Pr |h;s;u 2 ph;h \u0010 Pr pH |h;h;u q. The informativeness-discounting condition, p2 p, implies that Nu 2 ph;s q Nb 2 ph;s q p, while the informativeness-in ating condition, p1\u00a1p, implies that p Nu 2 ph;h q Nb 2 ph;h q. Also recall from Observation 2 that Nb 1 ph q \u0010Nu 1 ph q \u0010p. These relations imply that D2 ph;h q \u00a10 andD2 ph;s q \u00a10, which give us the following main result of our theoretical analysis: Proposition 1. Under the misperception of signal informativeness by the biased parents in periodt \u00102, exposure to hsignal raises the vaccine non-uptake rate of the biased group more than that of the unbiased group, while exposure to ssignal lowers the non-uptake rate of the biased group less than that of the unbiased group. 27One can consider a model with three or more signals, evaluating, e.g., the e ect of a third hsignal after a rst hsignal and a second ssignal. To keep the analysis simple while bringing out the gist of the matter, we separately evaluate the e ects of a second sand a second hsignals. 19Since the impact of the hsignal on the vaccine non-uptake rate is an upward impact, D2 ph;h q \u00a10 means that it raises the non-uptake rate of the biased group more than that of the unbiased group. On the other hand, since the impact of the ssignal is a downward impact,D2 ph;s q \u00a10 means that the impact on the non-uptake rate of the biased group is less negative, i.e., smaller in magnitude, relative to that of the unbiased group. There are asymmetric responses to positive and negative news in that, relative to the responses of the unbiased group, the biased group responds more strongly to the negative news than to the positive news. 5.2 The E ects of Information Exposures We proceed to the empirical analogue of the theoretical analysis, investigating the e ects of positive and negative information exposures described in Section 3.2. To promote the comparability of di erent types of exposures measured in di erent ranges of values, we use z-scores in our estimations.28We average the z-scores of all exposures of the same classi ed views to construct composite measures of positive and negative exposures for each state-year. Figure 4 illustrates the geographical variations in these composite measures in 1998, 2004, and 2011, in which the states are colored according to the quartiles of the composite exposures in the given year. The gure shows su\u000ecient variations within states over time in the relative levels of both positive and negative composite information exposures. We augment equation (2) to include two additional interaction terms, college \u0002ln pt \u0001 1998 q \u0002neginfo st, whereposinfo standneginfo st are composite measures of positive and negative information exposures in state sand yeart. Recall that the estimated coe\u000ecient of college \u0002ln pt \u00011998 qis interpreted as the strength of the biases held by the college-educated group; the coe\u000ecients of the new interaction terms therefore measure changes in the bias strength when the value of posinfo storneginfo st increases by one. Table 5 reports the estimation results, which provide evidence of asymmetric responses to the positive and negative information exposures. In all four speci cations of area-speci c year e ects, the coe\u000ecients of college \u0002ln pt \u00011998 q \u0002neginfo stare positive and signi cant, whereas those of college \u0002ln pt \u00011998 q \u0002posinfo stare negative, insigni cant, and minimal in magnitudes. In relation to the coe\u000ecients of college \u0002ln pt \u00011998 qreported in Table 4, these coe\u000ecients imply the following: a one-standard-deviation increase in exposures to negative information leads to at least 35.07% (0:0047 0:0134) increase in the strength of the college-educated 28Dafny and Dranove (2008) use the same standardization to study the e ects of di erent quality measures reported in HMO report cards on the enrollment choices of Medicare plans. The z-scores are variables with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, obtained by dividing the di erence between original variable value and the sample mean by the sample standard deviation. 20Figure 4: Geographical Variations in Composite Information Exposures in 1998, 2004, and 2011 Table 5: Changes in Di erential Trends of the MMR Vaccine Non-Uptake Rates in Response to Information Exposures (1) (2) (3) (4) college \u0002ln Division{Year State{ln(year) Note: The outcome variable is an indicator for delayed MMR immunization. college is a dummy variable for children with college-educated mother.

Columns (1){(4) report estimation results from four di erent speci cations of area-speci c year xed e ects: none, region-speci c year e ects, division-speci c year e ects, and state-speci c log-linear year e ects.

Standard errors clustered at the survey strata level are in parentheses. *** indicates signi cance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level. group's biases; by contrast, a one-standard-deviation increase in exposures to positive in- formation leads to no more than 10.37% (\u00010:0014 0:0135) and as low as 1.45% (\u00010:0002 0:0137) decrease in the strength of the biases. Exposures to negative information strengthened the biases of the 21college-educated group more than exposures to positive information attenuated them. Con rmatory bias and the implied asymmetric responses to information contribute to the persistence of misinformation. The e ects of misinformation linger when people am- plify incoming information that con rms their erroneous beliefs but discount information that contradicts them. This could have alarming implications on many levels. In the case of vaccinations, since immunizations create positive externality in building herd immunity, withholding vaccinations is not simply a matter of personal choice but has immense societal consequences.29 Given the scope of the potential impacts, a study on misinformation cannot be complete without shedding some light on how to counter or mitigate the adverse consequences of mis- information and the associated biases. We extend on the above ndings and investigate from a policy vantage which type of information exposures, traditional newspaper coverage or on- line information, may provide a more e ective channel to tackle the biases against the MMR vaccine.30We re-estimate equation (2) with separate sets of interaction terms for the positive and negative exposures of each type of exposures considered. Table 6 reports the estimation results. Online searches are found to have stronger impact on the biases of college-educated mothers than does newspaper coverage. Importantly, both positive and negative exposures of online searches have a signi cant e ect, although the e ect of negative exposures remains dominant, about 2.29{2.45 times of that of positive exposures. By contrast, for newspaper coverage, the e ects of both positive and negative exposures are insigni cant and minimal in magnitude. The e ect of the prevalence of measles, mumps, and rubella as positive exposures and that of autism as negative exposure are both insigni cant. Echoing Smith et al. (2008), this additional nding indicates that traditional newspaper coverage had limited impacts on immunization decisions. Negative coverage did not exacer- bate the college-educated mothers' biases against the MMR vaccine, but neither did positive coverage o er much help in reducing the biases. This is in contrast to online searches.31While negative online searches signi cantly strengthened the biases, our nding suggests that on- line searches are a \\double-edged sword\": unlike the ndings based on composite measures, positive exposures to online searches alone did signi cantly attenuate the biases. The policy 29Another contemporary issue that has been impacted by misinformation is global warming. Despite the con rmation by science that global warming is a real concern, some people including political elites still erroneously believe the otherwise (e.g., McCright and Dunlap, 2011). Any resulting delay in implementing mitigating actions could have adverse consequences not only at a societal level but also on a global scale. 30Lewandowsky et al. (2012) review the cognitive factors that contribute to the stickiness of misinformation and recommend debiasing strategies based on cognitive psychological theory. 31During the period covered in our study, newspaper readerships declined at an annual rate capped at 6%. The volumes of Google searches, on the other hand, increased quickly, though at a decreasing rate. In 2011, e.g., the growth rate was around 11%. Despite this contrast between online and traditional media exposures, our use of z-scores allows us to capture the relative levels of information exposures across states in a given year. Figures A.1 and A.2 in the Appendix present the geographical variations in the information exposures to newspaper coverage and online searches. 22Table 6: Changes in Di erential Time Trends of the MMR Vaccine Non-Uptake Rates in Response to Information Exposures by Information Types (1) (2) (3) (4) college \u0002ln Division{Year State{ln(year) Note: The outcome variable is an indicator for delayed MMR immunization. college is a dummy variable for children with college-educated mother.

The two major ones concern the data on informa- tion exposures. For the rst set of robustness checks, we consider separately four alternative constructions of measures of information exposures: 1) given that the search volume for \\measles\" is substantially higher than \\mumps\" and \\rubella,\" we exclude the search indices for the latter two from the measure of positive active exposures; 2) since the speci c phrase \\MMR autism controversy\" has a relatively lower search volume, we exclude its search index 23from the measure of negative active exposures; 3) since national newspapers have readership that spans across states, in an attempt to obtain a cleaner state-level variation in news ex- posures, we exclude top four news outlets from our data on news coverage; and 4) we take a further step to exclude the top ten news outlets. The estimation results under these alter- native constructions are reported, respectively, in Columns (1), (2), (3), (4) of Table A.3 in the Appendix. Our second robustness check concerns the missing data from Google Trends. Since Google Trends was not launched until 2004, the data prior to 2004 are imputed based on state characteristics. While the strong correlations between the imputed and the actual values after 2004 suggest that the imputation should provide reliable substitutes for the missing data before 2004, it is conceivable that some measurement errors are introduced. Table A.4 in the Appendix reports estimation results from using only observations in 2004 and onwards. Our main ndings in Section 5.2 survive the above two sets of robustness checks. We further examine the robustness of our ndings with respect to three sample restric- tions. First, to address the potential confound from exposures to information in a di erent state, we exclude those who have relocated across states. Second, we restrict our full sample, which includes children of all races, to non-Hispanic white and black children, thus excluding Hispanic and Asian Americans. Mothers whose native language is not English may be less likely to be exposed to the vaccine information we consider; to the extent that reading uency in English is correlated with education levels, our ndings may be driven by variations in information availability across the two groups of mothers rather than their di erent responses to information. The sample restriction to non-Hispanic white and black children, whom we consider to be the major English-speaking population in the sample, is an attempt to ad- dress this potential confound. Finally, to focus more narrowly on the most relevant news, we use articles that cover only the MMR-autism link to construct the measure of information exposures for newspaper coverage. Our ndings are robust to all three sample restrictions.32 6 Conclusion and Discussion The study by Wake eld et al. (1998), which linked the measles virus to the in ammatory bowel disease found in autistic children, initiated the infamous MMR-autism controversy and fueled an ongoing anti-vaccine movement that continued through today. Consistent with the ndings from prior studies, we nd that the persistent trend to delay the MMR immunization since 1998 to 2011 in the US was driven by children of college-educated mothers. A di erential trend of the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate of the college-educated group relative to the non- college-educated group was observed. More importantly, the di erential trend perpetuated even after scienti c consensus had been reached that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism. 32The detailed estimation results from these three robustness checks are available upon requests. 24We examine the interactions between this di erential trend and exposures to information about the safety of the MMR vaccine. The primary contribution of our study is the documen- tation of an asymmetric response to positive and negative information. Interpreting the size of the di erential trend as the strength of the college-educated mothers' biases against the MMR vaccine, we nd that exposures to negative information about the vaccine strengthened their biases more than exposures to positive information attenuated them. This nding provides non-experimental evidence consistent with the implications of con rmatory bias documented by psychologists. In the presence of such common bias in human reasoning, misinformation, once planted, is hard to eradicate. On the policy front, we obtain further nding suggesting that disseminating correct information online may present the best chance to counter the sticky misinformation and erroneous beliefs about the MMR vaccine. We conclude by discussing two potential issues in our empirical methods. Our policy implication hinges on the nding that the isolated impacts of online information exposures, both positive and negative, are signi cant. Yet it is plausible that simultaneity bias exists for online searches, which results in an overestimation of the impacts. Parents who are uncertain about the safety of the MMR vaccine may actively search for information online. As a result, there may be a positive correlation between vaccination decisions and the intensity of online searches, leading to the overestimation. We formally test the endogeneity of positive and negative online exposures by using the Hausman test to compare the estimates from an ordinary least squares (OLS) and an in- strumental variable (IV) models. We use two plausible instrumental variables for the two potentially endogenous variables of positive and negative online exposures. They are 1) the percentage of households with internet access, and 2) the average time spent on computer for leisure among individuals living in households with children under 18 years old.33Both instru- ments have a stronger relationship with developments of the internet industry and changes in lifestyles rather than strengths of opinions against the MMR vaccine. Comparing the es- timates from the OLS and the IV models using the Hausman test, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the positive and negative online information exposures are exogenous.34 In assessing the impacts of di erent types of information on the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate, we categorize information in terms of its forms of transmission, whether it is through traditional newspapers or the internet. It is equally valid to consider a taxonomy based on, 33The rst variable is obtained from the Current Population Reports on Educational Attainment, and the second variable is estimated using the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). Both variables are state-year level variables. The internet-access variables are also used in imputing the missing Google Trends indices for years prior to 2004, while the earliest year that the ATUS was available was 2003. Due to these restrictions, for this test of endogeneity we only consider observations in and after 2004. 34The IV models are estimated using two-stage least squares estimators. In all four speci cations of area- speci c year e ects that we adopt throughout the estimations in the paper, the power of the IV for both endogenous variables exceeds the conventional minimum of F \u001010, with a minimum value of 17.106 and a maximum value of 159.981. The p-values from the Hausman test range from 0.357 to 0.989. 25e.g., the sources of information, whether news about vaccine safety comes o\u000ecially from the government or informally from social networks. To the extent that di erent sources of infor- mation may be di erentially associated with di erent media formats, our ndings in terms of the latter may in part be driven by responses to the former. Without pretending to of- fer a complete answer to this potential confound, we nevertheless note that, for information obtained through social networks, the vast development of social media platforms like Face- book and Twitter has turned a substantial volume of social networking activities online. Our measure of online information as a type of information may capture the information obtained through social networks reasonably well, preserving the validity of our ndings in spite of the potential confound. Examining more generally the interactions between media and sources of vaccine information on vaccination outcomes would be a natural step for future research. 26References [1] Anderberg, D., A.
