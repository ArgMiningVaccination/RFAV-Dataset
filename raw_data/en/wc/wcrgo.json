During your initial consultation, we will discuss any health concerns you may have. A very detailed history of your health will be recorded to ensure the most effective naturopathic protocol is determined. You will also receive advice on any dietary changes you might need to consider, as well as advice on supplementation of certain nutrients if required. In addition, a referral to a General Practitioner or another health care specialist might be given. Once the consultation is finished, you will receive a personalised naturopathic advice sheet, which will contain all necessary suggestions and information on nutrition, lifestyle and supplementation. It will also include dosage guidelines for your bespoke herbal and nutritional protocol provided via the clinic, which will be delivered to you shortly after your initial consultation. DO YOU PERFORM ANY LABORATORY TESTS? After the initial consultation you may be advised to get additional health screening. In cases of detailed blood tests or further detailed examinations, you will be given a referral letter to see a General Practitioner. However, there are many tests that are carried out via the herbal clinic if needed, such as stool analysis for parasitic infections, gut health markers, hormone profile tests, food intolerance screening and many others. WHAT IS A HERBAL FORMULA? A herbal formula consists of multiple herbs, chosen and combined specifically for you. The most common form of a herbal formula is a tincture. If a tincture is not an appropriate approach for you, you will receive a herbal prescription of dried herbs, glycerates, or in some cases lifestyle advice and a nutritional plan is all that is required. DO YOU TREAT CHRONIC CONDITIONS? In naturopathic medicine, we treat people and not the disease itself. Therefore, an appropriate herbal medicine and naturopathic prescription can be used to help clients to deal with both acute or chronic illnesses. HOW OFTEN DO I HAVE TO VISIT MY PRACTITIONER? Once the initial consultation is over, your practitioner will advise you on the next date you should revisit the clinic. It generally depends on each individual case and their health complaints. However, in most cases, the follow up consultation should take place four to five weeks after your initial consultation, just before your first herbal prescription is finished. Afterwards, the visits will become less frequent, as you will be able to order a repeat prescription in between the consultations. It is important to be consistent with visits, in order to reach the desired outcome for your health and wellbeing. WHAT MAY BE INCLUDED IN MY BESPOKE PROTOCOL? Every client's protocol is bespoke to their needs hence the content of their suggested protocol can vary greatly. Some of the products offered via the clinic which may be included in your herbal protocol: Personalised herbal formula; herbal capsule complexes; herbal preparations; herbal creams; ointments and rubs/liniments; herbal syrups; nutritional supplements and other appropriate preparations. I'VE NEVER ATTENDED A REMOTE CONSULTATION, WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT? Remote consultations are very convenient and time efficient for clients, as no travelling is required and you can attend the consultation at the comfort of your own home or while travelling. You will be able to chose from a variety of remote call platforms to ensure you are satisfied with your appointment method. If you are choosing to start the bespoke protocol suggested for you, your package will be shipped to you to your chosen address shortly after your remote consultation.
