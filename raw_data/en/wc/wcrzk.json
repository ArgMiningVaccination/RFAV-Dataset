I only tried lobster the once when I went to an Italian restaurant for a pizza. The owner persuaded me to have the lobster instead. I really did not like the lobster much and wish I had ordered my pizza instead. However, I didn't want to make a fuss on my birthday by saying this lobster was basically not very nice. Perhaps it was past the sell by date, or turned to mush due to being cooked whilst dead. Needless to say I haven't, and wouldn't, touch lobster since and prefer dead cooked pizza. | 13) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 21 Aug 2013 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Is it a variable speed salad mixer? | 14) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Aug by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Yes, yes, yes!

Exoskeletons are involved, ie, crustaceans which are not fish. The latest pic of the device shows a setting for lobster and crab. Salt water is involved because electricity is not conducted through fresh water very well. No cooking is involved.

No. Salt is also required. Salty ice would be yuk. Just so you know in future, salty water was used in the process of making ice cream before modern refrigeration. quote from the Guardian. How was ice-cream made before refrigerators were invented? THERE IS a good summary in The National Trust Book of Sorbets, Flummeries and Fools by Colin Cooper English (published 1985). Time-consuming and costly, the old-fashioned way was to place the ingredients into a thin drum, which was then sunk into a larger container which held a mixture of ice and salt. Although water freezes at 32F (0C), milk and cream will not freeze until they are down to 20F (-6.7C). The salt melts the ice and produces a brine with a temperature around 17F (-8.3C), and it is this freezing brine which provides the refrigeration. Interesting. For the gadget in question, it wouldn't work without salt. | 51) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Aug 2013 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: ice maker?

I don't think any ambulance of fire engine driver is trained to drive at high speeds through heavilly populated towns or cities like London. An ambulance driver is a medical officer who does not go into Ferrari driver mode when driving an ambulance. He is subject to all laws and speed limits the any driver in London. If a fire engine driver exceeds the speed limits he is subject to causing death by dangerous driving the same as any London driver. He has no right to go through red lights and is breaking the law if he approaches a zebra crossing with people nearby too fast, the same as anyone driving recklessly. The same applies to police car drivers. They are not above the law. There is one exception, who train to drive vehicals at high speed through towns. They are the motor cyclists who get VIPs at high speed from, e.g., Heathrow to Buckingham palace without the VIP vehicals stopping even once, racing past the VIPs again and again to bar the traffic for the continually moving VIP vehicles. | 211) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Team Recruitment Center](forum_forum.php?id=19) : 2012 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: \u00e2\u20acIf you asked me to name the three scariest threats facing the human race, I would give the same answer that most people would: nuclear war, global warming and Windows.\u00e2\u20ac ~ Dave Barry Please join [ ](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/team_display.php?teamid=115396) [ ](http://www.setiusa.us) | 212) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : what a [Message 1198299](forum_thread.php?id=67018&postid=1198299)) Posted 21 Feb 2012 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I loved this bit from that link Blue lights can only be switched on by those specifically trained to do so So how much training do you need to flick a switch??

I disagree, I have no problem with people trying to control their own affairs, but this would be a decision that affects the whole of the UK. Also as Scotland has provided more than its fair share of the top politicians in Westminster, and it has been known for Scottish MP's to vote on purely English matters then I think they have had plenty of opportunities to put their point of view. For many years, it has been recognised that Scotland requires more per head than England and Wales to maintain its infrastructure etc. But when oil was discovered around, in so called scottish waters, some scots, now mainly known as the SNP thought that if they separated they could keep all the riches to themselves rather than share it with the people who have financially supported them for so long. You make a very good point of course WinterKnight. The union between England and Scotland is a political union - the Scots have always had choice to break this union, or ask to, in the past. The point about the SNP is also hugely important. It is not the Scottish people who are seeking independence, it is the leader of one political party in Scotland trying to drive this through. | 243) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Is England trying to stir the pot over the Falkland Islands?](forum_thread.php?id=66821) ( [Message 1196756](forum_thread.php?id=66821&postid=1196756)) Posted 18 Feb 2012 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: This thread title should actually read ...

Oh you mean England decided to take over. We accepted it but Scotland could not they just would not melt into the great pot that we call Great Britain. Of course the conquering England accepted it as the Russians accepted it when it conquered all the countries around it and called it all the USSR. England looked to the greater advancements that would be gained from combining the four countries of the UK under one banner \"Britain\". There we go; the USSR of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Scotland for their part see it as being swamped rather than seeing it as gaining the right of access to all the advantages of being part of a greater land mass and trading nation. I expect the Irish got swamped and left behind the ones who didn't want independence in the 'country' of Northern Ireland. Even the Russians didn't split neighboring countries into two.

Speaking in Warrington on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said: \"It's up to the courts to make decisions about sentencing, but they've decided to send a tough message and it's very good that the courts feel able to do that.\" However, some MPs and campaigners have criticised the sentencing as too harsh. Lord Carlile, a Lib Dem peer and Howard League for Penal Reform president, said some decisions were \"questionable\".

I mean, who would go to a riot/looting with a hammer strapped to their leg? I expect the god Odin would have something to say to his son Thor if he strapped his hammer to his leg for any reason. But then Odin would probably be baffled by Thor's choice of hammer support whereas the mother of the 13 year old was OK with her son trotting off to a riot and secreting a hammer in this way because the poor little dear was frightened.

It will come into effect if he is convicted.\u00e2\u20ac If I get this correctly, a person may be convicted, and consequently one of his parents could be thrown on the street. Was attempting to figure a suitable closing remark here, but am at loss of words. Some words you might have used is that Al Jazeera have got their facts right and not twisted and sensationalised as some of the British Press. One headline in the UK on the front page of a tabloid newspaper said that a family had been evicted. As AlJazeera correctly stated, Wandsworth Council did no more that take the first step is serving notice, and it will be 6 months before their procedures will allow any eviction notice to be enforced. As for \"thrown on the street\", that is your description of someone living in rented property who was broken the rules of tenancy and whose landlord has every right to get them them. The family will have to go and live somewhere else, as all of us have to live somewhere if we rent and end a tenancy for whatever reason. Instead of taking advantage of cheap council property they will have to find a private rental. Trash the coummunity around there, or steal or riot there, and I expect that the private landlord will have them out in far less than 6 months. | 305) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [UK by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Mum doesn't help by getting involved with a useless git that disappears as soon as he realises she is pregnant. Left winger do gooders don't help by encouraging \"affordable housing\" which gets given to the wrong people, rather than those it was intended for. Yeah, it's all the fault of the left wing do gooders (the opposite of which is, presumably, right wing do badders) that there are useless gits of boyfriends that leave behind pregnant women. If only there were more of the do badders about, these women would be looked after, right? The point that Chris S is making is a very good one. Young couples on low or no incomes qualify for benefits help. They may have children and find the cost of their social housing completely covered. In some cases the father leaves and the woman and children remain funded by the welfare state. Some young people see this as a way to live without getting jobs, intentionally living off the State. Both 'lefties' and 'righties' have allowed this to continue over the last 50 years of the welfare state. The way this taking advantage of the welfare system by such parents has become a way of life without any attempt to get a job or encourage their children to get a job. This has led in part (there are many other and complex reasons) to the broken and sick society eluded to by David Cameron recently. The problems underlying the riots have been the fault in part of the previous left Labour governments as stated recently by their leader Ed Milliband. It is not a left v. right political argument but for the government/police/judicial system as a whole to find the reasons behind the riots and to identify and implement solutions. | 306) Aug 2011 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Just wondering how much is being fraudulently spent & how many police officers it could fund.........

THEN, rather than sell off all our military bases for the greedy money men to make millions from, use them as military prisons - no tv & leisure time there. Not sure that nakes economic sense. Military bases do not have to my knowlege, secure accommodation for hundreds of prisoners to be locked up in cells. That would have to be provided. There was a plan once to employ floating prison ships, off the coast of te UK, but the on shore communities strongly objected. The only UK prison ship closed in 2005 after 8 years as temporary measure. It was berthed at Portland in Dorset and was effectively a container tied to the dock. It needed extensive refitting to continue in this role and was deemed too costly. Perhaps prison ships are not such a bad idea. Maybe the inmates can have a sense of being on a cruise whilst watching their TVs. Maybe the tax payers should pay for the diesel to sail them to the Caribean to enjoy the sun. On the other hand let's not do any of that.

I am no supporter of Nick Clegg and his LibDem party and am tempted to agree with you, but I don't think someone now 42 years of age should now be punished for something they did at 16 just because there was a riot in London last week in which they did not participate. Hell, you would now evict old people in Japan for what they did in WW2 even though they don't have any houses, and why don't you convict Japanese whalers for some spurious link to the England riots? I would love that. Fair enough, so how long in your opinion should the rioters be barred from council housing and/or receiving benefits?

I'm merely highlighting the hypocrisy of British politicians when it comes to condemning the acts of others when those acts are not all that dissimilar to what they performed in their youth.

In relation to social housing, it is already a ground for eviction if a tenant or a member of their family is involved in anti-social behaviour or criminal activity in their local neighbourhood. Ministers have encouraged social landlords to use these powers, and a number of local authorities have pledged to do so. The Department for Communities and Local Government is consulting on proposals to allow such evictions to take place where the criminal activity takes place outside the vicinity of the local neighbourhood; more information is available to view here: [http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/publicdisorder](http://www.communities.gov.uk/statements/newsroom/publicdisorder).\" The Rt Hon Eric Pickles MP, Secretary of State, in the communities.gov.uk link above says \"It is already a ground for eviction in existing legislation if a tenant or a member of their family is involved in anti-social behaviour or criminal activity in their local neighbourhood.

Wandsworth in London has become the first council to serve an eviction notice over the riots, but several others are also considering the move. David Cameron told the BBC he thought evictions were a way of \"enforcing responsibility in our society\". He said those who might struggle as a result \"should have thought of that before they started burgling\". Nottingham City Council, Salford City Council and Westminster, Greenwich and Hammersmith and Fulham councils in London have all said they will consider serving eviction notices. At present, local authorities can apply them only if troublemakers are involved in disorder in their local area. But Community Secretary Eric Pickles is planning a 12-week consultation on whether powers should be extended to allow councils to punish those convicted of what he called \"riot tourism\" in other areas. It is believed that many people who got involved in the riots and disorder travelled some distance to do so. 'Criminal networks' Mr Cameron told the BBC's North West Tonight: \"If you live in a council house you're getting a house at a discount from what other people have to pay and with that should come some responsibility. \"For too long we've taken a too soft attitude towards people that loot and pillage their own community. If you do that you should lose your right to the sort of housing that you've had at subsidised rates. \u00e2\u20acThese people have done their best to make people frightened on the streets where they live\u00e2\u20ac Eric Pickles Communities Secretary \"Obviously, that will mean they've got to be housed somewhere else - they'll have to find housing in the private sector - and that will be tougher for them, but they should have thought of that before they started burgling.\" The prime minister also said there could be a knock-on benefit to the policy because it \"might help break up some of the criminal networks on some housing estates if some of these people are thrown out of their houses\". Earlier, Mr Pickles told the BBC it was not time to \"pussyfoot around\". \"These people have done their best to make people frightened on the streets where they live,\" he said. \"They've done their best to destroy neighbourhoods, and frankly I don't feel terribly sympathetic towards them.\" Conservative-run Wandsworth Council has issued an eviction notice to a council tenant whose son has appeared in court charged in connection with Monday night's disturbances in Clapham Junction. The notice is the first stage in the legal process of eviction - the final decision will rest with a county court judge. Neither the tenant nor their son can be named at this stage for legal reasons. Council leader Ravi Govindia said: \"This council will do its utmost to ensure that those who are responsible pay a proper price for their conduct.\" The Department for Communities and Local Government is already consulting on proposals for a new mandatory power of possession for landlords with anti-social tenants. The most popular e-petition on the government's website currently calls for convicted rioters to lose their benefits.

They are clear that the conditions of tenure have been breached by the actions of the family member. Asked if it was right to make a family homeless a councillor said that the suggestion that parents could never be responsible for what their children did was a suggestion people could make. If the court upheld the conviction the family would be deemed to be making themselves intentionally homeless and the council would have no responsibility to house them. The councillor said the tenancy agreement effectively had a line which made it clear that if crossed the council would seek possession of their property.

In my case I took an old tower with a lower rated power supply and tried to take an economical approach in increasing my BOINC credits by buying just an ATI GPU and not spending out on extra PCs or power supply upgrades. Getting back on topic, it was a risk in the early days in MW GPU when it first started up and Gipsel came up with his first cuts. It was still an unknown entity not even being tested by Gipsel himself because he did not have an ATI GPU. I had to commit to buying a GPU to find out if that one would replace my CPU farm and give me a saving on electricity. When I did commit I had to go though all the trials and tribulations in coping with configuration changes by Gipsel and MW which invariably led to lost crunching times and lost WUs. Of course now things are more settled in projects using GPU and more settled credits across projects would be expected. | 356) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Boinc's Death 18 Jul 2011 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: There are a few caveats. 1) Power -- you need a power supply of at least 450W (clean) or better yet 500W.

You will run the same WU's on your GPU as your CPU. the CPU will take hours to finish the same work as a GPU. My GPU can finish a short MW WU in about 60 seconds. I get 213 credits for that. I could run the same WU on my CPU for about 5 hours and get the same credit. Yes, I'd agree it is true. The way I amassed many millions in MW was by getting one or six ATI GPUs and putting them into old PCs which I rescued from the landfill. They had a PCI Express slot and a slow CPU, enough to run Windows, Boinc and a few WUs. Those ATI GPUs turned over MW WUs pretty amazingly fast. The GPUs performance and Gipsels highly optimized coding turned just one ATI GPU into the equivalent of the small CPU farm I had previously. Thus it saved electricty, but that was a forgotten benefit once I started buying more ATI GPUs after the first. | 358) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 1129102](forum_thread.php?id=64736&postid=1129102)) Posted 18 Jul 2011 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: We are now seeing the most powerful people in society who thought they were \"untouchable\" being touched.

Its a good little php trick. The boinc server code stripps out any tags that are potentially harmfull. But they allow a few like [img] and [a href]. But your right, some of the sites won't display an image ending with .php. But it seems to work ok here on SETI anyway Ice. Ice i'm glad the admins here at seti reactivated your account after that whole \"banning people\" thing that happened there a while back. Its good to still see people hanging around here who have been with seti a few years. I feel i have known you now for a long time. We're old friends at this stage.

I've modified my team title as follows, and add the BBcode equivalent to show my new team heading. Refresh your browser and it will automatically change. Try it. Posted 6 Jul 2011 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Hi John, thanks for that. I've been mystified by this. The HTML team name allows the use of HTML code such as <a> for links, and as someone who has used HTML for some time I know that <a> has to be paired with a </a>. Otherwise everything else that follows the <a> becomes a hyperlink, as you pointed out. However, what I could not fathom out is why Boinc-wide and SETI HTML team name stripped out the </a> at the end of my link every time I put it in. I'm sure the use of BBcode will work, but as someone who uses HTML you might appreciate that I would prefer to use the HTML source code rather that code which is converted into HTML by the Boinc systems. I wasn't too bothered about this particular problem since what I have in my team description is not a lot, and wherever you click takes you to where I want you to go. (By the way, a broken link is one which goes to nowhere on the internet, or cannot display a picture which does not exist at that broken link. A link that takes you to the wrong place or displays the wrong picture is simply bad code.) I considered 2 things which might be causing the problem; 1. I was using the 'border' statement. Unlikely since this has not caused me a problem in Boinc previously. (\"Limited\" HTML is allowed, so I'm not sure if I was using something valid in HTML generally, but not allowed in Boinc HTML team names.) 2. The hyperlink statement is too long. I am displaying 3 images wrapped in a hyperlink. Likely since it keeps truncating my </a> at the end of my HTML team name. I changed both and this seems to have fixed it. I took out the 'border' attribute which in turn shortened the hyperlink statement. Now seems to work OK in Team-wide and I hope in Boinc projects as it propagates out. This is the Ice Ice, On your United States of Europe team page, your missing a html tag and it turns the whole team page into a broken link. Your missing a closing [/a] tag. To fix it; Edit your team page, but just the \"Team name, HTML version\". You might have to do it on the boinc wide team page. square bracket tags for the pointy bracket tags! Use these <> instead of these [] John. | 393) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Team Jul 2011 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: [ ](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/team_display.php?teamid=142435) Crunching all over Europe, planet Earth and Europa - [please join us](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/team_display.php?teamid=142435) PS It's a Eurofighter Typhoon on the right | 394) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [ ](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/team_display.php?teamid=142435) [please join us](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/team_display.php?teamid=142435) Congratulations to the United States of America | 395) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Team Jul 2011 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: [ ](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/team_display.php?teamid=142435) Crunching all over Europe, planet Earth and Europa - [please join us](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/team_display.php?teamid=142435) | 396) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 2011 [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) [ ](http://distributed.org.ua/) Check out 2011 [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) [ ](http://distributed.org.ua/) Check out our friendly [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: [The Zeitgeist Movement](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/team_display.php?teamid=139589) is a team which supports the organization of the same name.

Management in a company don't always decide on a strategy to survive, as current economic climate requires, but also to continue make profit and to do well for individuals in a company, but not necessarilly all. Making people redundant at the expense of lining the pockets of management is mostly about caring about management's lucrative lifestyle and inflated salaries rather than caring about the lives that people have put into a company, so easily discarded with arguments and reasoning to try and justify throwing people on the scrap heap. Take care of yourself, that's my advice. It's dog eat dog out there. People can and will lie to influence others not just to keep themselves safe.

Never even heard of this user before. Popularity has it's consequences I guess. I'll ask Fred if some code can be added so that when a person A filters person B any unread PMs from Person A to Person B are auto-deleted. I'll have to ask Fred as well because you kinda got me there. Did anyone drink the coffee after it was filtered? :P It's possible. In addition if Person A has Person B filtered then Person A should not be allowed to PM Person B. The PM block should work in both directions. Now I see where you're coming from, and I absolutely agree with you. It is totally out of order to enable someone to PM crap to you if there is no opportunity to shovel it back.

As a boy he loved outdoor pursuits and at the age of 10 he could ride, swim and bend a bow and hunt: he was a fine scholar, an accomplished musician, a chivalrous and bold monarch who proved to be a shrewd tactician - both militarily and politically. In addition to securing a temporary peace with France, Henry maintained control over the warring Owain Glyndwr whose armies sought to win territory in the Welsh Marches. Henry's impressive victories at Harfleur and Agincourt raised him to heroic status in England. Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; Or close the wall up with our English dead. In peace there's nothing so becomes a man As modest stillness and humility: But when the blast of war blows in our ears, Then imitate the action of the tiger; Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage; Then lend the eye a terrible aspect; Let pry through the portage of the head Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it As fearfully as doth galled rock O'erhang and jutty his confounded base, Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean. Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide, Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit To his full height. On, on, you noblest English. Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof! Fathers that, like so many Alexanders, Have in these parts from morn till even fought And sheathed their swords for lack of argument: Dishonour not your mothers; now attest That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you. Be copy now to men of grosser blood, And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman, Whose limbs were made in England, show us here The mettle of your pasture; let us swear That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not; For there is none of you so mean and base, That hath not noble lustre in your eyes. I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, Straining upon the start. The game's afoot: Follow your spirit, and upon this charge Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'

Ice, just wondering if [Africanized bees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africanized_bee) are an issue where you are. I'm not even sure a beekeeper is permitted to keep a wild swarm here. No, we don't have Africanized bees in the UK, just whatever is decimating the bee population generally. In the UK the owner of a swarm is only the owner until he/she loses sight of it then. Then it belongs to whoever can catch them (which is not as difficult as you may think). A swarm is highly prized for beekeepers since it contains all the younger active workers who gather the most nectar and pollen (to make honey). The bees they leave behind are older, slower and gather very little for the colony. They will also be leaving an old queen behind and have set off with a brand new queen to propogate their species by lodging in a hole behind someboy's brick ;) | 526) boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe Posted 28 Mar 2010 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: A bugs a Bug, there's millions upon millions of the critters and a few less won't make any difference right now.

Well they are insects, But yeah they are useful/needed and as long as their not Africanized, fairly easy to deal with. I was mainly talking about pests, Bees can be moved, Just get the Queen, The rest will follow I think. You are right VW, even honey bees can be pests if they pose a risk to people, and need pest control to deal with them. You are right about the queen, the bees will follow her. Although if you manage to retrieve a swarm, put a white sheet in front of a hive leading up to the entrance and dump the bees on the sheet, they will walk into the hive. But it will be ages before you see the queen walking in somewhere in the middle, but never at the front leading them all. But when she rarely flies the will follow her in flight. | 527) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Team Posted 28 Mar 2010 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: A bump for Northern Ireland, home of my best friend at university. | 528) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Posted 28 Mar 2010 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Hated to do it, but I had to serve the eviction notice on the 10,000-20,000 or so squatters.

I think I never got into DKII because my PCs were so underpowered. Maybe I'll dig out the disc and see if it will run under my more current empowered kit. When Dungeon Keeper first came out, I was still using my AMD AM5x86DX/5 133MHz (486 class equivalent of a Pentium 75MHz) with 18MB of RAM. My video card was very underpowered since I had no PCI or VLB slots, I had to use an ATi Mach64 2MB DRAM ISA card (not a good idea for gaming). The crazy thing is that the save files were so large that if I attempted to save a game while using any disk cache (like DOS's SMARTDRV or Norton Utilities' NCache2), my entire system would lock up. Running under DOS was the only way I could make sure there was enough free RAM to play the game. Running under Windows 95 simply took up too much RAM so the entire game was being swapped to disk, causing performance nightmares. Unfortunately, 18MB was the maximum my machine could handle (the odd number was because there was 2MB soldiered onto the motherboard and I had 4 4MB 30pin SIMMs). By the time Dungeon Keeper II rolled around, I was able to upgrade to a Pentium II 300MHz machine with 128MB of RAM (while most people were rocking 32MB) and an ATi All-in-wonder Pro 8MB AGP 2x video card. Needless to say at that time I had no problems with nearly any game I threw at it (it was a top-of-the-line system, the only chip faster was the PII 333MHz until a month and a half later when Intel released the PII 350MHz with the 100MHz FSB and the 440BX chipset). Heh. Those were the days. I want to build myself another high-end gaming rig. This is too much of a memory jerker.

I don't know how many times I said that when I first went to the USA, not that I didn't hear, but trying to make out what you guys were saying. Hahaha! I'm sure it happens when one of us goes over there. A normal one of us anyway. I'm fairly well versed in British English. Years of watching Dr. Who and every episode of Red Dwarf ever made. And I've picked up a lot here on the boards as well. We have the John Wayne movies, Star Trek, and just about every movie that came out of Hollywood :P I didn't know that. You should have picked up enough to understand us.. Well, We also have quite a few different accents. Basically it's Northern, Southern, Eastern and Western accents. I'm smack in the middle of the east coast and we actually have a blended Northern and Southern accent. I'm not sure what the el happened to New york. I've gone there many times and it's hard for me to understand them. I think it's because of the port of immigration at Ellis Island. The large mix of so many languages in one place.. They kind of have their own accent apart from the rest of the US. The last time I was over in the States was back in 2000 when we spent 3 weeks in Florida. I was lucky enough, while I was there, to meet with folk from all over the country. Half the fun was talking to them and explaining what the heck I was on about... :o) For the life of 'em, they couldn't understand a northern English accent. :o) But I had the most wonderful time and made friends that I still have to this day.

Those of us in the aircraft industry often use a slightly modified version on bad days at the office: \"Per Ardua Ad Nauseum\".

So without changing anything on your machine, you can gain information that will help. If you signup for an account then you can work through many things without the steep learning curve. There are many things that still have to happen for ATI to be here...

I'll just leave that to those here that prefer to knock the small attemps of someone like me who got the 96th HUNDRED MILLION credits in BOINC.

I do wonder if those allowed back must start their credits (and all that goes with it) from zero, or if they are allowed to step back into their existing credits and account? While credits have no monetary value, they do have pride and bragging value. It appears they get to step back into their existing accounts and credits. I would think if incident was serious enough to banish a person, that they would not be able to step back into their credits and original 'Member Since' date. Yes, we got to get our old accounts back. I was one of the banned, but I'm a changed man after 18 months of solitary confinement. And I thank the SETI crew for allowing us to come back. Its time to get back to science, and not dwell on the past. We paid for what we did, and now its behind us. Happy Crunching Heflin! I would say \"ditto\" to that KB7RZF. What sort of society would any be if after serving time offenders are punished further and by those who are not judges (seti admin being the judges in this case) but by the whim of the general public (forum members in this case)? SETI or any BOINC credits are an indication of contribution made to science.

Place the cream, milk and liquorice root into a saucepan and bring slowly to the boil. Remove from the heat and leave to infuse for at least an hour, or longer if possible. 2. Return the pan to the heat and bring back to the boil. 3. Place the egg yolks and sugar into a large bowl and whisk together until combined. Pour the boiling cream mixture through a sieve onto the egg yolk mixture and whisk well. Discard the liquorice roots. 4. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and return to the heat. Heat gently, stirring continuously, until thickened - don't allow it to boil. 5. Leave to cool, then pour the mixture into an ice cream machine and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions. It looked good until I came to the 'ice cream machine'. I don't have one of those.

At work, I finally, finally, today got hold on a developer at Microsoft! I found an error in the latest update some weeks ago when a customer reported an error in the upload file to Tax, and I was able to reproduce that same error in my demos using the same kind of input. I made a good error description and my boss started to pull all the strings to Microsoft she has, and finally a case was initiated. Last Monday there was an email in my Inbox telling me that they considered that error solved in the last update and therefore had down-prioritized my report! I wrote a reply saying NOOOOOOO, it's the latest update that creates that error, it hasn't been solved, on the contrary, and I called the two phone numbers I have got to the development department at Microsoft only to leave a message to them to call me back. So today one of them called me back and I had a nice talk with that developer. He agreed with me that it's an error in the latest update, and they have been able to provoke that error themselves, and the case has been up-prioritized to have top priority. So now I am waiting for a correction update to be sent out, which will take a couple of weeks here in the holiday period. Luckily the customers also have holiday, so they are not that needy. I called our customers to inform them about this and none of them have had that error when they ran the wages for July. I told them that if they get that kind of error, they shall send the file generated to Tax to me so I can correct it for them before they try to upload it to Tax, to avoid that they get an error there. I'm going on my two weeks holiday tomorrow, so hopefully they don't get that specific error while I am away from the office. And I have an another customer who had got an error in the file to Tax, which I can't recreate in my demos. I have remote access to her system so I have spend a lot of time to figure out what she had done, and I have done the same from what I could see from her system, but I don't get that error in the tax file! A periodic error it seems to be! It must have something to do with the way she had typed in the data, but she's away on her holiday, so I can't get in touch with her to ask her what exactly she has done when she ran that wage. I have spent hours and hours on this now! And as long as I can't recreate that error, I can't file an error report to Microsoft about it! I can't wait till tomorrow when I leave, then I have my holiday! I think though that I have to leave a message to my boss, who's on holiday this week, that if some of the customers call in about that known error, she can call me and then I can come in to the office and correct the file to upload to Tax. So I'm not going anywhere in my holiday. I think I will spend some days in my brother's summerhouse and garden, but that's nice also. It's a nice place to relax. Now, hand me a cup of that good Rocky's Coffee Club coffee. Thanks! I can certainly commend you on your perseverance Fuzzy. I can only wish that I could get the results you do.

Please feel free to make your comments I would like to hear what you have to say. Here is a Photoshop print of a negative from Tri-X aged for 12 years and developed in Rodinal for effect and is a virtual print in Photoshop it does not exist on paper but only on film. It was exposed in 1996 and developed a few days ago. Notice the 6 tones - white, black and 4 gray tones. I like this photo Paul. I have filters for my digital camera which are useful for subsequently turning photos into black and white with Photoshop/Paint Shop pro. It's something I would like to try out some time. This is certainly giving me some ideas. I particularly like the 'leopard skin' effect you seem to have got with the leaves. It an effect of the ageing of the film 12 years and the developer Rodinal which is about 20 years old and had an indefinite shelf life when left un-opened. It's an effect then that is probably impossible to replicate, unless using the same process you did. That's what I like about film is the chance effect. I have some more old stock I will do some river scenes on Monday with the old stock and some fresh stock and I am doing clouds studies now. You mentioned some filter studies you would like to try will you post them. Remember to be creative and not just take shots like a tourist or like a post card but create an art piece. After almost a year with a DSLR I am still at the 'point and shoot' stage getting used to using a DSLR camera and trying out different settings to understand how it works. I would very much like to move into a more selective phase and capture something like the special photos that really are 'art'. To be honest I only have a start of a filter selection. I have a UV filter which is on the lens at all times and acts to protect the lens, a graduated blue, a brown and a polarising. I think the brown is the only one that could be usefully used as a prelude to black and white image PC manipulation. For Black and white try orange and red and green and polarize filters. Try the red and polarizing and then try the orange and polarizing filters and try the green with people and try an infrared and red or orange filters. UV is good for color and lens protecting. I have been doing photography since 1967 with a Ricoh SLR. I use Pentax and Nikon for film now work and Olympus for digital all SLR\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s. I also use 4x5 in copy film for special effects. I will buy a new film camera a complete manual model with k-mount lenses in the near future I hope. Thanks for the tips Paul, I shall get those filters on order with my favourite on-line supplier. When choosing my Canon EOS 40D I was very tempted to go for a Nikon instead, but my investment in lens ties me to Canon, which is the way it goes with cameras nowadays. All of my lenses are Pentax K-mount's for my film cameras. Except for the Olympus and it is digital it is bayonet mount maybe my K-mount's will fit the Olympus? I had a polarize filter but I don't know where it is I should get another one it would help with my cloud studies I bet. All the major camera models are now digital they don't make film cameras any more but I found a Vivitar that is a complete manual model and has K-mount lenses I shall buy it soon. I find if I use a manual camera I can concentrate more on the composition and exposure more where as if it is fully automatic I am more in a point and shoot mode and the pictures are not as good in that point and shoot mode. The Nikon I bought for my wife but I usually wind up using it and it has bayonet mounts also maybe my K-mounts will fit it. Canon have a 35mm film camera, the Canon EOS 1V - it's the world's fastest 35mm AF SLR camera at 10 frames per second. | 877) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : & [Message 782317](forum_thread.php?id=47892&postid=782317)) Posted 13 Jul 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I never had to fix any springs in my Z3, but then it was in Oxford racing green - so I'm winning | 878) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Team Recruitment Center](forum_forum.php?id=19) BOINC 782315](forum_thread.php?id=47083&postid=782315)) Posted 13 Jul 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Cheers John.

Please feel free to make your comments I would like to hear what you have to say. Here is a Photoshop print of a negative from Tri-X aged for 12 years and developed in Rodinal for effect and is a virtual print in Photoshop it does not exist on paper but only on film. It was exposed in 1996 and developed a few days ago. Notice the 6 tones - white, black and 4 gray tones. I like this photo Paul. I have filters for my digital camera which are useful for subsequently turning photos into black and white with Photoshop/Paint Shop pro. It's something I would like to try out some time. This is certainly giving me some ideas. I particularly like the 'leopard skin' effect you seem to have got with the leaves. It an effect of the ageing of the film 12 years and the developer Rodinal which is about 20 years old and had an indefinite shelf life when left un-opened. It's an effect then that is probably impossible to replicate, unless using the same process you did. That's what I like about film is the chance effect. I have some more old stock I will do some river scenes on Monday with the old stock and some fresh stock and I am doing clouds studies now. You mentioned some filter studies you would like to try will you post them. Remember to be creative and not just take shots like a tourist or like a post card but create an art piece. After almost a year with a DSLR I am still at the 'point and shoot' stage getting used to using a DSLR camera and trying out different settings to understand how it works. I would very much like to move into a more selective phase and capture something like the special photos that really are 'art'. To be honest I only have a start of a filter selection. I have a UV filter which is on the lens at all times and acts to protect the lens, a graduated blue, a brown and a polarising. I think the brown is the only one that could be usefully used as a prelude to black and white image PC manipulation. For Black and white try orange and red and green and polarize filters. Try the red and polarizing and then try the orange and polarizing filters and try the green with people and try an infrared and red or orange filters. UV is good for color and lens protecting. I have been doing photography since 1967 with a Ricoh SLR. I use Pentax and Nikon for film now work and Olympus for digital all SLR\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s. I also use 4x5 in copy film for special effects. I will buy a new film camera a complete manual model with k-mount lenses in the near future I hope. Thanks for the tips Paul, I shall get those filters on order with my favourite on-line supplier. When choosing my Canon EOS 40D I was very tempted to go for a Nikon instead, but my investment in lens ties me to Canon, which is the way it goes with cameras nowadays. | 894) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) HEEELLLOOOO!.....[hears echo...leaves] Hello kaseychief.

Unless it was a Queen bee. They have no barbs on their sting. They can sting away as often as they like, and fly away happily to go eat their rich royal jelly. They're not poor at all. Yes but you have to be really tasty, special, lucky or crazy to be attacked by a queen bee :o) (You are probably more likely to win the top prize in the lottery than be stung by a queen bee..) . You're probably very right. A Queen bee only leaves the hive on two occasions. Once on a mating flight when she is very young, and secondly a new Queen who leads a swarm from the hive. You'd be very unlucky to find yourself in the middle of a swarm, but very unlikely to be stung since they have gorged themselves with honey before leaving the hive and are as docile as bees can get. | 949) |[Message 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I got stung by a bee yesterday. Have been stung by yellow-jacket wasps before, but this one was an actual honeybee. My neighbor keeps several hives and I deliberately plant \"bee-invitation\" plants. Usually manage to garden in harmony with them. The \"incident\" wasn't really the bee's fault. I think it was an old, sick, confused bee and my finger sort of collided with it. Any gardener remedies for bee stings? I was stung by a 2 inch long bright orange wasp once when I was in Pakistan and one of the local guys ran off to a lorry and brought back a piece of rag diped in diesel oil to place on the inflamation and a hot stone to put on top of that. It worked. Generally in western meds to help draw out an inflamation keep the wound clean and apply a hot pad/object to the area. (Not too hot though :o) You have a painful finger Angela ... but don't worry revenge is sweet... The bee probably riped it's bottom out stinging you.. Serves it right for stinging you..

Here is a shot of the W hotel in Dallas I took with my old D200. Tons more in my gallery pages on [ pbase.](http://www.pbase.com/dcappello) Nice portfolio I like the group in bw past/2003 it looks like the field of flags was an infrared shot. You should try more special effects to make the images stand out more to give them more interest that way your images will be different from another guy making the same shot that way yours will be different and more memorable and the underwater shots are good also vibrant I notice you used fugi film it is a good film for color saturation witch played well in the underwater shots you use of that film made the shots stand out with the saturated color. Well done. I disagree with this in part. First let me clarify...I am not a photographer...I just know what I like. Ok..here is what I disagree with. I don't think it's necessary to use filters or special effects to get a great photo. In my opinion, what makes for a good photographer is the ability to capture something in the lens that others may just look over or past. Ice has a very good eye ( to me ) for angles and lighting, without resorting to using special effects to make his photos \" pop \". I don't think using special effects make a photo any more interesting than not using them. Sometimes...the best photos are very simple and remain untouched by the photographer except for looking through the viewfinder and clicking the button. Every photographer manipulates the camera in the exposure and the print whether it is a slight focus to emphasize a desired effect or an exposure emphasis or a white balance change for a creative exposure so every one who has used a cameras has made special effects either by design or by mistake and later marveled at the result. But for those who use simple digital cameras...about the only thing you can control is whether or not a flash goes off. I have seen pictures from those types of cameras that are as good, if not better than some of the more expensive cameras simply because the photographer had caught something at an opportune time. Of course, there are programs like Photoshop...and I am sure that some manipulate their photos through there. Some do, some don't. Either way, most people ( I am talking normal everyday people like me ) have no idea how to manipulate photos in the program to emphasize any particular thing. Cleaning them up due to red eye, or being slightly out of focus, perhaps. But true image manipulation takes more expertise than many have. I think that photography is very much about preference. I might like a photo I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2ve put up, but you might not. If you do, it makes me feel good because I took the trouble to compose it, take it, edit it for viewing (even if only cropping it to size and uploading it), and was brave enough to show it as my work. For some, including me, photography is about experimentation, trying to do better, or different, or finding different subjects rather than sticking with the same photos of the same sort of things. Paul\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s work interests me, and although some of it is not my cup of tea it is not criticism that I am sure Paul will be worried about, because I have looked at his photos, they have made me think, and perhaps I will come to appreciate them more for what they are and try to emulate them in my attempt to broaden my photography skills. I expect like Paul, I appreciate people looking at my photographs. Getting feedback is always welcomed, good or bad.

I have heard that the addictive stuff lingers for as long as 3 days after the last cigarette. Not sure on this one. I do know that the habits that come along with smoking, such as stopping to buy them, picking up a book and a smoke at the same time, or in my case, playing video games, are very hard to break. I have two very bad habits. (I'm such a bad boy). Every morning when I get up In have to roll a cigarette and have a smoke.

Both are related in what I have to say. On the subject of smoking, I have given up 'seriously' three times in the past few years, the last time I gave up for over 3 years. The driving reason on that occasion wasn't that I wanted to give up, it was the expense. I estimated I would save \u00c3\u00c2\u00a335.00 a week, I needed the money, and told myself I would feel healthier for it. Did that happen? No. Instead of buying cigarettes (tobacco actually since I smoke roll ups) I was constantly buying chocolates, ice creams, Burger King Whoppers, sweets, biscuits, and all sorts of other indulgences. Quite possibly in excess of \u00c3\u00c2\u00a335.00 a week. Now that I smoke, I don't buy any of those, I'm not so fat, I feel more attractive, I jog, I feel healthier, I can fit into all my trousers without bursting them, and I'm generally happier. I wonder what that is all worth over and above \u00c3\u00c2\u00a335.00 a week to me? I'm not trying to put anyone off smoking, just suggesting you do it for a 'real' reason and not con yourself, because the cessation won't last. In fact I am about to go on an 8 week smoking cessation program, but this time it's because I want to, not to save money, not to make anyone else feel better, but to see if I can maintain the better state I am in, but without the smoking. Saving \u00c3\u00c2\u00a335.00 is indeed a worthwhile incentive, if not seen as a misleading cost benefit analysis of smoking cessation without taking all factors into consideration as I've outlined. But if I am going to reward myself with \u00c3\u00c2\u00a335.00 a week on indulgences which don't involve expanding my waistline again, then the incentive will be worth something to focus on. Like putting the money towards a decent camera, or better still, a far more expensive one than I would have gone for otherwise, as a reward for restraining myself and putting up with feeling miserable because I can't have a cigarette. At the end of the day I might decide to keep the camera I have and keep doing what I want to do, especially if people keep advising me to quit smoking, as if I can't make up my own mind about it. As regards the cameras - there are plenty good to choose from. As far as Canons are concerned, IMHO they are all worth the money and it's just a question of how far you want to go with photography and how much you want to spend. There are plenty of good alternatives to Canon for DSLRs; Nikon have some fantastic models, but with the lens fittings I am stuck with Canon unless I go through shed loads of extra expense to buy lenses for another make. As far a smaller pocket digital cameras are concerned, I have a 7 megapixel Olympus u750 with 5x optical zoom. Some of the photos I have put up here on SETI were taken with this, although by far the most with my 10 megapixel Canon DSLR. Can anyone tell which is which?

The ship is named after the cutty sark, Scottish for a short chemise or undergarment. This was the nickname of the fictional character Nannie (also the name of the ship's figurehead) in Robert Burns' 1791 comic poem Tam o' Shanter. She was wearing a linen cutty sark that she had been given as a child, therefore it was far too small for her.

Hi ECT, I've never tried to grow a pumpkin. I tried to grow more vegetables than ever last year: carrots, onions, spring onions, artichokes, cabbages, green red and chile peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, and some more probably. But they either didn't grow fast enough to be harvestable by the end of summer, or the slugs ate them. This year I'm sticking to the two crops I was successful at; tomatoes and potatoes. Both seem to fruit/crop well and those slugs don't seem to go for them.

If it doesn't take off soon I will give up on UAE Res and join you. It takes time and hard work to start up a team and get it populated Whiskey. And then to set up a team forum and keep the team organized.

It's not that people don't want to crunch for England; I can only imagine that they are either established in a team already or have no wish to join a team. However, time and trying can pay off and now there is a healthy Team England growing here in SETI as well as many of the other projects. Which is fantastic to see since I was a member of Team England in the original project I crunched for which introduced me to BOINC, [BBC Climate](http://bbc.cpdn.org/team_display.php?teamid=230&sort_by=total_credit&offset=0).

I agree with you Es. People have a right to an opinion about declawing cats, and should be able to state their case, or their feelings, or facts or whatever. The same as I have been doing when speaking up against declawing. As I said earlier, it is the first time that I heard about declawing when this thread started. Whilst my instinct is to speak up against it I have listened to the arguments on the other side - and they should be listened to as much as any side. As in any arguments, it's not the winning that counts, but the impact of understanding it makes on people. I like to think that I understand more about the whole of the argument now, and would prefer people to let others have their say without getting morally superior. | 1130) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) . . it's known as 'Trust' iX - the tiny knew You were alright I'm alright Richard, but not sure about being alright on this beach though ;) Hunstanton beach in Norfolk on a grey summers day | 1131) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Posted 16 2008 Anyone for tennis?

I am addicted to caramel filled chocolate- and I found that Hershey's makes a grand version that is 'sugar free'- it's not made with artificial stuff- it's sugar free.. and I cannot taste the difference. There are other brands I've tried that I could and was disappointed in. Yes, sorry to say- Werther's Originals sugar free has a vastly different taste than teh traditional version. It's the artificial sweeteners. So from one weightloss warrior to another- try the sugar free versions. Now there is an option I hadn't considered MzSnowleopard. I haven't had sugar in my coffee or tea for many years now, in fact can't drink it if it has sugar in it. But I've always been partial to chocolate, sweets, cakes and puddings. Many years ago I suffered from stomach ulcers and had a partial [vagotomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagotomy) which cured the problem. But prior to that I was advised to eat liquorice and Pontefract Cakes to help with the ulcers and am still addicted to them even after all these years :P But I must admit my weight loss started when I started up smoking again earlier this year, I simply stopped snacking all the time and generally ate far less of everything and hardly any sweets. I also started up jogging regularly again at the same time (I have medals for half marathons and 10K's from years back).

Understanding the situation is half the battle. Below are some valuable lessons. Lesson 1: Scratching is a natural behaviour for cats. This isn't exactly a revelation, since you probably have the evidence everywhere, in the tattered corners of your sofa, the shredded drapes, your frayed nerves. Though Kitty's natural propensity for scratching my not be big news, it is a fact that you'll need to take into account if you're to make any headway in winning the battle to keep her from scratching in places you consider undesirable. Lesson 2: You can't keep your cat from scratching. What you can do is stop her from scratching those items you value and want to keep in their relatively pristine state. Bear in mind Mark Twain's advice, which applies universally: Never try to teach a pig to sing; it frustrates you and annoys the pig. Translate this bit of wisdom to your dealings with cats and you'll avoid a good deal of futility and frustration. You can't make a cat do anything she doesn't want to do. Get clear on that. And getting her to stop something she enjoys is just about as difficult. Therefore you have to think smart and re-channel her desires. A word about punishment: Don't do it! Cats don't understand physical punishment. In addition to it being wrong to hit your cat, punishment simply doesn't work and is likely to make your situation worse. Clever though Kitty is about many things, she won't understand that you're punishing her for scratching the couch. She will only compute that sometimes when you catch her she is treated badly. This may make her insecure and stimulate her to scratch more or develop other undesirable behaviour problems. Eventually you will break the trust and security that is the basis for your cat's relationship with you, and you will find it very difficult to catch her for any reason at all. Cats have excellent memories and hold serious grudges. Fortunately, there is a simple alternative available for you and your cat. It consists of a good, sturdy scratching post covered with strong material and lined with catnip. You can make one yourself or it can be purchased. With close attention and a lot of encouragement, your cat can be perfectly happy scratching on his own furniture rather than yours. | 1231) |[Message Jun 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Can you show me statistics about how many cats suffer these complications as opposed to those that don't??

In traditional declaw surgery the vet extends the toe and cuts the nerves, ligaments and tendons, using a guillotine-type nail trimmer (or a scalpel), severing part or all of the third phalanx or terminal toe bone. An improper incision or cut may cause claw regrowth and/or cause damage to the pad which may result in lameness. Additional surgery may be necessary to correct the mistakes of the original surgery and to relieve symptoms. General post-operative complications of declaw surgery also include, but are not limited to, pain, hemorrhage, swelling, and/or infection. Improperly done, declaw surgery can cause damage to the radial nerve, lameness, paralysis, and bone chips which retard healing and cause recurrent infections. Amputation of a leg as a result of infection or complications can also occur. Declawed cats can also suffer chronic back and joint pain as shoulder, leg and back muscles weaken following the loss of part of the toes. Anesthetics administered for surgery present their own risks, and are a very important factor when unnecessary surgeries are considered. With traditional declaw methods, there is an unavoidable amount of tearing, crushing, and bruising that leads to postoperative pain and swelling . Traditional declaw surgery requires suturing and tight bandaging to prevent hemorrhaging after the procedure. In many veterinary hospitals and clinics, strong opiates are administered for pain post-operatively. Many veterinarians feel that cats do not suffer pain and do not routinely administer pain medications for surgeries including declaw surgery, unless the client requests pain medications for these procedures. Often there is an extra charge for pain medications administered post-surgically, whether routinely administered by the veterinarian or administered at the clients request. Because declaw surgery causes significant pain and involves many risks the decision to declaw should never be made for owner convenience. The loss of part of the cat's toes and his claws can be physically traumatic and psychologically demoralizing for your cherished family pet. Declawing a cat for owner convenience is never ethically justifiable. | 1240) Jun 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: The following is a list of countries in which declawing cats is either illegal or considered extremely inhumane. - England - Scotland - Wales - Northern Ireland - Germany - Austria - Switzerland - Norway - Sweden - Netherlands - Denmark - Finland - Brazil - Australia - New Zealand - Poland | 1241) |[Message Jun 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: [Shine on you crazy diamond.. ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZSWAkJ3h8E) ;-) One of my all time favorites.

That suicide is painless. It brings on many changes. And I can take or leave it if I please. I try to find a way to make, All our little joys relate, Without that ever-present hate, But now I know that it's too late, and... That suicide is painless. It brings on many changes.

I had the pleasure of driving a Mustang through the this valley some years back at speeds I can't say in case the cops are reading this. I hired the smallest cheapest car to take to me a ski resort in Arizona, but when I turned up to collect it all they had left was this grunt of a car with goodness knows how many cylinders which they let me have for the same price, no excess mileage charge. So instead of skiing I whizzed round all the states around Arizona, and even managed to spin it off on an elevated track in the desert as it swayed and lost traction at over 80mph. As the sand flew around me I imagined the car was tumbling over and over, and all I could think about was that I didn't buy any damage waiver. The car had spun round and round horizontally with not a scratch on it, just imprints of my hands on the steering wheel where I had gripped it in terror ;) | 1245) |[Message Jun 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Having pets, just like having children, is a responsibility as well as a privilege. When you adopt a cat, you're adopting the negative as well as the positive aspects of the animal. Although a cat is not a human with fur and should not be treated as such, she has unique physical and psychological characteristics that must be nurtured, not destroyed. If you're too busy to look after the best interests of a cat, or your own selfish desires take precedence over her health and safety, you have no business sharing your house with one. I'd agree with you there Dominique. I've shared a house, my house, with two cats for some 7 years now, ever since they were kittens. They have shredded my sofas, wallpaper, wooden furniture, my back when I've worn a thin T shirt as they jump up and play parrots with me, knocked things off my desk, disturb me when I'm trying to work on my PC, leave nasties on my carpets and bring in live and dead frogs and birds. But it's all part of the wear and tear of what I choose to accept into my life, and the joy and affection they give which more than makes up for that wear and tear and things like sofas that have to be replaced sometime anyway. If anyone can't accept a cat for what it is, they shouldn't butcher it for their own convenience. Just don't have one and leave the adoption worries to those who do love cats and who don't wish to surgically remove their body parts. | 1246) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [Closed - Use the Last Two Letters to Make a New Word](forum_thread.php?id=47483) ( [Message 767562](forum_thread.php?id=47483&postid=767562)) Posted Jun 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: An English lawn is not the same without an occasional Blackbird.

It's not just me that \"sez\" so. Declawing Robs a Cat of His Chief Weapon of Defense A typical counter-argument is, \"My cat is indoors-only.\" Even indoor cats sometimes manage to escape. A declawed cat does not stand a chance against a large dog, a bigger cat, or a predator. Although he still has teeth, by the time he gets in close enough to bite, it may be too late. Declawing is Painful Surgery Think of it as 10 amputations (if only the front feet are declawed). Pain meds may help initially, but phantom pain may last for weeks or months, as nerve endings heal. Doctors describe the pain following surgery: \"Unlike routine recoveries, including recovery from neutering surgeries, which are fairly peaceful, declawing surgery results in cats bouncing off the walls of the recovery cage because of excruciating pain.\" Declawing May Lead to Litter Box Problems Declawed cats often associate the pain when digging in litter with the litter box itself, and will avoid it, choosing softer carpeting instead. Declawing Sometimes Leads to Biting Problems When cats lose their ability to give a quick warning scratch, they will often resort to their second line of defense: a good, hard bite. The cat's owner may sometimes find himself the victim, just when he thinks his cat is enjoying a petting session. Cats Need the Exercise Their Claws and Toes Provide Watch a cat stretch, whether horizontally on a carpet or vertically with a tall scratching post. He will grab the carpet or sisal with his claws, using the resistance to pull and stretch his muscles. Cats' claws actually play a large and positive role in their amazing muscle tone and agility. Altered Gait May Lead to Later Joint Problems Domestic cats are digitigrade, meaning they walk on their toes. Walking with an altered gait because of the lack of the first digit of the toes can affect all the joints of the leg, resulting later in arthritis of the hip and other joints. Cats Need to Be Cats for Their Entire \"Nine Lives\" Honestly, if a cat could speak human language, do you really think, given a choice, he'd say, \"Sure thing. Cut off part of my toes?\" His claws and toes are an integral part of making a cat a cat. Would you honestly want him to be anything less, especially since there are humane alternatives? It's your decision, but please take your cat's needs into serious consideration before making such a drastic and permanent choice.

Cats do not scratch furniture with malicious intent. Scratching is part of their regular self-maintenance program to keep their claws nice and sharp for self defense. When cats scratch, they are actually dislodging and removing a transparent sheath that grows over the claws. You may occasionally find these sheaths buried in your carpet. Scratching also stretches and tones your cat's back and shoulder muscles. Declawing is NOT just nail trimming. Nor is declawing only the removal of a portion of a claw. Instead, it is the surgical amputation of the first joint of the cat's toes. Whether this procedure is accomplished with a scalpel, a guillotine-type cutter or a laser, it is major surgery and something totally unnecessary unless it is necessary for the cat's health reasons. The disclaimer, \"It's better than putting him to sleep\" is a fallacious argument, and usually offered only to soothe the owner's conscience. Only the cat's owner can make the decision to kill their cat because of scratching problems. He or she can also make the decision to let him keep his toes. Unlike neutering, which does benefit the cat, both health wise and behavioral wise, declawing simply does nothing positive for the cat. | 1278) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [Closed - Use the Last Two Letters to Make a New Word](forum_thread.php?id=47483) ( [Message 767101](forum_thread.php?id=47483&postid=767101)) Posted RECONSTRUCTION as Champ Won](forum_thread.php?id=47303) ( [Message 767097](forum_thread.php?id=47303&postid=767097)) Posted 12 Jun 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I'll take the Ice - you can keep the cream ;) | 1280) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [Closed - Use the Last Two Letters to Make a New Word](forum_thread.php?id=47483) ( [Message 767094](forum_thread.php?id=47483&postid=767094)) Posted [Closed - Use the Last Two Letters to Make a New Word](forum_thread.php?id=47483) ( [Message 767086](forum_thread.php?id=47483&postid=767086)) Posted Jun 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: or start smoking my socks ;) That'll cause brain damage ;-) It'll give me a lot of darning to do | 1283) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [Closed - Use the Last Two Letters to Make a New Word](forum_thread.php?id=47483) ( [Message 767083](forum_thread.php?id=47483&postid=767083)) Posted Jun 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I'm smoking the last of my duty free.

As I strolled along the beach to kill some time and take in the sea air, I noticed a small group of people making home made wine on the beach. Or that is what it looked like; demijohns lined up on the sand as they filled them with sea water. Curious, I asked them what the wine would taste like. They had a good laugh of course and explained how the precisely measured amounts of water and wind would make musical sounds replicating pulsars in the constellation Tucana, which was approximately sixteen thousand light-years away. They explained how 47 Tucanae has twenty three discovered pulsars, sixteen of which have had their rotational rate measured. They spin so fast that their radio signals, measured in pulses per second or Hertz, can be rendered directly as an audible tone. The pulsar signals are subjected to interference as they travel through space debris and gas causing them to become distorted by the time they arrive at Earth. The differing wind speeds and directions moving across the demijohns have a similar effect and give a \"Tintinnabulation of Cosmic Musical Scintillation\".

The rides demonstrated the vulnerability of cyclists on the road and was a protest against oil dependency. On Saturday they had their third Brighton ride, and I just happened to be there on a trip to the south coast of England. They were congregated in a public park by the seafront, about to cycle around Brighton & Hove city. Not all were nude, some partly or fully clothed, some with just body paint, some with just their cycles. They say that \"every day in the UK, on average, 9 people are killed and 700 injured (75 seriously) in car accidents. A further 65 die from respiratory illnesses caused by vehicle emissions. Between now and 2020 the UN predict that a billion people ( a sixth of the world's population) will be killed, bereaved or put in a career role due to car accidents. cars are a major source of CO2 and other pollutants damaging the global environment and all our health. It's time to move on from the anti-social habits of car and oil dependency to something more human-man friendly\". Photography was allowed, welcomed even, also by the police who were standing there bemused with their own cycles.

The winning solutions are based on forced moves rather than relying on your opponent to take and option which helps you get the mate.

Tutankhamun ruled for just 10 years and died at 20 years old of unknown causes. He wasn't buried in the chamber meant for him, but in another which eluded the grave robbers. When found by Howard Carter in 1922 it was simply stuffed full of treasures, many of them on show at the exhibition. Amazing stuff from 3,000 years ago. Tutankhamun as 'the living god' set about to restore the many gods that his predecessor, Arkenaten had replaced with one god, Aten or sun disk. Apparently all the gods circled the earth with the Sun and Arkenaten decided there should be just one god for all to worship, apart from the god Pharaohs of course. The exhibition was also about Arkenaten and other relatives of Tutankhamun, and was all very interesting ;) | 1452) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : . . . nice goin' iX - Paint us a Picture of the King TUT Exhibit btw - 'bird' is a reference to women (in case others don't know} ;)) Bird is the word!! ;o) Here is another bird I saw ;) It's [Eros](http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~loxias/cupid/eros.htm) shooting the tourists in Piccadilly Circus (It was a gray overcast day in London today, not too good for photos) [ ](http://photo.brilliantsite.com) | 1453) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) . . . nice Day you seem to be havin' outdoors - NOW - where's the birds ya took Pics of eh? > jest kiddin' ;)) < great pics btw Funny you should ask Richard, but I did take some photos of some birds, part bird and part human to be exact.

I searched, and found this..I hope its ok that i post it here. ;-) Windsor is the oldest and largest occupied castle in the world. The castle's floor area is approximately 484,000 square feet (about 45,000 square metres). Most of the Kings and Queens of England have had a direct influence on the construction and evolution of the castle, which has been their garrison fortress, home, official palace, and sometimes their prison. The castle's history and that of the British monarchy are inextricably linked. Chronologically the history of the castle can be traced through the reigns of the monarchs who have occupied it. When the country has been at peace, the castle has been expanded by the additions of large and grand apartments; when the country has been at war, the castle has been more heavily fortified. This pattern has continued to the present day.

This picture gives me an idea of how the \"Adrian Wall\" in northern UK must have looked like once it was built. It has a similar architecture stile to me. Nice picture.It gives a solide impression. This dam, Derwent Dam, was constructed between 1901 and 1916. A local quarry, Bole Hill Quarry, was chosen to supply around 1.2million tons of stone for the reservoir walls and railway infrastructure was constructed to support the quarrying operation. A village called Birchinlee was constructed in the valley to house the workers, consisting of well ordered corrugated iron homes along with shops, a school and a village hall. The village, known as 'Tin Town', was dismantled on completion of this and another dam close by.

Is that the font on your machine that is somewhat different? I'm curious. Rush, the truth is, because i'm not great at this! Not your fault John. Graphic programs will tend to merge lettering onto another graphic in a way that it blurs, the thicker the lettering the more it will tend to blur. There will be no blurring of the button if it is white (with a black border). You could then use a 'replace white for gray', or fill the white area to gray to get a button with sharp lettering. This will work for other colors than gray of course, but in all cases you will lose any textured effect on the button. Your solution to use a thinner font, resulting in minimal blur and retaining the textured button, is a good one. | 1541) |[Message May 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Great shots Albert.

BTW, if anyone tries to tell you that Jet-Ski's are a recent invention, I owned a used British \"Water-Scooter\" in 1967. It was a few years old even then. As with many things, we Brits invented it and others improved on it and made it a commercial success. Sorry, I digress... In the British climate a wet-suit is essential for water ski-ing, wind-surfing and Scuba so after enjoying some time on or under the water we had to peel off the rubber and dress appropriately before going into a waterside Pub bar. That was a pain. Then a pub near Ambleside on Windermere called the White Hart (That's not a typo, a Hart is a Deer) built an extension onto the pub at the land end of their jetty and called it the Wet Bar. It was a waterproof bar with water runlet grooves and a central drain in the floor and nothing in the small bar could be water damaged. It was for nuts like me so that we could ski or Windsurf up to the jetty and just walk into the bar in our wet suits and drip dry while we re-hydrated! Brilliant idea. A few years later I was living in Helensburgh in Scotland and my boats were marined at Duckbay Marina near Ballock on Loch Lomond. I told the manager of Duckbay about the White Hart Wet-Bar and they did the same thing for water sports enthusiasts. From wet on-the-outside to wet on-the-inside in less than a minute. I used to windsurf a lot and know a drippy a wet suit can get.

Whiskey, they were all taken yesterday near Windsor, after my visit to Windsor Castle. I took a 40 minute boat trip at the end of which was this iron post. It marks the sharpest turn in any navigable river in England. Many years ago a horse or mule used to walk around and around this post attached to a line which was hooked to the front of the boat, pulling the boat in and turning the boat on itself to be able to make the turn around this sharp bend. [ ](http://photo.brilliantsite.com) Our first four boats were all pre-owned, pre-named and registered under those names. A Freeman 26 cabin cruiser and an Albatross power boat on Windermere in the 70's named respectively; Miranda and Shy-Tot!! It, was too. The previous owner had changed the Ford Anglia 998cc engine for a Ford Cortina 2000cc GXL OHC engine. Shy-Tot went like a bat out of hell. Then we had a 28ft cruiser and a Simms Super V power boat on Loch Lomond, named respectively; Kinky-Kate (After the previous owners wife) and Kin-Ell. It wasn't until we bought our first new boat that we were able to name her ourselves. \"Pixies Dream\" Pixie was my wifes pet name because she was 4'9\" tall, hard-working, happy and had a great sense of humour.

I liked this one ;) Thats a nice name.. And many boats has for some or another reason very beautiful names.. :-) Its like if the owner can name the boat with that name they never could give their daughter.. When it comes to boats, most names arepossible :-) Oh, I don't know about that.

As it happens, it took a lot of work to combine two gifs into one and to optimize it down to 15037 bytes to be fair on people who have to download these images, and to enable me to cram yet another image into my signature. This compares with 66183 and 16305 byte sizes of your 'flat' images in your signature (my combined gif is made up of multiple images to give the animation effect). I also happen to like it, and I'm not going to make signatures just to please you, but will leave it as is - a masterpiece of gif combination and optimization ;) Hmmm.... I did not mean it as an insult Ice. It was offered as constructive criticism so you could improve. I know full well just how much work goes into making images look good. Especially GIF images. Here is my take on this; If you are selling a \"Toolbar\" to people, then would it be a good idea to tell folks what the toolbar is about?. I think so. It might also be a good idea to show folks the toolbar you are trying to sell. And tell them about the features that you have in this \"Brilliant Toolbar\". So this is what i might put in my sig if i was trying to sell that; That image is 26k so its not a very big image size for forums. In fact its considerably smaller than most of the stats images that everybody else has. That image also has all the info you need to know about the toolbar and its features. Plus its a nice compact height at 22 pixels and it will fit well in any forum signature. It took about 20 minutes to make it. Ice, my friend, the image is yours, if you want it, you are welcome to use and abuse it! Johnney. Thanks John, but I'm not trying to sell anything. I made the toolbar for myself to help me navigate the BOINC forums and other useful links I could easily find find on whichever computer I use, wherever.

I have tried to build a forum using phpBB3 but just couldn't get my head around how the permissions worked. I even managed to lock myself out of forums even though I was the administrator :( lol. Additionally, many of the features in phpBB2 are missing in phpBB3, so I would end up with a cut down version of my phpBB2 forum, features which I really would prefer to have. So I dropped my 'evaluation' of phpBB3 until a later time when when they get around to bringing phpBB3 up to speed with phpBB2. I'm going to stay with my tried and tested phpBB2 forum for the time being, particularly when my free host hadn't even sorted out a conversion to copy all the posts and accounts over. I didn't get around to looking at the profile displays in phpBB3, so I'm sorry, I really can't help you here. I think they are controlled by the styles, of which there are very few (two) available in my free phpBB3 forum just now, although many styles are on offer if you have your own server, eg, [http://www.phpbb3styles.net/db/](http://www.phpbb3styles.net/db/) 750742](forum_thread.php?id=46917&postid=750742)) Posted 10 May 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: 4.

The flight from Heathrow was just another \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00cbplane flight, but that from Oslo was spectacular with the amazing views from the window. I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t intend to recount my visit to Moon in a sequential or day-by-day account, but will skip around and as my thoughts of that visit take me. The opening photo in this thread is not the start of my journey, but an indication of my wish to reflect on it. I would be quite happy for you to take part with questions, comments or observations, but I won\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t promise to answer them all, and neither will I answer for anyone else but myself ;) As a reminder that this thread is likely to be a mix of reflections on this journey to see Moon, here again is the opening Moon Goddess reflecting in Moons largest reception room. The window looks in, but the reflection looks out to the south side of her house. If you can work out what is what, then good luck to you :) But I will pick out just one small detail from this photo. The arrow head the Moon Goddess is about to fire is not Nordic at all, but from England from the time of the Battle of Hastings in 1066, fought between King Harold II of England and Duke William of Normandy, when the Normans conquered England and changed the course of British history. A part of that history now completes the bow of Moon's Moon Goddess, amongst the so many interesting things there already ;) [ ](http://photo.brilliantsite.com) | 1671) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) part 3 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46856) ( [Message 750308](forum_thread.php?id=46856&postid=750308)) Posted 9 May 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: This is the view from the stern of the fast ferry as it powers it's ways through the cold Nordic waters [ ](http://photo.brilliantsite.com) | 1672) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) part 3 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46856) ( [Message 750306](forum_thread.php?id=46856&postid=750306)) Posted 9 May 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Here is the fast twin hulled ferry that will take me to Moon's islands [ | 1673) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe part 3 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46856) ( [Message 750304](forum_thread.php?id=46856&postid=750304)) Posted 9 May 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Hei and Good Morning ;-) Im on my way out in the wonderful paradise i live in.. ehh.. lol just thought to post a photo taken yesterday, of my bay, right now containing some special nets for storing fish, waiting to be delivered.

(refresh for another random picture) Here is some information about St. George. Saint George is the patron saint of England. He's popularly identified with England and English ideals of honour, bravery and gallantry - but actually he wasn't English at all. Very little, if anything, is known about the real Saint George. Pope Gelasius said that George is one of the saints \"whose names are rightly reverenced among us, but whose actions are known only to God.\" Facts in brief Everything about Saint George is dubious, so the some of the information below may be taken as mythical rather than real. - Born in Turkey (in Cappadocia) - Lived in 3rd century AD - His parents were Christian - Later lived in Palestine - Became a Roman soldier - Protested against Rome's persecution of Christians - Imprisoned and tortured, but stayed true to his faith - Beheaded at Lydda in Palestine - 23rd April was named as Saint George's day in 1222 Patron saint He is patron saint not only of England but also of Aragon, Catalonia, Georgia, Lithuania, Palestine, Portugal, Germany and Greece; and of Moscow, Istanbul, Genoa and Venice (second to Saint Mark). He's also patron saint of soldiers, archers, cavalry and chivalry, farmers and field workers, riders and saddlers, and he helps those suffering from leprosy, plague and syphilis. In recent years he has been adopted as patron saint of Scouts. | 1825) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 743079](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=743079)) Posted 23 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: bright Moon The sun is shining in the sky and Moon gives a sigh For she can\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t light up the day because the sun is in the way But at night Moon shines bright and the sun is out of sight He is sleeping in his bed and isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t angry to be said That Moon is shining bright in the sleepy starry night | 1826) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 742218](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=742218)) Posted 21 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: The Moon How often does the bright moon come?

So without downloading anything extra, can someone tell me if what are the best settings to use with just plain old BOINC? :-p Maybe later I will try and download whatever, but for now I just want to know if I have everything set right so I get the most speed, and best performance I can get. Below is how it is set up right now. When I first downloaded BOINC, I changed some of the settings because I didnt know what I was doing. Still kind of lost, but I dont get much time to read about this stuff, and only found out about it thru a co-worker. Anyway, here is how I set it up: ........ Some of these options matter more on some projects than others. But for SETI (and others), until you can decide otherwise, you might like to change these options; - Leave applications in memory while suspended? (suspended applications will consume swap space if 'yes') no - change to yes (I expect you want to leave off where you wanted after suspending, and not lose any crunching time) - Use at most Enforced by version 5.8+ 50% of memory when computer is in use Use at most - change to 90% - Enforced by version 5.8+ 90% of memory when computer is not in use Network usage - change to 100% These seem to work for me to try to maximize crunching, but you may have to change them or others if it slows down other programs you have running or overheats your PC - eg, if you fan starts to run constantly) The other values depend on your PC setup, but on a single PC with a constant internet connection the other default values are probably fine. Given that PCs and laptops vary enormously there is no 'easy' answer to these settings. At least BOINC has made some. I have a laptop with keeps cutting out when I try to run SETI, even after adjusting the settings, but it works with Climate, although the fan is running far too much.

I have tried the \" vegetarian \" lifestyle for about 6 months. While I did lose some weight, I also felt a pretty strong lack of energy due to missing proteins ( or so my doctor said ). In no way am I saying that you making a mistake in choosing to be a vegetarian. I am only saying that it simply did not work for me. That said, I am going to make a hamburger. :-) It's funny you should say that Knightmare. I was also a vegetarian for 6 months, when I was a student at university. I went out with a girl who was vegetarian and decided to try it, to be vegetarian. She knew all about the right foods and pulses and whatever, and I can say that most of it I liked and found no problems with my weight or health. However, I think the psychological attraction of meat suddenly got to me one morning as I passed by the student caf\u00c3\u00c2\u00a9 on my way to a lecture. I suddenly had this overwhelming urge for a bacon sandwich, and that was the end of my vegetarianism. I still ate her vegetarian food of course, and she was OK about me eating what I wanted. At the end of the day it's about the choices we make, and finding that proteins don't only exist in meat as foods, but making that effort to find them, and resisting the lure of student caf\u00c3\u00c2\u00a9s ;) | 1832) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Posted 20 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Good morning Mike, and Monday ;) | 1833) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 741652](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=741652)) Posted 19 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: And now for something different; Moon looking at the moon [ ](http://photo.brilliantsite.com) | 1834) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe {science [Message 741624](forum_thread.php?id=46430&postid=741624)) Posted 19 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: PLANET.

This is called a ' [pyroclastic flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow)' event in volcanic terms.

Question 1. What constellation is shown above the viking ship {northern hemisphere?} Question 2. Why is the viking ship displaying the curve at the back of the ship? Question 3. Why is the 'totem' showing a bird character? Question 4. Why is the 'totem' similiar with north American Indian totems {considering one theory suggests the inuit indians used mountain passes from Europe connecting America though the Vikings were the sailors/warriors because of their significant craft of seafaring warring abilities}. Question 5. What is the Indian population of Bergen? It also says \"Tiende \u00c3\u00c2\u00a5r hundre\" .. That means its all about when the vikings discovered America in year 1000 and something ;-) I was just looking at my version of the 'Anglo saxon chronicles' for the precise date, and which Viking king was ruling England then and the precise location of the landing area of the viking ship... You should read Thor Heyerdahl's Ra Expedition... Thor Heyerdahl was Norwegian and Ra was Egyptian, maybe some connection is there. The Vikings discovered America and the Red Indians well before Columbus did and (1) somehow navigated, possibly with stars, before other European did, maybe as far as (2) the Mediterranean and Egypt as well as the Americas (3) and had contact with totem poles (4) well before other Europeans. (5) They may have brought back slaves or guests from the Americas. Who knows? Vikings pillaged and raped in England. Who knows how much Red Indian blood they seeded there? What's your opinion about why they needed to navigate from the congo... I can't answer that. I don't know if they even got to Africa. But I can suggest that the Vikings were raiders who needed to do nothing but what their kings told then to; go and raid, bring back the bounty; show how clever they are by pillaging and raiding in far off land not heard about yet, or see if they can go to where other raiders have managed to get ;) I think Vikings were much like honey bees.

It seems they wrote a script that was supposed to quickly go back and purge some old content from the database. Unfortunately the \"quickly\" part didn't work out (deleting is one of the slowest database operations) so it has turned out to be a slow (days instead of hours) process that I believe is still ongoing.

The say that between 6-10 Joules are needed to create 1 Joule of food energy.

Maybe, but I have a theory with similarities that I put on a web page some years ago. You might not understand it and what Science_Jane says, but I doubt if the universe is a cosy as most might suggest. I found my web page, which I wrote many yeas ago and put it [here](http://www.surfingwithangels.com/god/); of god and angels A long, long time ago there was a fantastic being, call it God if you like, impossible to describe or define, impossible to identify as one or made up of many. It sat there being all-powerful. For a long time. Got bored. Decided to create the universe for something to do. To pass the time. Looked at it - very pretty and soon got bored again. I know, it thought, I shall create life. God created life in different forms, trying out new ideas all the time. Created chickens and thought \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac nice. Soon got bored again. God looked at the chicken and thought \"what would it be like to BE a chicken\"? So he jumped right in and lost all his godly powers to be a chicken for a while. Jumped right out again. Thought about this experience. Thought about sitting around all powerful and feeling utterly bored - for eons and eons. I know it thought, if I make \"Man\" and put myself in him/her; I could taste, touch, hear, laugh, debate, enjoy myself for the heck of it, laze around in bed with a good book all day.... I could do tons of stuff and never be bored! So that's what he did, he made the Earth to be the best place for humans. But part of God, call it devils if you like, started treating mankind like chickens on a chicken farm - for nothing but their own needs and pleasure. This part of God decided to be murderer, a child molester, a child dying of starvation, a man having his head chopped off - just for his own entertainment. Well, the other part of God was 'out there' also. Let us call this part angels. They also agreed with God's original plan, originally agreeing the human race would be a really nice way to exist in a physical plane. Unfortunately the devil part of God is going a bit too far with his 'experiments' and the angel parts have been fighting for a long time to turn things the way they should. But God cannot fight itself. The angels have other ways of 'persuading' the devil part of God to play ball, to stop being so utterly selfish. So the angels decided that, although they could not fight with the rest of God, they would do what they could to make the world the place it should be - free from wars, famine, pain, deceit, lies, selfishness\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6 So they are going about their business right now, often cursing the devils who are having fun at the chickens\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2 expense....

It was night and I was still wearing my white night gown, awakened by the noise and the flickering light from the flames outside. It was burning over the whole island, and also the adjacent islands. They were all covered in large bonfires, except that each bonfire was a building of one sort or another. My mind struggled with the sight and the ferocity of the flames, watching all the buildings as they burned and nothing else, as if each had been lit as a beacon. No other people were visible. A figure in a white gown came up beside me with long white hair, and calmly stood next to me, to my left, standing serenely. She was shorter than me, her head just up above my shoulders. We stood there side by side watching the flames, not saying anything to each other. Every building we could see was in flames, except for the house we were in. The sky itself seemed full of flames and smoke, supplemented by dancing embers and billowing smoke, with the flames below seeming to brighten it. We held hands and knew it would be our last touch in this journey. It was time to part again. And to try again. We turned to face each other and looked calmly into each other\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s eyes, still holding hands. She smiled, as only she could, a warm radiant smile, and softly said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2ll see you\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2.

I got home and left my bag and coat in the hall. Unpacking could wait until tomorrow. It was late and I wanted to power up my computers, get them crunching again, and see if the wire attached to my computer was still attached to a certain computer in Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s islands. Indeed it was, and Moon and I chatted for a while, and eventually we said our \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"See you\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2s. I decided to open the patio door in my office and stepped outside into my garden. There was a little noise from distant traffic, but in my garden, surrounded by trees, it can be quite dark at times, almost pitch black, and can be quite still and remote. But tonight it was quite bright, above me a bright full moon shone, as if welcoming me home. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Welcoming me home?\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 I wondered about this and how at home I felt in Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s house, which I did. They say that home is where the heart is. And I sure knew where my heart was just then as I stood under the moon. But this was my house behind me, and I thanked the moon for its welcome. If my journey to the Moon was now complete, then I had come a full circle, for this is where I started it, if it was about this particular visit. But that\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s all it was, a visit to Moon. My journey continues, the moon shines above me, and Moon is somewhere out there, and still in my journey. I went back into my office and brought my camera out into the garden. I took just one photo, which I later discovered was the 10,000th photo I had taken with this camera since I bought it last August. I was in Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s island\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s earlier that morning, and now I was standing under the moon in my own garden, thinking about how very much I loved her...

I am going to repeat the image that I displayed in part 17, because I discovered something about it. This photo was the last I took before returning to the UK. When I downloaded all the images from my camera to my PC I discovered that this was the 9,999th photo I had taken with my camera. It seemed a strange coincidence, but then numbers have always fascinated me. It may well be superstition, but when I end a sentence with dots, to signify a never ending pause, I always tend to use 3 dots. Moon always tends to use 2. I don't know if any of this matters, but I was once told a saying, \"if something matters, then everything matters\". I arrived at Heathrow to a world so very different to that of Moon's islands. It seemed a million miles away now. I called her to let her know I had arrived safely, and let her know I would be back in computer contact before very long. I drove along the three lane lit up motorway at night and contrasted it with that single lane road in Moon's island, unlit and dark with just car or bus lights to show the way. Despite this I wasn't missing moon's islands yet, just eager to get home and unpack the images of those islands into my computer. It's always nice to collect photos together put them in an album or a computer folder, but then they get quietly stored away. I'm glad for this opportunity to share them of course. Which is one of the of the wonderful things that a forum like SETI@Home can offer, to share words and images. Telling this story is also part of my journey, and I already have another image ready to share, and my thoughts about it. My journey, this part of my journey with Moon, is not quite over yet ;) [ ](http://photo.brilliantsite.com) | 1909) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 738286](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=738286)) Posted 13 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: This (and your story) reminds me to the [\"Two of Swords\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_of_Swords) in the Minor Arcana.

I bought it from a geological shop, not as a pendant, but made one of it with a shoe lace. I like to wear it sometimes, but don't normally wear such, no rings or chains or body piercings. I wore a silver cross in my younger days, given to me as a gift, with an inlaid piece of white ivory, a cross in itself, which turned yellow and brown and rotted, which was a great shame, I was sorry for that. | 1915) |[Message 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I did something different today, I went to a football match, a guest of a company who owned a table in the hospitality suite at Reading Football Club in the English premier division.

However, today, the status showed \"Initiate Request\". When selected, the system indicated that yet another message has been sent to the founder (who hasn't processed a WU since 2006) and if there is no response by JUNE, the request will be granted. Something is not working here. Is there any way to just get this done??? Thanks. You may get some luck if you email the SETI administrators, who may be able to do this for you immediately, depending on whether you have a case for it. This was done by the administrator in another project when the founder for \"Team England (BOINC)\" went missing, before this function to change founders was implemented in BOINC. He asked me to organize a vote amongst the team members for new founder, and implemented the change as soon as this was completed.

Here is what I saw out of my aircraft window as I left Norwegian airspace. As I said earlier, this would not be a point where my journey finished, just another view on that journey, to the Moon, or with Moon. This journey is all about me, not about Moon. It's about my experiences, what I did, thought and wanted to share with you. It's not over yet, not whilst Moon is still there somewhere in my journey. I still have a part bottle of Baileys that I bought in the duty free shop in Amsterdam, where I caught a connecting flight to Heathrow. It reminds me of those Baileys Moon and I shared on the lazy evenings sitting in her Moon Room in her house. I had brought 3 such bottles out with me, and had incredulous looks from the security/customs at Amsterdam as the put them through the X ray machine on my way out. I had checked the rules in a book the lady had by her counter on the allowances from the UK to Norway. They had told me 2 liters, the rule book said 3, so I took 3. A security man engaged me in a conversation about a scratch card \"someone had given him from England\". Was it OK? Where in England could these be bought? I knew he was looking for my reaction, my body language as a single male traveler to get indication as to whether I was carrying illegal substances or whatever. I patiently answered his questions with a smile, and left him with a \"don't waste you money buying those, the chances of winning are pretty slim\", as I dashed off to catch my connecting flight which was due to leave in just 10 minutes. I know that within the last 10 minutes of boarding time, you just can't if you turn up so late. Only standby passengers who have been waiting can usually get on within those last 10 minutes, as they forfeit the seats of anyone who has not turned up by then. The KLM chap looked at me panting from my run, took my ticket and hurried down to the cockpit for permission to allow this late arrival. The captain of an aircraft is the only one able to supersede the 'rules', the only one who can override them. It was my lucky day, they let me on, even if my bag was still in the hold of the aircraft I had just left. My journey then was not broken, and neither is it now ;) [ ](http://photo.brilliantsite.com) | 1928) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 12 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Good morning people from a windy sunny Lincolnshire Just heaved into movement about an hour ago, so not really here.

It was very misty as I trudged up the winding path through the forest, the dew almost percolating in the air as the damp made my heavy cloak even heavier. I disliked these early starts, this tradition of having to perform this duty at such an unearthly hour. Still, I had to do what was expected of my position. The other civil nobles and myself eventually came to clearing near the top of this hill. A small group of soldiers and magistrates waited for us patiently as we made our way to them. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"This is the one\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 a magistrate beckoned to me as he pointed to a figure with two soldiers by her side, ready to carry out the punishment. She wore a white cloak with a hood, and looked sorrowful as she awaited her fate. I asked the magistrate to remind me what she had done. Apparently she had been feeding the local workers who were hungry because of the poor harvests that year, and had been taking the food from the storehouses of her estate without her husband\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s permission. I asked if her husband had objected, to warrant a judgement of death. He replied that her husband was away on a lengthy trip, and no such consultation was necessary to carry out this judgement. The magistrate indicated the two sentries to make ready, expecting my confirmation and official judgement to come. They faced each other with her in between them and raised their swords over her. I looked at the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"X\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 made as the swords crossed and looked up at the Moon as it waned in the early light. It is not the law that is at fault I thought, as I looked down again to her tearful face, but the hopeless way in which it can be applied. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Let her go\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 I ordered, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"and send men to give her every protection and help to distribute her husband\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s food until he decides it should not be so. At that time order him to me when he will explain to me why he has this food when others have none\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2. I had always thought about having my own coat of arms, especially now that they were talking about knighting me. Two crossed swords under the Moon. Yes, that is what it will be, an \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"X\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 under the Moon.

The twin lytranium outfliers hummed as the ship started to vibrate slightly as it massively decelerated to a hovering stop just meters over the landing pad. Dimmed lights were now coming up as cabin crew came by each passenger to check that they were OK as we all came out of hibernation. I always hated the foggy sensation as I tried to remember where I was, as dulled thoughts started picking up to normal speed again. It was always amazing to fall asleep on one planet and then awake on another with no more than a confused thought as I awoke. I was in Port Bergen again, on the blue white planet, so different to the dark grey I had left behind in what seemed just minutes ago. My personal videocom hummed and a bright smiling face appeared. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Hurry up\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"you need to get over here quick\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2. I hurried to the waiting shuttle that would take me to the Moon. It was amazing how quickly these personal shuttles could whisk you to a nearby moon, in this case, the Moon. I was soon practicing a rapid braking decent on a remote area of the Moon, where Moon was waiting for me. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Hurry up\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 she beckoned to me, as I hurried over to her. I could see her yellow-domed Moon House on the hill above us, with it\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s glistening golden lights. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Look there\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2, she pointed excitedly. I had dashed across all the way from Pluto at her sudden glee to come and see this. On the rock was a natural formation, made with twin parallel lines of a deep blue colour against the grey rock. It was a huge almost symmetrical \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"X\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2, sitting there right under her yellow domed house. I couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t believe that no one, including myself, had not seen it before. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We are here now\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2, Moon said as she shook my shoulder.

The faster ferry soon came to whisk me to Bergen, where a plane would take me into the air. I sat on a seat by the window and gazed out at the passing rock formations over the water. I thought about going outside to take some photos, but instead watched as crew members came in and out of the bridge through the door in front of me. I thought about how often, at my request, the captain of aircraft had invited me into the cockpit as I flew whist employed by an airline. It was quite magical to see all the controls and how the crew constantly monitored them, making adjustments as the received instruction over the radio. In heard everything that they heard of course, since my headphones were plugged into their systems. I felt content with the glimpses as the door to this ship's bridge occasionally opened and closed, as various crew members came and went. My thoughts drifted to the islands behind me and a yellow house with and rock outcrop bearing an \"X\" to mark the spot. I hadn't seen that much of the islands, hadn't explored it much at all, or even taken a photo of all the lighthouses, or \"lights\" as Moon called them, as I tend to do when I visit coastlines. I thought about Moon of course, and wondered what she would be doing that day. I hadn't asked, I didn't have a clue. Oh, here's my mobile, maybe I'll call and ask. Or maybe I'll just sit here and gaze at the rock formations across the water. I had told her I would phone when I got to Bergen, and that is what I would do, as I dozed off to sleep still thinking of my journey with Moon ... ;) [ ](http://photo.brilliantsite.com) | 1948) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Team Posted 11 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I just want to say that you guys and gals are doing great to build Team England up here in SETI.

Aye, it's not over yet ;) Moon's sister's husband turned up in has car at my apartment at the promised time and drove me to the ferry as we chatted, his English being very good. I took a look at the islands at that early hour and still marveled at the beauty of it all, the stillness and the fantastic landscape surrounded by the beautiful frame of the sea. He dropped my off at the waiting ferry and we shook hands, and said \"See you\", and I boarded the ferry on my journey to the UK. The ferry arrived at the mainland and it was this point in the picture below that I realized I was leaving the islands, about to set foot on the mainland again, and was uncertain if I would return.

I was chatting with Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s sister and husband and their kids and Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s kids were running around. The other guests eventually, left and Moon told me that we were going for dinner at her mother\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s. Her mother didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t live too far away. In fact we walked through Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s garden, into her mother\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s garden and we were there. Her mother\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s house is not so big, it was built over a hundred years ago when house and room sizes were built smaller. But it seemed comfortable enough and even had a garage. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2m from a large family myself and found it familiar to be in the mix of parents trying to keep order, kids running around, some trying to hold conversations, others helping to prepare the dining area for the meal, and me throwing Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s younger son around like a sack of potatoes. Good game ;) The meal was fantastic; salmon and the best pickled cucumber I can remember. They chatted and Norwegian and in English, and I thought again how comfortable I felt with this group of people. Moon sat across the table from me, but I hardly noticed her at that meal, she was just one of that group as I was. Not that I was of course. I am from outside, a visitor. But that is how I felt, very welcomed, and very much part of what was going on there just now. This was indeed one of the memories I would take away with me. Not of climbing a rock, or of going someplace, but sitting down with Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s mother\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s family for Sunday dinner. I was discovering more about Moon every day, about her through getting to know about some of her family. On this last day I knew I wasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t going to reach the end of my journey, primarily because there was no end. It was a journey. I hadn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t planned where it should go and when it should end. A plane leaving Norwegian airspace with me in it will not complete or finish any journey with Moon. That is just it you see, it was never a journey \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"to\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2. It never has been a journey \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"to\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 the Moon. It has always been a journey \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00cbwith\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2 Moon. I had no expectations, no goals, nothing to be achieved. I came to see Moon, and we continued a journey with each other, as any two people do who decide to spend time with each other. Where did that journey start? When we first posted to each other in SETI? Sometime after? Before? Whenever is was, I have been on that journey with her, finding value as well as company form the journey as we continue along. My last sight of Moon was when I left later that night, my ferry leaving very early. We were at the front door of her house. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"See you\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 she said and smiled. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"See you\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 I replied, and smiled. She turned around and walked back into her house, leaving me to close the front door after me. Nothing had ended, it was just another point on our journey, I had a plane to catch. I started to walk down her road and turned to look at her house just once more. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"I really do love her\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 I thought. But then I smiled. She knows that ;) | 1954) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [A part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 737008](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=737008)) Posted 10 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: A journey to the Moon - an overview, part 11. We now have a twist in my journey. The destination of my journey is stated in the thread title, and that will continue later. But where did it start? If a journey is to be complete it must have a start as well as a destination, or the whole journey may not be understood. I want to share the photo below with you. It forms the background of Moon's website, the one I am building for her, although I had not met here yet when photo was taken. But the photo of her is one that I took, by we web cam when we were in web cam contact, and superimposed it on her photo. I asked he to stand up where she was on the other side of the North Sea and stretch her arms out. She agreed to do it but thought it mad of me to ask her. She sat down again and we continued to chat. As we chatted I cloned my web cam photo of her onto her photo without her knowing it, and then presented it to her. She was pleased with the result, and even though I said I had rushed it and needed to do it again 'properly, she wanted it as it was, and later made it her front page background picture to her website, [www.arizmoon.com](http://www.arizmoon.com). What has that got to do with my journey? Well, I was already on that journey even then, well before I headed out on a 'plane to meet her for the first time in person. My journey had started even before that, and I will say when it was, but first I must go back to continuing my journey to see Moon.

I managed to finish the fridge door that night, and also sort out some thing's on Moon's computer. It meant that I would have nothing outstanding tomorrow; it was my last full day there. There was time to relax that night as well of course, and of course I had the company of Moon. Her arm was still causing her pain and was not only immobile, but made her largely unable to do anything or go anywhere. So we were both content just to be with each other. It was late again when I made my way down her road to my apartment. I stopped as I did almost every time I got to this spot, night or day, and looked at that huge \"X\" on the rock wall below her house, this time shining the light on it to see it in the dark. I still find it strange that no-one else in Moon's family had noticed it, for it seemed so obvious to me and was clearly visible. There was a letter under the \"X\" and Moon later told me that her grandfather's name began with that letter. In fact her grandfather's Christian name is the same as mine, coincidentally. It's a name I know is used in Norway, I found three on the gravestones on the mainland bearing it. There are not too many of us, only one of me, and I was still having an interesting journey to the Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6 | 1971) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 736582](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=736582)) Posted 9 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: The dining table we all sat around.

That evening we had a family meal around Moon's dining table, even though I was the only one who wasn't actually part of the family. Or was I? I was seated at one end of the table, opposite Moon's mother with ten of us in total around the table. Her sister and husband were to my right, with Moon and her mother's partner on either side and the 4 children slotted in around. The food was wonderful and mounds of freshly caught prawns plentiful. I would normally feel nervous about sitting down with a family I barely knew, and not native English speakers at that, although most of their English was very good. But in truth I had met with them all before this, spoken with them all, if only a few words to some, and felt quite happy to be there. But that was for two reasons I think. One is that they made me feel accepted, that it was quite normal for me to sit down and eat with them. It was their way I expect, how they might treat anyone passing through, although maybe not usually inviting them for dinner like this. I was Moon's friend, so this was an exception, I'm sure. But the second reason was more important for me. Moon sat over there by one side of the table and occasionally glanced at me, and smiled, and I was content, happy to feel at home with this wonderful company. Even so, I still felt that I was on my journey to the Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6 | 1973) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 736570](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=736570)) Posted 9 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Paddling at the bottom of Moon's garden | 1974) [DAVID BOWIE - LIFE ON boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [TLPTPW#60 - TL04 is & we are CLOSED for reconstruction](forum_thread.php?id=46098) ( [Message 736524](forum_thread.php?id=46098&postid=736524)) Posted 9 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I'm sitting here at the the top of the pile.

Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s older soon cycled back and soon met me. He parked his bike by the road and we headed off towards the coast to take some pictures. I suddenly ran forward as I saw a sea otter on the far bank, but couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t get my camera out quickly enough to catch it on film. A young boy caught up behind me amused that I would get so excited over an otter :) I handed over my camera and explained some basics. David Bailey then took over the picture taking. [David Bailey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bailey_(photographer)) is a famous photographer and this is my screen name for Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s older son just now ;) He took to the camera amazingly quickly, and the shots he took from the start were all very good. I changed to the zoom lens for him as he tried some distant shots. He took me to the top of a very high hill for some panoramic shots, and then we headed home. We arrived to an empty house and were soon playing games on the computer. It sure felt like home to me ;) Moon and other son arrived, he was OK, and we all helped to make dinner. I sat in my usual chair and helped to serve up, and we ate as we chatted with each other. I never once looked for a TV to watch as we ate, as I normally would do at meal times, and quite enjoyed the talk that took place after the meal was done. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2m not sure if this is how Moon and her boys were usually at dinner, but for me this was as pleasant as any restaurant in Tunisia :) I was still puzzled about this journey to the Moon of mine, since I still don\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t seem to have quite arrived just yet, and knowing that more was yet to come\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6 | 1981) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 9 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Ice, I like your new avatar, what kind of shades are those?

Moon returned from the therapist looking very pleased. The therapist had discovered what the problem may be with here arm and had even started some treatment. She looked thrilled. Some progress was finally being made. I was very happy for her. We celebrated by going into the town and doing some shopping until it was time to get the next ferry back.. I sat across a table in the ferry enjoying Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s smiles as she was so happy they were finally going to fix her arm. She is quite a woman. She had designed her own house. I have seen her design drawings for the barely started garage and it will look fabulous, a natural extension to the house. I have seen much of her paintings, her art, which really is good, and of course her photography is a coming along really well. She works and takes care of two boys, and of the house as well. I was certainly finding a lot about her on my journey, but I sensed that was a whole lot more to find out as my journey progressed. The ferry docked and we were greeted by Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s mother and her younger son, who had cut his chin. Moon had to take the ferry straight back to take her boy to hospital. Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s mother asked me to jump in her car for a lift back. Her English is not terribly good, but she was keen to tell me about the sights on the way, stopping on a bridge to let me take photographs. We set off again and we passed a boy cycling by us in the opposite direction. I could see it was Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s older son and Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s mother pulled over a little way on, finding a convenient place on the single track road. She said I should get out and show Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s older son how to take pictures with my camera, not as an instruction, but something Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s older son and I had agreed earlier, that I would let him use my camera. So, Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s mum knew about that. And off she drove, leaving me to with Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s older son. Hmmm, now here was a twist to the journey I never expected. I was now in charge of Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s older son, and about to teach him photography.

It was a beautiful start to another day. I decided to find that shop again. Moon had told me the day before that they had a hardware section , and I was looking for some bolts. Moon had a door missing from her big fridge, a door almost as big as regular door and a fridge you could easily walk into. It had fallen apart some time ago when a hinge gave way and I decided I would fix it. Interesting holiday this was turning out to be ;) As I walked down from my apartment the area was totally deserted of people, apart from a man working on a boat by the apartment to who I offered a \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Hei\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2.. I headed away from the direction of Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s house towards the shop. Another road was joining mine from the right and I saw the figures of a woman and a very young boy. It seemed like a pleasant sight somehow, just these two and no one else to be seen. The three of us reached the junction at the same time, and to my surprise it was Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s mother with her sister\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s young boy. We stopped to chat as a man appeared, her partner. After a wile I waved \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"bye\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 and continued to the shop. I found my bolts, and some coffee for Moon of course, and headed back to her house. And guess who I bumped into again at the same road junction? Yes, it was Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s mother returning from Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s house. We chatted some more (she is such a lovely lady) and soon I waved \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"bye\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 again and was back at Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s house. Moon was quite surprised that I wanted to fix her fridge, but that had to be another day since I was missing a reinforcing plate which I later managed to get on the mainland the next day. I spent the rest of the day at Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s house, happy to keep her company as she suffered with the arm that couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t do anything. She was going to the mainland the next day, to find out what the doctor could do for her. I asked if I could come along, to see the mainland, and to find the reinforcing plate I was looking for. OK, if I wanted, she agreed. Be at the bus stop by 7:25. I was there on time and we boarded the ferry after the bus dropped us off. The ferry doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t take that long to get to the mainland where we split up as she found a lift to the doctor and I went to explore the town. The town wasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t very big, not a great deal to see, and I soon found myself trying to get into the local church, but alas was locked. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s a habit of mine to go into churches, I just like to look inside them. The architecture, windows, stone and woodwork all fascinate me, as well as all the souls that concentrated there over time. I also like to look at grave stones. They can tell you a lot about a place, the people who once lived there. I moved on and explored the town a little more and soon my mobile rang, and I met up with Moon in a cafe. She had to go and see a therapist, so we split up again. I sat by the water\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s edge near to some yachts taking pictures. It surely was a quietly interesting place with stunning scenery. I lay back and relaxed as I contemplated my journey to see Moon, and why it was that I felt that I was continuing on this journey. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2d found Moon alright, but the journey was still going on\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6 | 2006) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 735984](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=735984)) Posted 7 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: The church on the mainland [ ](http://photo.brilliantsite.com) | 2007) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 735974](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=735974)) Posted 7 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: A fantabulous drama...

I got up the next day and my first thoughts were about chores. My bag had arrived yesterday and I had unpacked, but I wasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t really organized, didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t even have any tea or coffee of my own. Hmmmm, a trip to the shop maybe? But I had no idea where it was. Oh well, a good excuse to go to Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s house and ask (there it was, another magnet drawing me to her house again). In any case, Moon would have some hot coffee ready, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2m sure, if I turned up looking for directions. I found my way to Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s house after a quick call on my mobile to let her know I was coming. On arriving I found a real treat. Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s mum was there and we exchanged hellos. Not much of a chat, and you may wander why I said \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"treat\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2, but later I had the pleasure of longer chats with this really lovely lady. Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s mum soon disappeared and it was probably a half day later that I headed off to the shops, Moon and I finding so much to talk about. Not that Moon could do a lot with her poorly arm, and I hope that our chatter kept her mind off the pain her arm was giving her. Eventually I made my to shops, got what I needed, and made my way back to my apartment to drop off my goodies. Hmmmm, I had some coffee for Moon. Good excuse to go back there I think. Not that I needed an excuse. But the coffee would make sure I got through the front door ;) I sat with Moon that evening sipping coffee, wondering why I could be so happy sitting here when the islands out there were craving my presence as a tourist. I had the feeling I was finally nearing the end of my journey, that I had found Moon as I sipped Baileys with her and talked in soft tones as night drew.

My first day on Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s islands started off as a tourist as I surveyed the wondrous scenes from the hill by my apartment and then by Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s house. I was no longer a tourist as I sipped coffee and chatted with Moon as I had done so many times before, only this time in 3D. The boys soon arrived back from school and my attention wondered to Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s fascinating house. It looks great in photographs but it really has a comfortable welcoming character of it\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s own. I soon found myself falling in love again, but this time with her house ;) There was something I needed from my apartment, so I made my way back, grateful it was daylight so that I could see which way to go. Her road to the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00cbmain\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2 road was interesting in itself, with it\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s own solid rock bridge over a short stretch of water, To my right was a huge outcrop of rock, the base of the hill by Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s house. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2m quite interested in geology and like to look at rocks. But here was something absolutely fascinating, two pairs of fault lines about half a meter separating each fault in the pair, and both pairs dead straight for about 10 meters. The pairs cross each other symmetrically in a perfect X. How such a fault can occur I have no idea, but I found it more than interesting ;) I busied myself in my apartment with whatever I needed and was interrupted by a text alert from Moon. My bag had arrived. I went to the front door and there it was, as if appearing by magic. Thank you very much KLM. I unpacked and found a few gifts I had for Moon and her boys and made my way back to her house. There was that huge X guarding her road. Fascinating. I spent the rest of the day in Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s house, getting to know it better and deciding I really did like it. Moon couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t do a lot since she was in quite a lot of pain and couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t use her right arm, so we sat and talked, and drank more coffee. I was invited to share dinner and simply relaxed and enjoyed being in that wonderful house and talking into the early hours. I made my way back in darkness again, but this time I knew the way. I realized I knew little of Moon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s islands since I hadn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t been anywhere yet, except the two hills and in between. Oh well, I had more days, and still I had a strong feeling that I hadn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t found the Moon yet. Maybe tomorrow\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6. :) | 2017) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 735440](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=735440)) Posted 6 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Moon's older son under the Moon ;) [ | 2018) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 735439](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=735439)) Posted 6 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Moon's older son under the Sun ;) [ | 2019) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 735438](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=735438)) Posted 6 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Is that Gibralter...

I awoke one my first full day in the islands to the alarm on my mobile phone. I opened the curtains to a beautiful day and a wonderful vista, the sun shining and scenery just breathtaking. I found the tea bags that Moon had given me the night before and hurriedly showered and dressed, eager to get out there. My first though was to find some of that wonderful coffee at Moon's house, but within a few steps of leaving the apartment I saw a hill to my left, and veered of, eager to get up there and have a good look around. It was a good vantage point, I could see for miles, out to sea and well into the islands. I could see Moon's house not very far, and could almost smell the coffee, but I stayed there for quite a while, taking a few photographs and just taking it all in. I realized I had fallen in love with this place. It was love at first sight, it had all the things I ever looked for when traveling abroad on holiday, but without the bustle, thronging people and cars. It was certainly beautiful, idyllic and calm. A peaceful haven far from the maddening crowd. I soon forgot about Moon, and headed away from her house down a track on the other side of the hill, just going in any direction to explore. My mobile rang with a text alert \"do you want some coffee?\". Hmmmm, I certainly did, and replied I was on my away, exploring left for another time. It seemed that just like on other days, for whatever reason, despite what I had in mind, one magnet or another would draw me to Moon's house. Good coffee is such a powerful magnet, didn't you know? ;) I arrived to an empty house, no answer when I knocked on the door. What the heck, I was expected so I pushed open the door and let myself in. The house was empty, I called, but no answer. It's such a nice house, so well laid out with so many rooms. Her older son later counted them for me, there were 18. Mostly, wherever you are in her house, you can see many rooms at any one time. As I stood there in the reception area with mounds of counts hanging on the hooks, I could see the kitchen, dining room, two living rooms, bathroom, downstairs bedroom and staircase. But not a soul to be seen. I thought I would take a look in the living room areas, and a quizzical face appeared from outside, wondering what a strange man was doing in her house. The text messages had taken a while to deliver, and Moon had decided I wasn't coming after all and was outside enjoying the sun. Coffee was soon served and I was soon in top of the hill next to her house taking more photographs. I could see a puzzled look below me, what is he doing here? Why did he come, from so far away to these remote islands? as if amazed that I would do so. I didn't care too much about that, I was just enjoying the views as I had done on the hill earlier fascinated by it all. It was so strange that very soon I was sitting on that patio of Moon's, as if part of the furniture, at ease, relaxed, and sitting next to a Moon who no longer looked puzzled, who seemed to accept my presence there as much as the chair that I sat on :) I had certainly found Moon, but my journey was still only just beginning. There was more of my journey yet to come, and I had not arrived at the Moon just yet... ;) | 2031) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 734529](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=734529)) Posted 5 Apr 2008 by [ : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 734519](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=734519)) Posted 5 Apr 2008 [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 734504](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=734504)) Posted 5 Apr part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 734301](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=734301)) Posted 4 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: One of the apartment bedrooms [ |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 734299](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=734299)) Posted 4 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: The living area in my apartment [ 2036) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 734298](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=734298)) Posted 4 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Here is the entrance to my apartment, the closest one [ ](http://photo.brilliantsite.com) | 2037) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 734295](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=734295)) Posted 4 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: A journey to the Moon - an overview, part 2. The first thing Moon did as I got off the bus was to ignore me and have a chat with the bus driver ;) I waited by the bus as she chatted with him with my camera bag and duty free carrier bag. My case was still in Amsterdam, the flight from Heathrow delayed so that I just made the connecting flight, but my bag did not. Eventually she convinced the bus driver I was mostly harmless, and no, that I hadn't asked to be taken to his leader :) She led me to my apartment along a totally deserted road, just rock on either side, and suddenly we were there. The apartment was very spacious with large kitchen dining/living area, two double bedrooms that could sleep 6 at a stretch and a bathroom with a shower that literally gushed hot water as I found later, not the trickle I had at home. It didn't take me long to unpack, I just put my camera bag a duty free carrier bags in the floor. She had promised me a meal at her house, so off we set in the dark again, Moon worried that I would fall off the bridge on her road that led to the house. The house itself was amazing, even the little that I saw on that first visit. I sat down with Moon and her boys as we ate pie, and had to laugh with them at my attempts to say a few words in Norwegian. Eventually it was time for me to go and Moon said I could borrow the light, \"but don't fall in the water\". And then she disappeared to see to her boys while I found my own way out of the house. I started walking down her road conscious of the fact that I didn't have a clue which way to go; I hadn't been paying attention on the way up. I came to the junction at the end of the road and hesitated before guessing the way. I guessed right and soon found my apartment, although out of the two in the building I didn't know which was mine. Time to guess again, and fortunately I guessed correctly. I was grateful for that gushing shower, and was soon asleep. Little did I realize what sights would greet me the following morning which was the start of a beautiful sunny day... | 2038) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Posted 4 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I have now updated [my toolbar](http://brilliant.forumtoolbar.com/) to include a \"Message boards/forums\" section so that it's quicker to find a link to your favorite message boards :) [ ](http://brilliant.forumtoolbar.com/) | 2039) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 734243](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=734243)) Posted 4 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: This is Moon's photo that made me think I was looking at toy houses and boats :) | 2040) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I've updated [my toolbar](http://brilliant.forumtoolbar.com/) to include links to the BOINC forums and information pages.

I've displayed a lot of photos here in this thread an in the [previous thread](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/forum_thread.php?id=45989). And thank you Moon for supplementing them with some of yours :) But what was it all about? Why did I go to Norway at one of the less better times of year year, with storms and rain forecast just before I set out? Why did I get glorious sunshine instead? Why did I pick that time when the weather was so good, but the islands so quiet without the tourists about to arrive any time now? Why Norway and not some fancy hotel in Tunisia with an outdoor pool and fancy shops to spend my money in? I had already seen some photos of Moon's islands in Cruncher's Cafe of course, and was more than interested to see the place, to take my own photographs, even though the weather might be less than favorable, to explore the islands and find out what they were all about, and of course to meet Moon. I met more than Moon of course; her boys and some of her family and the people around. Moon's older son said I should come back in November, when there were likely to be storms and crashing seas, tornadoes even, as he tried to interest me more. Well, I might just do that since I know I found just a part of what the island have to offer, with much more to see at other times of the year. But what did I find? What did I see on this journey of mine, to see \"the Moon\"? I've never been to Norway before, so wasn't really sure what to expect. I commented on one of Moon's photos that some of the house looked like toy houses, so colourful and pristine. This is the first impression I had when landing at Bergen, seeing all those colourful house on the hillsides, all different in colour, none seeming to be the same. Bergen itself was a large town of course, with larger buildings, but certainly not as busy with people or traffic that I expected. I had a few hours there while a waited for my ferry, and they were certainly not enough, a city rich in character and wonderful sights. It had a very relaxed feel to it, friendly and helpful people, and no hint of any danger or crime. Just throw your bag into the compartment under the bus. It will still be there after a few stops when you finally arrive. The ferry journey from Bergen to Moon's islands was like stepping into the wardrobe of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Chronicles of Narnia) by C. S. Lewis. I was instantly in another world as Bergen quickly disappeared behind me. Journeying through the fjords among the the islands was surreal, the landscape unlike I had ever seen, the sunsets just amazing as I took one ferry to another as darkness fell. Eventually I arrived at the small harbour on Moon's islands, a bus shortly arriving to take me on to my apartment. The bus drove along a single track road, with passing places, no street lights. It was strange to pick out the bridges as we passed from one island to another, and absolutely no sight of any people or traffic, very strangely quiet. The driver didn't understand my pronunciation of the place I wanted to get off, but I knew it when I approached it. There was a single figure by the roadside with a light in her hand, stopping the bus for me. Of course I had finally found Moon, but this is where my journey really began... :) | 2042) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : part 2 :)](forum_thread.php?id=46180) ( [Message 734006](forum_thread.php?id=46180&postid=734006)) Posted 4 Apr 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: These are some great pictures Ice!

Just how much in electricity bills (my hard earned cash that I could have spent elsewhere) has gone into accumulating the credits under my avatar? If the current establishment want money out of me and insist that I don't believe if I don't donate, then I won't take my crunching elsewhere, but will just think that the administration here is sad and I hope it changes soon to reflect a project worth supporting, which I do. Personally I don't think SETI should be begging for money. I give them enough of my computer wear and tear and electricity bills. If I want to give my money it will be to far more deserving causes than SETI. SETI should be grateful for what I give them in my computer time and the energy bills I pay to get the work units to them. Please (SETI) stop begging at me. Another monthly donation from me went on it's way to the guys over there. Some of us do believe.

No one wants to be alone for any length of time and Moon's house looks like the ideal balance to me. Peace & tranquility, life a short walk away. It certainly has an isolated feel about it, but a pleasant isolation, calm and pleasing, just friendly people passing in the odd car, always smiling at you, the bicycles with smiling people and even older teenagers offering a \"Hei\" (Hello). Mostly it's easy to take just a few steps and be totally alone, not a person or building in sight.

When I first saw Moon's photo's of the area I suggested she use PhotoShop or similar (I use Paint Shop pro) to clone out these 'lines' coming out of the water since I thought maybe they spoiled the picture, especially when there was nothing else but scenery. (I often attend photo competitions where I see judges making such comments). She declined of course since she knew what they were, and are part of the landscape. They are measures to let boat skippers know if the water is high enough to navigate, since they get tides like any other coastlines do. This one also probably marking the navigation channel. | 2118) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe 731695](forum_thread.php?id=45989&postid=731695)) Posted 29 Mar 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: pretty country for sure.

Below, the crane has just lifted aboard the rake and its load of seaweed. Prongs of the rake are visible on the right-hand end. In Norway the alginate industry originally used Laminaria digitata, a seweed, but as the industry expanded its market, it became necessary to exploit the Laminaria hyperborea \"forests\". A harvesting vessel was designed specifically for this purpose. The harvesting is done by dragging a large rake-like device through the seaweed bed where it cuts the plant near the holdfast. It is fixed to a crane on the boat and after about two minutes of dragging the crane lifts the rake and its catch (about 2 tonne) into the boat (above). A boat can carry up to 130 tonne, and when full it takes its load to a storage silo where it is chopped and stored in a formalin solution. When more raw material is required by the factory, it is then taken there by a larger ship. The harvesting areas are divided into five parts and harvesting is by rotation every fifth year, allowing the beds to recover. A study has found that while harvesting by this method removed all the adult kelp plants, small kelp plants were left undisturbed and, with the improved light conditions, they grew to a height of at least 1 m within 2-3 years. | 2154) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 729892](forum_thread.php?id=45989&postid=729892)) Posted 24 Mar 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Here is a closer look at Moon's house from this spot [ ](http://photo.brilliantsite.com) | 2155) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 729886](forum_thread.php?id=45989&postid=729886)) Posted 24 Mar 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: This is my favorite boat in the islands, it was before I even got there.

Coconut Ice Coconut Ice is also known in Puerto Rico as Dulce de Coco (Dulce Tipico de Puerto Rico) and not only eaten in England but also South Africa and Argentinia. This is a delicious and attractive candy snack for any coconut lover. While there are many ways of making this candy, here is my simple version of \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Coconut Ice\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2. Three cans of 14 fl. oz. (415 ml) sweetened condensed milk 3 lbs 5 oz (1500 g) powdered sugar 2 lbs 9.25 oz (1170 g) desiccated coconut Pink food coloring as needed Combine the sugar with the desiccated coconut and then add the condensed milk. Mix well until no dry spot appear. Pour half of the mixture into a paper-lined \u00c3\u00c2\u00bd sheet pan (13 inches x 18 inches) and level the surface with a rolling pin. Tint the other half of the mixture by stirring in the food coloring. Pour the pink mixture on top of other layer, and level the surface. Press all down firmly and allow hardening in the refrigerator. When firm, turn out of the pan, remove the paper and cut into 1 inch squares with a sharp knife. Nice! Let's play golf! 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) I won't tell. :D:D:D Please don't.

What is trash is fair game. As a kid I would go to the bay, beach, Balboa Park and dig through the trash looking for glass bottles and aluminum cans to sell to the local recycler. Sometimes I even see people scanning the beach with handheld metal detectors looking for dropped change and jewelry. Neither I, nor anyone else that I have seen, have ever been arrested for such things. I also don't see people being arrested at yard sales and swap meets selling other people's junk. The only time someone is in trouble is if they copy music/movies and then sell those bootlegged copies. At most this guy should lose his job, but only if there is a policy in place that employees are prohibited from dumpster diving in the employers trash. If the average joe citizen happened upon the trash should he/she be arrested too? I think not.

There was a case here a few years ago where a computer company tossed out about 40 old (XT class) computers that were, for all intents and purposes, totally obsolete. A county deputy sheriff caught 2 juveniles getting some of the computers out of the dumpster and stacking them into their pickup truck. They were arrested and cited with theft by unlawful taking, ticketed and released. At their court appearance their lawyer argued that trash was trash and if they had been collecting empty beer cans nothing would have been done. The judge ruled that since the computer company had testified that the computers were being disposed of, not being sent for recycling or reclaiming, hence no monetary loss was involved, the computers were fair game. If anything, they saved the trashmen some work. No crime had been committed. The kids were acquitted. That's what the law is about. It's the circumstances and small detail that can be used to apply a law or get drug dealers off scott free. No matter how you feel the morals 'should ' apply, it is the 'law' that applies in a court of law. | 2342) boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : inputs ;-)](forum_thread.php?id=45032) [Message 710506](forum_thread.php?id=45032&postid=710506)) Posted 10 n\u00c3\u00c2\u00a5ke Posted 10 Feb 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Sssh!

OK then, Christmas Day always comes the day after Christmas Eve, so it's not on the same day as Christmas Eve - the Eve's are on the same day, but the Day's are not, because they are on a different day. Ditto to for New Years Day/Eve. Do you understand that? They are on different days, the Day and Eve are not on the same day of the week. It answers your riddle. It might not be 'your' answer, but it answers the riddle. Ehh.. I really shouldnt laugh... but I have to! hehehehehe.. Ice.. this time you were deep frozen.. Lol! ;-) Ice was reading this to say that the Eves and the Days are not on the same day of the week, so that solves the riddle. His solution is grammatically correct. A good riddle should not be obvious, yet it should be clear. I purposely phrased it \"Christmas and New Year's Day are not\", leaving off the words \"on the same day of the week as eachother\", because that would have revealed too much. I also did not point out that we are talking about a calendar year, because that might have given it away. I like this riddle because it plays on how linear we can be in our thinking. My only problem with Ice's \"solution\" is that if that was the riddle, it was no riddle at all, because the eve before the day and the day itself can not be on the same day of the week. One had to read my statement in a way that made it true (factually and logically correct) in order for there to be a riddle. Yes, I can see two different days being on different days no riddle at all. I just see that Christmas Eve, every single year, as one of the most stressful in my year, as I desperately seek gifts that I have to have by the following day, having ignored the impending shopping chores as I always do, until literally the last minute. | 2346) Feb 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I want to add another comp to my boinc counting process but i dont know how. i cant find the project URL.

The sole duty of a drone, the male bee, is not to be a King, but to fly around up about a thousand feet looking for a virgin Queen bee on her maiden flight. His odds of finding one are pretty slim. If he is fortunate(?) to meet and mate in flight, the virgin Queen rips out his sexual apparatus (stores it inside her body for future use) and he falls to the ground and dies.

Guilty of WHAT crime? The courts have already overturned the defendent's sentence. Guilty of breach of contract. That would be Civil not Criminal anyway. The only contract was verbal between BMG and the USPS not individual workers. The Defendent did not \"dumpster dive\" while being on post office duty (he was on his own time). I didn't realize that being a postman was a 24 hour job. Using your logic the USPS not the defendent should have been in court. Its not about logic of a point of view. It's about the law and the intention of somebody who appears to be breaking the law. The intention that BMG had in asking USPS to deliver its goods and disposal of undeliverable goods would be part of any legal contract between BMG and USPS and it's employees would be bound by any arrangements made. There is a clear indication that sales from legitimate BMG sources suffered as a result of CDs retrieved from the trash which BMG did not authorize. Ownership of the CDs never passed to the defendant and he therefore sold them illegally. Criminal or Civil law, he is guilty. | 2357) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe 8 Feb 2008 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Thank you Richard.

I took my partner to America for her first (and only) visit just a few years ago. It was at this time of year, soon after Christmas Day. This is the view she had of the Grand Canyon.

I'd like to thank Beethoven and Ratava for helping me out with the judging here. There are many excellent photos and the standard has been amazingly high. It's been a pleasure working on this with my two colleagues and fantastic that we've been able to agree on the winners, although the margin between these and others is pretty small and our difficulty in separating them was high. Please remember that Ratava and myself were not allowed to vote for our own photos, although the other two judges were able to do so. Another awkward difficulty that Beethoven was particularly invaluable for. Remember, a judge may award a photo maximum marks, in a competition, 10 out 10. Yet the same photo in another competition with a different judge can get a low 7.5 out of 10. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2ve seen this happen. At the end of the day it\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s all for fun, judges are human and can only apply their consideration as fairly and best as they can.

They just snapped as if they weren't there. High tensile steel? really?..... One day previously I was riding to work at Heathrow (London Airport). The airport police stopped me and wanted to know why I was riding around the handcuffs on my bike. \"It's my bike lock\" I replied. \"You were doing more than 30mph\" he said. \"No I wasn't, you accelerated to catch up with me, how could you possible know the speed I was doing?\". I expect he was jealous that his plastic British cuffs didn't look as good as mine. | 2545) by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: ;-) Goodnight AriZ :-) Stop swinging and I'll give you a hug ;) doh.. thats why i`m swinging.. hehe.

Actually, you may not know what the rules of the road are. Some are pretty obscure. But even if you don't know a particular rule/law, you can be punished by the judge. Also, you may think what you have done is not a violation of a law or rule, but if the judge disagrees with you (meaning the Judge agrees with the Cop who gave you the ticket), you will still be fined. It's the judge who decides what the law says or the rule means, not the person who was ticketed. The same principles apply to posting here. If you don't know the rules, or if you think you are within the rule, you may still be moderated or even banned, no matter how much you believe you are right. You can always appeal to the modlist, and your position will be discussed (and sometimes the moderators will even agree with you--it has happened), but if the moderators find you to be wrong, your post will remain hidden and repeating such behaviour may result in a ban.

Thanks to all who took part. The SETI Sideshow and 2007 Gauntlet are finally over. Well done to all team members, of all teams. During the two weeks of this competition our team has amassed 757,930 credits for Team England and secured 500th place in the league table. In the Gauntlet that would have secured us 10th place out of 14 teams, not bad for our small group of lads and lasses. We can now look forward to slowly climbing up the ranks and take our place amongst the top teams. Don't forget to visit us on the Team England forum, you'll find us [here](http://england.forum5.com/index.php?mforum=england) This is the final graph for the Sideshow and a comparative Gauntlet graph showing where Team England would have finished amongst the lower half of the official Gauntlet teams. | 2738) Nov 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: No, it was gust of wind.

Is that just ignorance or the wish to bring that system back? None of the above. This thread is not about ignorance but about an interest in military and other \"Top Gun\" aircraft. You can try and censor all mention of the Nazi regime if you want, but that regime produced scientists and inventors who went on to America and elsewhere to make the West what it is today, military or otherwise. Perhaps the awful symbols of the past should remain to remind us not to go back there, but we can still stop and wonder at what can be created from war, and the amazing ideas for planes that some had. | 2841) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Last Person to Post Wins #{[(51]} or higher - How be Eeeh', me deer?

Northwest Arkansas USA That's interesting because I see this photo differently. Although Ice, you say that the field is sloping to the left the eye is drawn upwards to the left hand corner by the overhanging branch. This gives movement to the image and keeps the eye within the picture frame, that's what I like about it :) Your point is entirely correct Hev. I would go further in saying that the view from the woods as we look to the field makes it a particularly good composition. There is a lot about this picture that makes it interesting, and a lot of things that could be said about it, but probably nothing negative. Just maybe things that one or two people might suggest would improve it.

They can simply strap explosives to themselves, walk into a public area, usually filled with everyday random people who happen to be there at that time, and blow themselves up together with a number everyday people.

Is it possible that many people secretly sympathise with him? Not just in Britan, but around the world.

You mean since 1605 there are many people wanting to blow up the British Houses Of Parliament? Because they follow a certain religion? Yes, I'm sure there are, but none of them remotely sympathizing with Guy Fawkes of 1605 I expect. By then he had changed his name to Guido, the Spanish form of Guy. Catholic Spain and England were at war between 1585 and 1604. I expect if the Spanish couldn't defeat King James I, then Guy thought he could by blowing up Westminster and any other innocent people who were there on the day of the State Opening of Parliament. I meant, more like in recent times. Adopting his ways of attaining desired ends. Perhaps because of certain... fears about the world today. I find it interesting that so many people sympathize with the character in the movie, even though the real Fawkes is the ispiration. I could be wrong about the inspiration. Just read some interesting comments about just that [here](http://www.shadowgalaxy.net/Vendetta/fawkes.html). The bottom part. I see what you mean now. \"Is it possible that many people secretly sympathise with him?\" Yes, absolutely.

But who knows till you try it. I'm interested in close up photography, or at least trying some, but I don't really know what macro photography is all about. Do I get lens extenders, or macro lenses? Or get an adapter to reverse my lens? And what about multipliers to increase the zoom on my zoom? So many questions... Ice, I spoke with an expert on the subject and he said that multipliers decrease the quality of the image. He said that if you wanted good quality it is best to buy a higher power lens. That's very true, but given the quality of lens these days and around 10 MegaPixels of censor using other methods than buying expensive macro lenses can work.

You have \"free\" health care. And there is no connection whatsoever between massive taxation and brutally expensive housing. Or is there? The high cost of housing in the UK is caused mainly by the following factors: 1) The market (ie demand outstrips supply) 2) Lenders lending people more money than they can really afford to borrow,thus driving up house prices. 3) The selling off of subsidised council housing in the 80s and 90s.

No need to shout Rush. You know full well the I am using Russian's derogatory term of \"The Ukraine\" to suggest, as a contribution to this thread, that \"The Earth\" may be a derogatory term since \"Earth\" will suffice and prefixing \"The\" to Ukraine was Russia's way of seeing Ukraine as a province in the CCCP/USSR it once had, and still uses the term to demean. Whether anyone is using \"The\" to prefix Earth to demean it I don't know. But I do know that Russian wish to demean Ukraine, and by calling it \"The Ukraine\" they do just that. that's a really good point - I've never thought of that... back in college, I had a good buddy from Ukraine - and he'd aggressively correct those who dared (accidentally or otherwise) refer to his nation as \"The Ukraine\" - for he took it as a huge insult.

That seems really odd to me. No Rush, the Russians speak Russian, which is a Slavic based language, as is Ukrainian, but the languages are not the same. The Russians put a Russian word in front of the Russian word for \"Ukraine\". So they use two Russian words, which translated into any other language, including Ukrainian and English, say \"The Ukraine\". That's how languages work Rush. The world does not use English simply because we, or you, use the English translated versions of their words. They use their own words and we choose to translate them into English and use the English version. It's decidedly odd that you should think that all Russian words originate in English. Especially since the Slavic and English languages and alphabets are completely different. | 3145) Oct 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: There's no need to try to be so clever. \"The Americas\" is correct whilst \"The America\" is not correct.

I have no idea, but you really aren't fixing the hash of Ukraine with a deep and incisive burn such as, oh, putting the article \"the\" in front of the country name. I would suggest that very very few people have any idea about that. Native English speakers, as a rule, would use the terms interchangeably without giving it a second thought. And it's just as likely that non-native English speakers are skrewing up their use of the article, thus giving rise to the different usages. It's not your fault Rush, you just don't know much about The world, particularly how Russia demeans it's neighbours and uses arguments much like yours to put \"The\" Ukraine in it's place, which is just where it would like to put \"The\" America I expect. | 3146) by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Pfffft.

That you happen to have decided that it is demeaning, well, have at it. There's no need to try to be so clever. \"The Americas\" is correct whilst \"The America\" is not correct.

Why \"The Ukraine\"? Why do Russians call it \"The Ukraine\" when it is in fact \"Ukraine\". Why don't the Russians say The USA, or The England or The South Africa? It's because 'the river' is part of something, 'the sun' is in the sky. The Ukraine is a province of Russia (so they arrogantly want to continue to think of it as). So that is my explanation - Earth is demeaned by being referred to as part of something (the solar system?) rather than being acknowledged in it's own right (as other planets). | 3149) |[Message Oct by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Thanks for your interesting proposition Astro.

England's dismal form earlier in the tournament saw them written off as realistic contenders, but they resurrected their challenge in spectacular fashion as they beat Samoa and Tonga in the group stages before overcoming Australia and France to reach the final. \"I don't think anyone outside the squad gave them a cat in hell's chance of doing anything at all, but they were right in the game until the final whistle,\" added Ashton. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who attended the match at the Stade de France in Paris, said: \"England's performance at this World Cup, and in the final against South Africa, was an inspiration to millions in our country. \"Their victories against France and Australia will live long in our memory, and the country is extremely proud of their extraordinary achievements over the past few weeks.\" | 3167) |[Message 21 Oct 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: This was professional rugby for a professional era, a production high on practice and proficiency.

England (3) 6 Pens: Wilkinson 2 South Africa (9) 15 Pens: Montgomery 4, Steyn Three Percy Montgomery penalties to one from Jonny Wilkinson saw South Africa, who had hammered England in the group stages, lead 9-3 at the break in Paris. England went desperately close to a try through Mark Cueto soon after half-time before a penalty apiece made it 12-6. Francois Steyn extended the lead with a long-range penalty and South Africa held out to match their 1995 triumph. It had been a remarkable run to the final for England, who went into the tournament woefully short of form. They were humiliated in the group game against the Boks just over five weeks ago and although they finally found some form to reach the final, it was a bridge too far against a superior South Africa side. The Springboks ruled the line-out through Victor Matfield, Bakkies Botha and Juan Smith, stealing seven of England's throws, and their defence was all but impeccable throughout the 80 minutes. After Wilkinson kicked off England enjoyed the early territorial advantage but they could not make it count as they struggled to win their own throw at the line-out. South Africa's line-out operation had been praised to the skies going into the match and they made their mark immediately, stealing England's first two throws and preventing the champions from building an early head of steam. When England did manage to win a line-out it was deep in their own half and led to them conceding the lead after Mathew Tait slipped as he tried to run from inside his own 22. Montgomery, the tournament's leading points scorer, knocked over the easy kick to get the scoreboard ticking over. England hit back after 13 minutes when South Africa failed to gather a hanging kick. Massive second row Simon Shaw secured possession and although Bryan Habana halted a sweeping England attack with a thumping tackle on Paul Sackey, South Africa infringed at the ruck. The penalty was wide out on the right but Wilkinson guided it between the posts to level the scores. Both sides were not afraid to use the boot to try and get field position and when Butch James kicked ahead and chased, Lewis Moody, who has struggled at times with his discipline, could not resist tripping the South Africa fly-half. Montgomery bisected the uprights to edge the Boks back into the lead. England upped their game and the forwards battered away to create a platform for Wilkinson to drop at goal, but his effort drifted wide. The champions enjoyed a good spell in the middle of the half but as the break approached South Africa started to assume the upper hand. They could have extended their lead through a penalty from Steyn, but his long-range effort drifted wide. The inside centre is only 20 but he did not let it affect his confidence and with five minutes to go to the break he stepped past Mike Catt and beat Wilkinson and Phil Vickery to take the Boks deep into England territory. The champions managed to halt Springbok captain John Smit a yard from the line but the Boks kept the pressure on and when England desperately infringed Montgomery stepped up to make it 9-3 at the break. It looked as though South Africa were set to pull away but two minutes after the re-start Tait picked up a bouncing pass from scrum-half Andy Gomarsall in midfield. The Newcastle man stepped past the on-rushing South Africa midfield and raced deep into South Africa territory before being halted just short of the line. Gomarsall fed the ball wide and Cueto dived over in the corner, but the television match official correctly ruled he had just put a foot in touch as Danie Rossouw got across to make the tackle. Referee Alain Rolland had been playing advantage and Wilkinson, via the woodwork, brought the gap back to three points from the resulting penalty. A fourth Montgomery penalty took South Africa back into a six-point lead and England's chances suffered a blow as veteran full-back Jason Robinson was forced off injured. As the half progressed England, boosted by a host of replacements, looked like they might gain the upper hand but they fell further behind when they were penalised for obstruction as Cueto ran the ball out of defence. Steyn drilled the ball between the posts from long range and suddenly South Africa led by more than a converted try. England were never going to give up the fight and they attacked with increasing abandon, but their inability to control their own ball at the line-out and the breakdown ultimately cost them dear.

I told you that we would loose if Gordon Brown went to the match!!!! You were absolutely right Di Atribe. But of course politicians spin it all out... [Politicians praise beaten England](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7054836.stm) The leaders of the UK's three main political parties have paid tribute to England's efforts after their rugby union World Cup final defeat. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who attended the match in Paris, said the team were an \"inspiration to millions\". Conservative leader David Cameron praised their performance as \"brave, dogged, determined and fearless\". Lib Dem acting leader Vince Cable said the team, beaten 15-6 by South Africa, had done \"fantastically well\". England, the defending champions, were generally considered to be rank outsiders at the start of the tournament because of their poor form in recent months. And when they lost 36-0 to South Africa in the pool stages, their chances of going far in the tournament looked even more remote. But England defied the odds to reach Saturday's final with knock-out victories over Australia and hosts France. The prime minister, who is a keen rugby fan, congratulated England's and South Africa's players on the pitch after the final whistle. Mr Brown said: \"England's performance at this World Cup, and in the final against South Africa, was an inspiration to millions in our country. \"Their victories against France and Australia will live long in our memory and the country is extremely proud of their extraordinary achievements over the past few weeks.\" Culture, Media and Sport Secretary James Purnell, who also attended the match, said: \"England did us proud tonight, but sometimes guts, heart and spirit are not quite enough. \"England have had a rollercoaster campaign and we can all be really proud of them.\" The final was watched by millions of rugby fans across the country, with many of them left dejected following England's defeat. About 9,000 fans gathered at the O2 Centre, in south London, to watch the game on a big screen. Peter Hargreaves, 52 and an England fan from Greenwich, south London, said: \"I'll be fair and say that I think the best team won. We never looked like scoring a try.\" UK-based South African fan, Eloise Turnbull, 21, said South Africa had been \"the best team in the final by far\". \"I only wish I was back in South Africa to celebrate with my family,\" she said. Meanwhile, in Paris, police said an estimated 18,000 people, many of them England fans sporting their colours, had gathered beneath the illuminated Eiffel Tower to watch the match on giant screens. And despite defeat, they largely remained in good spirits afterwards. Paris police press officer Olivier Deflon said: \"There have been no problems and no arrests during or immediately after the match. \"Everyone was in good spirits and we are pleased they behaved.\" | 3189) |[Message 20 Oct 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: This team won the Rugby World Cup 2007 | 3190) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 20 Oct 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Both team filed out past the cup before the match started | 3191) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Oct 20 Oct 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Gordon Brown and Thabo Mbeki congratulating the South African skipper, J Smit | 3193) |[Message 20 Oct 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) The South Africans look pleased | 3199) 20 Oct 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Bringing out the Cup | 3200) |[Message 20 Oct 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: THis is the man who didn't (APPARENTLY) score a try for England which might have won the game for England... | 3201) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 20 Oct 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: It's all over with a close win by the Springboks ;) It'a a fair result I think | 3202) Oct 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Think the Boks have it.... ...barring divine intervention...I think you're correct.

The sin-bin is the bench where all players who have committed a yellow card offence sit out of the game for 10 minutes. If the referee believes a player has committed a serious foul or shown indiscipline, then he will show them the yellow card, just like in football. But unlike in football, that player must then immediately leave the pitch. (Sounds familiar?) They then have to sit in the sin-bin for 10 minutes while the game continues without them.

Actions are better. You cannot 'act' on a forum. You can only post.

Sometimes the best thing to do is not 'act' at all. If you can't say something nice, don't post. That would be better. That is true, but I think Chuck was trying to say something. I didn't see it as criticism, but just pointing out that things don't change by just hoping they will change. Change requires movement.

Why do you have to leap in and try to make a fight of everything? Freedom to post and happiness has just dive bombed! I think perhaps you are the one who lept to the wrong conclusion, Ice. Chuck was just explaining himself so that his meaning was not misunderstood. You made the decision that it 'implied' something else. This is how good conversations go bad. Freedom to post and happiness lives. But you have to believe in it yourself and not jump to the conclusion that everything someone else posts is sinister in nature. Does that make sense? A positive attitude goes a long way. My comment was aimed at Qui-Gon. Chuck made a comment, I replied building on what Chuck said. For a moderator then to join in with a \"I don't see it as criticism' implies that either Chuck or I did. There was no need for Qui-Gon to accuse anyone indirectly of criticism by saying \"I don't see it as criticism'. It was unnecessary and the usual sort of fighting statements that some, moderators and others, just should just stop with. | 3308) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) the forums......](forum_thread.php?id=43013) [Message 660793](forum_thread.php?id=43013&postid=660793)) Posted 17 Oct 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Hope is good.

It's seems late for autumn here and it's still very mild weather - hardly the cold, wet foggy mornings you would expect at this time of year.

I laughed and said I didn't know how to use it and was trying it out to see how it worked. I then felt like a photographer when I explained how the extension tubes worked. How they had no glass in them, were hollow tubes, and it was the moving away of the lens from the sensor in the camera (where it records the image) that made it magnify more. I suppose it's a bit like a magnifying glass. If you move it away from your eye, things get bigger - the magnifying effect increases. | 3459) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe a runner!](forum_thread.php?id=42839) [Message 656236](forum_thread.php?id=42839&postid=656236)) Posted 8 Oct 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: .....besides ICe, David Bailey, Late for dinner we know its you and you really care About SETI!

[Stuck in customs](http://stuckincustoms.com/) Andy These certainly are striking photos, and something I'd certainly like to emulate. Here is what it says about how these photos were achieved; Stuck In Customs is regularly updated by photographer Trey Ratcliffe. Trey uses special techniques to create these striking images. It is hard to put your finger on what makes these photos feel so realistic yet so unreal at the same time. I discovered the answer in one of Trey's blog entries. It links to a detailed tutorial he has written on something called High Dynamic Range photography or HDR. HDR is a software technique where you adjust the contrast ratios on the photographs. When you do this, you can see a great range of intensities between light and dark areas. HDR photos show the world looking less like a camera sees it and more as our eyes perceive it. The only drawback to HDR is that Trey believes you need to show the pictures very large to get the full effect, so his blog can be a bit slow to scroll through. I also think that some photos are shown at their best when shown very large, hence my reason for starting the [for larger photos](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/forum_thread.php?id=42281) thread.

But, except for one roll taken in 2004 because of the Venus transit, I haven't taken any photos since 1996, when my ladyfriend died. There's nothing around here that's worth photographing, except every ten years or so. If I find another lady or girl I'll use the film camera or possibly buy a digital. Until then, I'm not wasting money. I would take a few photos on holiday, and then nothing until the next holiday. Saying the same as you Clyde, that there's nothing worth photographing. But the truth is that there is tons and tons of stuff worth photographing - it just depend if you're interested, or have the vision to make the photos (like wedding photographers have to) or it's your profession to find good photo opportunities. I positively refuse to take a camera to family gatherings because I just have no interest in asking people to squeeze in a bit. When I'm interested, it's great. But when it is a chore I just don't want to know. I've said with my new SLR I will not do photos of gardens or people. So what happens? I fall out with my sister because she says she forgot her camera and wants me to take a photo of my garden. I say no. My partner wants me to do some glamor shots, and I haven't said no yet. But, no gardens, no people. Or the camera goes in the trash. This is my hobby not a convenience for others.

Maybe in time I'll splash out on a real macro lens (they are so expensive), but for now I'd like to try out the much less expensive options, macro tubes, macro lens converters, or an adapter to reverse my lens. I'm thinking of trying the macro tubes and see how I get on with them. This is what a seller on Ebay says about them; On most lenses, the manufacturers provide a focusing mechanism that extends only a few millimeters, partly to keep down costs and partly to restrict the lens to extensions for which its optics are optimized. To provide additional extension, one or more extension tubes can be added between the camera and the lens, to make the lens focus at closer distances and therefore produce higher magnification.

Historically, the Northwest Passage linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans has been ice-bound through the year. But the agency says ice cover has been steadily shrinking, and this summer's reduction has made the route navigable. The findings, based on satellite images, raised concerns about the speed of global warming. 'Extreme' The Northwest Passage is one of the most fabled sea routes in the world - a short cut from Europe to Asia through the Canadian Arctic. Recent years have seen a marked shrinkage in its ice cover, but this year it was extreme, Esa says. It says this made the passage \"fully navigable\" for the first time since monitoring began in 1978. \"We have seen the ice-covered area drop to just around 3m sq km (1.2m sq miles),\" Leif Toudal Pedersen of the Danish National Space Centre said. He said it was \"about 1m sq km (386,000 sq miles) less than the previous minima of 2005 and 2006\". \"There has been a reduction of the ice cover over the last 10 years of about 100, 000 sq km (38,600 sq miles) per year on average, so a drop of 1m sq km (386,000 sq miles) in just one year is extreme,\" Mr Pedersen said. The Northeast Passage through the Russian Arctic has also seen its ice cover shrink and it currently \"remains only partially blocked,\" Esa says. 'Battle for Arctic' Scientists have linked the changes to global warming which may be progressing faster than expected. The opening of the sea routes is already leading to international disputes. Canada says it has full rights over those parts of the Northwest Passage that pass through its territory and that it can bar transit there. But this has been disputed by the US and the European Union. They argue that the new route should be an international strait that any vessel can use. | 3874) 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Higher temperatures are bringing some benefits to the sub-Arctic south part of Greenland.

I understand the game of English football, but there are things around here I just don't understand. Football, or soccer as it's known in the USA, is a game played for fun as players interact. Three people don't take part in the actual play of the game - the referee and the two linesmen. They are there to make sure the game is played to rules, not set by them, but by the rules set down by the governing body, and don't make up any more rules of their own.

The co-pilot was on a training flight with a training captain sitting in the jump seat, an extra seat that folded out behind the captain and co-pilot. The training captain was being particularly hard on the co-pilot, so the captain decided to play a trick on him. When the the training captain disappeared off to the toilet, the captain got a stewardess to bring some cheese and hid a magnet inside it, and asked her to bring it when she brought them food. Which she later did. \"Oh, no\" said the captain, \"We can't have that cheese it here. I'll affect my readings\". The training captain turned away from tormenting the co-pilot and asked why. The pilot took the cheese and moved it to the dashboard compass (this was a long time ago on an older plane). Sure enough the cheese affected the dials. So the training captain spent the rest of the flight pushing the cheese at the dials trying to figure out why and left the co-pilot alone. | 3957) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Team Posted 29 Aug 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Welcome Jennifer, and thanks you for joining [Team England SETI](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/team_display.php?teamid=131912).

The current monarchy families will sit tight and defy the science and female links via the mitochondrial DNA. One claim would be based on the male line being the only one to inherit. That would complicate the mitochondrial work. This makes this a good thread to speculate in. But, no one would spend the money to follow the rightful lineage, unless they already have a strong claim based on historical evidence.

One is that Queen Elizabeth I knew that Edward IV was illegitimate, and purposefully hid the fact from the Hastings family of the time, who should have been sitting on the throne instead of her. The Hastings family continued to be very supportive of the monarchy, and even fought for King Charles I in the Civil War, but obviously unaware that they should have been ruling England. | 3969) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Aug 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Eeeek!

China has a serious population problem. That's not good. Somebody once remarked that one way to solve a population problem is to start a war, I don't think we want that solution. China's system may not be the best, but they are attempting to address a real problem that they have. Back in the 70's a group of scientists were concerned about world population, particularly in Africa where they couldn't feed themselves. Aides then appeared and the population problem in Africa (so they said) was no more.

I was watching my pond fish today, as I do most days, and can tell that a heron or a cat has been nearby, since they shy away near the bottom of the pond. Normally they are swimming up to me looking for food. But I doubt whether they complain about their world much. They get fed every day, their water is kept in good condition, filtered an circulated as best as any pond shop can recommend. If there are predators like a heron, they have a deep bit and pillar to hide behind, and water lily leaves to hide under, and should use a bit of common sense to hide until the heron or cat gets fed up and leaves.

Amen to that. I wasn't really thinking of the 30 \"group\" when I posted here last, although I use 30 and the double meaning of the 30 \"group\" as a pun, and am warmed by the publicity the 30 have been getting of late ;) However, it must be said that the 30 are not a \"group\" as such, but merely like minded individuals who have come together to talk. Hence no leaders, no agenda, no rules, no weekly subs to pay - it's just an informal gathering who can say what they like without kids or controlling adults around. As such, loyalties outside this 30 \"group\" were there first and probably still take precedence. I carefully put the word \"group\" in quotes because the 30 isn't a team or like any other group in BOINC boards. We are unique. We are not 3, we are not 300.

The war games were staged under the flag of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a regional grouping that includes Russia, China and four Central Asian states. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who watched the war games with Chinese President Hu Jintao, dismissed comparisons with the western North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). \"Today's exercises are another step towards strengthening the relations between our countries, a step towards strengthening international peace and security, and first and foremost, the security of our peoples,\" Putin said. Fighter jets swooped overhead, commandos jumped from helicopters on to rooftops and the boom of artillery shells shook the firing range in Russia's Ural mountains as two of the largest armies in the world were put through their paces. The exercises take place against a backdrop of mounting rivalry between the West, and Russia and China for influence over Central Asia, a strategic region that has huge oil, gas and mineral resources. Russia's growing assertiveness is also causing jitters in the West. Putin announced at the firing range that Russia was resuming Soviet-era sorties by its strategic bomber aircraft near NATO airspace. ANTI-INSURGENCY OPERATION Commanders said the aim of the exercises -- involving 7,500 troops from SCO member states -- was to practice joint operations for putting down a militant uprising. Moscow has been fighting a separatist insurgency in its southern Chechnya region while China says it is fighting Uighur Muslim rebels in its westerly province. \"I am convinced that the current exercise will definitely serve to stimulate the SCO to play a bigger role in the struggle against terrorism in the region,\" Hu said. Asked by a reporter if the SCO was turning into a counter-balance to NATO, Putin said: \"That is not the case.\" \"The military aspect is not dominant and not the main thing ... The SCO is an organization that deals with questions of a political character and an economic character ... and the economic aspects are at the forefront,\" he said. Marcel de Haas, an expert on security in ex-Soviet countries, said the war games, and the presence of SCO heads of state, was \"another indication that they are slowly but surely working towards being a mutual security organization\". \"We cannot neglect them. We have to pay attention.\" But the senior research fellow at the Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael said the SCO was unlikely to turn into an anti-Western club. \"Russia wants to use the SCO for its anti-Western (aims) but the others will not allow it.\" Building the alliance may be hindered by the ambiguous relations between Russia and China. Moscow wants to supply energy to China's booming economy and sell its weapons to its military, but is also wary of Beijing's growing economic and military might. \u00c3\u00c2\u00a9 Reuters 2007.

There was no word on whether there was any sign of life in the mines or when rescuers might enter them. Two high-speed pumps reportedly were being rushed in to drain the flooded shafts. A dike on the Wen river in Shandong province broke Friday afternoon, sending water gushing into a mine run by the Huayuan Mining Co. in the city of Xintai and trapping 172 miners, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Work areas were submerged and the miners \"had only slim chances of survival,\" Xinhua said, citing Wang Ziqi, director of Shandong's coal mine safety agency. There was no indication whether rescuers had any sign the miners were alive. Friday night, nine more miners were trapped when floodwaters poured into Xintai's Minggong Coal Mine, Xinhua and China National Radio reported. A mine employee reached by phone said the water came from a small river nearby, not the Wen dike break. He would give only his surname, Pan, and said he had no details on the status of rescue efforts. An employee who answered the phone at the national mine safety agency said he had no additional information and refused to give his name. Calls to the Shandong mine agency were not answered. Rains that swept through on Friday and Saturday dumped more than nine inches of rain on the area, Xinhua said. In the Huayuan mine, a total of 756 miners were working at the time of the disaster and 584 escaped, Xinhua said. On Saturday, about 2,000 soldiers, police and miners were trying to close the 175-foot-wide gap in the dike on the Wen, the agency reported. It said water was more than six-feet deep at the breech. The directors of China's industrial safety and coal mine safety agencies rushed to Xintai from Beijing to oversee rescue work, the report said. The disasters came as rescuers in Utah suspended the search for six coal miners trapped since Aug. 6 by a cave-in. Authorities announced the suspension Friday following a tunnel collapse that killed three rescue workers. China's coal mines are the world's deadliest, with thousands of fatalities each year in fires, floods and other disasters. Many are blamed on managers who disregard safety rules, fail to install required fire-control equipment or push miners to dig far more coal than the mine's license allows. The government has promised for years to improve mine safety. Authorities offer rewards to whistle-blowers who expose problems, prosecute officials who collude with unscrupulous mine bosses, and have ordered thousands of small pits closed. But China depends on coal for most of its electric power, and the country's economic boom has created voracious demand. Production has more than doubled since 2000. China's deadliest reported coal mine disaster since the 1949 communist revolution was an explosion that killed 214 miners on Feb. 14, 2005, in the Sunjiawan mine in Liaoning province. | by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: [All news must be good news, says Chinese government](http://www.guardian.co.uk/china/story/0,,2151227,00.html?gusrc=rss&feed=networkfront) Jonathan Watts, The Guardian, in Beijing, Saturday August 18, 2007 China has ordered its media to report only positive news and has imprisoned a pro-democracy dissident amid a clampdown on dissent ahead of the most important meeting of the communist party in five years. Media controls have been tightened, Aids activists detained and NGOs shut down as president Hu Jintao prepares for the 17th party congress, when the next generation of national leaders will be unveiled in a politburo reshuffle. Chen Shuqing, who is a founder member of the banned China Democracy party, suffered the toughest punishment meted out so far when he was found guilty on Thursday of \"inciting people to overthrow the government\". The intermediate people's court in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, sentenced him to four years in prison. Chen was an outspoken critic of the Communist party, although because of the tightly controlled traditional media his campaigning in recent years was largely restricted to the internet. The free-speech group Reporters Without Borders said it was appalled by the verdict. \"Courts taking their orders from the Communist party continue to crack down on cyber-dissidents,\" the Paris-based organisation said. \"We reiterate our appeal for the release of Chen and the 50 other cyber-dissidents and internet users held in China.\" With the congress nearing - the exact date is a secret, but it is expected in October - the domestic media have been banned from conducting independent investigations of food and product safety stories. In Beijing the municipal propaganda department has issued detailed instructions to editors on how they should cover the test of traffic-easing measures, which started today. During the four-day trial more than 1m cars have been ordered off the roads. Local newspapers and TV stations can only report on the improvements to the environment and transportation. Interviews with inconvenienced commuters or images of overcrowded buses are forbidden. Most state media have also been banned from reporting on the collapse of a bridge in southern China which killed at least 41 people. Reporters said local officials punched them and chased them from the scene of Monday's disaster. On Wednesday the government issued new regulations that prohibit false news and illegal TV coverage. This is ostensibly a response to a fabricated report last month about cardboard being used as a filling for steamed buns. Zi Beijia, the TV journalist held responsible for the fake story, has been jailed for a year. \"This crackdown is a legal gun to the head to responsible journalists who want to report on the basis of facts,\" said Sophie Richardson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch | 4133) |[Message Aug 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Vista over the Grand Canyon in December, 2003 | 4134) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Posted Aug [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Okay, here ya go: Honest mummy.

I don't know for a fact that this would translate for fine digital cameras like the Nikon D40X & Canon 400D. If anyone that actually knows instead of spouting off like me, please respond. You should possibly in all due respect explore the use of filters for pics like this. I love the content, but am throughly mystified by the clouds. In fact a clear filter (not actually clear, but a slight yellow) will not only enhance all pictures, but will also protect your lens. Scratches & even repeated cleaning will take their toll on a lens. A clear filter will cover & protect your lens so that most of the time, all you have to clean is the cheap filter (in comparison to the cost of a lens) To get back to the use of filters. I had a Canon AE1 & Canon FTb. I loved filters. Through the use of filters you can enhance the sky, & enhance the clouds, yet not change the foreground itself. There's so much more to photography than just recording what is there. Filters will bring more into a picture than is actually there. And you'll say Photoshop..... Photoshop couldn't come close to touching what filters do. Dune, what you just said is all I know about filters now, so I'll be interested in any advice you get. I've just put my photos up on picasaweb [http://picasaweb.google.com/brilliantphotos](http://picasaweb.google.com/brilliantphotos) to see if this a quicker/easier way to publish my photos. Definitely quicker and easier, but maybe not better since picasaweb doesn't allow for a full screen slide show and cuts down all my bigger photos. But a useful way to publish photos for free. Just get a gmail account a go to the photos/picasa options and you get 1 GB free on-line storage. | 4177) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Team Recruitment Posted 14 Aug 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Congratulations Team England on getting their first 1 million in SETI | 4178) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe & RECONSTRUCTION](forum_thread.php?id=41426) 618999](forum_thread.php?id=41426&postid=618999)) Posted 14 Aug 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Winning!

The credit is calculated higher on ver 2.2b. You should only update as soon as possible that no discuession about cheating comes around. Because user of chicken soup get more results finnished a day you even get more credits. Thats all. That's right Mike. Cheating is not appropriate or comes into this at all. If you use a KWSN optimizers which turns around your WUs faster and you get more credits faster - that is not cheating. You computer is doing the work and earning the credits. But does everyone else in SETI use the Chicken optimizer? Does everyone know about it and wonder why others are accumulating credits faster? Are people coming here from other projects just to get credits faster, irrespective of what the SETI project is all about? Is it fair that your computer can earn xx% more than an identical computer crunching at say, climatepreditction.net? All is fair in love and war. If you want to use optimizers to work more efficiently on SETI, then that is fair enough.

Probably because they have better broadband speeds, and can do more than Europe (especially the UK). Second, for ICE! Take care with Sky and ISP. Their customer service/customer care is regarded as appalling, even for the industry and on a par with Talk Talk free broadband (within their package). Moreover, cable, when properly done, is reputed to have better future proofing the BB speeds. In the future, with HD TV, etc, you will be downloading films and watching them in real time. BB speeds need to be around 10Mbps and above for this to happen. Cable is likely to be the best option ATM. Those are two very good points and are part of the real reason why I'm holding before changing. Chris's point is also valid because I live too far from the BT exchange and would only at best ever get a 2MB connection, whilst with cable the sky is the limit (excuse pun with Sky). I'm used to 2MB but would certainly go higher if I knew I would use the bandwidth.

Chill, my man, you needn't transform everything that is posted into an affront on your honor. Take it in stride, let it pass, with a grain of salt, over the shoulder and all. You ask me to \"give it a rest\" which means \"stop posting\". Then you ask me not to take this as an affront? I suggest you stop trying to tell people to stop posting here.

Milk goes in the tea! If you do it the other way round then the hot tea straight from the pot can curdle the milk. Professional tea drinkers drink tea neat without milk anyway. I did work for 3 years for the Lipton tea company so I ought to know..... Is that the company which sells something which supposed to be tea in those little TEA BAGS, or even as an instant powder? Oh no! These ignorants! Tea must be loose, and there is a real ceremony in tea making. The only convenience I accept is a tea strainer - but no tea egg or even tea bags. Pardon me, but tea in powder form, which includes milk, is very nice. We always take TyPhoo QT with us when we're camping, and I always have a jar at work for when the milk runs out but the person whose turn it is to fetch the milk, doesn't. | Aug 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I don't know anything about Canada except that I was the only one at the controls of 747 when it passed over the La Paz, Canada waypoint on it's way from LHR to LAX.

[http://setiathome.berkeley.edu//forum_thread.php?id=41175](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu//forum_thread.php?id=41175) He's trying to chase me off his thread, for some reason. After a long discussion of ice cream, the thread took a brief turn to a legal topic. I chimed in with a pun on tort/torte, and Ice comes on to me heavy, accusing me of being off-topic...when the pair of legal posts themselves, are off-topic. Any thoughts? PM me when you get a chance. Oh come on Beethoven. You chastised me for talking about tort when you though the subject was contract, even thought I mentioned I studied both contract and tort before talking about the most famous of all tort cases - the snail in the ginger beer bottle. The point is you had to be clever and put me down for not talking contact when you carelessly failed to spot \"tort\" discussion going on. The point is you chastised.

Consideration under English law is anything of value (an item or service), which each party to a legally-binding contract must agree to exchange if the contract is to be valid. If only one party offers consideration then the agreement is not a contract. Consideration in its traditional form in English law usually is expressed as the requirement that for parties to be able to enforce a promise, they must have given some quid pro quo for it: something must be given or promised in exchange or return for the promise. At English law, a contract must be \"met with\" or \"supported by\" consideration to be enforceable; also, only a person who has provided consideration can enforce a contract. In other words, if a contract contains promises (called \"gratuitous promises\") that are unsupported by consideration, then the contract is void ab initio. Students new to the study of contract law sometimes find the doctrine of consideration baffling. Ice promises to let you stay if you behave, but in exchange he has a wide choice of ice's creams ... including American, Italian and many many others Italian is a specialty right now. Although I must say, having studied contract and tort at university (Llb) level, I'm impressed with the summation of consideration Di Atribe. What about if a snail is found in my ice cream though? Is liability that of the the moderators for not removing it prior to a pregnant woman seeing it and suffer miscarriage? Or that of the Administrators who are responsible for said moderators? Or is Dr. Anderson himself responsible for any snail that might inadvertently find itself here and cause distress and ultimately claim on liability? It's a tricky one eh? The law usually is. These are not questions of Contract, these are questions of Torte: as in, \"Let them eat Torte!\" Yes Beets. I did say \"Although I must say, having studied contract and tort at university (Llb) level\". Maybe you should read before deciding what the question is (which you don't, since I did).

Thee haughty tyrants ne'er shall tame, All their attempts to bend thee down Will but arouse thy generous flame; But work their woe, and thy renown. Rule, Britannia!

Thousands of homes have lost their water and electricity supplies as the flooding crisis continues in central and western England. In Gloucestershire the number of people to have lost water supplies is expected to reach 420,000, as the Severn and Thames rivers threaten to overflow. Water levels on both have exceeded those of devastating floods in 1947. In some areas the rivers are expected to peak over the next 2 days. The RAF said it is carrying out its biggest ever peacetime operation, with six Sea King helicopters rescuing up to 120 people. At their height, some rivers will be more than 20ft higher than normal. The Environment Agency has issued eight severe flood warnings and says the situation is \"critical\". Some 40,000 homes have also lost power and England's two biggest rivers, the Severn and the Thames, are threatening to overflow. | [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: [Happy Mondays](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xKaq-SNeEc) I've got Monday on my mind.

Why would they care about this minor comment, when they rarely do anything at all about the hundreds of thousands of explicit threats that are \"placed on the internet\" every day? Ride on, Don Quixotes, ride on. Well, it depends on whether you are aware of the full content or the email containing the \"minor content\" that you reference. Maybe you, the FBI or Dr. Anderson might not be interested, but the threat written is very explicit, and copies are being made available to certain parties, and maybe even to the California press next. Who knows, perhaps even Arnie might be horrified at what is happening in Berkeley. Perhaps he needs the publicity, since Posh and Becks are there to soak it all in. I wonder if they are getting the same hate mail right now? Let's just make light of this and laugh about it shall we?

I have, and I it is impressive (I was at about 100 feet above the river bed at the time and headed up hill. A flash flood in the UK is where driving through a large puddle of water can get half way up a car tyre.

Well said Mystique, some good observations, including this one I have quoted. Many months ago, around November of last year, I can't remember exactly when - just before [Cafe@Home](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/forum_thread.php?id=35564&nowrap=true#460074) was created, Eric Korpela made a clear statement that he was prepared to close the Cafe, if behavior did not improve. Shortly after I formed my own opinion that this is what he intended, no matter what. His ear was bent by Berkeley to get it sorted, he couldn't - didn't have the skills - so he took on moderators that would take the cafe down (automods - any old person would do). No one could blame him because the moderators, with their fat heads expanding with the status of being a SETI moderator, would cause resentment and unrest, leading to the Cafe being deleted. Or 'safely removed' as you nicely put it Mystique.

Written by the New Economics Foundation (Nef), it says that reducing social inequality and energy consumption are key drivers of improved wellbeing. Iceland has the highest ratio of wellbeing to emissions, with the UK 21st out of 30 countries assessed. A Nef report last year rated Vanuatu as the happiest nation on Earth. The ratings are based on its Happy Planet Index (HPI). Countries score points for how happy citizens rate themselves to be and how long they live, and lose points for their per-capita carbon output. \"Countries like Iceland... demonstrate that living within our environmental means doesn't mean sacrificing human wellbeing,\" said Nic Marks, founder of Nef's Centre for Wellbeing. \"By learning from the differences between European countries and copying best practices, we believe it will be possible to both greatly reduce our carbon footprint and increase our wellbeing.\" Consuming trend The European countries with the lowest per-capita carbon footprint are either those which generate substantial amounts of energy from renewables, such as Iceland and Sweden, or former members of the Soviet bloc whose economies are still rebuilding, such as Latvia and Romania. Across the continent, our per-capita carbon footprint has risen by 70% since 1961, Nef calculates, while life expectancy has increased by about 8% and self-reported happiness hardly at all. Scandinavians, Icelanders and the Swiss are the happiest people in Europe, while the unhappiest seven are all former Soviet-bloc states. Britain has the fourth highest per-capita carbon output on the continent, while scoring on the middle tiers for wellbeing and longevity. A recent BBC survey showed that Britons were happier in the 1950s than we are today, despite a threefold increase in wealth. \"Countries that have most closely followed the Anglo-Saxon, strongly market-led economic model show up as the least efficient,\" commented Nef's policy director, Andrew Simms. \"These findings question what the economy is there for. What is the point if we burn vast quantities of fossil fuels to make, buy and consume ever more stuff without noticeably benefiting our wellbeing?\" Based on its analysis, Nef's prescription for happy European countries with low per-capita carbon footprints includes measures such as: - mandatory short-term targets for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions - reducing inequalities in income, education, health and social opportunity - using the emerging science of wellbeing as a driver of policy | 4692) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Posted [Tests begin on Canaries telescope](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6897293.stm) Tests have begun on one of the world's largest optical telescopes, installed on a mountain in the Canary Islands. Situated on a 2,400m-high (7,900ft) peak on the island of La Palma, the huge telescope consists of a mirror measuring 10.4m (34.1ft) in diameter. The Spanish-led Great Canary Telescope (GTC) is extremely powerful and will be able to spot some of the faintest, most distant objects in the Universe. The GTC team expect the telescope to be fully operational within 12 months. The enormous array has taken seven years to construct; its installation has been hampered by poor weather and the logistical difficulties of transporting equipment to such an inaccessible location. The project is estimated to cost 130m euros (\u00c3\u00c2\u00a388m). Another Earth? Based at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, the optical telescope is made up from 36 separate hexagonal mirror segments which together form the 10.4m primary mirror. Its vast size will enable it to capture some of the most distant light in the Universe, helping researchers look for information that might help to explain the evolution of the cosmos. It will probe far-off galaxies, look into the secrets of star formation, and hunt for Earth-like planets. \"It would be wonderful if this telescope allowed us to detect a planet like ours,\" project director Pedro Alvarez told the Spanish El Mundo newspaper. Campbell Warden, the executive secretary of the Canary Islands Astrophysics Institute, told BBC News: \"The big advantage of the GCT over existing telescopes... is that because of the combination of the very advanced technology and the largest optical infrared mirror we'll be able to characterise the atmospheres of planets, instead of just having, as we have at the moment, mathematical speculations of what planets could be like. \"We'll actually be able to take a much better look at them.\" He added: \"We'll be able to throw back the curtains that shroud the early Universe, revealing many of its mysteries.\" Giant telescopes The GTC is among the world's largest optical reflecting telescopes. The newly opened Southern African Large Telescope (Salt) boasts a segmented primary mirror with - in the longest dimension - a diameter of 11m (36ft). The Hobby-Eberly on Mount Fowlkes in Texas, US, also has an 11m mirror; however, the way that it works means the Keck twins in Hawaii, which have mirrors 10m (33ft) across, have a slightly larger light-collecting area. The twins can also be made to work in tandem - as a so-called interferometer - which allows them to mimic a larger telescope that is 85m (279ft) wide. These US scopes are rivalled in power by Europe's own Very Large Telescope, sited in Chile, which includes four large mirror units (each 8.2m across) that will soon also be made to work as one. When they do this, the VLT will mimic a telescope that is 200m (650ft) across. The Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona, US, uses two 8.4m (27.6ft) mirrors side by side to achieve an effective 11.8m (38.7ft) diameter. All of these scopes will be dwarfed in the next decade if plans are progressed to build facilities with mirrors that are 30-60m (100-200ft) across. | 4695) |[Message Posted 15 Jul 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: the expenditure of kilowatts, and the expense Hmmmmm.

In any case, those electricity bills are so worrying. Why do we keep PCs running when when they aren't being used, when we used to switch them off because we saved electricity and didn't have to put up with the fan noise and heat pumping out?

So you agree with Dr David Anderson then? I do, 100%. I'd go even further: \"Pull\" is everywhere on the internet, a better model than \"Push\". In fact I see a great struggle over the next decade to be between \"Open-and-Pull\" vs \"Closed-and-push\". Closed-and-push is for people that want to control everything. Open-and-pull is for people who want to cogenerate activity again. I know, I know: I'm starting to sound like an ideologue. LOL Sounds like the old argument for thin clients.... I don't understand that, Chris. What's the argument for thin clients? In client-server architecture there are two schools of thought, thin clients where all the processing and programs are on the server, thick clients where the programs and processing are on the client and he sever is used for storage. Thin clients are cheaper machines, but rely on the server to operate. Thick clients are dearer but can operate stand alone without a server or network. Closed/push is thin client, Open/pull is thick client. See the analogy here, how much central control do you want? The choice widens out. You don't just have one server, but you have a server for each application. Or you just have one server and virtualize with arrays of off-line storage. Or you send every home and have home working, which is becoming increasingly popular. | 4697) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : .

Two teams are formed and a sugar beat tossed to decide who is going to 'flonk' first. A \"dull witted person\" is chosen as the referee or 'jobanowl'. The game begins when he shouts \"Here y'go t'gither!\" The rules The team which is not flonking holds hands and dances around in a circle - known as \"girting\". A member of the opposing team stands in the middle of the circle holding a \"driveller\" (a pole 2-3 ft long and made from hazel or yew), on the end of which is a beer-soaked dwile. The flonker then turns in an anti-clockwise direction and flonks his dwile at the opposing circling team. If the dwile misses completely it is known as a \"swadger\". When this happens the team forms a line and the flonker takes hold of a pot filled with ale. He then has to drink the contents of the pot before the wet dwile has passed from hand to hand along the line, chanting to the ancient ceremonial mantra of \"pot pot pot\". The team with the highest number of points wins, after deducting one point for every player still sober. Confused? So am I. So THAT was what we played behind the bike sheds at school....... So THAT is why they always called me a flonker at school........ | 4743) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Posted 14 Jul 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Did you notice my RAC is rising?

But we get 'belief' mixed up with evidence and views based on evidence. There is no evidence 100% to prove either which way, and scientists use what evidence there is and state their views.

Select a star or planet from a hand held attachment, and the telescopes slews across and points to the star or planet you asked for. Or satellites, asteroids etc. It makes it interesting because you get to know all the names and get familiar with all those specs of light up there.

When I see a 25-year-old girl that's had five children I think she should be sterilized and put in jail. The young (and maybe not so young) men are to blame, too, and should also be sterilized and jailed. Each kid that's born today will want a car in 16 years, a house in 20 and more kids of his/her own. This kind of stuff's not regulated enough. When somebody has that fifth (or more) child, he/she is congratulated. That image should be reversed, just like smoking was. I've heard somewhere that the Supreme Being said \"Be fruitful and multiply.\" We've already done that 60 times in the last 2,000 years. Isn't that enough? It's a bit of an extreme view this, but yes, the argument that the world is overpopulated does come up again and again. Not too long ago I met a scientist who was looking into Climate Change back in the 1970's, but even then overpopulation in parts of the world where they couldn't feed themselves was more of a major concern for the scientists. But then Aids happened and the scientists very privately breathed a sigh of relief; the population problem in Africa was solved. | 4811) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [This is TLPTP might W # 40 thread - No Black Puddings today!

What are climate models? What do they do or prove? Why crunch climate models? I started in BOINC with crunching BBC climate, because it seemed like a fantastic idea to use my computer for something worthwhile, to do my bit. And anyway, I had no knowledge of SETI@Home or any other project then. Now there are different types of climate models, like SAP (Seasonal Attribution Project) the first two of which I completed in 12 days on a dual core, 6 days each, whilst CPDN models can take months to complete. What do I know about the science of climate modeling? Very little. How about you? Post: [BTW: Thanks for those articles Longshanks, They are interesting to me as they demonstrate that world economy can benefit from these new emerging trends, as well as slowing down our damage to the planet ] You are welcome. It is true that carrying out many of the recommendations will help us whether there is climate change/global warming or not; the benefits of using clean energy, being efficient, pumping out less pollutants, etc., are all worth doing anyway. I totally agree, and have made this same point in posts here. I'm glad to see that I am not the only one that feels this way. Using renewable energy sources will lessen the dependence of our economy on non-renewable ones. Increased efficiency in energy use will make it so that the energy that we DO use goes further. Spewing less crap into the environment will lessen the damage that we do to the environment, and hopefully allow the environment to begin to 'heal' somewhat. The issue of human-caused global warming/climate change is a contentious one. Some people say its definitely true. Others say it definitely isn't. Me, I say that while it is possible, we just don't know enough about it yet to say one way or the other. Furthermore, I say that there are other, compelling reasons to take most, if not all, of the proposed actions to combat 'human-caused global warming/climate change'. Economic and Environmental reasons compelling enough to start doing these things now and not wait on the GW/CC issue to be settled. These reasons effectively render any debate on GW/CC meaningless. If, at some point in the future, human-caused GW/CC is conclusively proven to exist, well, we were already taking steps to help (but for other reasons). If human-caused GW/CC is shown to NOT be significant, well, we needed to do these thing ANYWAY (again, for other reasons). I'm already doing what I can on these issues. I replaced one of my vehicles with a new one that gets 50% better MPG than the old one. If I don't need to drive somewhere, I don't. I switched years ago to CFL light bulbs in my home (they use only 25% of the electricity than a regular incandescent bulb with an equivalent light output). I have replaced my air conditioner/heater, my refrigerator, and my water heater with newer, more efficient models over the last few years, and I do my best to limit the amount they run. I buy my electricity (paying a bit more for it, too) from a company that has a significant amount of generation capacity from solar, wind, and nuclear (currently about 20%), and is committed to increasing that amount as time passes. I do everything I can to reduce my water use. I buy liquid products preferentially in aluminum or glass containers, and I recycle those containers. I avoid plastic containers wherever possible. I look for paper-based packaging that has significant paper recycling use in it, especially 'post-consumer' recycled paper. I do my best to limit use of harsh chemicals around the house. For instance, I don't use weed killer or chemical fertilizer on the lawn, and I use chemical pesticides very sparingly. I prefer natural fiber clothing to synthetic. Cotton and wool rule! Nylon/rayon/polyester/etc. drools! I already do all of these thing for Environmental and Economic reasons, and I am always looking for ways to increase what I am doing. I have been doing these things for years. Years before 'global warming/climate change' became the hot topic it is today. What are you guys and girls doing to help? Well MajorKong, what can I say? But that this makes all good sense and you have given some good ideas and tips. I'm admittedly miles behind you, only really becoming interested win Climate Change when I first joined BOINC and the BBC climate project some 18 moths ago. I try and do what a can to reduce my carbon footprint and reduce my contribution to pollution. Sometimes it's just getting hold of some ideas that help. I've only just thought of buying two extra 200 liter water butts and aim to make my garden free of tap water - collected and falling rainwater only. Every little helps. | 4818) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [TLPTPW#39 HAVE CLOSED THIS THREAD](forum_thread.php?id=40575) ( [Message 602369](forum_thread.php?id=40575&postid=602369)) Posted 12 Jul 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I think that last pic might be stretching the thread?

I had two wonderful dogs, for 20 years... Rebel, my English Shepphard, was a warm, playful, energetic, affectionate dog. He died a short while back. My other dog, Pooh-Bear, a Chow-Chow, was fierce, loyal, reserved, but also deeply affectionate to me. He died a few months after Rebel. If you'd asked me while they were both alive, which was my favorite of the two, it'd would've been hard for me to say, but I would've given the edge to Rebel, who never left my side. They both died ugly, painful deaths from cancer. For some darn reason, Rebel is already starting to fade from my memory; I mean his exact appearance, the number of times I think of him. Whereas Pooh-Bear's last moments are always fresh in my mind, and I think of him more times, than I do of Rebel.

The Environment Agency wants a 25-year plan aimed at coping with the kind of flooding seen in England in late June. Lib Dem environment spokesman Chris Huhne said the Midlands and Yorkshire were \"largely unprepared\" for an \"almost monsoon\" level of rainfall. Ministers have met local councils to discuss how to spend the \u00c3\u00c2\u00a314m relief package announced by PM Gordon Brown. In the House of Commons, Communities Secretary Hazel Blears hailed the \"brave men and women\" of the emergency services who had assisted in the relief effort. She said: \"What communities have told me is that they want to get back to normal as quickly as possible.\" The floods hit 31,200 homes and 7,000 businesses, said Ms Blears, mainly in the Midlands and northern England. Her Conservative shadow, Eric Pickles, called for a review of the way cash assistance is provided to councils faced with emergency spending. Meanwhile, forecasters are predicting more showers over the next few days for parts of Yorkshire - although more flooding is not expected. About 500 Environment Agency staff are still monitoring water levels in the worst-affected areas, near Doncaster and Hull. More protection Environment Agency chief Barbara Young said such flooding events - where torrential rain causes a deluge of surface water - were likely to become more frequent. She said planning needed to take climate change into account and that piecemeal planning must be avoided. \"As an agency, we've got to improve the standard of protection we've got for many properties. \"But local authorities, water companies and the developers need to have a co-ordinated process for 25-year planning for surface water flooding.\" Overloaded drainage Mr Huhne, who has visited the worst-affected areas of Hull, said the weather was causing a \"new type of flooding\". \"In the past we've been prepared for floods from rivers overflowing and floods from coastal and tidal surges,\" he said. \"This was an enormous amount of rain - four inches of rain in one day - almost monsoon quality. The drainage system simply couldn't cope.\" He called on the privatised water companies to play a bigger part in assessing the risk of flooding.

(These are ['No Sun link' to climate change](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6290228.stm) By Richard Black BBC Environment Correspondent A new scientific study concludes that changes in the Sun's output cannot be causing modern-day climate change. It shows that for the last 20 years, the Sun's output has declined, yet temperatures on Earth have risen. It also shows that modern temperatures are not determined by the Sun's effect on cosmic rays, as has been claimed. Writing in the Royal Society's journal Proceedings A, the researchers say cosmic rays may have affected climate in the past, but not the present. \"This should settle the debate,\" said Mike Lockwood, from the UK's Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory, who carried out the new analysis together with Claus Froehlich from the World Radiation Center in Switzerland. Dr Lockwood initiated the study partially in response to the TV documentary The Great Global Warming Swindle, broadcast on Britain's Channel Four earlier this year, which featured the cosmic ray hypothesis. \"All the graphs they showed stopped in about 1980, and I knew why, because things diverged after that,\" he told the BBC News website. \"You can't just ignore bits of data that you don't like,\" he said. Warming trend The scientists' main approach on this new analysis was simple: to look at solar output and cosmic ray intensity over the last 30-40 years, and compare those trends with the graph for global average surface temperature, which has risen by about 0.4C over the period. The Sun varies on a cycle of about 11 years between periods of high and low activity. But that cycle comes on top of longer-term trends; and most of the 20th Century saw a slight but steady increase in solar output. However, in about 1985, that trend appears to have reversed, with solar output declining. Yet this period has seen temperatures rise as fast as - if not faster than - any time during the previous 100 years. \"This paper reinforces the fact that the warming in the last 20 to 40 years can't have been caused by solar activity,\" said Dr Piers Forster from Leeds University, a leading contributor to this year's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment of climate science. Cosmic relief The IPCC's February summary report concluded that greenhouse gases were about 13 times more responsible than solar changes for rising global temperatures. But the organisation was criticised in some quarters for not taking into account the cosmic ray hypothesis, developed by, among others, Henrik Svensmark and Eigil Friis-Christensen of the Danish National Space Center. Their theory holds that cosmic rays help clouds to form by providing tiny particles around which water vapour can condense. Overall, clouds cool the Earth. During periods of active solar activity, cosmic rays are partially blocked by the Sun's more intense magnetic field. Cloud formation diminishes, and the Earth warms. Mike Lockwood's analysis appears to have put a large, probably fatal nail in this intriguing and elegant hypothesis. He said: \"I do think there is a cosmic ray effect on cloud cover. It works in clean maritime air where there isn't much else for water vapour to condense around. \"It might even have had a significant effect on pre-industrial climate; but you cannot apply it to what we're seeing now, because we're in a completely different ball game.\" Drs Svensmark and Friis-Christensen could not be reached for debut for plastic daffodils](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cumbria/6291194.stm) Artificial daffodils \"planted\" on the shores of Windermere are to be exhibited at a major flower show to highlight climate change in the Lakes. Dozens of silk and plastic daffodils were installed at Fallbarrow Park at Bowness, after the mildest winter since 1914 saw real daffodils bloom early. Now South Lakeland Parks is to exhibit them at the Royal Horticultural Society's annual show in Cheshire. It is hoped the move will highlight climate changes affecting the area. 'Superb environment' The company has commissioned a garden called Paradise Found, which aims to show how subtle indicators of climate change are already under way in the Lake District. Parts of the \"climate change garden\" are shaded by conifers and lead to a grassy bank and a stream which has all but dried up due to rising temperatures. A spokesman for South Lakeland Parks said: \"We are already seeing evidence of climate change in the Lake District. \"It is important to show what we are doing as a company to combat this and how visitors can contribute and help preserve the superb environment we have here.\" | needed on climate](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6292744.stm) By Mark Kinver Science and Nature reporter, BBC News The international climate debate needs to embrace a \"new way of thinking\" to tackle the problem, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has urged. Too much time was being wasted arguing over \"historical responsibilities\" for past emissions, Mr Ban said. He called for both industrialised and developing nations to focus on limiting future global greenhouse gas emissions. Mr Ban added that he would convene a climate summit to help reach consensus on a global climate action plan. \"It is time for new thinking,\" he told an audience at Chatham House, the international think-tank based in London, UK. \"This is an agenda that really affects the whole of human kind. \"I promise that this challenge and what we do about it will define us,\" he said. Breaking the deadlock Recent attempts to reach a global agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012, have ended in failure. The global climate treaty requires industrialised nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% from 1990 levels, but the US and Australia have refused to ratify it. President Bush's administration called the scheme \"fatally flawed\", partly because it did not require developing countries, including China and India, to commit to emissions reductions. The idea of making developing nations enforce emissions caps has also faced opposition. In June, China published its first national plan to curb climate change but it stopped short of backing a limit. Ma Kai, chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission, said: \"We must reconcile the need for development with the need for environmental protection.\" But he added that rich countries were responsible for most of the greenhouse gases produced over the past century, and had an \"unshirkable responsibility\" to do more to tackle the problem. \"The international community should respect the developing countries' right to develop,\" Mr Ma observed. Mr Ban, in his first speech in the UK since becoming UN secretary general, warned that arguing over the legacy of past emissions only wasted time. \"I have been advised by many experts that if we act now - since we have the resources and heightened awareness - we can reverse it,\" he said. \"Then we can give a much more prosperous planet Earth to our great, great, grandchildren. \"What I would like to stress is rather than looking at past historical responsibilities, we need to look at historical responsibilities in the future. \"To build on the current momentum, I am going to convene a high-level UN General Assembly debate on 24 September.\" He said that the outcomes from this meeting would feed into the UN climate negotiation process. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will hold its next meeting in Bali towards the end of the year. \"Business as usual is no longer an option - we must reach complete agreement,\" he told the audience in central London. | Post: [BTW: Thanks for those articles Longshanks, They are interesting to me as they demonstrate that world economy can benefit from these new emerging trends, as well as slowing down our damage to the planet ] You are welcome.

In the latest in a series on changing US attitudes to global warming, the BBC's Sam Wilson profiles three grassroots ventures in the state of California. Solar Sebastopol California's generous endowment of sunshine gives it a golden opportunity to exploit solar power, but the town of Sebastopol, north of San Francisco, has been particularly energised. Its goal is to install one megawatt of solar power production across the town - equivalent to decking the roofs of 500 average-sized homes with solar panels. It is over a third of the way there, with 380kW-worth of panels fitted so far on local government buildings, businesses and homes. One of the most eye-catching adorns the roof of the town's open-air swimming pool. Sebastopol's Mayor Sam Pierce describes it as a \"very aggressive effort, by both the city and the community\", to tackle global warming. His city council has also set itself a target of reducing its own emissions by 42% over a 10-year period - the most ambitious target in the US and far ahead of those demanded by the Kyoto Protocol. Mr Pierce - whose Green Party has held a majority in Sebastopol for six years - says the pressure for action is definitely bottom-up. \"Our community is very tuned in, very well informed on climate change, and wants to take action,\" he says. \"So, as a result, the policy-makers are very aggressive, and find ways to satisfy that demand in the public.\" The 42% target comes from closely audited assessments, says the city manager, David Brennan, and should therefore be achievable. The city is improving energy efficiency in heating and lighting in council buildings, and has bought five hybrid vehicles when replacing its fleet, including three police cars. The officials are disappointed that President George W Bush has refused to set nationwide emissions reduction goals, but hopes Sebastopol's efforts will be replicated at the local level elsewhere. \"If there's any silver lining to what I would call the debacle of the Bush regime, it's that it demonstrated to local jurisdictions that it's essential that they find local solutions,\" Mr Pierce says. \"The nationals aren't going to do it. But we as a community are going to demonstrate to the rest of the country what can be done.\" \"You do what you can, then find a megaphone.\" [click here for the rest of the [Polar bears send climate message](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/surrey/6291872.stm) School children in Surrey are following the movements of polar bears in the Arctic as a way of learning about the effects of climate change. South Bookham School, in Great Bookham, near Leatherhead, has signed up to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Canon polar bear tracker website. The site examines the changing habitat of the bears around Svalbard and Franz Josef Land, to the north of Norway. Children are taught how saving energy in their lives can help polar bears. The school already invests in water conversation work and has a children's environment council. Online blog Head teacher Rosie Keedy said: \"We have been very proactive in educating the pupils about the environment and sustainability. \"The children really enjoy using the website and now when you ask them about ways of saving the polar bear, they will say that they walk to school or that they turn off lights to save energy.\" Learning materials on the website include downloadable school packs, online games and a blog from WWF researchers in the Arctic. Canon UK's Lisa Attfield said: \"The knowledge and enthusiasm of these pupils is really infectious and more schools should take the same approach as South Bookham in teaching children how to do their bit. | 4853) |[Message 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: This is intended to a be a serious discussion thread about Climate Change and Global Warming.

Lewis Gordon Pugh will swim for 1km in water temperatures as low as -1.8 degrees Celsius (28.7F), the coldest waters a human has ever swum in. The City lawyer plans to complete the swim in 20 minutes, dressed in a swimming costume, a cap and goggles. Pugh has left London to join a Russian icebreaker which will take him and his crew to the North Pole in seven days. He is the only person to have completed a long distance swim in all the five oceans in the world. 'Regrettable' attempt Pugh will attempt the record on 15 July, swimming along a crack in the ice to the geographic North Pole. Earlier this year announcing his record attempt Pugh said: \"Areas of open sea are now appearing and the sea temperature in the Arctic Ocean is predicted to increase by 9C by the end of the century. \"Just five or 10 years ago this swim would never have been possible - most people have no idea that you can find patches of open sea at the North Pole in summer. \"It's deeply regrettable that it's possible now because of the devastating effects of climate change.\" During various challenges over the years, including in Arctic and Antarctic waters, Pugh has come into contact with crocodiles, sharks, hippopotami and polar bears. His ability to endure extreme cold has also earned him the nickname of \"The Polar Bear\". | 4888) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) HAVE CLOSED THIS THREAD](forum_thread.php?id=40575) ( [Message 600538](forum_thread.php?id=40575&postid=600538)) Posted 8 Jul 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I like to win too :) Oh, your first post.

A Kronenbourg, brewed since 1664. Crisp and bitter, but with a hint of sweetness in the aftertaste. It's made in Alsce-Lorraine, on the French-German border.(My favorite) Thanks guys. Trouble is can't buy a pint of it, probably 440cl or 1/2 litre bottles. I know you can buy them in 6 packs (bottles) or 8 packs (cans). At least here you can. Not over where you are? Yeah can get it in packs of bottles, but for a pint as Mike said, youre talking draught. Not round my way, although it may be elsewhere in the UK. Yeah, same here. You can't get on tap around here, either. But the bottled stuff is just fine, excellent in fact. Speaking of cans: I kinda like the taste of Japan's Saporo beer. I wish they made it more carbonated, but American drinkers would probably like it. It comes in a cool silver \"shaped\" can, kind of like a large tulip shaped beer glass. There seems to be a choice of two Japanese beers in Germany. One is brewed in Bury St Edmunds, the other in Dublin. I just added a pic to my post, Michael. Is Sapporo one of the two beers on offer there? Maybe it's made under licence in Dublin. I think so, yes - one is Sapporo, the other Kirin and I think Kirin is brewed in Bury St Edmunds. Kirin is the more well-known, but I'd go for the Sapporo. It's much tastier, imho. Worth a try once, anyway. Quite nice in its own way. Tastier?

April 4: Looked right into the security camera; used it as a mirror, picked your nose, and ate it. 8. May 10: While appearing to be choosing kitchen knives in the Housewares aisle asked an assistant if he knew where the antidepressants were. 9. June 3: Darted around the store suspiciously, loudly humming the \"Mission Impossible\" theme. 10. June 6: In the kitchenware aisle, practised the \"Madonna look\" using different size funnels. 11. June 18: Hid in a clothing rack and when people browsed, yelled \"PICK ME!\" \"PICK ME!\" 12. June 21: When an announcement came over the loud speaker, assumed the foetal position and screamed \"NO!

In March 2007 he said: \"The foundation of this must of course be a new international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2012.\" He added: \"My ambition is to build a global carbon market, founded on the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and centred in London.\" He has even appointed the former US Vice President Al Gore as an adviser and action on global warming is another issue on which he is likely to differ from President Bush.

Climate change (and global warming) does not simply mean temperatures will rise across the globe. The 'mean' temperatures will go up, but rises will vary. The climate change is about more storms, worse storms, bigger flood surges, more intense weather, more typhoons, more lightening storms or increasing intensity, up-side-down weather (weather being a very short term definition, a day or week). Climate is chaotic by nature and definition. But that chaos in climate will get worse. Days will be colder that they should be, areas turn to desert while buckets or rain pour in areas which should to have little rain etc. So don't think about this global \"warming\" too much.

No, it's the climate change that the warming causes which is turning areas into desert and causing drought and the storms and the major changes in climate taking place.

Clearly they are not and reflects some of the muddled thinking on this thread which is headed 'global warming' but talks about climate change without any indication that anyone knows the difference, and if it matters that the two are equated when then are not the same. 'Global warming' is the scientific evidence that temperatures of the near surface Earth atmosphere are rising, and that higher temperatures threaten dangerous consequences on planet Earth: drought, disease, floods, lost ecosystems, etc. The term 'climate change' is used to refer to changes in the Earth's climate. Generally, this is taken to regard changes in temperature, by monitoring averages, extremes, durations, and geographic coverages. 'Climate change' is caused by natural forces including, but not limited to, human activities. | 5023) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 28 Jun 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: By raising your legs slowly and lying on your back, you cannot sink into quicksand.

I don't think you were in any danger of being attacked by the approaching cows. I've found that cows are very friendly towards humans. When I was about 14 there was a enclosed pasture were cows grazed. Whenever I happened to be passing by the area I would stop by so I could pet them. They liked that very much. I wasn't worried about being attacked, I just didn't want these great things with all that crap stuck to their butts to come anywhere near me. But I assure you the arm waving worked.

The question is whether the 'greenness' is really green or only a Marketing green sham 'look'. Elsewhere, Bush is dragging his oil heels as ever with smokescreens, prevarication, and trying to blame everyone else first... Martin I think its mostly 'Marketing'. For instance, there is a TV commercial running around here about a car manufacturer (Subaru??) having this environmentally friendly factory. Sure, its nice that they take steps to reduce their factory's pollution, but the product made there (cars) will pollute WAY more over their useful lifetime than that factory ever would. Most 'green' initiatives are jokes. If that car company was *serious* about cutting pollution, they would stop making cars and switch to bicycles. I think you're right MajorKong. There is a market to sell products to people who want to buy 'green'. So if you had an existing car, and without making any changes to it, but find something about it that was green, like it used less petrol when it went downhill, and advertised it covered in flowers, you would probably increase sales. | 5095) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [What the Olympics 2012 logo?](forum_thread.php?id=40014) ( [Message 582419](forum_thread.php?id=40014&postid=582419)) Posted 6 Jun 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Do you look at the posts?

Those captivated by cloudbursts will find a silver lining in global warming. An analysis of 20 years of satellite data indicates that rising temperatures will bring increased precipitation. The finding challenges well-established climate models and could help researchers more accurately predict dramatic weather events such as El Ni\u00c3\u00c2\u00b1os. Climatologists have long agreed that as the planet heats up, the atmosphere will hold more water--almost 7% more for every additional degree Celsius. Complex computer models, however, predict that a rise in atmospheric water will only boost rainfall by 1% to 3% for every degree the temperature rises. Researchers have assumed the discrepancy must be because, although there is more water in the atmosphere, the rate of its precipitation and evaporation slows down. But these models don't have a perfect track record. When used to simulate weather patterns over the past 2 decades, the models underestimate rainfall and miss dramatic weather events such as the 1998 El Ni\u00c3\u00c2\u00b1o. So physicist Frank Wentz and colleagues at Remote Sensing Systems, a satellite analysis company in Santa Rosa, California, ditched the models. Instead, they used real historical data collected from six satellites to see the relations between total atmospheric water, precipitation, evaporation, and global temperature. It was a good match. Precipitation and evaporation changed exactly in line with total atmospheric water--an increase of 6.5% for every degree Celsius that Earth's temperature rose. That means evaporation and precipitation don't slow down when the atmosphere gets wetter, the team reports online in [Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1140746). Don't count on a drought-free future, however. The amount of annual rainfall varies greatly around the globe, the researchers note. And the increases due to global warming could range quite a bit. \"In the tropics, you would get as much as 65 millimeters of water, whereas in the northern latitudes, it might only be a few millimeters,\" says Wentz. The study is the first to question the accuracy of precipitation in current climate models, says climatologist Brian Soden of the University of Miami in Florida. \"There are dozens of different climate models out there, and every single one of them predicts that precipitation will increase more slowly than this study suggests,\" he says. Plus, he notes, they all get the historical record wrong. Improving these models, Soden says, could help climatologists better predict future storms.

Look at politicians for example. How many get caught fiddling expenses, and breaking the rules they know full well when they accept 'gifts' from ambassadors from other countries, or accept free holidays or hospitality, which they know they shouldn't, because their political judgment might be compromised, hence the need for the rule.

They always seem to argue that there is no empirical evidence to support the 'skeptical' views, yet... well, they don't really have cast iron research to prove the case for for CO2. Also, the point about moving from the scientific realm to the political realm that David Evans is making is valid. I'd like the scientists to take responsibility for what they are feeding to the politicians. If the politicians are misleading us on Global Warming, I'd like to see the scientists stand up and say, \"excuse me, but we didn't actually say that\". \"That course of action is unjustifiably extreme, based on the science we know about Climate Change\". etc. etc. And yes, I dislike the notion that some scientists are creaming it because, \"it's what the politicians have asked us to do\". Let's see more impartiality and scientists who research what they believe they should be researched, rather than where the fat money is. | 5114) 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Them be digital.

It was especially irked by the refusal of anti-whaling countries to discuss a small amount of commercial whaling by four Japanese coastal communities. Japan has made similar statements in previous years. Environmental groups say the meeting paid too little attention to important issues such as the number of cetaceans hit by ships, and climate change. After securing a narrow majority of members for last year's meeting - the first majority in 20 years - pro-whaling countries again found themselves in the minority here, and lost a number of key votes. A recruitment campaign by European and South American countries over the last year brought more members into the IWC to vote for the anti-whaling bloc. After initial signals that both sides were looking for dialogue and co-operation, the commission closed its four-day annual meeting with familiar acrimony in its later stages.

OK, you have a point. He knows it all and is spinning his answer to suite what he wants - as I do, and many climate scientists do. We 'spin' - say what we want to present things in an argument that suites what we want to achieve. As I say, I can see this is not ignorance, but rather skepticism that he is showing, manipulating his answer to suite his objectives. Something to ponder though: What if the ecosystem is already attempting to adjust to the CO2 levels? If we reduce, what is the chance that it may cause \"Global Cooling\"? That's a good point. I would assume that the result from most, if not all, 'solutions' to Global Warming would not be instant - we would see a reversal or whatever taking pace over decades. So might we over-brake and send climate into Global Cooling? It's something worth pondering over I agree. But then you have again highlighted the fact that there aren't any certainties to know exactly what will happen if we do nothing, if we do something, or if we do lots and lots of something. I think Rush and others have clearly identified there is unlikely to be a co-ordinated world-wide attempt to implement solutions, and it is more likely to be piecemeal - different countries deciding on different things.

You can't make an argument about this stuff, so you repeat your mantra. I used Kyoto this time to demonstrate one of your glaring inconsistencies, namely that you are concerned about the costs of using nuclear power (really the only economically viable alternative right now) yet you ignore costs that utterly dwarf those involved in nuclear power. I'm not an accountant, but I read somewhere that nuclear costs would be higher than alternative renewable energy costs. I have no way of verifying this but concede that decisions are made to go NPP whether I like it or not. I also accept your point that not getting the costs right about GW is a huge concern. Although all issues need to be addressed. I've never said that you should do nothing; however, I have said that what you propose is likely to be of negligible impact. There are different levels of 'doing' something. Even if negligible, at least it's 'doing'. Oh, and I DO write letters and make phone calls to politicians. I AM trying to influence them. Cool.

When I said \"It's about changing to other renewable forms of energy which do not emit huge amounts of CO2\" I meant China, India, Sierra Leone, and the Northern Territory in Australia and .... every country really. Except that they aren't doing it. It's just empty rhetoric. China doesn't care what you think. It never has. They rule with an Iron Heel and aren't interested in what the West says. They will feed you political rhetoric to placate. You're warping again Rush. \"China won't this, China won't that. Your answer to anything about Global Warming is - China won't this, China won't that.\" But how about deciding if \"you\" are going to do anything about Global Warming on a personal level - irrespective of what China is doing? Warped as in twisted. You're logic is saying it can't be done - you have twisted the argument from whether it should or should not be done, to I say it can't be so I'm using warped logic to try to scupper the argument - which is \"should we do something or should we not\" to which you are warping into \"can't be done, so stop even thinking about it\" - you \"conveniently fail to recognize it\" with \"it\" being what it's all about. I haven't said it cannot be done. Ever. I haven't twisted anything, ever. I HAVE said that Kyoto won't save you. I have said that Kyoto was a HUGE waste of time. I have said that piddlin' lil' crap like \"laws by Algore,\" or CFL lightbulbs won't cut it. I have said that orders from the gov't won't save you either--just like Kyoto didn't. I have said that the problem confronting you is nearly insurmountable; that the govt can't save you--just like Kyoto didn't. Here we go with the warping again. Except instead of China it's Kyoto - same record, different label. Again, how about deciding if \"you\" are going to do anything about Global Warming on a personal level - irrespective of what Kyoto is doing? Look Rush, if you decide it is bad to murder people, you don't let people carry on with murder and pass no laws just because they murder in other parts of the world. We have to decide what is right and go with it - influencing others in the world comes next, and should not stop us from doing what is right. Well then, let's use your example: \"If you decide it is bad to pollute, you don't let people (China, India, Mexico) carry on with polluting and exempt them from laws because they pollute in other parts of the world.\" This is another warp for sure. ditto ditto - how about deciding if \"you\" are going to do anything about Global Warming on a personal level - irrespective of what people (China, India, Mexico) are doing? Concerning your next sentence, many people do not agree with you, and do not believe what you think is right. Just as they didn't for the coming ice age, and the population explosion, and the nuclear holocaust, and everyone starving to death, on and on and on. That you happen to think something is right, does not mean others do. ditto ditto - how about deciding if \"you\" are going to do anything about Global Warming on a personal level - irrespective of what happened in the Ice Age? Actually, as it happens, it is not nuclear I have a problem with, it is the horrendous risks, the huge overall costs, and the legacy we are leaving to the world and future generations give Chernobyl and the accidents/terrorist uses that are high probability/risk. It is senseless to to use something that carries risk of unmentionable damage to the the world let alone the country using nuclear. Apart from that I would be quite happy to take advantage of the benefits that nuclear has to offer. The risks of nuclear are negligible (compared to what emissions are doing) and have lessened (overall) over time. It's odd that you are concerned with huge overall costs of nuclear energy, yet the costs of Kyoto don't even come into play--even when they dwarf the costs involved with the use of nuclear energy. Here we go - it's Kyoto again, your stock answer to warp an answer that fails to say whether you recognize that Global warming exists and what you are doing about it. For example, changing to other renewable forms of energy which do not emit huge amounts of CO2. Well I'll say it; grow up and face you responsibilities and reality. I don't accept your version of reality, nor for the reasons I have presented, do I find your solutions viable. You find my solutions viable? Then why all this China/Kyoto defense? You may be alright Jack in your lifetime or your little spot on this Earth, but someone has to pick up the tab and it really should be the one that scoffed the meals. (You can chip in for the tip as well. ;P ) That may be true. But so far, even if he does, those that are scoffing them now are destroying any tab that might get picked up. What then? It's called diplomatic influence and education. One time England was trading in slaves. Now they're not. England learned lessons and why shouldn't other countries learn lessons about Global Warming? Hmmmm, always \"Don't put me on the spot, look at him over there instead, he's fatter than me\". Are you always diverting attention elsewhere rather that addressing the crap on your own doorstep (by which I meal slag from coal mines and other nasty stuff that oozes out of Nuclear Power Plants)? Yeah, duh. Because it doesn't matter what the U.S. or the U.K. cuts (and they won't be able to (250mm vs. 400mm)) because China is picking up all the slack and more. The U.S. could cut 100% and China will STILL quadruple what the U.S. emits. The point being, you won't convince people that they have to shoulder enormous economic burdens when they can see that it will make no difference whatsoever. Always with the negative warp. Let's look at what we can do and get on with it, let the diplomats do the influencing, and at least make a start rather than negatively doing nothing because China this and Kyoto that. I used to tear away from traffic lights and use my accelerator harshly. Now I ease back, don't lose any time, usually none, but burn less gas and emit less CO2.

You're kinda like that other guy that posted here for a while: you seem incapable of reading when it doesn't fit what you want to hear. So I'll say it again: silly little political solutions will not save the planet because those countries that are exempted will quickly dwarf whatever minor cuts you make, i.e., a new coal burning power plant every four days, or 400 million people vs. 250 million people. Well I'll say it; grow up and face you responsibilities and reality. You may be alright Jack in your lifetime or your little spot on this Earth, but someone has to pick up the tab and it really should be the one that scoffed the meals.

OK, I'm non-scientific but with an enquiring mind, but I still don't get it. I get light OK. I can understand that the moment it leaves the Sun it will take 8 minutes to reach Earth. This fact does not change if the Sun remains, or suddenly vanishes, ceasing to exist. 8 minutes later I still see that light, then darkness because the Sun is no longer there. Yet you say that gravity travels at the speed of light and that it's force, it's gravitational pull, still exists without the body that was exerting the force. That is, you say if the Sun suddenly vanished, the Sun's gravity that left the Sun a moment before the Sun vanished would continue at the speed of light exerting that huge gravitational force, even though the Sun has now vanished.

Since division by four-thirds is always multiplication by three-fourths, the per capita reduction would be to a level of 30 percent of today's emissions instead of 56.25 percent.

We are planting the odd tree here, and getting people to recycle their rubbish, but the tonnes and tonnes of pollutants spewed out by industry, the airlines and, as you say China, India, Mexico etc, stays unabated. We deny the third world any chance of industrializing or climbing out of poverty because we say that can't make money out of industry despite the fact that we have been creaming it and polluting the world for the cast 200 years.

This is after critics of Tony Blair and the government's Energy White Paper [called the consultation a \"farce\"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6681377.stm) and nuclear power would be a \"dangerous, dirty white elephant\". Nice one Scotland! The usual ridiculous argument is that we must have nuclear energy, or else we must burn coal and use gas and make Global Warming worse. Nonsense!

Appointment of a moderator should be on the basis that they spend *some* **voluntary** time here depending on what they are able to contribute. They don't need to know everybody, in the same way that a policeman does not need to know everyone on his patch to enforce law and order. Appointment of a moderator should also be based on the ability to do the job, to enforce the rules here, not on the basis of going easy on friends and hard on someone they don't like or doesn't belong to their team. In fact any moderator making moderation decisions based on their personal preferences, or based on which side they got out of bed that morning, is patently not suitable to moderate. Any such person should be withdrawn by the administrators since theirs is the responsibility of bad moderation and its unchecked continuation.

Is it still crunching at the time, or is nothing going on when you have no 'Net connection? If so, why? The connection should only be needed to download WUs and upload results, correct? If you are not attached to a project or do not have ant WUs showing, then there is nothing to crunch - your BOINC manager will be idle. Apart from trying to download WUs from a non-present network link (unless you set the option to stop it trying to use a network connection). Lack of network connection will not stop your BOINC Manager Crunching.

It's worth knowing that, being a long WU (or \"model\" in CPDN talk), a few months before you finish, it can be very disappointing if PC problems cause an error and you are unable to finish the model right up to 2080. (Eg, if you decided to play a PC game which locked up the model and crashed it, or you simply switched off the PC without remembering to put the model on 'suspend' or closing it down properly.) The idea is to suspend the model, do a backup, and restart it every now and then. The link above will give you advice about backups and [avoiding crashes](http://www.climateprediction.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=5896). It may sound daunting, but climate modeling is definitely a challenge. After a year+ of climate crunching I myself have only completed one full 1920 to 2080 model.

I have string of crashed models, but after starting up again earlier this year I have had very few crashes (only on SAP in fact) - probably because I now have better spec. PCs and don't muck about with computer games so much. It's best to suspend when playing the games since the game's use of the graphic card can cause a climate model to error. | 5273) |[Message May 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Talking about strange, I was just wondering SoxEd, you people in the 'English Midlands', you call yourselves \"Britishers\"?

What it all boils down to is that I will have to change the preferences on every single project I am attached to? If that's the case, then among us let me say that sounds very inefficient. Why doesn't the BOINC manager have a tab or drop-down from the menu so we can do it all for all projects from one place? Actually, once you change the preferences on 1 website, such as here on Seti, it is global, however, when the project is either updated manually or its next connection to get or report work, it will download the changed preferences as well. To make it quicker, you change the preferences, and click update on all your projects. At least thats how it has worked for me. Jeremy To answer Sarge; no you don't have to change anything on any project if you want the defaults. The values of 100 and 60 minutes are defaults in all the projects. The links are there if you want to change these. In fact you have to do nothing more than attach to a project and run it. If you have more that one project, and just one processor, each project will crunch alternately with the others, each getting an equal share. If you decide to change the defaults, you have to select a project under the Projects tab in BOINC manager, and click the update button to take effect.

It's worth knowing that, being a long WU (or \"model\" in CPDN talk), a few months before you finish, it can be very disappointing if PC problems cause an error and you are unable to finish the model right up to 2080. (Eg, if you decided to play a PC game which locked up the model and crashed it, or you simply switched off the PC without remembering to put the model on 'suspend' or closing it down properly.) The idea is to suspend the model, do a backup, and restart it every now and then. The link above will give you advice about backups and [avoiding crashes](http://www.climateprediction.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=5896). It may sound daunting, but climate modeling is definitely a challenge. After a year+ of climate crunching I myself have only completed one full 1920 to 2080 model. Others have done a lot better, but I just need more practice ;) | 5277) May 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: That's what I thought, processor usage.

You can adjust share or time as you wish, For example 1000 for one and 1 for the other would leave the other crunching for a very short time THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT The settings don't take effect until you press UPDATE in the BOINC Manager for both Einstein and climateprediction.net - you have to UPDATE, to take effect, for each PC that you are running these projects on. | 5278) May 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: There are some who started a climate model in Feb 2006 and which won't complete until 2008. It obviously depends on how quick your PC is, what else you are doing with it, and for how long during the week it is actually switched on and crunching. It's usual to complete a climate model in around 4 months, depending on your PC spec, and whether you are crunching two at a time on a hyper/duo. A recent new release of CPDN models means there is 90% less disk read/write activity, so the new models seem to be more stable and faster, and more suitable for laptops. There is another type of shorter climate project called SAP which says that the average completion time is around 6 weeks - I managed to finish one on a core duo in 6 days. (Unfortunately there is no work for this project right now.) You get a 'trickle' credit update every model year (there are 160 of these). On my 'average' PC I was getting a trickle every day - 160 days to complete the model(about 5 months). The daily 'trickle' credit is not taken away if you stop crunching for any reason - it's the only project where you get credits for partly completed WUs (work units).

This somehow came to was there a parallel earth somewhere else in the universe. Neither of us were into science although he believed in E.T's. My belief was that as everything (Planet wise), is spherical the Universe must therefore be round. A big balloon type of thing in which all planets and stars are inside. If therefore we pointed out and set off into space we would in the end come back to where we started from. No matter how many lightyears it took. The earth we left would be the same one we left but in a different space time. Sometime later we heard of the SETI program and I decided that although man would never get past the first few planets in our lifetime, it may be possible that light and soundwaves being searched by SETI might prove me correct or then again wrong.

Civil Service Ties CIVIL SERVICE TIES have gone to the wardrobe in the sky, joining old friends Bowler Hat and Neatly Rolled Umbrella who went before them. The unmistakeable badge of buttoned-down respectability came unknotted as society's values shifted around it. It is survived by its estranged neighbour, Open Necked Shirt. The sad announcement came as the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Andrew Turnbull, himself a long-time Tie Man, told civil servants that \"as long as they looked smart, they needn't wear a tie\". He made it plain, though, that there was still no room for \"Blue Jeans\" or \"Trainers\", still considered barbarians by many. Friends of the Tie will have foreseen its demise during an industrial tribunal last year in which a male civil servant claimed sexual discrimination for having to wear a shirt and tie even though his female colleagues did not. Some mourned its passing, saying the demise was a symbol of declining standards in the modern world. But its departure was welcomed by others, including a civil servants' union. \"Oscar Wilde once said that a well-tied tie is the first serious step in life,\" said a spokesman, adding that times had \"changed, thank goodness, and it's only right that civil servants be allowed to leave their wool jackets and ties at home\". | 5303) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Team Posted 4 May 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I hope to be finishing my first BBC CCE WU for Team England sometime later today [ ](http://bbc.cpdn.org/graph.php?resultid=664572) I managed to finish it OK. | 5304) [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) The first reason was, ummmmmm, errrrrrr It was ummmmmmm (I'll get back to May 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Do you have any memories from your younger days of the confession box?

The Shadows THE SHADOWS have finally seen the sun set on their career. Britain's first home-grown rock and roll stars have played their last show, almost 50 years after they shot to fame as Cliff Richard's backing band. Despite their links with Sir Cliff, The Shadows preside over a formidable solo legacy as Britain's most successful instrumental band. Only Elvis and Sir Cliff himself have spent more weeks in the UK singles chart than the Tyneside-led quartet. Born of the thriving coffee shop scene in London's Soho, the group - initially called The Drifters - were the last word in mid-50s \"hep-cat cool\". As such, they clearly did not dig their dreary post-war English names. Guitarists Brian Rankin and Bruce Cripps became, respectively, Hank B Marvin and Bruce Welch. It was an example keenly followed by later recruits, bassist Jet Harris (Terence Harris) and drummer Tony Meehan (Daniel Meehan) and, of course, Cliff \"Harry Webb\" Richard himself. Instantly identifiable by their exotic West Coast twangy guitar sound and Marvin's Buddy Holly-like spectacles, the group topped it all off with a tightly synchronised stage walk. Success came in 1958 with Cliff's chart buster Move It. They then hit the charts with their own tunes. In 1960, Apache stayed at the top slot for several weeks. Further number ones followed including Kon-Tiki and Dance On. | 5308) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe Work Unit](forum_thread.php?id=39244) [Message 559477](forum_thread.php?id=39244&postid=559477)) Posted 4 May 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Heh.

Yes, train spotting not been banned yet ;) | 5311) R.I.P. Lock-ins LOCK-INS, the party is over, time has been called. Legislators will make the traditional UK pub lock-in redundant on Thursday when new opening hours come into force. Under the new Licensing Act, premises can now apply to extend their opening hours beyond 11pm, allowing round-the-clock drinking and killing off the need for an after-hours get together. Many pub lovers, for whom there were few more pleasurable drinking experiences than the illicit thrill of carrying on when others had been asked to be on their way, will rue the day. For while 24-hour drinking will become widespread, the attraction for many was that lock-ins were secret, a conspiracy between publican and patron. Also, they were exclusive, usually with only a few select regulars. It's a tradition that had been enjoyed by generations of drinkers, with even the likes of Prince Harry enjoying a few covert pints. While publicans risked losing their licence by allowing them, police often turned a blind eye if things were kept low key. | 5312) Bachelors and Spinsters BACHELORS, the party is over.

I don't know how strong the account passwords are at the forum you're talking about, but the SETI passwords are pretty strong and hard to break. Theoretically they can but not without some work.

Maybe somebody can guess your email address - all moderators and site admin of a project have access to it, as do Founders if you are in a team. But the password? That's as strong as you make it. SETI doesn't decide on the strength - you do when you set it. Mine is gobbledygook, a combination of characters and numbers, upper and lower case, and is certainly not easy to guess - since it's gobbledygook and doesn't stand for anything, mean anything, or is not associated with anything to do with me.

Saint George is the patron saint of England. He's popularly identified with England and English ideals of honour, bravery and gallantry - but actually he wasn't English at all. Very little, if anything, is known about the real Saint George. Pope Gelasius said that George is one of the saints \"whose names are rightly reverenced among us, but whose actions are known only to God.\" Facts in brief Everything about Saint George is dubious, so the information below should be taken as mythical rather than real. - Born in Turkey (in Cappadocia) - Lived in 3rd century AD - His parents were Christian - Later lived in Palestine - Became a Roman soldier - Protested against Rome's persecution of Christians - Imprisoned and tortured, but stayed true to his faith - Beheaded at Lydda in Palestine - 23rd April was named as Saint George's day in 1222 Patron saint He is patron saint not only of England but also of Aragon, Catalonia, Georgia, Lithuania, Palestine, Portugal, Germany and Greece; and of Moscow, Istanbul, Genoa and Venice (second to Saint Mark). He's also patron saint of soldiers, archers, cavalry and chivalry, farmers and field workers, riders and saddlers, and he helps those suffering from leprosy, plague and syphilis. In recent years he has been adopted as patron saint of Scouts. | 5459) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 22 Apr 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Didn't i promise :) That's a We had better practice [this](http://www.know-britain.com/songs/land_of_hope_and_glory.html) too: [ ](http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/land-of-hope-and-glory) The version sung with such gusto at the Proms is actually only the second of the song's three stanzas, while the Ode originally had seven. I remember singing this at the Last Night of the Proms and that really is a magnificent experience. The song has been criticised by various antisocial wimps for being \"jingoistic.\" I think that one should see through the poetry into the heart of the message, just as with the American national anthem and its references to battle. It was sung at the coronation of King George V in 1911, when Britain owned about 70% of the world's merchant shipping fleet. In that context the language used seems in any case less unrealistic than it does today. On [this page](http://www.firstworldwar.com/audio/landofhopeandglory.htm) you can find a recording of Clara Butt singing it in 1911. A fine select Michael! Let's add this one; I vow to thee, my country, all earthly things above, Entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love: The love that asks no question, the love that stands the test, That lays upon the altar the dearest and the best; The love that never falters, the love that pays the price, The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice. And there's another country, I've heard of long ago, Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know; We may not count her armies, we may not see her King; Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering; And soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase, And her ways are ways of gentleness and all her paths are peace. | 5461) 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: But Chris, this is made by the crap Europeans and the \u00c3\u00c2\u00a3531,000 English florins will buy Euros.

I came across the above at www.realclimate.org after watching a lecture by David Archer on TVO Saturday afternoon. He is a prof at the University of Chicago.

This is all starting to remind me of the Spanish Inquisition and the Salem Witch Hunts. Franz Franz, this is just a wake up call to everybody to consider the ultimate question; How much is it worth to society to restrain CO2 emissions --- will that guarantee protection against global warming? How much are we prepared to 'combat' global warming, only to find it's a waste of money and resources which should have been spent on mitigating the effects of global warming? How sure are the scientists and what is the consequences of following their conclusions? We often see a picture of a child, the future generation we have to protect. But what if we spend so much on CO2 reducing schemes, when that money should have been spent, for example, on relocating schools and hospitals away from the coastal areas, where nothing we could have been done would have stopped the inevitable coastal flooding?

Sorry, i shoulda read the thread first. Captain America is killed! March 8, 2007 Captain America has undertaken his last mission \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac at least for now. The venerable superhero is killed in the issue of his namesake comic that hit stands yesterday, the New York Daily News reported. On the new edition's pages, a sniper shoots down the shield-wielding hero as he leaves a courthouse. It ends a long run for the stars-and-stripes-wearing character, created in 1941. Over the years, some 210 million copies of Captain America comic books, published by New York-based Marvel Entertainment Inc., have been sold in 75 countries. But resurrections are not unknown in the world of comics, and Marvel Entertainment editor in chief Joe Quesada said a Captain America comeback wasn't impossible. Still, the character's death came as a blow to co-creator Joe Simon. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We really need him now,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Simon, 93, who worked with artist Jack Kirby to devise Captain America as a foe for Adolf Hitler. In the comic-book universe, death is not always final. But even if Captain America turns out to have met his end in print, he may not disappear entirely: Marvel is developing a Captain America movie. Maybe we in Europe should have a Captain European Economic Union. You could draw him as a piffling bureaucratic squirt with brussel sprouts as his main weapon.

This fact is pretty much accepted by those who think global warming is a natural process, and those who think it's caused by man. In more recent history there has been: a mini ice age in the seventeenth century when the Thames froze so solidly that fairs could regularly be held on the ice; a Medieval Warm Period, even balmier than today; and sunnier still was the so-called Holocene Maximum, which was the warmest period in the last 10,000 years. Those who think global warming is a natural process point to the fact that in the last 10,000 years, the warmest periods have happened well before humans started to produce large amounts of carbon dioxide. A detailed look at recent climate change reveals that the temperature rose prior to 1940 but unexpectedly dropped in the post-war economic boom, when carbon dioxide emissions rose dramatically. There is some evidence to suggest that the rise in carbon dioxide lags behind the temperature rise by 800 years and therefore can't be the cause of it. In the greenhouse model of global warming, heat from the sun's rays is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. If it weren't for these gases, Earth would be too cold for life. Greenhouse gases trap heat from the sun within the earth's atmosphere. This is the greenhouse effect. Traditional models predict that increasing concentrations of [greenhouse gases](http://test.channel4.com/science/microsites/U/ukweather2080/) lead to runaway heating. If greenhouse warming were happening, then scientists predict that the troposphere (the layer of the earth's atmosphere roughly 10-15km above us) should heat up faster than the surface of the planet, but data collected from satellites and weather balloons doesn't seem to support this. Those who think global warming is a natural process say that the troposphere is not heating up because man-made greenhouse gases are not causing the planet to heat up. For some people, the final nail in the coffin of human-produced greenhouse gas theories is the fact that carbon dioxide is produced in far larger quantities by many natural means: human emissions are miniscule in comparison. Volcanic emissions and carbon dioxide from animals, bacteria, decaying vegetation and the ocean outweigh our own production several times over. Others would argue that carbon dioxide isn't the only greenhouse gas and that human emissions could tip up a finely balanced system. New evidence shows that that as the radiation coming from the sun varies (and sun-spot activity is one way of monitoring this) the earth seems to heat up or cool down. Solar activity very precisely matches the plot of temperature change over the last 100 years. It correlates well with the anomalous post-war temperature dip, when global carbon dioxide levels were rising. In fact, what is known of solar activity over the last several hundred years correlates very well with temperature. This is what some scientists are beginning to believe causes climate change. Others feel that solar activity only explains the fine details of temperature change. So how does the sun affect the earth's temperature? The process scientists suggest is that as earth moves through space, the atmosphere is constantly bombarded by ever-present cosmic rays. As these particles hit water vapour evaporating from the oceans, clouds form in the atmosphere. Clouds shield Earth from some of the sun's radiation and have a cooling effect. When solar activity is high, there is an increase in solar wind and this has the effect of reducing the amount of cosmic radiation which reaches Earth. When less cosmic radiation reaches Earth, fewer clouds form and the full effects of the sun's radiation heats the planet. But is the effect of solar activity really enough to explain away global warming caused by the greenhouse effect?

We all agree that global warming is happening, we can all see the consequences if it. But there may be more than one cause. I'll watch the programme to see what they have to say before I comment further. Unlike many other people, I don't think that global warming is \"fun\" nor is it \"entertaining\". It's a serious issue that needs to be addressed. All respect to you on this one Chris. I for one can laugh and joke and ridicule, as is the option of anyone in a democracy - but I have supplied the scientists with oodles of WUs - Climateprediction.net CPDN, BBC CPDN, Seasonal Attribution SAP CPDN, and Climateprediction.net Beta - a total of 344091.98 credits so far and I'm piling a stack of WUs that way right now. Talking and arguing about it is fine, but what about doing something about it? I take my empty bottles to the recycling bin, drive a tiny car, and give scientists WU material to confirm what is going on and whether polar bears are really going to die out and whether we all are if we continue to ignore the warnings.

Yes a telescope views things upside down, but my camera was attached to the 'scope upside down, so the photo came out the right way up.

From todays UK Sunday Express GLOBAL WARMING ALL HOT AIR? The global warmimg bullies have had their day. For years they have blamed ordinary folk for just about every environmental disaster known to man. They say the world is overheating because of the way we live, and governments around the world have paid tens of millions of ponnds to hammer home the message. But now, at last, the truth is out. A group of eminent scientists have made a television programme that shows how the \"greens\" have got it wrong. Yes, the world is heating up, but solar activity is to blame, not man. Pollution is bad and we must stop it, but let's be sure of our facts before we allow batteries of scientifically ignorant politicians, to raise more taxes to stabilise the climate. Watch the programme on Channel 4 on thursday - you'll be amazed. Greenhouse effect is seen as a religion, and if you don't agree, you are a heretic. But scientists may become more open minded and more questioning.

The growth of all flora occurs in the summer thawed layer above the permafrost known as the active layer. This layer can be from several inches to 12 ft. deep. Permafrost is just what it sounds like, \"permanently frozen\" solid. It would be like trying to sprout and then grow something on an ice cube in your freezer. It just ain't gonna happen. OK, but there are very hard cold bits of earth where trees grow, on the edges of the Siberian tundra, and as global warming thaws out the frozen soil further down below them and around them (the permafrost soils), the trees are tilting as the ground becomes wetter and soggier. Apparently. But it's a while since I was last in Siberia.

The man told his wife to carry on with the shopping while he fixed the car in the lot. The wife returned later to see a small group of people near the car. On closer inspection, she saw a pair of male legs protruding from under the chassis. Although the man was in shorts, his lack of underpants turned private parts into glaringly public ones. Unable to stand the embarrassment, she dutifully stepped forward, quickly put her hand up his shorts, and tucked everything back into place.

Ebay has helped my seti team by upgrading all my old p3 600s and 537cels to 933mhz and 1000mhz. And now I just upgraded my slowest p4(1.5), to 2.2ghz. I doubled my cache and got a newer core along with 700mhz. The p3 upgrades were about 9 dollars with shipping - real cheap. The p4 cost me a total of 60. I had to by some gel for the heat sink which is included in that total. I've also purchased 3 of my computers used off of ebay that are core pieces of my seti team. I'm thinking about upgrading my amd 2.0ghz(2800 xp) to a 3200xp(2.2ghz), but the price is too high. Maybe in a year. Anyway, if you have any ebay stories or bettter yet ebay related setiathome upgrades please share. Thanks, Christopher. So long as you're not helping out the fencing too much, that's great Christopher. I've been lucky enough to buy some unwanted XD memory cards for my digital camera, but pretty soon they're unwanted again since I can now buy much bigger capacity at a fraction of the price. That's the way it goes I suppose. Now I feel guilty that I've made those cards unwanted again.

There is a lot of unnecessary movement of goods, the transporation of which adds to global warming via all the pollutants produced by the trucks, planes etc. In the UK we import about as many potatoes as we export. But supply and demand due to surplus here, and a shortage during non-potato growing periods makes this happen, as well as the fact the we choose different types. This applies not only to potatoes, but if you didn't demand 'foreign' potatoes and tried to buy locally, we would affect supply and demand and help out with global warming. The unnecessary movement also applies to people. Modernization is leading to all sorts of things, animals and people being moved around in vehicles that emit greenhouse gases.

Greenpeace have identified some opportunities as Israel takes \"a significant step today towards becoming a solar-leader\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2; February 21, 2007, Tel Aviv, Israel \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac Greenpeace welcomes the announcement today from the Ministry of Infrastructure that the proposed solar power plant in Eshalim, originally proposed in 2001, will finally be put out to tender to private contractors. Greenpeace Mediterranean has led the campaign for renewable energy power plants to be constructed in the region. In 2005, the organization submitted a report to the Ministry of Infrastructure, which proved that the construction of solar power stations would generate a profit of NIS 810 million annually, would create 5,000 new jobs, and would turn Israel into a world leader in the export of renewable technology to help combat climate change. The decision today is a good first step in this direction. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Greenpeace welcomes this positive announcement by the Ministry of Infrastructure, to finally build a first solar plant.

Notably, the plan takes into account rapid economic growth areas such as China, India and Africa, and highlights the economic advantages of the energy revolution scenario. It concludes that renewable energies will represent the backbone of the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s economy. The energy blueprint for the Middle East concludes, that 36% of the region\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s electricity needs in the year 2050 could be produced by solar thermal power plants, while on the global level 9% of the required electricity would be produced by this technology. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The decision from the Israeli Government comes as the world is crying out for a plan on how to tackle the dilemma of how to provide the power we need, without fueling climate change,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Sven Teske, Climate & Energy Campaigner, Greenpeace International. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We welcome this project and urge all Governments of the \"sunbelt regions\" to invest in solar thermal power stations.\" by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: It is now past 19:00 UTC.

The call for unity among the 27-nation bloc was made by the UK Environment Secretary, David Miliband, and his Spanish and Slovenian counterparts. Failure to act would threaten efforts to get nations such as the US and China to agree to cap emissions, they said. Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said: \"I urge the rest of the developed world to follow our lead, match our reductions and accelerate progress towards an international agreement on the global emission reductions.\" [read 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: A nerd is someone whose life revolved around computers and technology.

Thanks Matthew Love The email address you use when you attach to your BOINC projects must be identical - this is the basis of the 'key' that BOINCstats uses to combine your stats. You can use a different name in different projects, which BOINCstats will combine, eg, iX/Ice/Macaroon (if those were 3 different names I had used in different projects, but using the same email address for all). It's worth noting that there is a delay in a change to your name or stats before it being represented in your BOINCstats image. That is, you may need to wait a few days before a name change is reflected. | 5897) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Posted 17 Feb 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: All the best to the Melbourne Victory in their A-League Grand Final...

Programs often format the number into a dotted decimal notation such as 192.0.2.0. Each byte is a number between 0 and 255. An IPv6 address is 128 bits, usually written as eight groups of four hexadecimal characters, such as 2001:DB8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/32.

ASNs enable an autonomous system to exchange routing information with neighboring autonomous systems. ASNs are currently 16-bit numbers, providing 65,535 unique ASNs.

In a speech in Rio de Janeiro, President Lula said it was time for wealthy countries to do more to reduce gas emissions. He called on them to stop preaching on what to do with the Amazon rainforest. President Lula said developed nations applied a double standard in their approach to global warming. The Brazilian president has accused wealthy countries of not doing enough on the environment before, but he has rarely been this direct. He said they were skilful at drafting agreements and protocols, like the Kyoto treaty, to appear as if they were doing something to reverse dangerous gas emissions. In practice, however, he said the results proved otherwise. 'World leader' President Lula was most adamant on the issue of deforestation. Developed countries, he said, had nothing to teach Brazil on the subject, adding that his country had reduced the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest by more than 50% in the last three years. This was something which should serve as a lesson to developed countries, which in his words, had already deforested everything under their control. On the subject of alternative fuels, President Lula described Brazil as a world leader. And indeed the South American country is the world's largest producer of ethanol made from sugar cane and it has the world's largest fleet of cars that run on alternative fuels. The Brazilian president said he would be leading an international campaign to highlight the need for wealthy countries to reduce gas emissions. His comments come a day after the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told a UN conference on the environment that the world's poor, who are the least responsible for global warming, will suffer the most from the effects of climate change.\" | Feb 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I'm sure there must be some keen gardeners out there.

I thought you had decided to stick with the \"vac-o-bag\", not the 2nd plane following the 1st. If you decide to go with the plane, why not go with a car on the freeway following every other car? One for one, we could clean up every cars emissions, of course then we would have to send a car after our \"vac-o-car\" because it too is expelling emissions, so we could really clog the freeways, or the airways with this idea. I think you are back to a carry-on tank and capturing your own emissions. I'm a little ahead of you mikey. I'm doing 2 things; 1 - clean up emissions as they are are expelled (a car collects it's own emissions as it drives along, a plane collects it's own emissions as it flies along, etc, etc). 2 - I am sending up planes to collect all the CO2 that is already up there in the atmosphere. If we don't clean that up, the Earth will still carry on warming up, no matter how much we reduce emissions from today onwards.

Once we've cracked that little problem we can then go ahead with sky trawling.

This is sure to save some more billions of tonnes of CO2 being put into the atmosphere. Singing can stop for a start. Singers breath far too much. And so do athletes; boxers, football and ice-hockey players etc - all that must stop at once. Marathon runners must become couch potatoes and all forms of Olympics must cease immediately.

Not cost effective. The competition is not about being cost effective. It is about removing one billion tonnes of carbon gases a year for ten years. In my fist idea I suggested aircraft (and car) exhaust could be collected for processing and storage underground in the usual way. This way we could fly as much as we like, and, with an appropriate car bag, drive as many fuel guzzlers as we want. \"Vac and go\" if you like, of should it be \"Go and vac\" - fly/drive as you vac it all up behind you. That would remove more than one billion tonnes of carbon gases a year. The $25 million is mine! But if you pollute in the process, what's the point? You would have to \"go and vac\" from the second plane/vehicle/whatever making it much less cost effective to operate, thus using the limited available energy at a much faster rate. What's the point of the exercise then? To save the planet? For what, there is no energy left in it, your plan used it all up cleaning the Planet up. I believe Branson said the whole point of the exercise was so his kids and grandkids would have a nice place to live. With all available energy resources depleted cleaning the Planet who would want to live here? In this case I see the cure being as bad as the disease. We killed the cancer but lost the patient. Yes, I take your point. But forget the second idea of a second aircraft or a second car to chase the first to clean up. My initial (one and only) idea was a way to capture all the exhaust from an aircraft or a car as it was flying/driving along. Imagine a steam train with steam belching from it's chimney - but adding a condenser which would turn the steam to water and collect it back in it's water tank (Hey I should have been there with Stevenson to help him with that one). In the same way the exhaust would be captured, 99.9% of it let go and the 0.1% which is CO2 retained in a small box beside the rear toilet on an aircraft or next the the gas tank in a car, and then emptied for storage under ground. Thus removing billions of tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere. Hey, at least it's an idea that will work - it just needs the technology applied to make it happen. As for whether energy resources are being depleted and inefficiently used - that is another argument. That argument was ALWAYS there, global warming or or not. That fact the we all have ALWAYS been disgracefully wasteful with energy has always been the case before we even realized that we were killing the planet. But whether we are or not, we can be a little more respectful of mother natures resources, don't you think? My ideas says if you must fly and personally put 3 tonnes of CO2 in the atmosphere every time you do, or if you must drive gas guzzlers and belch CO2 into the atmosphere, at least my 'invention' can clean up after you. We still (most of us) live in democracies and are free to fly and drive whatever we like (even with increasing 'green' taxes), but we either stop the emissions (they say no more must be put into the atmosphere, and some say that a lot of CO2 already there must be taken out), or we clean up, as we pollute, vacuum it all up as we go along - \"Go and vac\". | Posted 10 Feb 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I'll tell you one thing...his airline really sucks. I've flown Virgin Atlantic twice rount trip to England in the last year, and only because Virgin was the only one that flew non-stop. Crappy food even by airline standards and the cabin crew are the rudest in the industry. Even American Airlines gives you a 33\" pitch in economy, whereas Virgin gives you only 31\". They pack you in like sardines, and the planes are dirty. Sir Branson is a showman for sure, but once his interest wanes, he could care less and lets the CFO's run the show. BTW, he made a big thing about having his planes towed to the taxi way to reduce jet engine emissions, but they never did that the last two flights I took with them. Ideas are one thing, but if they aren't implimented, then they are just so much PR and nothing more. If he want to toss his money around that is his own business and perogetive. I flew Virgin just once and would rate them as average/OK. I've flown a fair bit in my time and have never come across any rude cabin staff - but then I've been in the airline industry and perhaps see them differently because \"I'm one of them\". Your point about towing the planes is interesting. This could save an awful lot of CO2 emissions if all airports did it. But unfortunately that is the point - the airlines do not own the airports or the facilities provided. Tow trucks, baggage handling, where planes dock and their wait for a stand, wait for the cleaners, etc. etc are not theirs to control. If Branson wants a tow truck, and there aren't any, or British Airways have done the dirty on him again and bullied the airport into grabbing them all for their airline, then don't blame Branson - blame Misfit!

Some climate scientists were predicting \"another ice age\" in the next 100 years, Lord Lawson added, but even if temperatures were going up there was little mankind could do about it.

Depending on the speed of your link this could be less than a minute in either case. If your CPU has one processor (not hyper threading or dual core) and you are processing one WU at a time, it usual for your BOINC manager to download a WU, and then to download another just before it's finished, so that the next can start as soon as the previous is finished. When it downloads the next WU you will see it under the transfer tab for as long as it takes to download and then you'll see nothing. When a WU is finished you will see it as uploading under the transfer tab, be designated as ready to report, and then when scheduled it will upload the reported results.

In some areas where change might be expected, however, nothing much seems to be happening.

It is the speed at which climate changes are happening that convince me that they are man made. I have one criticism of the IPCC report: it underestimates the N2O emission provoked by catalytic converters in cars and trucks. I have downloaded an EPA report in 2000 that says that from 1992 to 1997 the emission rate of CO2 was constant, the emission rate of CH4 diminished slightly, while the emission rate of N2O increased by 34%, and it linked it to the widespread use of catalytic converters in cars. And N2O is 300 times more efficient than CO2 in producing global warming, from the same report. Tullio It struck me that until recently that it seemed that the debate was all about whether there 'was' climate change with many seemingly impervious to all the evidence. Now it seems to be about proving that it is man-made before certain people are prepared to do anything about it, or to accept that humans can have an affect as to whether climate change gets worse or not. The important thing must be to assess: 1..Do we have a climate problem or not? 2..Is it man made? If not, trying to reduce CO2 is a waste of time. 3..If it is man made, what can we do to stop it, slow it down, or get around it, or should we adjust to it (eg, move cities to higher ground)? 4..Should we sit tight and do nothing at all because there is not enough evidence and the scientists are still arguing about it? 5..How come in the UK I have to mow my lawn in February for the first time I can remember?

High-income groups, whose emissions were twice the national average, would absorb any price increase rather than change their travel habits, it said. Researchers from Oxford University said the data revealed how socio-economic factors shaped how people travelled. They said targeted measures, such as personal carbon credits, were more likely to influence people's behaviour. The findings have been published on the day that the Air Passenger Duty on UK flights is doubled; part of the environmental measures outlined by Chancellor Gordon Brown last December. In their report, the authors questioned the effectiveness of \"moderate\" tax hikes: \"The most conclusive evidence from this study has been the relationship between income and emissions. \"For example, less direct or modestly used fiscal instruments such as moderate petrol or aviation fuel-price increases are less likely to have an effect on the more wealthy sub-sector of the travelling community.\" Highest emitters They suggest that targeted measures, such as awareness campaigns aimed at high emitters or leisure flights, or personal carbon credits would be more effective ways to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

It warns that if residents do not cut water consumption by more than 50% over the next 20 years, the city will become unsustainable. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation report also warns that temperatures could rise 5C above the predicted global average. This would leave the city facing an almost permanent state of drought. Rise in heat-related deaths With its spectacular harbour and beautiful suburban beaches, Sydney is often portrayed as one of the most desirable cities to live in. But this report paints a disturbing picture of how life here could be completely transformed by the year 2070, if climate change goes unchecked. It warns of severe droughts nine out of every 10 years, a dramatic rise in the number of bush fires, and freak storm surges which could devastate the coastline. Scientists predict that rainfall will fall by 40% by 2070, not only creating a massive water crisis, but producing double the number of bush fires. Heat-related deaths would soar from a current average of 176 a year to 1,300. Sydney would come to resemble the harsh, dry and inhospitable conditions of remote inland towns. The government of New South Wales, which commissioned the report, has been alarmed by its findings. The state premier called it a doomsday scenario, but one which the city and country had to confront. Along with America, Australia has refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol, the only two major industrialised nations to do so. | 6044) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : Part Deux!](forum_thread.php?id=37423) ( 511449](forum_thread.php?id=37423&postid=511449)) Posted 1 Feb 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: [Bad News for Global Warming Alarmists](http://www.dailytech.com/Bad+News+for+Global+Warming+Alarmists/article5914.htm) Michael Asher, January 30, 2007 The Climate Debate turns ugly It's been a bad year for Global Warming Alarmists. Researchers are finding more and more evidence of natural warming events in the earth's past, events that were far more rapid and dramatic than first thought. Several scientists, disgusted with the media's refusal to carry their mesage accurately, have begun writing letters and books. Even the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has long been the most vocal supporter of climate alarmism, has finished its Fourth Assessment report, which lowers worst case estimates sharply, and cuts in half long-term predictions for sea level rise. Evidence of the beneficial aspects of continues to mount, with arctic seal populations increasing, longer growing seasons, and less extreme temperature swings. Is it any wonder environmentalists are getting even more emotional in the debate? In public, they state they simply want \"truth to out,\" but the reality is a bit different. Recently, Weather Channel host Heidi Cullen made a strong bid to silence the opposition, calling for the removal of AMS certification for meteorologists who challenged the belief in catastrophic human-induced global warming. In it, she compared global warming denial to \"going on air and saying that hurricanes rotate clockwise,\" apparently herself unaware that in the southern hemisphere hurricanes do indeed rotate in this direction. Cullen's statement immediately provoked outrage from meteorologists around the nation, with one of them angrily proclaiming, \"I don't know a single meteorologist who buys into the man-made global warming hype.\" Heidi Cullen gained earlier fame for hosting environmental writer David Roberts, who openly called for Nuremberg-style war crimes trials (complete with death sentences) for any scientist brave enough to dispute the public hysteria on global warming. How's that for support of scientific truth and free speech? In the past, reporters just hung up on scientists who didn't agree with their beliefs ... now they want to lynch them! Luckily, its not yet illegal to research the true causes of global warming. Late last year, atmospheric physicist S. Fred Singer released his book, Unstoppable Global Warming (Every 1500 Years), detailing the current warming trend's correspondence with a natural 1500-year cycle. Singer notes that most of the current warming ocurred before 1940, and thus before the majority of man's CO2 emissions. He further notes that, since 1940, the earth experienced one 30-year long cooling trend, followed by a 30-year warming trend...both of which were much smaller than the warming right after 1900. Singer's documenting of 600 past historical events of rapid warming further supports his views. Also, Danish Physicist Henrik Svensmark has a book coming out next month: The Chilling Stars: A New Theory of Climate Change. In it, he details his research on cosmic radiation-induced atmospheric cloud formation. Svensmark points out that already-observed changes in solar flux act to reduce cloud cover, and thus cause the earth to reflect less solar radiation back into space. This quite obviously causes a moderate degree of warming...just as we've seen. Is global warming a man-made danger ... or a part of a natural cycle? More and more scientiests are leaning to the latter. Will the media be brave enough to report their research, or will public hysteria win the day? | 6045) [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Any bids?

The focus was a bit hit and miss since I'm focusing the telescope as best as I can, and cranking up the optical zoom on the digital camera until the moon nearly fills the camera screen so that I can see it's sort-of in focus (there is no separate viewer) and hoped the auto-stabilizer would compensate from my shakes as I held camera to 'scope and clicked. And then the lousy tripod kept shaking every time I touched the telescope, and the computerized motor is no longer working properly so I had to turn it off and manually try to point the thing, for which it isn't designed to do.

I've already said they are going backwards and making the world's climate change problem worse as we speak. (And please don't ask what \"I\" am going to do - this micro decision making for individuals means squat if China continues) Their current plans call for the opening of a new power station every week, most of them coal-fired. Yes, I'll say it again. ONE NEW POWER STATION EVERY WEEK from here till eternity. For those that like graphs go and argue this one out with China; How much CO2 do you think this lot will put into the atmosphere? How is China, or any newly developing Industrial Country, going to afford anything BUT Coal or Oil fired power plants? They have no money coming in until they develop their Country. Farms do not pay enough taxes to pay for Nuclear power plants! Solar power plants, absolutely ridiculous! Wind power you say, not reliable enough to be the sole supplier. So what does a Country do to provide power so Companies can be formed and built to provide those taxes required to be fancy dancy power plants that then actually provide power and reduce the overall output of emissions? Climate Change is a FACT! China is aware of that fact, the problem is they do not have enough money to pay for \"one new power station a week\" that is of the non-polluting type! 100 years from now, they absolutely could, IF they started banking the money required. The US, and the UK, could too IF they started banking the money required. Right now the money is required elsewhere, the Politicians have pork barrels to fill! You are illustrating the difficulty in finding a solution, let alone agreeing on what Climate Change is and what is causing it. Perhaps the questions should be different. Perhaps if we knew 150 years ago what burning all that coal/oil would do, then would we have gone ahead and industrialized? If the answer is \"yes\", then we would have known that China, Mexico, India and others would also want to industrialize. If \"no\", then we agree we did wrong and must pay to get the planet out of this mess. We cannot now stop China etc, just by saying so, and we cannot put our heads in the sand and pretend it's not our problem, because we industrialized and put all that muck in the atmosphere. We have already caused Climate Change - others like China are making it worse to deal with. Therefore we have to pay for China to get clean energy sources to enable them to industrialize cleanly. If not, we all go down the Climate Change plug together. And face the prospect of WW3 as we squabble over the dwindling energy reserves as coal, oil and gas all gets used up. | 6060) |[Message Jan 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Ice, another thing you might run past them is buying a day.

The report, by ACNielsen of more than 25,000 Internet users, showed that 57 percent of people around the world considered global warming a \"very serious problem\" and a further 34 percent rated it a \"serious problem.\" \"It has taken extreme and life-threatening weather patterns to finally drive the message home that global warming is happening and is here to stay unless a concerted, global effort is made to reverse it,\" said Patrick Dodd, the President of ACNielsen Europe People in Latin America were most worried while U.S. citizens were least concerned with just 42 percent rating global warming \"very serious.\" The United States emits about a quarter of all greenhouse gases, the biggest emitter ahead of China, Russia and India. Thirteen percent of U.S. citizens said they had never heard or read anything about global warming, the survey said. Almost all climate scientists say that temperatures are creeping higher because of heat-trapping greenhouse gases released by burning fossil fuels. The study also found that 91 percent of people had heard about global warming and 50 percent reckoned it was caused by human activities. A U.N. report due on Friday is set to say it is at least 90 percent probable that human activities are the main cause of warming in the past 50 years. People in China and Brazil were most convinced of the link to human activities and Americans least convinced. The survey said that people living in regions vulnerable to natural disasters seemed most concerned -- ranging from Latin Americans worried by damage to coffee or banana crops to people in the Czech Republic whose country was hit by 2002 floods. In Latin America, 96 percent of respondents said they had heard of global warming and 75 percent rated it \"very serious.\" Most industrial nations have signed up for the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol, which imposed caps on emissions of greenhouse gases, mainly from factories, power plants and vehicles.

That'll save the planet for sure. Well, it sounds like a bucket load more than you've done. Tell us iX, Ice, Sir Beekeeper...., what are doing about it? (yes pissing contest starts now ;) ) I anticipated that question. But then I've been anticipating it for nearly a year now since I started crunching BOINC climate change last March. Crunching seemed very useful at the time, and it saddens me that there are still crunchers who want medals for running their PCs 24/7 but do little else than spout on about what others should do (not directed at you in any way Gas Giant). I've done some things, and also a lot of thinking like you; I've thought about getting solar panels on the roof, a wind turbine (there are major DIY outlets in they UK that now sell them). I've insulated my loft properly, I turn my TV off rather than on standby, I recycle, I compost rather than buy more compost/fertilizers from garden centers, I try to buy local produce, I run a small car, but only to get to work and essentials like going to the cinema. I do ride a bike, but for fitness rather than to get to anywhere in particular. I've written to my MP on a few occasions now. I joined Greenpeace and wrote letters to UK companies about energy use. I return to the CPDN climate forum from time to time and bug them with questions, like \"what is the evidence?\" and debate the value of a polar bear. In short, I do what I can to reduce my energy requirement and make an effort to reduce my carbon footprint, and lobby my MP and industrialists. Last and not least I do my bit to keep the debate going. It's easy to agree, harder to challenge and play the proverbial devil's advocate. I can't remember the last time I pissed in a bucket, but heck, if that will solve a problem I'm up for it. | 6071) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 29 Jan 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: [Frozen sea may harbour Mars life](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6310173.stm) A frozen sea found on Mars is one of the most promising places to look for life on the Red Planet, scientists say. But planned missions designed to search for microbes below the Martian surface will not drill deep enough to find living cells, the UK team has said. Researchers at University College London say that microbes in the first couple of metres of Martian soil would be killed off by intense radiation. Life might survive deeper down, where conditions are more benign, they think. But these depths were beyond the reach of drills envisaged for missions to Mars, said Lewis Dartnell, from UCL's Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences & Experimental Biology (Complex). These missions - such as Europe's ExoMars rover - could find hints that life once existed there - such as proteins, DNA fragments or fossils, explained Mr Dartnell; and that \"would be a major discovery in itself\". But he added: \"The Holy Grail for astrobiologists is finding a living cell that we can warm up, feed nutrients and reawaken for study. \"It just isn't plausible that dormant life is still surviving in the near-subsurface of Mars - within the first couple of metres below the surface - in the face of the ionizing radiation field. \"Finding life on Mars depends on liquid water surfacing on Mars, but the last time liquid water was widespread on Mars was billions of years ago.\" Read the full BBC News item [here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6310173.stm) | 6072) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) Part Deux!](forum_thread.php?id=37423) ( [Message 510491](forum_thread.php?id=37423&postid=510491)) Posted 29 Jan 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Glaciers melt, climate talks open Three photographs, taken in 1912, 1968 and 2003, show how a glacier at Vernagtferner in Austria has shrunk.

While of course that is true (people act economically in their own best interests, notice that's what China, India, Russia and Mexico did--opted out) total emissions is a zero sum game--it doesn't matter who emits what if total emissions aren't cut. With China becoming number 1 and quickly dwarfing the U.S., and with 3, 4, and 11 not cutting, total emissions continue to rise. Which means that whatever predictions come to pass will come to pass regardless of what we spend. In other words, that's a waste of resources. As an aside, China's GDP per capita in 2005 was about $7.2K, the United States' GDP was about $43.K per capita. As it stands today, they're second in emissions right NOW with a per capita GDP seven times LESS than the U.S. However, they have a population population 4-5 times the size of the U.S. You want to cut total emissions, you're going to have to absolutely crush China's economic expansion. Hey, lets sign another piece of paper! We'll all feel better about ourselves because we did something. How are you going to crush China's economic expansion? I've already said they are going backwards and making the world's climate change problem worse as we speak.

But action by individual countries is not enough. Each country, however large, is just a part of the problem. It is essential to create a shared international vision of long-term goals, and to build the international frameworks that will help each country to play its part in meeting these common goals. Key elements of future international frameworks should include: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 Emissions trading: Expanding and linking the growing number of emissions trading schemes around the world is a powerful way to promote cost-effective reductions in emissions and to bring forward action in developing countries: strong targets in rich countries could drive flows amounting to tens of illions of dollars each year to support the transition to low-carbon development paths. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 Technology cooperation: Informal co-ordination as well as formal agreements can boost the effectiveness of investments in innovation around the world. Globally, support for energy R&D should at least double, and support for the deployment of new low-carbon technologies should increase up to five-fold. International cooperation on product standards is a powerful way to boost energy efficiency. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 Action to reduce deforestation: The loss of natural forests around the world contributes more to global emissions each year than the transport sector. Curbing deforestation is a highly cost-effective way to reduce emissions; largescale international pilot programmes to explore the best ways to do this could get underway very quickly. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 Adaptation: The poorest countries are most vulnerable to climate change. It is essential that climate change be fully integrated into development policy, and that rich countries honour their pledges to increase support through overseas development assistance. International funding should also support improved regional information on climate change impacts, and research into new crop varieties that will be more resilient to drought and flood. | 6094) |[Message [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Whatcha think? These ideas work really well in Second Life and whatnot, in fact, several gov'ts have been sniffing around taxing these sorts of transactions. A) If you support gov't, you've gotta be thrilled that they want to start taking what you earn on-line. B) More importantly, with some further refinement, Ice, you could probably fund SETI@Home quite nicely. Very nice idea. You'd need to get them on board to set up the the central clearing house to handle the transfer of credits. Sort of like the CBOT does for commodities. Come up with some awards for x numbers of credits. Lowracs could buy them from hiracs to earn stars, or moderator for a day status, or user of the day. Maybe a \"Supporter of the Day,\" in addition to the user of the day. Whatever. But then you've got pinko-central (Berkeley) involved. That portends doom for a credit trading system, regardless of the upside for SETI@Home. It is worth considering. We are simply talking about people making a donation to SETI@Home, on an indication that if x credits were donated by others, they could have them transferred from others accounts to theirs. It would all be anonymous. I would indicate that I has happy to donate 10,000 credits, by sending an email to setiadmin perhaps. End of story for me until I see my total reduced by 10,000 - but I would not know who got them. You would send SETI@home a donation of $xx and indicate that you would like 10,000 credits if they are available. SETI@home have already banked your $xx donation, and will credit you with 10,000 credits as and when they are donated. The credits remain the same in the system, donations are made as they are currently made so no tax issues apply; with a comment made in the appropriate comment field if credits are wanted. You get to show off more credits, I show less, but am happy to see SETI@home get the donations they are looking for.

First we need to set up a beer kitty. We'll worry about how/where later. Next, we get SETI@home to implement a Credit Trading Scheme (CTS). People can donate credits to others in this scheme. To receive 1,000 credits from somebody else, you have to donate $10 to SETI@home.

You are of course suggesting that people make rational choices, and choices that they think are good for them. For example, I will choose to do this stupid thing that loses my company heaps of money because my boss is an idiot and will like my choice because, despite the dire consequences for the company, he gets to have a free holiday. Another example is a minister of the church asking a congregation to repent or go they will go to Hell. And retire and leave it at that. I expect he wouldn't accept people were rational or 'right thinking' enough and have to do a little more to influence them. Because that is what it's all about. Influence China, Mexico and India to pay their way, so that \"we\" in the Europe and USA don't have to pay so much. Yes, economics again, but economics of the worse kind - trying to offload the cost so that we can enjoy our fat living style without worrying so much about the pollution we are causing.

There is no doubt that there is a climate problem, and there is no doubt that many scientists are pointing to the view that man is influencing climate change. While the indicators are still strong, there is still not irreputable proof. This is one of the reasons why many countries, including USA, have been slow to act. It is obvious that black holes exist and do this and that - but is it? There are certain things we cannot prove, just potulate about. We do not even know what lies on the floor of out deepest oceans, and neither do we know what is really happening at the upper levels of our atmosphere. However, we can look at what evidence there is and and we can influence the best way we can. And this does not mean making statements about 'sound policy' which is at the behest of government nonsense. At least governments are starting to take note and acknowledge what could be a very serious problem. [China admits to climate failings](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6306881.stm). However, it just shows that China is going backwards - making things worse. So how are you going to get the Chinese to accept 'facts' when they are simply interested in economic growth and grabbing what they can like the West did in their periods of economic growth? It's all very well for you to sit their in your fancy house and fancy cars with fancy holidays burning tonnes of CO2 every time you fly - and then telling China it mustn't have all thees things because the West is already killing the planet but doing nothing about it.

A tax is unlikely because of America's aversion to that three-letter word. Given that, it should go for a tough cap-and-trade system. In doing so, it can usefully learn from Europe's experience. First, get good data. Europe failed to do so: companies were given too many permits, and emissions have therefore not fallen. Second, auction permits (which are, in effect, money) rather than giving them away free. Europe gave them away, which allowed polluters to make windfall profits. This will be a huge fight; for, if the federal government did what the Europeans did, it would hand out $40 billion-50 billion in permits. Third, set a long time-horizon. Europeans do not know whether carbon emissions will still be constrained after 2012, when Kyoto runs out. Since most clean-energy projects have a payback period of more than five years, the system thus fails to encourage green investment. It's interesting that America now, after positive stalling, has decided to acknowledge Climate Change and is starting by criticizing Europe's efforts. Europe started taking it's responsibilities seriously some years ago, but now that the USA has started to act it simply belittles Europe's efforts and starts with a \"What a mess you made, we can obviously do better\". No, the USA should be saying \"We are idiots for not starting yet and leaving the Climate Change problem unaddressed for so long and we'll screw up like we screw everything up\". by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Michelle Yeoh, who played Chinese agent Wai lin on the Bond film Tommorrow never dies.

The report: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00cbEnergy [R]evolution: A sustainable World Energy Outlook\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2, produced by the European Renewable Energy Council (EREC) and Greenpeace International, provides a practical blueprint for how to cut global CO2 emissions by almost 50% within the next 43 years, whilst providing a secure and affordable energy supply and, critically, maintaining steady worldwide economic development. Notably, the plan takes into account rapid economic growth areas such as China, India and Africa, and highlights the economic advantages of the energy revolution scenario. It concludes that renewable energies will represent the backbone of the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s economy \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac not only in OECD countries, but also in developing countries such as China, India and Brazil. The plan states that renewable energies have the potential to deliver nearly 70% of global electricity supply and 65% of global heat supply by 2050. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The Energy Revolution scenario comes as the world is crying out for a roadmap for tackling the dilemma of how to provide the power we all need, without fuelling climate change,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Sven Teske energy expert of Greenpeace International. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We have shown that the world can have safe, robust renewable energy, that we can achieve the efficiencies needed and we can do all this whilst enjoying global economic growth and phasing out damaging and dangerous sources such as coal and nuclear, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\" he continued. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Renewable energies are competitive, if governments phase-out subsidies for fossil and nuclear fuels and introduce the `polluter-pays principle`. We urge politicians to ban those subsidies by 2010.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 However, the report also highlights the short time window for making the key decisions in energy infrastructure, which will have to be made by governments, investment institutions and utility companies. Within the next decade, many of the existing power plants in the OECD countries will come to the end of their technical lifetime and will need to be replaced, whilst developing countries such as China, India and Brazil are rapidly building up new energy infrastructure to service their growing economies. Arthouros Zervos, president of the European Renewable Energy Industry Council (EREC) said: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The global market for renewable energy can grow at a double digit rate till 2050, and achieve the size of today\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s fossil fuel industry. Wind and solar markets, already worth US$ 38 billion, are doubling in size every three years. We therefore call on decision makers around the world to make this vision a reality. The political choices of the coming years will determine the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s environmental and economic situation for many decades to come. Renewable energy can and will have to play a leading role in the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s energy future. There is no technical but a political barrier to make this shift.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 The report was developed in conjunction with specialists from the Institute of Technical Thermodynamics at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and more than 30 scientists and engineers from universities, institutes and the renewable energy industry around the world. It provides the first comprehensive global energy concept which gives a detailed analysis of how to restructure the global energy system based only on a detailed regional assessment for the potential of proven renewable energy sources, energy efficiency and the utilisation of efficient, decentralised cogeneration. The Energy [R]evolution scenario is compared in the report to the effects on CO2 emissions (and, thereby climate change) of carrying on with a \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00cbbusiness as usual\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2 scenario, that scenario being provided by the International Energy Association\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s breakdown of 10 world regions, as used in the ongoing series of World Energy Outlook reports. A copy of the Energy [R]evolution: A Sustainable World Energy Outlook report can be downloaded at: [http://www.greenpeace.org/energyrevolution](http://www.greenpeace.org/energyrevolution) and [http://www.energyblueprint.info](http://www.energyblueprint.info) Notes: The Energy [R]evolution scenario describes a development pathway which transforms the present situation into a sustainable energy supply, within a single generation. Exploitation of the large energy efficiency potential will reduce primary energy demand from the current 435,000 PJ/a (Peta Joules per year) to 422,000 PJ/a by 2050. Under the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00cbbusiness as usual\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2 scenario there would be an increase to 810,000 PJ/a, and a quadrupling of electricity costs. This dramatic reduction is a crucial prerequisite for developing a significant share of renewable energy sources, compensating for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. 1. The report was commissioned by Greenpeace and EREC from the Department of Systems Analysis and Technology Assessment (Institute of Technical Thermodynamics) at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR). 2. The report develops a global sustainable energy pathway up to 2050. The future potential for renewable energy sources has been assessed with input from all sectors of the renewable energy industry around the world, and forms the basis of the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. 3. The energy supply scenarios adopted in this report, which both extend beyond and enhance projections by the International Energy Agency, have been calculated using the MESAP/PlaNet simulation model. This has then been further developed by the Ecofys consultancy to take into account the future potential for energy efficiency measures. 4. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario describes a development pathway which transforms the present situation into a sustainable energy supply through the following mechanisms: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 Exploitation of the large energy efficiency potential will reduce primary energy demand from the current 435,000 PJ/a (Peta Joules per year) to 422,000 PJ/a by 2050. Under the reference scenario there would be an increase to 810,000 PJ/a. This dramatic reduction is a crucial prerequisite for achieving a significant share of renewable energy sources, compensating for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 The increased use of combined heat and power generation (CHP) also improves the supply system\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s energy conversion efficiency, increasingly using natural gas and biomass. In the long term, decreasing demand for heat and the large potential for producing heat directly from renewable energy sources limits the further expansion of CHP. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 The electricity sector will be the pioneer of renewable energy utilisation. By 2050, around 70% of electricity will be produced from renewable energy sources, including large hydro. An installed capacity of 7,100 GW will produce 21,400 Terawatt hours per year (TWh/a) of electricity in 2050. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 In the heat supply sector, the contribution of renewables will increase to 65% by 2050. Fossil fuels will be increasingly replaced by more efficient modern technologies, in particular biomass, solar collectors and geothermal. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 Before biofuels can play a substantial role in the transport sector, the existing large efficiency potentials have to be exploited. In this study, biomass is primarily committed to stationary applications; the use of biofuels for transport is limited by the availability of sustainably grown biomass. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 By 2050, half of primary energy demand will be covered by renewable energy sources.

It's not just about the story, as you very well know in the debates we have had on these boards about Climate Change. It is about the spin that people put on the story to suite their own arguments. Back in October Blair, the UK Prime Minister, was specifically saying that the [Climate change fight 'can't wait'](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6096084.stm). He went on to make all sorts of arguments why it was a crisis and we should act now. Clearly, this is not what the Stern report said, and clearly Blair is leading us into another Iraq war blindfolded, except he doesn't care if it's Iraq or not this time so long as he misleads his country again. I am not saying there is no Climate Change problem, since you have to be a totally ingrowing toe nail if you can't see that Climate Change exists, but let's not be having these ridiculous extreme calls for action and to spend money when the evidence simply does not exist in the Stern Report or anywhere else to justify all this hype.

UK Prime Minister Tony Blair called it, \"the most important report on the future ever published by this government\". But expert critics of the review now claim that it overestimates the risk of severe global warming, and underestimates the cost of acting to stop it.\" The message from the report's chief author, the economist Sir Nicholas Stern, was simple: if we did nothing about climate change, it would cost us the equivalent of at least 5% of global GDP each year, now and forever. But if we acted today, we could prevent a catastrophe. These figures sounded scary and imminent. But if you read the report in detail, that is not what it actually says. The 5% damage to global GDP figure will not happen for well over one hundred years, according to Stern's predictions.

Upon her head a platted hive of straw, Which fortified her visage from the sun, Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw The carcase of a beauty spent and done. Time had not scythed all that youth begun, Nor youth all quit, but spite of heaven's fell rage Some beauty peeped through lattice of seared age. Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne, Which on it had conceited characters, Laund'ring the silken figures in the brine That seasoned woe had pelleted in tears, And often reading what contents it bears; As often shrieking undistinguished woe In clamours of all size, both high and low. Sometimes her levelled eyes their carriage ride As they did batt'ry to the spheres intend; Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied To th'orbed earth; sometimes they do extend Their view right on; anon their gazes lend To every place at once, and nowhere fixed, The mind and sight distractedly commixed. Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plait, Proclaimed in her a careless hand of pride; For some, untucked, descended her sheaved hat, Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside; Some in her threaden fillet still did bide, And, true to bondage, would not break from thence, Though slackly braided in loose negligence. A thousand favours from a maund she drew Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet, Which one by one she in a river threw, Upon whose weeping margent she was set; Like usury applying wet to wet, Or monarch's hands that lets not bounty fall Where want cries some, but where excess begs all. Of folded schedules had she many a one, Which she perused, sighed, tore, and gave the flood; Cracked many a ring of posied gold and bone, Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud; Found yet moe letters sadly penned in blood, With sleided silk feat and affectedly Enswathed and sealed to curious secrecy. These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes, And often kissed, and often 'gan to tear; Cried \"O false blood, thou register of lies, What unapproved witness dost thou bear! Ink would have seemed more black and damned here!\" This said, in top of rage the lines she rents, Big discontent so breaking their contents. A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh, Sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew Of court, of city, and had let go by The swiftest hours observed as they flew, Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew, And, privileged by age, desires to know In brief the grounds and motives of her woe. So slides he down upon his grained bat, And comely distant sits he by her side, When he again desires her, being sat, Her grievance with his hearing to divide. If that from him there may be aught applied Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage, 'Tis promised in the charity of age. \"Father,\" she says \"though in me you behold The injury of many a blasting hour, Let it not tell your judgement I am old: Not age, but sorrow over me hath power. I might as yet have been a spreading flower, Fresh to myself, if I had self-applied Love to myself, and to no love beside. \"But, woe is me! too early I attended A youthful suit -it was to gain my grace - O, one by nature's outwards so commended That maidens' eyes stuck over all his face. Love lacked a dwelling and made him her place; And when in his fair parts she did abide She was new-lodged and newly deified. \"His browny locks did hang in crooked curls, And every light occasion of the wind Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls. What's sweet to do, to do will aptly find: Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind, For on his visage was in little drawn What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn. \"Small show of man was yet upon his chin; His phoenix down began but to appear, Like unshorn velvet, on that termless skin, Whose bare outbragged the web it seemed to wear; Yet showed his visage by that cost more dear, And nice affections wavering stood in doubt If best were as it was, or best without. \"His qualities were beauteous as his form, For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free; Yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm As oft twixt May and April is to see, When winds breathe sweet, unruly though they be. His rudeness so with his authorized youth Did livery falseness in a pride of truth. \"Well could he ride, and often men would say `That horse his mettle from his rider takes: Proud of subjection, noble by the sway, What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!' And controversy hence a question takes, Whether the horse by him became his deed, Or he his manage by th' well-doing steed. \"But quickly on this side the verdict went: His real habitude gave life and grace To appertainings and to ornament, Accomplished in himself, not in his case. All aids, themselves made fairer by their place, Came for additions; yet their purposed trim Pieced not his grace, but were all graced by him. \"So on the tip of his subduing tongue All kind of arguments and question deep, All replication prompt, and reason strong, For his advantage still did wake and sleep. To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep, He had the dialect and different skill, Catching all passions in his craft of will, \"That he did in the general bosom reign Of young, of old, and sexes both enchanted, To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain In personal duty, following where he haunted. Consents bewitched, ere he desire, have granted, And dialogued for him what he would say, Asked their own wills, and made their wills obey. \"Many there were that did his picture get To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind; Like fools that in th'imagination set The goodly objects which abroad they find Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assigned, And labour in moe pleasures to bestow them Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them. \"So many have, that never touched his hand, Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart. My woeful self, that did in freedom stand, And was my own fee-simple, not in part, What with his art in youth, and youth in art, Threw my affections in his charmed power, Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower. \"Yet did I not, as some my equals did, Demand of him, nor being desired yielded; Finding myself in honour so forbid, With safest distance I mine honour shielded. Experience for me many bulwarks builded Of proofs new-bleeding, which remained the foil Of this false jewel and his amorous spoil. \"But ah, who ever shunned by precedent The destined ill she must herself assay? Or forced examples 'gainst her own content To put the by-past perils in her way? Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay, For when we rage, advice is often seen By blunting us to make our wills more keen. \"Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood That we must curb it upon others' proof, To be forbod the sweets that seems so good For fear of harms that preach in our behoof. O appetite, from judgement stand aloof! The one a palate hath that needs will taste, Though reason weep, and cry `It is thy last'. \"For further I could say this man's untrue, And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling; Heard where his plants in others' orchards grew; Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling; Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling; Thought characters and words merely but art, And bastards of his foul adulterate heart. \"And long upon these terms I held my city, Till thus he 'gan besiege me: `Gentle maid, Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity, And be not of my holy vows afraid. That's to ye sworn to none was ever said; For feasts of love I have been called unto, Till now did ne'er invite nor never woo. \" `All my offences that abroad you see Are errors of the blood, none of the mind; Love made them not; with acture they may be, Where neither party is nor true nor kind. They sought their shame that so their shame did find; And so much less of shame in me remains By how much of me their reproach contains. \" `Among the many that mine eyes have seen, Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed, Or my affection put to th' smallest teen, Or any of my leisures ever charmed. Harm have I done to them, but ne'er was harmed; Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free, And reigned commanding in his monarchy. \" `Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me Of pallid pearls and rubies red as blood, Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me Of grief and blushes, aptly understood In bloodless white and the encrimsoned mood - Effects of terror and dear modesty, Encamped in hearts, but fighting outwardly. \" `And lo, behold these talents of their hair, With twisted metal amorously impleached, I have received from many a several fair, Their kind acceptance weepingly beseeched, With the annexions of fair gems enriched, And deep-brained sonnets that did amplify Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality. \" `The diamond? -why, 'twas beautiful and did tend; The deep-green em'rald, in whose fresh regard Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend; The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend With objects manifold: each several stone, With wit well blazoned, smiled or made some moan. \" `Lo, all these trophies of affections hot, Of pensived and subdued desires the tender, Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not, But yield them up where I myself must render - That is to you, my origin and ender; For these, of force, must your oblations be, Since I their altar, you enpatron me. \" `O then advance of yours that phraseless hand, Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise. Take all these similes to your own command, Hallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise. What me your minister, for you obeys, Works under you, and to your audit comes Their distract parcels in combined sums. \" `Lo, this device was sent me from a nun, A sister sanctified, of holiest note, Which late her noble suit in court did shun, Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote; For she was sought by spirits of richest coat, But kept cold distance, and did thence remove To spend her living in eternal love. \" `But, O my sweet, what labour is't to leave The thing we have not, mast'ring what not strives, Planing the place which did no form receive, Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves! She that her fame so to herself contrives, The scars of battle scapeth by the flight, And makes her absence valiant, not her might. \" `O pardon me, in that my boast is true! The accident which brought me to her eye Upon the moment did her force subdue, And now she would the caged cloister fly: Religious love put out religion's eye. Not to be tempted, would she be immured, And now to tempt, all liberty procured. \" `How mighty then you are, O hear me tell! The broken bosoms that to me belong Have emptied all their fountains in my well, And mine I pour your ocean all among. I strong o'er them, and you o'er me being strong, Must for your victory us all congest, As compound love to physic your cold breast. \" `My parts had power to charm a sacred nun, Who, disciplined, ay, dieted in grace, Believed her eyes when they t'assail begun, All vows and consecrations giving place. O most potential love! -vow, bond, nor space, In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine, For thou art all, and all things else are thine. \" `When thou impressest, what are precepts worth Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame, How coldly those impediments stand forth, Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame! Love's arms are peace, 'gainst rule, 'gainst sense, 'gainst shame; And sweetens, in the suff'ring pangs it bears, The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears. \" `Now all these hearts that do on mine depend, Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine, And supplicant their sighs to you extend, To leave the batt'ry that you make 'gainst mine, Lending soft audience to my sweet design, And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath That shall prefer and undertake my troth.' \"This said, his wat'ry eyes he did dismount, whose sights till then were levelled on my face; Each cheek a river running from a fount With brinish current downward flowed apace. O how the channel to the stream gave grace! Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses That flame through water which their hue encloses. \"O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies In the small orb of one particular tear! But with the inundation of the eyes What rocky heart to water will not wear? What breast so cold that is not warmed here? O cleft effect! Cold modesty, hot wrath, Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath. \"For lo, his passion, but an art of craft, Even there resolved my reason into tears; There my white stole of chastity I daffed, Shook off my sober guards and civil fears; Appear to him as he to me appears, All melting; though our drops this diff'rence bore: His poisoned me, and mine did him restore. \"In him a plenitude of subtle matter, Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives, Of burning blushes or of weeping water, Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves, In either's aptness, as it best deceives, To blush at speeches rank, to weep at woes, Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows, \"That not a heart which in his level came Could scape the hail of his all-hurting aim, Showing fair nature is both kind and tame; And, veiled in them, did win whom he would maim. Against the thing he sought he would exclaim; When he most burned in heart-wished luxury He preached pure maid and praised cold chastity. \"Thus merely with the garment of a grace The naked and concealed fiend he covered, That th'unexperient gave the tempter place, Which like a cherubin above them hovered. Who, young and simple, would not be so lovered? Ay me, I fell; and yet do question make What I should do again for such a sake. \"O, that infected moisture of his eye, O, that false fire which in his cheek so glowed, O, that forced thunder from his heart did fly, O, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestowed, O, all that borrowed motion, seeming owed, Would yet again betray the fore-betrayed, And new pervert a reconciled maid.\" not like this!!](forum_thread.php?id=37369) ( 2007 by . . .the boy firmly believes are \"not capable of beating anyone.\" ;))) there is a genuine risk of choking that may end in tears It is, after all, of interest to little boys and what the Aussies think that little boys believe. | 6214) |[Message |[Message not like this!!](forum_thread.php?id=37369) ( [Message 508598](forum_thread.php?id=37369&postid=508598)) Posted 25 Jan 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Maybe the Australians can play cricket.

Trading Standard Officers have ordered the urgent recall of a defective product found to be faulty and dangerous. Over the Christmas and New Year period, tests proved the components in the product called \"Australian Cricket\" would fall apart when placed under the smallest amount of pressure. Consumers first experienced problems last year, when it was noted the product failed to work properly in Europe. Complaints were made about it malfunctioning and then emitting a continuous whining noise usually when in England or in Australia. At the time the complaints were ignored. But when the product started falling apart in England in recent years, the Trading Standards Authority took action. A spokesman warned: \"We particularly want to stress to parents that, with Australian Cricket, there is a genuine risk of choking that may end in tears at the end of test series. Despite assurances from the company behind the product that action was taken to correct the faulty parts, including abandoning the use of the highly unpredictable and sub-standard component \"Hussey\", malfunctions have continued. Consumers have been urged to check the small print carefully for the words \"this product may still contain traces of Warne\". If that is the case buyers of the product are urged to put it back in its box and return it immediately. \"Warne\" has been known to cause a severe allergic reaction in many consumers, causing them to shout involuntarily \"Retire you useless sod!\". 25 Jan 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: time for lunch Enjoy your meal!

Yes you can. Quantum physics, according to the uncertainty principle, briefly stated: the universe could have started from nothing and for no reason. jjemme, do you realy believe that there was nothing before the bang ? nothing, no time on nothing ?. I cant swallow that. Well, quantum physicists have things happening in their labs that astound the human intellect. Quantum physics is definitely right now the most successful and utterly bizarre theory in the whole of physics. If these humans conclude that matter can appear from nowhere, then I am also open to the idea that nothing existed before the big bang. What the heck. If the known universe at one time was condensed into a microscopic \"nugget,\" it's not too much of a stretch to say that no matter or time existed before the big bang. There has been some interesting thoughts on that subject in the [The String Cafe Table blog](http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/string/archives/000424.html). It looks possible that the intersection of two branes could have been the culprit, rather than the singularity they told us about in junior high. I'm not sure if I understand all of that string theory. But the notion of a 'Soft Bang' is intriguing. Perhaps the Soft Bang has been going on forever, ie, there was nothing before the Soft Bang, so that something was never produced out of nothing. There was nothing before the Soft Bang because the Soft bang has been going on forever, therefore no worries about what happened before - it has always been Soft Bang. | 6230) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Jan 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: OK ice, its truth time.

The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie.

China as a developing world economic and military power should be showing some maturity as it sits as one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. It used an old out-dated ballistic missile to destroy on old unwanted satellite to show what? That it could do it? We can all go and bash something.

You could then use the second account to join another team. and if i understand correctly, i have 2nd account, but the program would still run with 2 accounts. Thank you By the Way The program will run. It wouldn't run both at the same time, however, so you would have to switch it back and forth to gain credits on both accounts. No problem. Happy to help. A way to do this with Windows is; - Install BOINC and set it running with projects for account 1. - Close the BOINC Manager program. - Back up the C:\\\\Program files\\\\BOINC folder, to C:\\\\temp\\\\BOINC1 - files\\\\BOINC folder afterwards) - Reinstall BOINC and set it running with projects for account 2. - Close the BOINC Manager program. - Back up the C:\\\\Program files\\\\BOINC folder, to C:\\\\temp\\\\BOINC2 - Uninstall BOINC. files\\\\BOINC folder afterwards) Copy the BOINC1 and BOINC2 C:\\\\Program files\\\\ C:\\\\Program files\\\\BOINC double click \"boincmgr.exe\" - You are now running the BOINC Manager for account 1 with the projects you selected for account 1. - TO SWITCH ACCOUNTS:- - Close the BOINC Manager program. - Rename C:\\\\Program C:\\\\Program files\\\\BOINC double click \"boincmgr.exe\" - You are now running BOINC for account 1 with the projects you selected for account 2. - Close BOINC Manager and rename to rerun as needed for account 1 or 2.

Same coach too! LOL How about that Adam Vinatieri, though! Five field goals, including 48 and 51 yarders! The Colt's didn't even need Peyton against the Ravens. Strange game that one: 25-6, a playoff game without a single touchdown. I'll bet you the New England Pats are kicking themselves over letting him go. What're they going to do against him, Sunday? The Colts only need to get to midfield to score. That's a definite edge in my book. THAT is why some call it the 'National FieldGoal League'! IMO, they need to reduce the point value of field goals to 2 points, thereby reducing the advantage. Maybe even making them only worth 1 point. Currently thought you are correct, get to the 40ish yard line and most new kickers can get it thru the uprights. Remember they have to hike it and then the extra 10 yards because the uprights are at the back of the end zone now. Although that extra 10 yards does not count on the 'official' yardage amount. Kind of like the 3-point play in the NBA. It has changed the game dramatically. LOTS of emphasis on drafting kids that can shoot them now. I expect that David Beckham will soon show them how to play football and score the goals. Although I expect he might be a bit confused about the rugby posts you use at either end. I expect he'll also have words with the ref about trying to use a rugby ball in a game of football.

Most people get outvoted by 2040, way before 2100 when the game ends. Second or third try can get them to the end, but maybe not with impressive scores like yours. It's only a game. Thanks for having a go. It was annoying that the game doesn't end on a \"reduction goal\" year. You end up voting for a CO2 reduction quota for a year falls after the end of the game... I was tempted to just boost the economy on the last turn to see what would happen. As a 'strategy' type game it is interesting to try it again and again to see what happens if you change your strategy. Unfortunately it is too easy to suddenly become 'unpopular with the voters', be voted out of office, and for the game to suddenly end. As with other strategy games it might have been useful to have 'saved games' where you could go back to a certain point and try something different, without having to start the game all over again.

Thanks for having a go. It was annoying that the game doesn't end on a \"reduction goal\" year. You end up voting for a CO2 reduction quota for a year falls after the end of the game... I was tempted to just boost the economy on the last turn to see what would happen. As a 'strategy' type game it is interesting to try it again and again to see what happens if you change your strategy. Unfortunately it is too easy to suddenly become 'unpopular with the voters', be voted out of office, and for the game to suddenly end. As with other strategy games it might have been useful to have 'saved games' where you could go back to a certain point and try something different, without having to start the game all over again.

But SETI@home has something that is as exciting as the Arthur C Clarke books that I once picked up almost every day; an excitement based on a belief that someone has to make the effort, or we'll never get away from what limits us to this Earth. It might be sci-fi, but it's worth trying to make it a reality; to find the technology and resources to improve things for all. (Find it 'out there', or find it in trying to get 'out there').

Through out the history of man countless people have been taken advantage of, by people wishing to gain from there suffering. It would be very irresponsible for the leaders of this world not to be very skeptical and cautious when confronted by an alien contact. First, any alien contact made would be the first (widely known) issue of its kind to confront the human race and we all know that your first time through any situation is the best anyone can ever do, correct? Second, any race that can cross the vastness of space and over come the obsicales that presents, is a race that is vastly superior to our own in technology and, as we all know, that technology gap does not guarantee a victory in war, but I would put my money on them. Third, lets not forget out heads here and let\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s put it into something we can all understand. If a stranger comes to your door unannounced, the first thing you do of course is invite them in to your house and family without knowing why they have come or what they want. Many conquers have come under the flags of \"I come in peace\" and \"Please accept this gift\" (The Aztecs know about the latter)and while I truly believe that we are not alone in this universe I also believe that the vast majority of the human race would not react well to knowing that we are not alone. In my opinion any alien civilization would know that at our current level of technology and belief systems, there would be GREAT potential for disaster on this world if they just \"dropped by\" at this moment. Any that do should be met with as much reservation, reluctance, and caution as we can muster, until that race could demonstrate good will toward this planet as a whole. Well said cvec19.

I think that, indeed, humans would do everything they possibly could to find a way to exploit any contact. Let's say the aliens that contact us are a race of pacifists. They don't believe in war, or fighting of any kind. Do you honestly believe that there wouldn't be those among the various governments and militaries that wouldn't try to take advantage of that?? That is simply naive. Is it?. Are you saying that we you cannot even sort out terrorists, and humans have no hope of controlling their greed? Arthur C. Clarke was so wrong. You are so right.

I think that \"live some sort of make believe life\" = Not Sane. As to the day dream comment, I was raised in a household where hunting (in season) was common and gun safety was taught as a matter of course. Growing up with hunting exposed me to the effects of firearms on fragile flesh and I have never had the urge, daydream or idle speculation about using a firearm on anyone. Beating someone up, though, that daydream I have had. Most people these days are not directly exposed to firearms and their effects. The extent of their exposure is from TV and movies, which are mostly (at least below the R level) deliberately sanitized. People get neat little holes and neatly fall over dead, with maybe a few screams for shock value. The \"daydreams\" you are speaking about are based on ignorance and incorrect information obtained at second or third hand. If such daydreams are not very infrequent, I mean like years apart infrequent, please please please speak to a mental health worker about them right now. These kind of daydreams and urges are not normal and the reasons for them need to dealt with and defused ASAP. It would sadden me no end to see a news report about a graphic artist wigging out and doing such a thing, OK? Ha ha ha, OK, I have to back down and agree that \"live some sort of make believe life\" = Not Sane. I also have to admit that I have never daydreamed about using a machine gun to mow people down. Only with a machete. But then not any people involved. Just trees. I always wanted to be a lumberjack - and that is before I ever heard of Monty Python.

He remained agitated, however, and later decided he wanted to continue the discussion and get a goodnight kiss, so he called her cell phone and took to the highway in search of her. He sportted what he thought was her car, but he should have known it was the wrong one when he told her on the phone to stop and she said she was stopped. In spite of this, he then rammed the wrong vehicle 15 times and pushed it through intersections at stop signs until he was arrested. Gotta get up soon and work. Good night! :) Nice.

To my view the only cogent question is if he should suffer the death penalty or be imprisoned for the rest of his life. It will come as no surprise to many that I prefer the death penalty in this situation. I don't agree, and unless medically certified, the preacher was probably as sane as you or I. I think may of these 'power mad' (but sane) preachers live some sort of make believe lives in the confines of their own church and grow more and more confident in how they can mistreat their congregations. I think some mix religions with some sort of voodoo and day-dream themselves into believing they are Christ or whatever and can do whatever they want. It's living a day-dream - not insanity. You would probably be lieing if you never had a day-dream about mowing down a group of people with a machine gun, or just your boss. It's why this scene is in so many movies. Only armed forces or preachers actually do it, except preachers have a dubious reason not to control their day-dreams like the rest of us. | 6426) Jan 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: If memory serves me, oil a couple of years ago was around $38-$40. Recently it was at $60+, a 50% increase. This wreaks havoc with modern economies because it's so hugely inflationary. It's like a tax, really. You can't freeze so you have to pay it. That leaves less money left for other things, like food and rent. It's worse than that. Almost everything we eat, wear, or play with is moved around by a vehicle that uses fuel made from oil.

There are tons of other issues like saving rainforrest, whales, whatever. It's a complete different ballgame when it comes to companies who have to fear for losses in height of billions of dollars. I think everybody can imagine a comparison how much money those companies have for lobby work and how much organisations like greenpeace. Besides that thise corps and their shareholder have for sure quite some shares of media corporations. I am no hippie, in fact I am rather conservative. But I hate being taken for a fool. I have worked long enough in marketing to know how arrogant think tanks are - they think that YOU and ME are just plain stupid and they can influence us in every direction they want. Therefore I don't like overhyping climate change as well as I don't like the effort to manipulate people for profit. The only really important thing is the future of our children and people who sell it for money make me sick. The people who want actions now might be wrong. The results would still be positive for us all. More jobs and less pollution. But what will the ones here, who don't want to take actions tell their children in 30 years - sorry I have been an idiot, they managed to fool me? You have missed one very important factor in all of this. Government. It is ultimately government that decides what is done about Climate Change, or what is not done to be more precise. Government is lobbied by industry, and fends off irritants alike Greenpeace. Who are Greenpeace or similar organizations to tell government when government knows? Oh sure, they know things and produce websites full of 'evidence', but it is mostly hyped up to try to inflate the importance of these organizations and the people that run them. And what about industry? They have their own interests to look after and, apart from nominal donations to charities, they are out to make money and beat their competitors. Industry will try in influence government, who have the ultimate say in what happens - government dictates policy and taxes to decide how Climate Change is managed. Government is made up of the greedy and the incompetent as well as those who try but cannot make happen what should. Send letters to your MP? Protest? Join Greenpeace? Hope industry will do the right thing? Hope the government will see sense? Will any of it change a twig?

The criminal courts don't have time to try a dead man, where no practical punishment can ensue..they're busy enough with the living, as is. That's an interesting point, because they do open up the cases of people executed in the past and give posthumous pardons - not a trial, just an interesting point. Good point, iX. That's a very recent development and it's an exception to the general rule. That one started a few years ago, when DNA evidence made it a scientific fact that certain convictions were mistaken. There was quite a debate about it, because pardons are generally issued by the government and not by the courts. My guess is that in the face of convincing scientific evidence, the Supreme Courts have decided that upholding the integrity and reputation of the justice system does require opening up some cases. You can say here that the reversal of verdict does amount to having a practical effect. Slowly but surely, the law is ever changing...for the better, one hopes. :) The law does indeed change. I studied tort and contract at university for a year and it is amazing to see the logic behind the formation of law, and the thought processes behind the change. In the case of posthumous pardons, I was thinking of the WW1 British soldiers who were shot for desertion. Evidence shows that they suffered from shell shock and it has taken so many years for the soldiers to be pardoned and their families to be finally cleared of this ghastly thing hanging over them that happened in a war long ago. It doesn't help those that were shot, but it helps the families who now visit their graves with a heavy black weight lifted from their family names. Your point is entirely valid with regard to grieving families but I do not think that it is right to re-write history which can only lead o the distortion of factual events. I think this is why it took so long for the UK Ministry of Defense to give way on this. Representations have been made for many, many years and rejected on the basis that those in command at the time made decisions and those decisions should stand.

Actually the greenhouse effect does cause significant warming on Mars. It's fairly easy to calculate the temperature that Mars would have without an atmosphere. The appropriate formula is simply R_sun^2 T_sun^4 / d_mars^2 = 4*e_mars * T_mars^4 a_mars) or T_mars=T_sun * sqrt(R_sun/(4*d_mars)*sqrt((1-a_mars)/e_mars)) where R_sun is the radius of the sun, T_sun is the effective photospheric temperature of the sun, d_mars is the distance from Mars to the sun, e_mars is the IR emissivity of mars, a_mars is the martian effective albedo, and T_mars is the martian surface temperature. Any freshman physics major can derive this for you. Now for values: The solar temperature is 5785K, the radius of the sun is 0.696 million km, the mean distance from mars to the sun is 228 million km. The martian albedo is 0.15, and the IR emissivity is going to be larger than 1-a because nonmetallic solids tend to emit and absorb in the IR better than they do in the visible. Let's call it 0.95. So the mean surface temperature of mars should be 155 Kelvin. The mean surface temperature is 210K, a difference of 55K. The most reasonable explanation is that the IR emissivity of Mars is less than would be expected. If you try to back substitute, you get that the Martian IR emissivity is about 0.28. In other words, mars radiates about 30% as much infrared energy as it should given its surface temperature. That is primarily because of the CO2 in its atmosphere. Eric That was a very interesting answer Eric. But it was wrong. The answer is that, whilst CO2 is a contributory factor to global warming, it is not the only factor. There are other factors that are causing global warming on Earth, but which are not causing global warming to the effect that it is raising temperatures on Mars as dramatically as Earth. For example, chlorofluorocarbons, of which there is none in the Martian atmosphere, and water vapor, of which there is none in the Martian atmosphere. As well as a whole host of other elements which are in the Earth's atmosphere, but which are not in the Martian atmosphere.

But we could use the principle of prudent avoidance and reduce our greenhouse gases emissions, for instance by recurring to solar energy sources. Germany has about ten times the amount of photovoltaic power production compared to Italy and there is more sunlight flowing upon Italy than Germany. But our Government is only worried abot methane gas imports, and we are dependent on the likes of Putin and Ghaddafi for our electric power production, since we foolishly abandoned nuclear plants. Tullio I have been against the use of nuclear power given the Chernobyl experience, risks from terrorist attacks on NPP and terrorist abuse, safety, and cost of dealing with the contaminated waste. However, I do recognize that if these 'objections' were overcome, nuclear could provide the energy we need for the future, and more importantly, could be the only energy available that could help us conquer the stars.

That is the nature of science in the real world. Here is a quotation from the NOAA report cited in the New York Times: The unusually warm start to this winter reflected the rarity of Arctic outbreaks across the country as an El Ni\u00c3\u00c2\u00b1o episode continued in the equatorial Pacific. A contributing factor to the unusually warm temperatures throughout 2006 also is the long-term warming trend, which has been linked to increases in greenhouse gases. This has made warmer-than-average conditions more common in the U.S. and other parts of the world. It is unclear how much of the recent anomalous warmth was due to greenhouse-gas-induced warming and how much was due to the El Ni\u00c3\u00c2\u00b1o-related circulation pattern. It is known that El Ni\u00c3\u00c2\u00b1o is playing a major role in this winter's short-term warm period. Tullio This is a very important point.

I agree with your suggestion to have the name changed to \"Green star yes/no\" or some other more obvious message. The other setting is indeed confusing. I don't know why a green star would have appeared last year, but not this year. There must have been a problem with the code that handles the appearance of the green stars.

And there are more now than EVER. Yes, while I agree in general principle with what you stated; we as humans are the only species capable directing change, and we are certainly the species that pollutes the planet the most and consumes the most natural resources; therefor by default we are the species to which the most blame goes. Again this is due to the fact that we are the only species that does not naturally reach an equilibrium with nature. Quite often people will state overpopulation as a major reason for climate change, directly or indirectly. I often sit in a car, or in a train, or on a motorcycle, and even looked out of an aeroplane recently and saw such open spaces, miles and 10s of miles or 100s of miles with no buildings or sight of people. Bags of room for plenty more as far as I can see. Obviously you haven't been on the 405 in Los Angeles recently...or breathed the smog...when the sky over LA looks like the city is on fire tell me that pollution doesn't add up. When your nose burns and you can taste the pollution in the back of your mouth then tell me it doesn't add up. No, not recently. But you are exaggerating. It's your choice to congregate in Los Angeles; this planet has plenty of space to move to if you want to breath cleaner air. We all have choices. I moved out of London to give up some of the good things about London but to get away from squashed sardines and polluted skies, to live near open fields and skies with far less light pollution, much more opportunity to see the stars. Now how does someone who has not recently been to LA just assume that I am exaggerating just because their can't wrap their tiny closed mind around simple fact. Have you ever seen a forest fire or the damage that can be done by one? Have you ever see the sky filled with smoke from one? Have you ever even been to LA? These are all questions to establish your real knowledge concerning my former statement, because I have been to LA...once quite recently and...no joke it really is as bad as I say. I started to react to the smog within minutes of entering the LA area and didn't stop for several hours after I left LA proper. You know they even have multiple names for it down there. They also call it \"lemon fog\" too...for a reason...and no natural fog is yellow/brown. As for me I live in the San Francisco Bay Area about an hour from Berkeley so no I don't choose to congregate as you assumed that I did in LA, for it was actually a business trip that took me down to LA. So I write from first hand experience, and frankly I'm not even sure that you have seen the place after your showing of total ineptitude concerning the state of the LA basin air quality. Even in the San Fransico Bay area we have what is commonly known as \"spare the air\" days, so that when the temperature reaches a certain level and the air is not moving much over the bay area the state and local governments encourage mass transit use as a way to cut down on pollution and improve air quality. Now luckily for Bay Area residents the area that we live in gets a normal off shore flow of air from the Pacific so it pushes the pollutants causing them to not hang in the air, It becomes more prominent over Stockton (still in the Bay Area) where the air can sit due to the mountains and the pollution can collect, however even San Francisco can experience a certain amount of smog from time to time. When your nose burns and you can taste the pollution in the back of your mouth Yes, this is an exaggeration, and yes I have been to LA many times, most recently 2 years ago and my nose did not burn. The pollution you have there is no worse than any large city in the world. Stop making choices in your spending that give rise to organizations producing this pollution, and then it won't be you fault, will it? | 6510) Jan 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Big John [said](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/forum_thread.php?id=35124&nowrap=true#499944) Why do some people even bother to post a message when they can not even spell words correctly?

That's a very recent development and it's an exception to the general rule. That one started a few years ago, when DNA evidence made it a scientific fact that certain convictions were mistaken. There was quite a debate about it, because pardons are generally issued by the government and not by the courts. My guess is that in the face of convincing scientific evidence, the Supreme Courts have decided that upholding the integrity and reputation of the justice system does require opening up some cases. You can say here that the reversal of verdict does amount to having a practical effect. Slowly but surely, the law is ever changing...for the better, one hopes. :) The law does indeed change. I studied tort and contract at university for a year and it is amazing to see the logic behind the formation of law, and the thought processes behind the change. In the case of posthumous pardons, I was thinking of the WW1 British soldiers who were shot for desertion. Evidence shows that they suffered from shell shock and it has taken so many years for the soldiers to be pardoned and their families to be finally cleared of this ghastly thing hanging over them that happened in a war long ago. It doesn't help those that were shot, but it helps the families who now visit their graves with a heavy black weight lifted from their family names. | 6516) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : court drops Saddam's charges](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6239853.stm) \"The Iraqi High Tribunal has dropped all charges against Saddam Hussein\" It would be kinda hard to give a fair trial to a dead man.

The Climate Change Experiment prediction models spend 50% of the crunching time predicting climate of the past, from 1920 onwards, and you are citing it as evidence. | 6524) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Jan 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: As scientists, \"expert\" scientists, in the field of Climate Change I asked them for evidence, and they said there was none. As in nothing; as in \"no evidence at all\". It's not me looking at graphs and making my own interpretation, it is asking scientists whether there is any evidence, and the scientists saying no. That is not true acording to what you can find her... I am telling you that I asked them, and what their reply was. Why can't we just have a conversation and ask someone in the know, without muddling everything with \"go and read that library, read all those websites, and all those journals while you\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2re at it.\".

And there are more now than EVER. Yes, while I agree in general principle with what you stated; we as humans are the only species capable directing change, and we are certainly the species that pollutes the planet the most and consumes the most natural resources; therefor by default we are the species to which the most blame goes. Again this is due to the fact that we are the only species that does not naturally reach an equilibrium with nature. Quite often people will state overpopulation as a major reason for climate change, directly or indirectly. I often sit in a car, or in a train, or on a motorcycle, and even looked out of an aeroplane recently and saw such open spaces, miles and 10s of miles or 100s of miles with no buildings or sight of people.

What I'm simply saying is it's a little too late to say that humans have not had a MAJOR impact on the earth and nature, and if that can be seen then why is it so hard for society and government to wrap their heads around accepting that we as humans are the cause, and move to balance what we have upset. I know that the polar bear isn't responsible for it's loss of habitat, and many other extinctions likely wouldn't have happened if humans weren't responsible for messing up the delicate balance of nature like a bull in a china shop. To deny that we are the cause is short sighted at best! It is simple to imagine, and it can be simple to state the obvious. But let's cut to the chase, for the sake of argument. Let's just say that Man has been ripping out Earth's resources, particularly in the last 200 years or so, to give us all such wonderful lives; 2 cars each family, a nice house with decent PCs and toasters, and money in the bank. And then suddenly we find in doing the ripping we have caused serious problems to this planet, that Mankind could be in serious jeopardy. We have to do something. Do what? Every 'what' means spending lots of money - LOTS of it. Spending it means we have to do without. Only one car each family, a smaller house, half a toaster and no money in the bank to buy a new PC every 6 months. Sorry, don't want to know. Lets muddle the arguments, lets blame America for not signing up to Kyoto, lets argue and procrastinate - let's do anything but seriously try to work out what is going on and seriously do something about it fast, before Gods' investment in Man has to be written off and he has to start again. What use is there in crunching for Climate or Aliens but to advance science, and what better thing can there be for Man than science, unless he doesn't use it?

Moderation is what they do as an additional task to ensure crunching continues. As scientists, \"expert\" scientists, in the field of Climate Change I asked them for evidence, and they said there was none. As in nothing; as in \"no evidence at all\". It's not me looking at graphs and making my own interpretation, it is asking scientists whether there is any evidence, and the scientists saying no. For all we know the moderator in question on CPDN is not a scientist. Have you asked what their credentials are? I know he is a 'scientist', I know he is in frequent discussion with scientists in CPDN - I have been a member there for a while now and have myself posted there and read a lot of CPDN posts to see him and other scientists interact with each other. I am also inclined to accept that he and his colleague scientists have integrity and am inclined to accept what they say as said with integrity. The point I am making, and the point they are making, is that there is no evidence. The fact that they have beliefs about Climate Change, and are taking time out to study it, does not mean that there is any evidence; but they choose to study the subject for whatever reason. The Climate Change project are simply trying to predict what climate 'might' look like in the future using (BOINC based) simulation. For example what if there was more, or less, CO2 in the atmosphere, what might the climate look like in 2080? It does not attempt to attribute the cause of why there is a predicted raise in world temperature, if it is down to Man or not, but looks at the changes of variables they introduce in the simulations. However, they recognize that a major 'result' from their project is better BOINC modeling. Their attempts to simulate climate change have improved BOINC processing for all (so they say). Not evidence that it was CO2 produced by Man that did it (or will end the Earth and drown us all in rising sea levels).

They don't have any. They say \"wait 10 years and there might be some\". And, \"Our models behave differently without CO2 than with CO2\". And used some strange words to try to excite me with their vocabulary. Surely you're not taking the word of a moderator as gospel. We all know how much quedos moderators have when it comes to knowledge...... In any case, I think that moderator was being a little tongue in cheek! The problem with proper scientific peer reviewed papers is that it does take years for the data to be gathered, papers written, reviewed and then published. Anyone can come along and say just what you've been saying without any peer review and any basis in fact. People can say that it's down to natural cycles, but the three graphs below show that what is happening right now is way beyond any natural cycle. All pretty obvious really. There is no doubt, as illustrated by your diagrams, that climate is changing.

I have to go by what the scientists say, and that doesn't mean accepting everything a crackpot scientist puts into a journal. Aren't you just a walking hypocritical oxymoron. I was asking you not them, and that was the best you could come up with that we should put it to the scientists and \"their assertion that there is no evidence\" then to my utter amazement you turn right back around and say that you have to \"go by what the scientist say and that doesn't mean accepting everything a crackpot scientist puts into a journal\". Now maybe I missed something here but are you trying to sidestep the question with a rhetorical answer...because at this point I am asking you not them and if you can't give more to the discussion then \"I have to believe the scientists, but I'm not going to believe everything that a crackpot scientist puts into a journal\" then you are just polluting the thread with rhetoric. Ok... sure, if that doesn't scream oxymoron I don't know what does. Now I'm gonna ask you another question...in your infinite wisdom how exactly do \"you\" make the determination of which scientist are \"crackpots\" and which are not? Because at this point I think that is important information in this discussion. Skipping to your last statement \"Stop listening to lobbyists and start thinking for yourself. REALLY!\". That is EXACTLY what I am doing my friend Dark Angel. It is what God gave me a brain for ;) So far you're powers or logic are lost on me o'master of rhetorical statements, and this is where I have an issue, because logic does not dictate reality, and since you have invoked religion into this now tell us what you think personally not what someone else thinks. In the world of religion they call this blind faith, and I really would like to hear your thoughts not pre canned rhetoric, because after all God did give you a brain and you state you are using it to which I state there is no conclusive proof yet but we'll wait ten years and see. So please indulge me because I'm truly fascinated now. As for the rest of what you say, it's the same old thing; nobody is denying that there is a problem, nobody is denying that pollution is a problem, especially on a vast scale. But jumping to conclusions because your thought processes work in a certain way is not the same as proof of evidence of cause. Yes, you can deduce what 'may' be <part> of the cause. But don't try to say you know it all, when you simply don't. I never claimed to know it all and I certainly am not hiding behind the scientists on this one. I do however find it amazing that you say you don't deny what has conclusively been shown to be the major causes of global warming but you also don't admit that humans are to blame for it. Here's an original thought lets stop trying to hide in a hole on this one and start changing as a species and really work on the things that are causing the pollution and if it turns out \"10 years from now\" that the \"crackpot scientists\" are wrong then what have we actually lost in this world....nothing I say if anything we have a cleaner planet with cleaner air. This is exactly the reason that people are telling you that you have your head in the sand, because it's this mentality to deny what you see and admit is an issue but because someone tells you it may not be \"the issue\" you want to bury your head without working on an obvious problems that will better the earth and nature as a whole. It is quite possible that this is just one of nature's regular changes to the Earth which has happened many times over millions of years? You know you may be right but then again you may not I think the growing consensus is to not \"wait for ten years and see\". Just remember none of us were around millions of years ago so we really truely don't know unless you have proof? You should learn to read mac. You are attributing crap to me that belongs elsewhere else and basically talking crap.

Wait another 10 years.\" Head in the sand approach. There is overwhelming evidence that man is responsible for increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere and it has been proven, yes proven that CO2 IS a greenhouse gas (without it we would be at -20C). We can't go and poor 15 Billion tonnes a year of CO2 into the atmosphere without something going wrong. We need to kerb the amounts we emit, sequestere as mush as we can and introduce alternatives to burning fossil fuels. Will the oceans soak up some CO2, why yes. But then the pH of the oceans will decrease and shells on shellfish will dissolve. The oceans temperatures will also increase and the levels increase therefore killing (from pH change, increased temperature and increased depth) coral reefs that harbour an astonishing amount of sea life. So much sea life will die off that the world's fish stocks will plummet. We can't emit into the atmosphere 15,000,000,000 tonnes of CO2 without something going wrong! Are people so short sighted as to not understand this? Do you want to own up to your kids and say that you sat by and did nothing while you waited for absolute proof then realise it was too late? How will your kids view you in 10, 20 or 30 yrs time? Live long and BOINC (if you don't die from a tropical disease, starvation, get displaced by rising sea levels, or be killed by an increased number of hurricanes, tornados and floods). Paul I understand your concerns. Many do. But 'no proof' does not mean 'head in sand'. There is no point spending percentages of nation's GDP on solutions when we don't understand, or have proof, of the causes. We could be rushing into doing some things only to find it was all due to something else after all, but it's to late the save the planet now. A more concerted effort to find that proof would be prudent. Ice, We can't emit into the atmosphere 15,000,000,000 tonnes per year of CO2 without something going wrong! Are you so short sighted as to not understand this? Do you want to own up to your kids and say that you sat by, argued against doing something and did nothing while you waited for absolute proof then realise it was too late? How will your kids view you in 10, 20 or 30 yrs time? Technology that comes out from trying to reduce CO2 emissions can only be a good thing and will pay itself back many times over. We are in a unique situation right now, we need to act accordingly. Live long and BOINC. Paul. No, I wouldn't say 15,000,000,000 tonnes of CO2 was negligible, but it is pretty small compared to the total mass of atmosphere and what is put into it. And nobody is saying that we should sit down and wait. Just don't go off with knee-jerk reactions before being sure about the facts and evidence. Sure go ahead and reduce CO2, but don't mislead the world into reducing CO2 because you think, but do not have any basis, that this is in itself is the answer to all changes happening with this planet right now. | 6570) 2007 by Post: Good evening all.

They are Moth people, always going to the light no matter what happens Yes about water - no one speaks of dry air, yet Moses used it successfully. Dry air is so important and displaces water so well, yet we don't even acknowledge it. As for the dark bills - picked up by the secret services who wouldn't want anyone to know about this 'faster than light' stuff. Dry air bills? Similarly paid for be the secret services. Just think what the Climate Change people would say if they knew there was enough dry air stored under the African plains to displace all the oceans and send it sloshing into space.

The fact is that the admins can't make everybody happy, and no matter who they appoint, somebody is going to feel unhappy about their choice. There are many boards out there, so maybe you can find a board somewhere, where you'll feel more happy about the crew of moderators than here. Good day to you too. Yep, there are many boards out there. None of them I wish to be a part of. This board is a part of something I wanted to make a contribution to. I have to look to where I spend my (unlike others - NON returnable) dollars. I happen to feel that the people who have been put in charge here are not the sort of people I have anything in common with. There are 2 exceptions ... both of which I have remarked about before in another thread. If you look at my history, you will see that I am a well meaning and even tempered person. Where I fly off the handle is well intentioned. If that seems to others to be anti USA - it is because I perceive the US to be at fault. I pay taxes in the US. I not only deserve, I demand the right to criticise how my tax dollar is spent. NONE of this dictates or even indicates a hatred for America. Perhaps it is you, in a myopic sense, who might be at fault. I am, - if you look at my record on Seti and Beta, in the process of running down my cache. When it is over, THIS TIME - I promise you, I shall not return. Many of you will say \"Good Riddance\". Those many of you will NOT have given as much computer time to Seti as I have. NONE of you will have kicked the tin with donations to the tune I have. I do not wish to be moderated by a person such as Lena (or Christina or Elsa or Stopp). Her history is something to wonder about. Simple as that. Goodbye @ Bodley: You should never let your opinion of other people stand in the way of good judgment! LOL The test should be, \"Am I having fun with friends, am I participating in some interesting discussions, am I enjoying some interesting content on these forums?\" If none of the of the foregoing is true, then yes, find some other forum that will offer you that. But otherwise... Stay. That was very well said Beethoven. There are some good people here, and the rest aren't too bad either. Who cares who the mods are, or what they are saying, or how they are saying it? So long as they don't stop what Beethoven just said; having fun with friends; participating in some interesting discussions; enjoying some interesting content on these forums. Let the mods do what mods need to do, and lets all give it a go and keep it happy.

There is no evidence it is down to Man, Go ask the Climate Change scientists. Here, I'll save you the time; [there is no proof that the climate change starting to be experienced is caused by any one thing](http://bbc.cpdn.org/forum_thread.php?id=5151&nowrap=true#36333) \"I think that you're a bit too early to ask for proof. Wait another 10 years.\" Head in the sand approach. There is overwhelming evidence that man is responsible for increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere and it has been proven, yes proven that CO2 IS a greenhouse gas (without it we would be at -20C). We can't go and poor 15 Billion tonnes a year of CO2 into the atmosphere without something going wrong. We need to kerb the amounts we emit, sequestere as mush as we can and introduce alternatives to burning fossil fuels. Will the oceans soak up some CO2, why yes. But then the pH of the oceans will decrease and shells on shellfish will dissolve. The oceans temperatures will also increase and the levels increase therefore killing (from pH change, increased temperature and increased depth) coral reefs that harbour an astonishing amount of sea life. So much sea life will die off that the world's fish stocks will plummet. We can't emit into the atmosphere 15,000,000,000 tonnes of CO2 without something going wrong! Are people so short sighted as to not understand this? Do you want to own up to your kids and say that you sat by and did nothing while you waited for absolute proof then realise it was too late? How will your kids view you in 10, 20 or 30 yrs time? Live long and BOINC (if you don't die from a tropical disease, starvation, get displaced by rising sea levels, or be killed by an increased number of hurricanes, tornados and floods). Paul I understand your concerns. Many do. But 'no proof' does not mean 'head in sand'. There is no point spending percentages of nation's GDP on solutions when we don't understand, or have proof, of the causes. We could be rushing into doing some things only to find it was all due to something else after all, but it's to late the save the planet now. A more concerted effort to find that proof would be prudent. | 6626) by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Nice Hat! Thanks CA. These hats only eat fruit.

Hey Ice ... when you click on your donations it tells you how much you have sent, historically. I am not interested in the Green Star here ... it is the tracking of my donations that I am up in arms about. The green star is there. YOU will never see the total of my donations ... in fact, I am STILL to be credited in my account with $180 I sent back in July! I am lacked off ... and NO amount of schmaltzy words by Lena or her like will change my view. I promised Berkeley $500 per month. That they cannot even record my donations (which only I see) does not make me a happy rabbit. BTW - nah! forget it ... I was going to take a cheap shot at Lena ... ! No, I think you have a good point Bodley. If I were making that sort of monthly payment, then the least SETI could do was record against my personal profile so that I could track it. I hope someone will pick this up and contact you privately about it to make sure you are satisfied that all is handled at their end. $500 is more than worth a bit of attention. Fuzzy, can you make sure this is looked at and somebody ensures that Bodely's private profile is updated accordingly?

The prop's contribution to how funny you are may not be obvious at first, but it is very important. Pick a prop, then carry it around with you wherever you go. Do not acknowledge the prop in any way other than its occasional use, and do not use it for any purpose other than that for which it was intended. To illustrate the effectiveness of a prop, imagine you are telling a funny joke. Now imagine you are telling a funny joke and you have a rubber glove in your hand.

I do not dispute your evidence of climate change or the necessity to address the effects of same. I dispute your assertion that mankind has had any other than a miniscule effect. And I re-iterate \"It is everyones right to put their head in the sand when it comes it this issue. For people who do this, all I can say to them is.....we can't go spewing stuff into the atmosphere for over 100 years without something going wrong. We've seen already what happens when we spew stuff into waterways, it just takes longer to see an apparent change with the atmosphere as it is so much bigger. Carbon dioxide is at levels that the earth has not seen in over 600,000 years! With it increasing significantly above a rolling average in the past century. Surely you can't sit there and tell me that we can spew stuff into the atmosphere at increasing amounts with no adverse reactions taking place!\" Evidence is also that the CO2 levels have only been increasing since the industrial age began and that there has been no instantaneous peak when there has been volcanic activity. Read [this](http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s1076856.htm) article and tell me that there ain't going to be some sort of problem if we keep this up! You are quoting CO2 as if it were the only reason for Climate Change. Scientists often disagree or change their their minds. Just because they write something to get published does not mean it is true, and it does not mean that it may become a view discredited when other evidence comes along. What about El Nino? What about use of aerosols that cause cooling? What about solar activity? What about the Earth's wobbling orbit that causes it to change distance from the Sun? What about all that dust and debris in the 'vacuum' between the Earth and the Sun that may or may not block the Suns rays? There are so many other factors to consider than a bit of CO2 that man has released by burning a relatively small amount of matter on this planet. Man's activity in relation to the force of nature is still not understood properly - has this been factored in? | Post: Good Day All! Mornin (Mumbled around a mouth full of toast & jelly) Not fair.

These threads are made sticky, not for you to read, but for people who want to give their input, some very valuable input, about what technical problems they have about donating, and also tell why they eventually chose not to donate, and as you can see, I read it. I'm making a summary from all inputs in these threads, so we can try to eliminate the problems or work around them. And so far a lot of good ideas and input have been given. So these threads on the different boards serve a purpose, they are sticky so they are easy to find for people to post in and for us to find them and read them. And as soon as they have served their purpose, they'll be un-stickied again. I hope this answers your question. And thanks for all input, they are more important to us than you know. :-) It's all about psychology I suppose. For me stickies melt into the background and my instincts tell me the same thing happens with others. So I don't agree with what you say here; they are sticky so they are easy to find for people to post in and for us to find them and read them. Raising funds can be done is so many ways, but a stuffy technical scientific way is least likely to succeed for this as well as, eg, a TV campaign for breakfast honey. Some sort of campaign to make people feel proud to contribute money as well as computer time might help to prompt people into applying for the green star - a thread bobbing up and down to do this might help.

I read long ago somewhere (Scientific American?) that bees use very specific 'dancing' patterns when returning to the hive after a trip out, to communicate in what direction and how far away certain landmarks and targets are, so the rest can find them. In other words, they 'talk' by their dancing motions. Have you observed anything that might confirm that? Or is that just an unproven theory? Scientific theories are the best explanation for the facts. It has been proven. If you do things that change the dance of the returning bee the bees that are danced to go to the wrong (but predicted) location. This was in the expanded Scientific American article (book) that I have. I believe that one of the examples was to polarize the light that one bee saw during a trip. This changed the location that the returning bee indicated in a predictable manner. Yep it's true. The 'dance' of bees and reactions of others have been studyed and confirmed as a method of communication. They are broken down into what food can be found, in which direction, and how far away, etc. In my short 'career' as a beekeeper I never had a chance to study such dances, just trying to do the basics; finding the queen and making sure she looked OK (no queen no hive), killing queen cells (let a new queen develop and you lose all your best worker bees in a swarm) and making sure everything was OK, eg, that a small mouse hadn't got in or some horrible disease was developing. Oh, and working out if it was time to remove any of the 'supers' for honey. (Supers are the top parts of the hive where the queen can't go due to a queen excluder - holes through which the smaller workers can go but not the larger queen.) | 6736) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : CLOSED!

That's not quite true. Queen bees are usually bought with a 'nucleus', a small amount of worker bees (all female). After putting them in a hive the queen will build up the colony. Any bees trying to get in from other hives will be killed by the 'sentry' bees. If a queen is reared in a hive, she will usually rival the existing queen, and will usually take all the younger worker bees away to start another colony. This is called 'swarming', and is the way that bees propagate and expand their colonies and numbers. My grandfather had bees but I was very young when he died, so I don't remember all his comments about it. But yes, I have seen those little boxes with a bee queen, and when you have her, you have the whole swarm. There is so much to it you wouldn't believe Fuzzy. I went to night classes before starting beekeeping and spent 2 year keeping bees, but I was still learning. Bees will only swarm with a queen that is born in their own colony. However, two colonies can be joined. I've never tried this myself. but you put two hives together with just a sheet of newspaper between them (no gaps). Their instinct is to defend (not attack), but they hear each other and eventually chew holes in the newspaper and unite, having got used to each other's smells and sounds, and seeing each other as well. Two hives are often joined when one or both is weakened in number and unlikely to survive. For example, there must be enough in a huddle of bees to survive a winter. | 6741) Jan 2007 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: When you want a new beehive, all you need is a queen and then the others will arrive.

When you want a new beehive, all you need is a queen and then the others will arrive. What makes the (female) bees work so hard, and select those that tend only the Queen is still a mystery. The smell you speak of Fuzzy, is called pheromones. The bees will follow pheromones given out by other bees (not just queens). The technique I used to attract a swarm to a cardboard box was to take a handful of the bees, walk over the the cardboard box and throw the bees down by the box very hard, as if throwing ball down hard. Within half an hour or so later 99% of the bees swarming in the tree will be swarming by the cardboard box waiting for me the drop it over them and pick up the white sheet I had already laid underneath to take them back home. Finding the queen then becomes important. Because if you don't deal with her, they'll be swarming again very soon. | 6743) [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I give up, [show me](http://www.surfingwithangels.com/images/findqueen-x.jpg) where she is.

I have a certificate to show the weapon has been deactivated, which I have to produce on demand to any appropriate authority. I've only had to do this once so far.

The Americans can see the problem; they cannot support any more outsiders, they cannot make more schools for them, more hospitals, more booklets in another language wherever you go. So what's the compromise? Put up the barriers and give the illegal immigrants a sporting chance? Seems a good compromise to me. They're going to try whatever you do.

When your post is acted on by a moderator (deleted, undeleted, moved, locked, etc) you will get an email, as before. The email will include the name and the user number of the moderator. The same email will get sent to the setimods mailing list (setimods at ssl dot berkeley dot edu). If you disagree with the moderation, feel free to write to the setimods mailing list. Do not agrue with the moderator in the forum, or post the identity of the moderator. This will not be tolerated. Do not repost deleted messages without correcting them to remove the offending portions. Reposting deleted messages will result in banishment. I will no longer give warning of banishment for reposts before doing it. If the moderators agree the message should be undeleted, it will be undeleted. If not it will stay deleted. If you include signifcant portions (or all) of a deleted post in your reply, it will probably be deleted. Eric Since that thread was locked, I just wanted to express my thanks for making this happen. Its about time, and has been something that many on the boards have been wanting. Thank you again sir, and I hope you and the rest of the SETI staff have a great New Year!!!

And we think we are so wonderful, beyond this sort of manipulation and propaganda. Are we any better? There were just two questions about Saddam at the end. 1. Was he mad? Could he have been excused from his crimes due to mental health? 2. Did he believe that what he did was for God, for Allah, that what he did was right? It's not about what you believe, or whether he should have believed what the Sunnis believed, or what the Persians believed. Did he believe it, and was he rational, not mad? If he was mad pity him.

People came from miles around to see the famed hypnotist do his stuff. As Claude went to the front of the meeting room, he announced, \"Unlike most hypnotists who invite two or three people up here to be put into a trance, I intend to hypnotize each and every member of the audience.\" The excitement was almost electric as Claude withdrew a beautiful antique pocket watch from his coat. \"I want you each to keep your eye on this antique watch. It's a very special watch. It's been in my family for six generations.\" He began to swing the watch gently back and forth while quietly chanting, \"Watch the watch, watch the watch, watch the watch...\" The crowd became mesmerized as the watch swayed back and forth, light gleaming off its polished surface. Hundreds of pairs of eyes followed the swaying watch, until, suddenly, it slipped from the hypnotist's fingers and fell to the floor, breaking into a hundred pieces. \"S#!\u00c3\u00c2\u00a3\" said the Hypnotist.

This was subsumed by the Christian Church as the Epiphany, the manifestation of the divine nature of Jesus to the Gentiles as represented by the Magi. Another explanation goes: Joseph of Arimathea arrived in England on 25 December 63AD. This was regarded as a Feast day to celebrate his safe arrival (much like Thanksgiving is celebrated in USA). Somwhow a Hawthorn (I think) bush flowered on that dat and on 25th December (the 10th Month) ever since. England did not adopt the Gregorian calendar until 1752, by which time, the old calendar was 11 days out of sync ... this now fell on 6th January.

Leave it to a defense lawyer to come up with logic like that...lol I agree with you R/B...good riddance. Whilst I will never agree that Saddam was never anything but a bloodthirsty tyrant who deserved to be brought to justice, can you REALLY say that his trial was \"fair\". George Bush said that this morning. I wonder if his view would be changed if HE was the subject of such a travesty of justice. Surely a deaf-blind mute could have worked out that the Court was \"stacked\" and that Saddam had no chance at all from the word \"go\". If that is so, and if such is the new justice system under the new \"democracy\" imposed on Iraq by America - where on earth is the end for a Court System at all? I happen to believe that no man has the right to take another human's life. No way, not for ANY reason. All it shows is that those who do are no better than the criminals they put to death. We talked about a rapist being arrested in Ipswich UK earlier and knee capping him, and then found he was let go because they found the real rapist. But we all know Saddam is the real Tyrant. We all KNOW it. We are civilized and have asked the Iraqis to try him and carry out the punishment in a civilized way, their civilized way including hanging and capital punishment, but accepted by all as their 'civilized' way. I am happy with the outcome. I hope Saddam rots in hell. | 7011) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [iX, We will Miss you!](forum_thread.php?id=36767) ( [Message 493760](forum_thread.php?id=36767&postid=493760)) Posted 30 Dec 2006 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: I second that.

The money on Iraq is already squandered; much more will be squandered in an exit strategy that will never benefit the world, simply politicians trying to save face. What!...and leave all that oil behind??! If they could take the oil with them, they would've been gone long ago, believe me. They need an exit strategy that leaves them in control of the oil. That's not an easy thing to accomplish. Hi Beethoven. By 'exit strategy' I didn't mean simply walk away, but to get themselves out of the mess. No one thought the USA or UK would simply take over the oil and steal it all; what they wanted was a stable, democratic region, that would allow western access to the oil, as in, they pay for it. I've always said this war was about oil, and that the USA and UK would never had gone to the extent of waging war if there had been no oil there. Why else haven't they yet gone to war in other parts of the world were democracy is lacking? I have no doubt that if the USA and UK could drain away all the oil today, they would already be pulling out by nightfall. | 7084) zombie67 wrote: If I attach an avatar, will it be automatically scaled down to fit?

Just wonder if you can get to go to the same parties that God goes to when he's not doing his day job. Who created God? Every living thing has a mother, a parent. God ain't dead is he? I'm convinced that He's not dead, nor is His son Jesus. And like God was the father of Jesus Christ, it's possible that He also has a father, parents. But this is so far off of our imagination - we hardly can understand the idea of an eternal God having created our entire universe, so any higher generation older than God The Father is irrelevant to us: What is older than the universe? So to work out this idea remains speculations. Oh my, don't you accept that you can't speculate about God and 'he' is way off your imagination. Why try? You can't even understand what made 'you' let alone the maker of the maker. A machine made for a purpose has no business asking itself questions that hinder it achieving the purpose for which it was made. Your human body is a machine made by God for a reason, and you know what your reason is. Get on with it and stop stalling with these questions. But don't worry, if you can't do the job, in the trash bucket for you, God can always make another. Take this with a smile.

Siddharta Gautama, the first Buddha, was from India and the religion that developed around him can be said to be a response to Hinduism. If you call Hinduism a religion, you must also call Buddhism a religion. Here is why. The Enlightenment of which you speak was to reduce the karmic residue to zero. Positive karmic residue = reincarnation into a better life (or into a better \"form,\" including as a god or goddess in some level of Hindu heaven). Negative residue = ... you get the point. When attaining 0 karmic residue, the Samsaric reincarnation cycle would end and one could attain moksha, the final release. It depends on the definition of 'religion' I guess. If it involves worshiping a god and feeling blackmailed into going to hell if you do bad, then Buddhism is not a religion. It is just an awareness of how to live without man-made fears and restrictions. Ice, please see what I have bolded in the quote of my post. If you have information that contradicts my studies of southeast Asia and India from 1990 or my experiences with Buddhist Vietnamese refugees in 1982 or so, please let me know. Siddharta Gautama started 'Buddhism' two and a half thousand years ago. He was dissatisfied with the current religion of the day and gathered around him monks and nuns drawn from every tribe and caste, devoted to practicing the path or Dharma he had realized in that moment enlightenment. A path. Not a religion. If you or millions today want to call it a religion, that is for you. For me it is seeking the path to enlightenment. I follow my path as I have in my many life times. What you know is for you. What I know is for me. I am not a teacher of the path. I simply want to find my way to awareness. In approximately 486 BC, at the age of 80, the Buddha died. His last words are said to be... Impermanent are all created things; Strive on with awareness. Now you're shifting your argument. If I remember correctly, elsewhere you were saying something about a lack of gods in Buddhism, or a lack of worship, whatever. You haven't said anything yet to convince me my choice of words is incorrect. I don't have any problem with your choice of words Sarge. I just have a thing about what defines a religion and what it means to me. I have no problem with you or anyone else calling Buddhism a 'religion'; it's a label of small significance to me, but the debate is useful an interesting. My problem is that I will instinctively go to religion to pick bits out, for me. Hence my interest in Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and others. But no interest in Hinduism, Jehovah's Witnesses, paganism or others. Why is it a problem? Because I have better things to do that pander to my instincts. Life is too short.

I wonder what scare will come when Global Warming is found not to be producing all the predicted calamities? I expect it will be Global Wobbling.

I have posted on this before. Siddharta Gautama, the first Buddha, was from India and the religion that developed around him can be said to be a response to Hinduism. If you call Hinduism a religion, you must also call Buddhism a religion. Here is why. The Enlightenment of which you speak was to reduce the karmic residue to zero. Positive karmic residue = reincarnation into a better life (or into a better \"form,\" including as a god or goddess in some level of Hindu heaven). Negative residue = ... you get the point. When attaining 0 karmic residue, the Samsaric reincarnation cycle would end and one could attain moksha, the final release. It depends on the definition of 'religion' I guess. If it involves worshiping a god and feeling blackmailed into going to hell if you do bad, then Buddhism is not a religion. It is just an awareness of how to live without man-made fears and restrictions. Ice, please see what I have bolded in the quote of my post. If you have information that contradicts my studies of southeast Asia and India from 1990 or my experiences with Buddhist Vietnamese refugees in 1982 or so, please let me know. Siddharta Gautama started 'Buddhism' two and a half thousand years ago. He was dissatisfied with the current religion of the day and gathered around him monks and nuns drawn from every tribe and caste, devoted to practicing the path or Dharma he had realized in that moment enlightenment. A path. Not a religion. If you or millions today want to call it a religion, that is for you. For me it is seeking the path to enlightenment. I follow my path as I have in my many life times. What you know is for you. What I know is for me. I am not a teacher of the path. I simply want to find my way to awareness. In approximately 486 BC, at the age of 80, the Buddha died. His last words are said to be... Impermanent are all created things; Strive on with awareness. by Post: Hello Dan and iCe! Hope you are recouping nicely from the Christmas Day festivities.

And I wonder how many parents still tell their children that if they don't go to church they will go to hell? What's with all this blackmail? And to the children? I think the blackmailing is because these parents don't know it better - they were taught the same by their parents and those by theirs and so on... Do I make the impression to want to make everybody else attend a church? Oops. I only tried to share my view. Well, I attend a church to meet people who believe the same way as I do, to learn from them etc. That's fine, to go to church by your own choice rather than a compelling need to do so, such as a requirement go to heaven or to impress the vicar with your attendance. I would happily go to church for a christening, and even have done so on a Christmas Eve. In particular, I generally love to go in old churches and cathedrals. On occasions I even stop my car in a village where I see an interesting old church, and I will chance to see if it is open and wander around inside. I love to study the stained glass windows and the statues in particular. It's not for some reason of hobby, but to try and connect to that God which keeps eluding me. I hastily add that it's not only in old churches that I am tracking God down. I even look at things he's made, like bus shelter adverts. | 7177) |[Message by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: [Paul Simon - Obvious Child!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oS34kStpmc) I'm accustomed to a smooth ride Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more I don't expect to sleep through the night Some people say a lie's a lie's a lie But I say why Why deny the obvious child?

Of course, in the past six decades or so, India has been divided along those lines. Hence, the existence of Pakistan and Bangladesh, if memory serves me correctly. Is Buddhism a religion? I don't think The Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, would have said so, or true Buddhists today. In Buddhism, a buddha is any being who has become fully awakened (enlightened), has permanently overcome greed, hate, and ignorance, and has achieved complete liberation from suffering. Add \"from moderators\" and you can make it a religion for SETI if you like. | 7196) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe - [Message 490796](forum_thread.php?id=36481&postid=490796)) Posted 26 Dec 2006 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: morning all.

You haven't made a case for that at all. Es, just pull those earplugs out and listen. I'd have better luck talking to a tree than to you. The modded posts were all signed E.A. Blair. And if it wasn't him, then ALL you mods have no integrity at all. It must be a free-for-all party for you and I'm sure you're loving it. And stop with this \"I haven't got a genuine complaint\".

I had real bad luck there. A lady pushed in front of me and sat down to fruit machine when it was my turn - I had to take the one next to her. Then she won the jackpot. And I felt sick. It was like thousands and thousands of dollars. I went home thinking of ways to strangle her. LOL! I won the jackpot in Las Vegas. That's all that matters. It was dimes, about $130 LOL!!! iCe!

They did agree on one thing, that it was people causing a lot of the problems, or rather the escalating population rises across the globe. They also noticed the acute problems in Africa and how many of them dissipated way after AIDS struck and dramatically reduced such explosive population rises.

Ripley's Doesn't Make A Believer Out Of This Boy GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. - A sixth-grade Michigan youth didn't believe it when he read it takes light from the sun four minutes to reach Earth in Ripley's \"Planet Eccentric!\" So David Beerens of suburban Grand Rapids, Mich., pointed out the error to his teacher and wrote a letter to Ripley Entertainment, the Grand Rapids Press reported. \"You should be proud of the fact that you were able to spot this, as it is something that slipped by all of our editors, Ripley Entertainment Executive Vice President Norm Deska wrote in response. \"Also, out of the hundreds of thousands of books we sold, you are the only one that saw the mistake, and more impressively, took the time to let us know.\" So how long does it take light from the sun to reach the Earth? Believe it or not, it's 8.32 minutes. Well, not to dispute the 8.32 Min.; as this could be correct, today... However, I distinctly remember many times over the course of my education that I was told by several Teachers up through High School that it was approximately 6-Min. for light from the Sun to reach the Earth. However; the last time I heard the 6-Min rule was back in 1983, so with the advancement in technology from then to now I will defer to the 8.32 Min. statement as fact... I am only making this statement to show that I too paid attention in school. ;-D I always knew it as 8 minutes.

Did they not see the planes actually fly into the buildings? Not to mention it would be a ridiculously brave person to bring down those towers and claim all those lives just to make an insurance claim. Oh but if they were so stupid, why did they also fly a plane into the Pentagon. Come on, stop being so stupid... Just to put things into perspective, the conspiracy theory is that 6 weeks before 9/11 a new owner took possession of the twin towers, took out a massive insurance policy, wired the buildings with explosives for demolition without anybody noticing, and when the planes hit them decided to push the plunger to bring the buildings down and to collect on the insurance, with everybody thinking it was the planes that did it. At the same time, a building next door holding embarrassing government secrets was also demolished by same demolition crew, obliterating all said embarrassing evidence, hoping everybody would accept that adjacent buildings could be destroyed, which, err, some were. I don't really care about this theory, I just know it was the terrorists that started it, it was the terrorists that caused it, and it's the terrorists that have to be made to pay for this. The Freedom Tower will be a symbol for many things, one of which will be a reminder that no matter what it takes, the terrorists will be defeated.

Trials are there so the rest of us can feel as good about getting the right guy as the Cops were when they arrested someone. Cops lie! They are human, they also make mistakes. Killing someone before a trial is inhumane because then IF we have the wrong person, the right one gets away with it, until they kill again. Then what do we do about the innocent one we killed?

Before last years win, definately a myth. Now i would say its just a plain conspiracy!! Pardon my ignorance ( and the fact that I am too lazy to look it up ) but what the heck does \" won the Ashes \" mean? \"The series is named after a satirical obituary published in The Sporting Times in 1882 after the match at The Oval, in which Australia beat England in England for the first time. The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.

They then get to meet their maker, and because of the grief they have experienced; he decides to grant them one wish each, before they enter Paradise. They're all lined up, and God asks the first one what the wish is. \"I want to be gorgeous,\" and so God snaps his fingers and it is done. The second one in line hears this and says \"I want to be gorgeous too.\" Another snap of his fingers and the wish is granted. This goes on for a while with each one asking to be gorgeous but when God is halfway down the line, the last guy in the line starts laughing. When there are only ten people left, this guy is rolling on the floor, laughing his head off. Finally, God reaches this last guy and asks him what his wish will be.

It is so easy to find a 'rule' that you broke if your employer decided he doesn't like your face any more. In more book that is utterly wrong and should be condemned, not installing a harmless program on your PC. The problems I would see is that the employer foots the extra electricity costs that BOINC and project applications would incur. At my work place the five computers are used for about 12 hours and the CPU usage is not constant. I don't know how much BOINC and the applications would cost in electricity but it would add up especially if BOINC is used on several. Plus the wear on the HDD's. The proper and ethical solution would be to get the employer's permission first. Of course the ethics are right. But the excuses used to fire are wrong. The 'extra' electricity used on an already turned on and running PC is negligible, and wear on a HDD is irrelevant; they outlive most parts of a PC and get binned when still working when the PC is disposed of when, eg, the power supply or motherboard goes, or it's just simply replaced by another newer model. | 7656) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe Posted 16 Dec 2006 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: [quote]Or if you can afford a bit more...

The notion that an employer can use a minuscule breakage of a rule to fire somebody. Never mind that they have given years of service or that he himself and other management are breaking rules on a vast scale by pocketing expenses that they shouldn't and taking advantage of 'perks' when they shouldn't. Installing BOINC an a company PC may be against company rules, but what harm is it doing? Exactly what damage is it causing and what monetary gain is transferred from the employer to the employee?

It is well established that the global temperature has gone up slightly over the last 150 years or so. What I am saying is that it has not been established that mankind has had any but a negligible effect on global temperatures or climate. Or that mankind can do anything about the natural changes that do occur. Another established fact is that the Earth has been, for most of the history of life on the planet, much warmer than it has been during the recorded history of mankind. At this point, given the state of research, I can only conclude that the proponents of \"Oh my God, man is KILLING the earth!\" global warming are crooks looking for money. Also, those who actually take the word of that group and want to force everyone elso to reverse the supposed effects on climate are in the position of Caligula commanding the tide to stay out. Just a small point, but it's not \"man is KILLING the earth\", but \"man is KILLING man\".

Is it reasonable to have a law that punishes people for acting in dire straits? Or to interpret a law as covering actions made in dire straits and for fear of one's own life? Let's suppose there was an automatic death penalty if those men were convicted of murder. (In fact, I think that was the case during 17th Century England. I'll have to check.) I can't let you support your position on the basis that, if convicted of murder, the sentences would be lenient. If you as a judge were giving instructions to that jury about the law of homicide, would you instruct them that killing another person while in dire straits, fearing reasonably for their own deaths unless they did so, nonetheless constituted murder, ie unjustifiable homicide? I think understand your point Beethoven. British soldiers were sentenced to death and were shot dead by firing squad for desertion in WW1, when over 300 of them were recently posthumously pardoned because it has been shown that they suffered from shell shock and were not in control of them selves when they ran away. They didn't kill anyone, but it just shows how difficult it is to apply the law - \"in some cases\". The law in our society is clear - if you willfully and unlawfully kill someone you are guilty of murder. If there are circumstance that might allow a judge to apply a less lenient sentence - then that is what judges are there for. To be specific, if the two of us are about to die, and I think you are more dead than me, and we are both dead in 20 minutes anyway. If I think by killing you and eating you I can live - ie, instead of both of us dieing, at least I can live. Would I be guilty of murder if I killed you in my 'dire' circumstance? My answer is Yes. If the answer is No, then I woke up in the wrong world. Beam me up Scotty. | Nov by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: So, I put it to you: Were these men in a state of civilized society or were they acting out of necessity in a state of nature? When in dire circumstances you will think of your own needs rather than what the law says. We all do it every day, We don't intend to break the law, but we pick up parking tickets - because we have broken the law. Society makes laws and applies them across the board. If a law doesn't work it has to be changed. If it stands it has to be obeyed. Of course there are difficulties. Fuzzy has highlighted one of these. Assisted deaths are going on in hospitals every day, but conveniently not classified as murder, despite individuals directly contributing to a premature death of a sick person.

Complaints from the community mean that at least someone is bothered by the contents -- and we're starting to see a lot of complaints. Could we take it down a notch, folks? Please?? Some people complain, not about the post but about the poster. Knightmare has adressed this problem before. Some people do really have too much focus on what certain posters post, maybe they should use the filter function and else just ignore that or those posters, they don't like? People are allowed to post, as long as they meet the requirements from the project. This includes BrainSmashR too. The only problem with ignore lists, is that everyone wants to know what every one is saying, so they click the link to be able to see the ignored posts. Doesn't accomplish anything. I have used the cocktail party analogy before, I'll try again. At a cocktail party you mingle and usually you join in that group you feel at home in and where your friends are. If you see a person, you simply can't stand, standing in the other end of the room, you don't walk over to that person and scream into his/her face how much you dislike him/her, do you? No, you ignore that person, mostly by simply staying away from that person. Same, when you mingle in the crowd, you pass that group, where this person, you simply can't stand the voice of, and you accidentally pick up some words. The words are not meant for you personally, they were said to someone else, who's not ignoring that person. You don't join the crowd around that person and start throwing comments and/or insults to him/her, do you? No, you close your ears to that voice, and you move on the next group, where you can't hear the voice anymore. Or even if a person, you don't want any contact with at all, address you, in a cocktail party you have two options, you can pretend you haven't heard it and then ignore him/her, or you can answer as polite as possible and then get away before the conversation develops into something you don't want to bother yourself with and you consider a waste of time. And at a cocktail party you simply avoid any contact with those you don't want to be bothered with, either it's a direct ignoring or you chose to close your ears to that voice, if you can't avoid it. Does this make sense? Behaving in cyberspace how you would behave in real life with that courtesy you show people in real life. Yes, this makes sense Fuzzy. I understand what you are saying and your point is well made. However, I might worry that this might be seen by some as an excuse for obnoxious people to do and say what they please. This is not a cocktail party, this the Cafe forum associated to SETI@Home, and perhaps more respect to all in a 'membership' type group should be shown, rather that comments made in open when they should not.

Basically when you send an email a charge will be levied, whether the email reaches it's destination or not. So if you send 4 million spam emails, you have to pay 4 million levies up front.

The man was found guilty and a sentenced. The guilt or the sentence should not be changed because of his age or circumstances.

Besides 9? Yes! I'd love to! It's simply the name of a planet from the Scifi book \"Dune\" by Frank Herebert. Ix is the machine planet which made many of the thinking machines that enslaved humanity, and then produced the hi-liners that allowed freed humanity to travel vast distances in space without moving; called space-folding. From here to the other side on any universe in the blink of an eye! I reversed the capitalization to make iX, to make it mine. It was never meant to be 9. Because 9 is not the name of a planet LOL. In fact Ix was the ninth planet in its system. Well I'll be.. I didn't know that. Maybe it was too obvious, but they should have called it Pluto :) In the first Dune book, called 'Dune', there is a 'Terminology of the Imperium'. This is what is says about Ix; IX: see Richeshe RICHESE: fourth planet of Eridani A, classed with Ix as supreme in machine culture. | 8052) Nov by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Good morning to everybody from Cafe@Home! :) We are all feeling wonderful and looking forward to you meeting you for [breakfast](http://www.cafeathome.org) :) | [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) [ ](http://www.cafeathome.org) is open for Nov [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Start again - been done \"by me\" I'm the Forum Modulator remember I set the tone...

Everyone else can cry and whine about leaving, so now I can have my turn. Yea, I know Jeremy. It's Jonathan's intention. Build a board and have it all working, just in case people want to go there. Stay here, go there, yo-yo between the two, whatever. The fact is the new board is up and running and you can choose to join or not. Stay here or not. Or join it is as another board, just as some are members of many boards. Me? I've joined everyone below, active in as many as time allows. UOTD in SZTAKI recently :) Nov 2006 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: You don't get my point, do you? You advertise your board here, you get complaints here. I don't think YOU get it Fuzzy. THIS thread is about a new board, for which adverts are being placed. EVERYBODY advertises with their signatures. The BBC CCE complaints ARE NOT brought HERE. If they were, Jeremy would have dealt with them in exactly the same way - go complain in the originating board. Get it? | Nov 2006 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: To be honest, I don't know what the fuzz is about. You advertise your board here and ask people to come over and join. And when they then do, and for some reasons, known to themselves and those who have seen the posts in question over there, they are unhappy and post about it here, they are being flamed here. This doesn't make sense to me. People will be unhappy about something, you will have unsatisfied customers, no matter what, they will take it to the places you are advertising, in this case here. BrainSmasheR joined your board, he became unhappy about something on it, he complains. You advertise here, why should he be muzzled about his critique here? You only want happy customers to post here? EDIT: To the tricker happy mods, I am not flaming, I am not flamebaiting, I am only stating my oppinion. I hope this is Ok?

Actually it was the other way round, the guvnor pulled you a 1/2 of bitter and topped a light ale to go with it, which you added yourself. Yup, went though a phase of that, and also brown & mild. In those days with the old wooden barrels, the cannier publicans poured the bitter slops back into the mild barrels!!! Do you remember the Lager Top?

Although the Brits said it was horrible. Sorry bout that, I had my country wrong... Well back in the 1960's we had \"pale Ale\" in 1/2 pint bottles, and \"light ale\" also in 1/2 pint bottles. The pale ale was stronger and was also known as \"IPA\" or india pale ale that originated in the days of the British Raj in India. Watneys Red barrel was a draught bitter about that time, which was universally slated due to its taste and weakness. [edit] who remembers Party 7's ???

The puzzle is that a heck of a lot of CO2 got locked up in rocks, oil, shell deposits etc over a vast amount of time. But now most of it is being released in the atmosphere suddenly (since the start of the Industrial Revolution to today - a very short moment in Earth's history). | 8253) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Posted 14 Nov 2006 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Rather than the current situation where 'the west' is better off because they exploited and plundered the resources of the 3rd world? Yes, that's a good point. I have often pointed out that we in Britain have become rich because of the Industrial Revolution, and have spewed out all the pollution that we did, and now we point a worrying finger at China and India as they better themselves economically, spewing out more pollutants and CO2 than ever. But it's correct that we neglect the 3rd world as we argue over who should pay what to clean up a mess that might kill us if we don't, and it's this argument which is in itself delaying action when some scientists are saying it could be too late if we don't act soon. The wealth of Britain is founded on things like the slave trade, the piracy done by the East India trading company, the Empire and the industrial revolution..those were our 'glory' days. We didn't 'make' the wealth..we simply took it from other parts of the world. Then we let them take all our pollution, and now we complain about having to subsidise them to help keep their pollution down as they try to recover from what the West did to them. We started with vast quantities of coal and trees (which we turned into charcoal) and when leached from the British Isles we imported vast amounts more to burn and release mega tons of CO2. Everyone can remember having a coal fire which all gave us individual guilt for more of it released in the atmosphere, as we still do with car exhaust fumes. The initial wealth of Britain came from wool, from sheep grazing in Britain. That created the means for industrialisation and wealth to build a navy to rule the world and suck the world dry to make sure every Britton has a mobile phone today. But is it about survival as doom and gloom is preached about Climate Change? Or are we worried that the poor in the world simply use this scare as a pretext to shifting some of the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s wealth over to them, primarily so that they can also have mobile phones? The analogy is simple. Is the beggar on the Mexican border really starving and needs a meal for her daughter to survive, or is she merely holding out for and nice new dress and a lollipop to give to her child? Are we going to risk giving her the money, only to see them latter clutching ice lollies and looking a lot happier and well dressed than when holding out hands earlier? | 8254) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Posted 14 Nov 2006 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: The supporting research is all economic in nature, dealing exclusively with the economic impact of the dire global warming predictions used as the base assumption of the report.

It doesn't say that some countries will have to pay more than 1%, but will gain less for this investment than other countries who will pay far less than 1% but stand to gain much more than any. In other words, in 20 years time some countries will be much better off because 'the west' has paid for it.

Damit, this happened to me. I was trying to find a parking space in Windsor on a very busy-packed-out-with-American-tourists Sunday (Sunday could be significant) and lo and behold whilst driving around with dozens of other cars I miraculously found a parking space. \"That was lucky\" I said. \"No\", she said sitting next me, \"I asked the Parking Angel to find us a space, and she answered my prayer\".

Some of the big food chains are selling almost everything now. They are driving the small business out. Perhaps they do contribute towards charity, but I don't know to what extent. We're not told much about what these big organizations do behind the scenes. They could argue that they do help the less well off because they can lower their retail prices, unlike the smaller businesses. Their goods are pretty cheap so great for low income families to buy from, as long as those families can afford a car to get to their often out-of-town complexes. But even so, I think we are kept in the dark a lot about how much they contribute towards charitable causes, if at all. I'm sure most businesses would like to help society out. But they don't. They are there to make money for their shareholders and are obliged to put profit, growth, and more profit at the top of their agendas. A little bit of token charity here and there helps with their advertising, and I doubt if they give the small businesses that they are putting out of business every day a second thought. | 8560) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe 441696](forum_thread.php?id=34022&postid=441696)) 22 Oct 2006 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Sunrise at Seaton in Devon Nice pic.

This is more than a side note and probably the crux to it all. Nobody is saying there should be a law on what you must wear, or not, in addition to any current US/UK laws. Some people choose (or are compelled by their religion, so they say) to wear a veil. We are talking about a black headdress with only a small slit to allow the person to see through. (I say people because this is not an issue about sex). These people do not currently go into banks, where they would certainly be challenged to remove the veil in the same way that you would be asked to remove the ski mask. But they haven't done this yet, and have not 'needed' to complain about being victimized in this way, yet. They are using the case of the school teacher to change the law so that they can walk into a bank, fully veiled, and fully protected by the law against anyone asking them to remove the veil.

Our records show that you've been with SETI@home since 15 March 2006, but it's been 218 days since you last returned a work unit. We want you back, and here's why: These are exciting times for SETI@home. We recently installed a new SETI@home data recorder at the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. This recorder is attached to a state-of-the-art multibeam receiver, so we can now measure signals from 7 positions on the sky at once, with greater sensitivity to weak signals compared to the data from the flat feed antenna we've used since 1999. Coupled with a new application, SETI@home Enhanced, we've greatly increased the sensitivity of our data analysis, and the likelihood that we'll find the first signs of extraterrestrial life. We're also testing a second application, Astropulse, which will look for extremely short pulses of astronomical (and possibly intelligent) origin. With these new developments comes an increase in required computing power, for which we depend on people like you. We hope you will consider signing back on with SETI@home, and help in this wonderful scientific venture blah blah blah. I'm RACing over 600 fer goodness sakes. Hello! I'm here! Am I invisible?

Is this not discrimination on grounds of religion or belief? Why should the Government of Saudi Arabia be allowed to dabble in discrimination whilst the same is not allowed for others? Sheesh, sometimes this is painful... It's a principle. It's wrong whichever gov't does it. And they all do. Mostly because people beg them to do so. Saying \"sheesh\" adds nothing to the rightness or wrongness of what is a fact of life. And btw, you added nothing to the general debate in your reply above. If it is wrong, whichever Government does it, then why do you not agitate to change your Government's attitude towards Saudi Arabia. Your Government wished to introduce \"Democracy\" to Iraq, and unleashed a hellish war on that Country. Why do you, Mr Rush, not stand on your soap-box and agitate for that same \"Democracy\" to be afforded the prro people of Saudi Arabia? I don't think the debate is about democracy or what a gov't should or shouldn't do. It's not about sex, race, or religion. It's about culture. It was suggested that visitors to Saudi Arabia (I've never been there) dress to respect their culture. Yet people come to the UK wearing their culture and try to enforce it as a right over and above the existing culture in the UK and even try to force a change in UK culture by using the excuse of religion to get a change in the law to enforce their culture. | 8588) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Posted 20 Oct 2006 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Happy Birthday Robert :) By the way, where has he been lately?

I agree with you 100% on this Es, I don't think the law should tell us what to wear, or what not to wear (within boundaries of decency). The young lady in question ascertains she is under the law of her religion to wear the veil rather than a choice of dress code. She claims that her religious rights are being violated by a 'common sense' request to remove something which impedes face to face conversation. This, her employers claim, reduces her ability to carry out her job of teaching. This is not a religious issue, although the young lady and her backers are trying to make it one, but one of someone simply asking a women to consider the problems caused by wearing a veil if they wish to carry out this type of teaching employment, and to please remove it when he is trying to talk to her otherwise it just doesn't make it best for the welfare of teaching the children. | 8594) [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: / / Awsome Bike Max!

I understand that the start of all of this was a few months ago when the assistant was teaching a class of children without her veil. A male school teacher walked in to speak to her and she put on the veil. He asked her to remove it so that he could talk to her properly, and she started her actions of complaint from this point. Who said what, when, is now incidental since this case is being picked up as the test case as to whether a woman can be asked to remove a veil to make for proper communication. It is also true that nowhere in the religion of Islam does it state that a woman must wear a veil in the presence of a man not her husband or otherwise. It is an interpretation chosen by some Islamic women, and an interpretation forced on some Islamic women. We have a situation in the UK where 'outsiders' are coming into the UK and are in the process of establishing their ways as being rights which must be imposed on all in the UK, to supersede the existing rights, for example, of proper communication without veils over our faces. | 8603) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 19 Oct 2006 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Apologies to Tom for wandering off topic.

It's understandable why you would want to accociate more with people from a team that's more active on these forums. Not being part of a team that has many active posters here can make one feel like an outsider I guess. You're right, apparently I am the only member of The Knights Who Say Ni! that posts (regularly) in this part of the forum. Although a few do post in number crunching. Hmm, perhaps sleepy isn't the right word. I think that other members of the KWSN may avoid posting here in the cafe partly because of the environment, and the tension that arises from time to time. It's somewhat easy for one to be misunderstood. Many people that post in the number crunching board probably avoid posting here for the same reasons. Hey, I hadn't thought about that. I like to dabble in the science forums, but the number crunching just is so... boring. However, maybe I'll make the effort to have a look from time to time, see what your knights are up to.

I expect I might be changing my signature shortly. Did you try posting about your situation over at our team board? That might be the better way to get some support. Also, I think that the BBC climate project is different from [CPDN](http://climateapps2.oucs.ox.ac.uk/cpdnboinc/forum_index.php). So if the KWSN team does't take part in the BBC's project as much as some of the other projects, that could be why. Unless it's the same climate project? Damn, the hell if I know, besides SETI, Einstein and Climate Prediction, I really don't no much about all of the other BOINC projects or how much our team is involved in them. The BBC isn't as free-speechy as you might think. While they do claim to be neutral, they would probly be a little protective of the politicians from the two major political parties. Anyways, that's the impression I have. So, don't give up on our team yet. :) Sorry A/C, I never did reply to this. I have changed team here to The Final Front Ear and to England in BBC CCE. Whilst The Knights Who Say Ni! are highly present in most forums, they do not post here (apart from you) and they do not post in BBC CCE (apart from an exception a while ago). Whilst it's good to join a team and stick with it, it becomes a bit lonely and pointless if only one out of some tens or hundreds are posting. In any case, I'd rather associate myself with active posters who get into so much humor and 'wind down let down your hair and have a good chat' that does it for me. It's mainly about participation - and I'd rather be in a group doing some of it. I wish you all the best with your (sleeping) knights. The reason I dug up this old thread because I was looking for the Star Trek Tread. Someone on Siran t' T'Khasi's thread suggested there were people that didn't like Star Trek. I was banned from the BBC CCE forum for 2 weeks for placing a link to one of the Star Trek gifs here. Nothing that would break the rules for decency, under 18 etc. Simply because I used it to poke fun at the recruiting tactics of one of the teams in BBC CCE. I would wholeheartedly agree that some don't like Star Trek (What's wrong with them?!). Anyways, I just wanted to give my answer to A/C as to why I've changed team here. iX | 2006 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Most of us are still half asleep as well......

It was mainly about the different ways a building could be demolished. Conspiracies as to why they might have been demolished came as a development of the video. I often watch films and enjoy them to the point that it all gets unreal and the plot unsustainable. That point was reached for me when they started on about this guy doing it all for $9 billion insurance and was in league with the USA defense and who knows else.

Just copy mine :) | by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: What Does RAC Mean? The short definition is Recent Average Credit. The long answer could be; an estimate of the average number of credits granted per day. However it is not calculated just by dividing the total credits by the number of days the task has run. The formula is influenced by credits granted in the last several weeks with recent credits having more effect than those given some time ago. Because of this the value of the RAC rises quickly to begin with and then begins to rise less quickly to a peak after several weeks. Any loss of credits on a particular day, whether it be due to problems with the task itself requiring a restore from backup, or the server not granting credits for several hours after the update can have an effect on these calculations resulting in the graph falling off. This effect will only be annulled when it is pushed back to several weeks before the current date. Because of this RAC is not a good measure of the progress rate, but can look impressive if you want to boast about it.

You are right about the concerns about the North Atlantic Drift. Temperatures in the UK would be 5 to 10 degrees C lower without it's moderating effect, so if this stopped we would indeed be buying warmer winter coats. Right now, however, we are experiencing exceptionally hot summers with major water shortages and drought conditions such that parts of England are experiencing Mediterranean-like climates. Someone is planting an olive grove in Devon, southern England, (first and only in the UK) which is expected to be in full production in five years or so.

No. Because a second is the time it takes for an atom of Cesium-133 to perform 9,192,631,770 complete oscillations -like I said on my last post-, and under the same circumstances an atom of Cesium-133 behaves the same on any planet, or anywhere in the universe for that matter. A second is no longer 1/86400 of an earth mean solar day. It hasn't been since 1967. ;) OK thanks, you're quite right. It makes my case all the more compelling. A second on Earth equals a second on Pluto. Therefore since Earth is a planet, then Pluto is a planet. Look, let's not push up the bids too much. We can get Pluto for a steal and draw straws for it.

Admittedly I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t worry too much about the doom and gloom forecasts because doom and gloom just never comes to pass. Well I guess maybe there was that flood Noah dealt with if you\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2re inclined to believe that, but even then we seemed to have survived. Last time I checked we aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t extinct. Now I do get frustrated at those that are more or less in in agreement with me who argue the earth isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t getting warmer because it is, all you have to do is check the data. Arguing that it isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t warming is to look like an idiot and you\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2re not helping the cause. But if you want to know why I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t worry much about the global warming thing check the money quote from the first article: He said research undertaken by Harvard University revealed that US government spending on energy research had not increased since 2001. In order to make any progress, funding for climate technology needed to multiply by three or four times, Professor Holdren warned.That\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s right, we can only solve this issue if we give three to four times as much research money to Professor Holdren. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s not the greenhouse gases that are the problem, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s the research money. I plan on keeping my money and not worrying too much about the doom and gloom. Like I said, they never happen and even if they do, somewhere there is some lunatic building a modern version of the required arc. I may not get to ride with Noah, but I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2m going to take my chances that I won\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t need to.\" [/quote=\"Tommy\"] I disagree with the view that climate change is 'obvious' such that we must all sit back and thinking there is little that can be done. We need to get into research and climate models big time before it's too late to do anything about it, since climate change is 'obvious'. It's not about declaring doom and gloom but trying to be realistic about recognizing that we need to identify and quantify what is going on and shove the need to do something about it in the right faces. | 8740) |[Message [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: [Approved by God](http://thatvideosite.voxcdn.com/core/856/family_guy_jesus.wmv) The rhythm was good, the moves fairly novel for the time I would say, the body language excellent, and the beat pretty good.

So then we train our Optical Seti recievers on it, lasers having the capacity of carrying huge amounts of data, and find the _real_ message, which would include Galactic Encyclopedias, terabytes of VIDEO showing what their civilization and home-world(s) are like, ect. This doesn't require 2-way communication, only a repeating signal from the ETs, which would be both an intermittent radio-pulse, and occasional laserbeam to ping a few million stars. How practical would a method like this be for the aliens? Anyone know? This sounds to me more like a possibility than actually meeting an alien, given the difficulties discussed.

Not if they sent it a long time ago. If they are not yet extinct, and we are still around when the signal arrives, how long would it take us to decode and reply? I think that depends. If a signal is coming from, say, a hundred light years away, it would take a hundred light years to reach us. To reply to the signal, if and when we manage to decode it, it will take another hundred light years to get back to them. Radio waves will travel at the speed of light. However, the chances of another civilization being within a hundred light years of earth is probably very remote. Susan. So, since we are in no position to move nearer to them, the only way we could have a meaningful discussion with ET is if they are already racing towards us, closing the gap. Which is unlikely because they probably don't know where we are, even if they had the means of extremely fast space travel and invented it some time ago.

But two wrongs never make it right. It does not make it right that Israel can carry on targeting civilians, and killing them, just because the other side are wrong. Israel knew what they were targeting. It was not a case of \"Oh dear, we killed some more civilians that time, we didn't know there might be any there\".

It's hard enough trying to cope with the thought that matter appeared from nothing. Much harder to then try to wrap a brain around the idea that this spontaneously happened an infinite number of times. Let's face it, the concept of infinity is is still a little hard to comprehend. It would seem that a lot of people on this planet believe there is some kind of an omnipotent being who looks over us and is a father figure if you will. It might be interesting to consider, if such a creature does or did exist, then what would such an omnipotent being be like in another universe or would there even be one. Well, you've explained something to me. I always though that if there were such a being, (I am assuming there is only one, not one for each universe - hadn't though about that possibility), if there is such a being, then they are obviously not very interested in what was happening around here and are away in some far more interesting place in the universe. | 8843) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) this newcomer?](forum_thread.php?id=33043) [Message 400498](forum_thread.php?id=33043&postid=400498)) Posted 18 Aug 2006 by [GalaxyIce](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8407071) Post: Well, what I was wanting to do is recieve some sort of sound transmission from stars, how is that possible?
