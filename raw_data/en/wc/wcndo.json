While the report covers the academic year from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020, it is being assembled in the fall of 2020 while the COVID pandemic still rages around us. Yet there was more to the year than COVID. Our research productivity continued its upward trend as measured in increased number of grants, publications and citation counts. Our postgraduate students enjoyed their first full year of the new CBD curriculum and our faculty continue to learn new ways to provide the education and ongoing feedback students are looking for. To further support faculty engagement, the Department of Medicine formed an Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Committee in the Spring of 2020 with an official launch in July. I look forward to the committee's recommendations in the year ahead. And then of course there was COVID. The pandemic forced a sudden and unexpected shift in focus for everyone. While some faculty faced reduced access to patients, putting in-person clinics and research on hold, several were able to pivot and contribute to the growing body of knowledge about the novel corona virus. Several COVID-19 related publications are included in this year's publication list. I want to acknowledge the contributions and extraordinary efforts of the Department of Medicine team from throughout the province. From administrative assistants juggling student schedules, to the leadership provided by faculty from Infectious Diseases /Microbiology and other divisions, to in-hospital COVID teams developing and implementing new protocols, to presenters for the COVID-19 Bootcamps ensuring your colleagues are informed and educated, and to all faculty for your flexibility and resilience; your efforts are noted and appreciated. Thank you to everyone who contributed to the success of the department this year. We will continue to learn from each other and support each other in the months ahead as we look forward to a return to a new normal. DR.

It was very encouraging to see the Department of Medicine members pull together during this very difficult time. The department was more united than ever and is well positioned to face additional challenges posed by the pandemic. LEADERSHIP ROLE The Department of Medicine quickly assumed a leadership role within the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) in preparedness and planning for the Covid-19 pandemic. Department members led and participated in various SHA committees including the following examples: COVID testing group COVID screening working group PPE group Respiratory guidelines group re safe use of CPAP and BiPAP group SFCC COVID advice line Development of training and educational material re management of COVID Field Hospital Committee Upskilling Committees and Redeployment and Ethics Committee re: pandemic contracts Pandemic Area Chief of Staff for Regina Pandemic Site leads - RUH and SPH Pandemic Physician Co-Lead for Virtual Care SHA for Regina Pandemic Physician Site Lead for Wascana Rehabilitation Centre PATIENT CARE Department members quickly reorganized clinical activities. In Saskatoon they initially formed four COVID teams; two at Royal University Hospital and two at St. Paul's Hospital. On very short notice, Department of Medicine members volunteered to provide additional inpatient coverage on these teams as well as expanded ICU teams and back up call schedules. Department members also worked with the System Flow Coordination Centre (SFCC) to support \"care in place\" to reduce transfers to larger centres and to provide support to physicians outside major centres. Working with the SHA Digital Health Program, all members adapted to the new reality and adopted virtual care models. The Department of Medicine was one of the few units which never saw a decline in clinical volume. On the contrary, our clinical commitments during the pandemic Department of Medicine University of Saskatchewan Annual Report 2019 - 2020 8 | P a g e rose dramatically. Several department members were involved in quickly creating new virtual multidisciplinary clinics; for example, the Neurology team worked with members of the Respirology Division to create an ALS/motor neuron disease clinic. RESEARCH The Department of Medicine set up a rapid response research call and was able to fund three research teams whose projects focused on COVID related issues. The College of Medicine partnered with the Respiratory Research Centre to fund three additional COVID related research projects. In addition to these competitions, several other Department of Medicine researchers are actively conducting research in COVID related fields either as principal investigators or as members of national teams. The range of investigations spans sub-speciality and geographic areas including Cardiology, Infectious Diseases, General Internal Medicine, Rheumatology, Neurology, Respirology and CCHSA, with work being carried out in Saskatoon, Regina, Prince Albert and Moose Jaw. Most other research programs were put on hold for several months and resumed in accordance with University of Saskatchewan Resumption of Research Planning. Dr. Darcy Marciniuk has had a leadership role in this regard within the Vice President of Research Office. TEACHING Department of Medicine academic duties also had to be changed on short notice. This required a transition to virtual platforms whenever possible. In her role as UGME Assistant Dean Curriculum, Dr. Regina Taylor-Gjevre has been overseeing the re-organization of the UGME program curriculum and curriculum delivery during the initial and subsequent stages of the pandemic in Saskatchewan. Department members are also actively involved in educating the public about COVID-19 through both local media and social media, or as featured guest speakers / resource persons for multidisciplinary projects such NeuroSask: Active and Connected which remotely engaged people with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury and Parkinson's disease. CME EDUCATION Sixteen Department of Medicine members contributed to the Department of Medicine COVID- 19 Bootcamp series, organised by Dr. Jim Barton, which ran from mid April to the end of June. The well-attended weekly online learning sessions were designed to share knowledge and provide a forum for questions about the rapidly changing information available about COVID- 19. Department members also presented in a CME COVID education initiative open to the entire College of Medicine. Participating members were from divisions of Infectious Diseases, Respirology, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Cardiology, Geriatric Medicine, General Internal Medicine. The Department Head participated in a session about leadership. Department of Medicine University of Saskatchewan Annual Report 2019 - 2020 9 | P a g e EDUCATION SECTION II Department of Medicine University of Saskatchewan Annual Report 2019 - 2020 10 | P a g e UNDERGRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION Undergraduate Medical Education has been busy this last year. 2019 ended fairly quietly before the drama of 2020 ensued. The pandemic led to the temporary closure of the undergraduate curriculum. This of course led to significant stress amongst our learners however they found admirable ways to see the silver linings. When the curriculum resumed, all pre-clerkship teaching was done virtually and there were significant changes to the clerkship rotations. Our faculty showed their resilience by being nimble and finding innovative ways to teach. Clinics were shifted to take place virtually and students and faculty alike found new ways to perform clinical duties and teach this new way of delivery care. As the new academic year began, faculty once again showed their expertise in new ways of delivering medical education. The year 4 students were challenged by having to do all their electives in Saskatchewan as all programs closed their academic borders to visiting clerks. It has been stressful to find placement for all these students, but our Department has worked hard to fulfill this commitment as best they could. Rural Internal Medicine sites now became engaged in providing educational experiences for clerks. Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) became mandatory for the new Year 3 clerks and this will definitely improve the feedback and learning for our learners. The next step is to develop a competency committee to mentor these students along their training. Department of Medicine faculty continue to excel in teaching at all levels. However, work is still needed to continue to engage faculty and maintain our excellent teaching record. DR. RAHUL MAINRA Director Undergraduate Education Department of Medicine University of Saskatchewan Annual Report 2019 - 2020 11 | P a g e CORE INTERNAL MEDICINE Core IM Program 70 residents Saskatoon Regina PGY1 19 6 PGY2 19 5 PGY3 14 5 PGY4 2 The Internal Medicine program launched the new Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons Competence by Design (CBD) training curriculum in July 2019. Residents and faculty were engaged in the process to ensure a successful launch. Multiple resident and faculty development sessions were held throughout the academic year to ensure everyone involved engaged in the transition to this \"new way\" of training Internal Medicine residents. The launch was successful, and we are now into our second year in the new curriculum with residents in the Core of Discipline Stage and the newly starting Internal Medicine residents in the Transition to Discipline/Foundations stages. The program is building on the faculty development opportunities this new curriculum offers. There have been Grand Rounds held related to understanding EPAs at various stages of training, How to Provide Useful Feedback , and training sessions for the residents and Faculty Academic Advisors on Coaching in Medicine. The residents have been very helpful in providing input for improvements within the CBD curriculum and are actively involved in the curriculum development and implementation. Ongoing faculty development will continue to be one of the priorities for the coming year. The COVID-19 pandemic affected all aspects of resident education. When it started in March, the residents stepped up to ensure safe and appropriate call coverage was maintained by developing a '\"back up\" call schedule and they were front line care providers for patients presenting to the Emergency Department with COVID-19 symptoms. Weekly Academic Half Days (AHD) were quickly switched from in person sessions to Virtual Academic Half Days, ensuring the academic mission of the Internal Medicine Training Program was continued. The virtual Academic Half Day sessions have continued throughout the summer DR. KAREN LAFRAMBOISE Director Core Internal Medicine Program Department of Medicine University of Saskatchewan Annual Report 2019 - 2020 12 | P a g e months and will continue indefinitely until the pandemic resolves. The faculty presenters at AHD have adjusted their presentations to meet the needs of the resident learners and the reviews of the presentations have been very positive. Welcoming the new Internal Medicine residents starting in July 2020 will be a new \"Virtual\" experience.

Based on reporting from the College of Medicine's Office of the Vice Dean of Research, our department still ranks among the highest in the college in all of the research metrics observed. This is a testament to the important work being completed by our researchers. FUNDING SUCCESS National funding successes include Dr. Donna Goodridge , a co-PI on a CIHR catalyst grant and Dr. Stuart Skinner , a co-PI on two CIHR operating grants through the Network Environments for Indigenous Health Research Program. The latest research grant funding competition within the department results in funding for eight research teams from six divisions and included both Saskatoon and Regina based researchers . STRENGTHENING RESEARCH CAPACITY Our department and research committee continue to develop ways to strengthen research capacity by helping researchers move into research or advance their research programs. 2019/20 saw the launch of our Research Lunch and Learn Series. See Research Events for a list of the topics covered. COVID-R ELATED OPPORTUNITIES While COVID caused some research programs to pause, it has also led to researchers adjusting their programs to help address this challenge. The Department of Medicine set up a rapid response research call and was able to fund three research teams whose projects focused on COVID related DR. JOSH LAWSON DIRECTOR, RESARCH Department of Medicine University of Saskatchewan Annual Report 2019 - 2020 18 | P a g e issues. These were led by Drs. George Katselis , Jay Shavadia , and Rob Skomro . The College of Medicine also partnered with the Respiratory Research Centre to fund additional COVID studies. Drs. Donna Goodridge , George Katselis , and Shelley Kirychuk were successful in this competition. In addition to these competitions, a number of other Department of Medicine researchers are actively conducting research in COVID related fields either as principal investigators or as members of national teams. It was a very active year for research despite the presence of COVID and we would like to congratulate you all for your successes.

Department of Medicine University of Saskatchewan Annual Report 2019 - 2020 20 | P a g e QUALITY of CARE SECTION IV Department of Medicine University of Saskatchewan Annual Report 2019 - 2020 21 | P a g e QUALITY OF CARE Other than adapting to the unique requirements in response to COVID-19, there were two major areas of focus for the Quality of Care Committee. EARLY WARNING SYSTEM Internal medicine residents are currently collaborating in a pilot project to implement an Early Warning System communication tool in the Clinical Teaching Unit. Patients can show signs of clinical deterioration hours before the actual event. The Early Warning System communication tool is used by hospital care teams to recognize early clinical deterioration and has been successfully implemented in various institutions worldwide. The aim of this project is to reduce unexpected deaths and cardiac arrest. ASSESSMENT PROGRAM It is broadly agreed that education in quality improvement (QI) and patient safety is needed in every aspect of health care education. It is also essential to learn and discuss patients' safety and QI concepts within our organization and how they are integrated into the daily work of health care ideas to provide safe care. However, there is a paucity of continuing education on patient safety and QI. The Department of Medicine Quality of Care Committee is introducing a formalized assessment program to enhance the knowledge of patient safety, provide analysis of a critical incident, and determine how system thinking can improve health care and minimize patient adverse events. The self-assessment program will be delivered along with Quality Improvement Rounds for the Department of Medicine members to learn and enhance those skills. DR.

The division of cardiology was instrumental in several aspects of the delivery of care in the Covid era as it pertained to cardiovascular issues. Cardiology members demonstrated leadership and worked collaboratively in creating the Protected Code Blue Pathway for Covid or suspected Covid patients within SHA. This would help ensure safety to all members of the health care team but also ensure that patients would still receive optimal care. In collaboration with SHA, we facilitated the temporary relocation of CCU to the 6th floor in order to optimize ICU capacity in the anticipation of Covid. SPH CARDIOLOGY SERVICE Starting in July 2019, there was the implementation of a new and separate cardiology consult service (7 days/week) at St. Paul's Hospital (SPH). This was the first time there has been an official consult cardiology service at this site. This service has been utilized by physicians from GIM, ED, ICU and continues to evolve over time to enhance cardiovascular care in this patient population. THE USASK CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH GROUP (CRG) was recently formed within the Department of Medicine and is committed to creating a research environment that will aim to improve cardiac care delivery to the province. It is chaired by Dr. Haddad and co-chaired by Dr. Shavadia . Several research projects are currently underway, and details are available on the Department of Medicine website.

ARDYTH MILNE DIVISION HEAD Department of Medicine University of Saskatchewan Annual Report 2019 - 2020 Page 60 CRITICAL CARE ASSOCIATES (CCA) - REGINA Division Members : 25 Family Physicians COVID The Division of Critical Care Associates (CCA) has been a key player in the development and leadership of the COVID Airway Code Blue teams in the Regina General Hospital and the Pasqua Hospital. The CCA developed an upskilling program for non-critical care physicians to gain essential ICU skills in preparation for the COVID-19 surge. This program is designed for rural doctors to gain confidence with resuscitation skills by working alongside CCAs. Several physicians have already successfully completed this program. CLINICAL INITIATIVE In collaboration with the Division of Neurology, we have implemented the inpatient stroke protocol to cut down the in-hospital treatment time to rTPA. The CCA provides the initial physician assessment for potential stroke patients who are admitted, therefore cutting down on the lead time to thrombolytic therapy. EDUCATION The CCAs have maintained involvement in simulation sessions including COVID-19 Airway simulations. We continue to invest time in CME opportunities with the continuation of our case study/M&M rounds, journal clubs, toxicology rounds and syllabus builder. Members of the division remain active participants in the Critical Care Management committee and the Department of Medicine Quality Improvement committee. TEACHING Over the last year, several division members have attained formalized teaching positions with the University of Saskatchewan College of Medicine. All of our CCAs remain actively involved in resident bedside teaching in the ICUs. We are excited to announce the new CCA teaching initiative for undergraduate medical students to gain clinical experience in the renal unit. DR.

CLINICAL INITIATIVES Due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in restrictions to in-person clinical delivery, the Department of PM&R is working to establish a comprehensive virtual care model at WRC. This includes both inpatient and outpatient care services. Inpatient team conferences are now able to be held with the multidisciplinary team, patients and their families via videoconference. This allows patients to connect with their families, and families to participate virtually in rehabilitation. Virtual outpatient clinics have been established including multidisciplinary Prosthetics Clinics and virtual consultations with remote hospitals. Pediatric rehabilitation through the Children's Program at WRC has also been providing virtual therapy and physician appointments. Feedback from patients and healthcare professionals has overall been quite positive. LEADERSHIP Dr. Shane Wunder served as a Pandemic Physician Co-Lead for Virtual Care SHA (Regina Area) providing leadership in developing virtual care strategies for the Regina Area. Dr. Kraushaar served as both the Regina Area PM&R Pandemic Physician Lead and the Pandemic Physician Site Lead for WRC providing leadership and support for patient care needs and planning for surge capacity.
