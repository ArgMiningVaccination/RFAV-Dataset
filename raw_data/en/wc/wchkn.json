Here at One Source Integrative Medicine, you aren't just another number. Integrative medicine focuses on establishing and supporting a long-term relationship between a patient and our practitioners, to make sure that our patients get the trusted medical care and treatments they need to heal and feel their best. Integrative medical care focuses on providing healing options for both children and adults. What is Integrative Medicine? Many people wonder how integrative medicine differs from conventional medicine. While our integrative medicine doctors do provide a variety of conventional medical interventions and treatment options, we also know that there are other alternative therapies and unique interventions out there that can provide faster healing within the body without relying on more invasive procedures and technologies. Our integrative medicine doctors craft a patient-focused treatment plan that encompasses a wide range of both traditional and alternative therapies and treatment options. Our goal is to help you feel and function at your best. The Benefits of Integrative Medicine So, why should you turn to the integrative medicine team at One Source Integrative Medicine? It's simple. We care about you and your family's health and we put that at the center of everything that we do. Instead of simply treating diseases and illnesses when they arise, we focus on ways to prevent disease first and foremost to promote long-term health and wellbeing in all of our patients, no matter their age or background. Our team of integrative medicine specialists take ample time with each patient, discussing their health and concerns at length, and getting a more detailed as well as big-picture approach to how to best care for every patient. Our care is always tailored to you. Connecting the Health Dots We are also health detectives as much as we are practitioners, figuring out the best approaches to manage symptoms and promote better health in our patients. For example, perhaps your child has been diagnosed with ADHD and you have concerns about their behavioral issues. By sitting down with our team we can discuss dietary needs and other aspects of their lifestyle that are connected to their health, behaviors, and development. Through simple dietary changes and even alternative medicines such as herbal supplements or Chinese medicine, we can provide you and your child with the tools they need to better manage their behaviors, emotions, health, and overall well-being.
