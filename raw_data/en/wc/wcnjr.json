With Balance, it isn't. [Balance invests in your home](https://www.balancehomes.com/about) in exchange for a portion of your home equity. As a co-owner, Balance shares in the costs, appreciation and depreciation of your home. Sharing in your future home appreciation allows Balance to offer attractive terms with low monthly payments and flexible qualifying criteria. We've tried to make Balance as flexible as possible for our co-owners, so there is no minimum term. Balance currently offers a 7 year maximum term and will typically be repaid whenever you decide to buy Balance out and move to a traditional mortgage or sell the home entirely. Similar to a mortgage and other home equity products, Balance charges a service fee and you are responsible for paying the closing costs. You have the option to pay all of the closing costs with a portion of your home equity, so Balance's customers typically pay $0 at closing. In fact, customers are also able to sell additional equity to Balance at closing and receive additional cash at closing to pay off other debts. Your closing costs, including any cash outs you elect to receive, will be summarized in a Balance proposal. Yes! When you enter an agreement with Balance, we'll set a starting price for your home and adjust it up or down every three months based on the Federal Housing Finance Agency's home price index for your metro area. This means any appreciation in your home's value above this index will be yours to keep! At any time, you can buyback all, or a portion, of Balance's interests in your home at this price. Balance is a co-investor in your home equity, so our goal is to keep you in your home. Any adverse situation is costly and stressful for all parties and we've structured Balance to avoid them by being flexible about how much of your home you own. If you cannot afford to pay your minimum monthly payments and have exhausted your ability to pay with equity, we will make every effort to accommodate any alternative financing options. A sale of the residence, where you share in the proceeds accordingly, is a last resort option. Our pricing is fair and transparent: Balance charges a one-time shared ownership entry fee of 2.5% of your home value to co-invest in your home and pay off your mortgage and any other eligible debts. Homeowners have the option to save their cash and pay this one-time fee using their home equity, so a homeowner can partner with Balance without paying any cash to Balance at closing. You'll pay a fixed monthly fee to Balance, based upon the percentage of the home co-owned with Balance. You have the option to increase your ownership percentage at any time, by buying back equity, which would help to lower your monthly fee. When you choose to end your co-ownership relationship with Balance, the final amount due is based on the starting value of the home, adjusted for any changes in your local market. As the value of your home changes, Balance's buy-out amount is adjusted accordingly to reflect the gain or loss of our investment. "}
