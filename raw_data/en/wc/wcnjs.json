It is used to break down tryptophan and vitamin B-6. It is a source of energy for muscles and the central nervous system. It strengthens the immune system and helps the body use sugars. Unsubstantiated claims There may be benefits that have not yet been proven through research. Alanine may help treat diabetes. This is because it helps the body use glucose. It helps prevent low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Recommended intake Amino acids are available as single amino acids or in amino-acid combinations. They're in multivitamin formulas, proteins, and food supplements. Amino acids can be taken as tablets, fluids, and powders. If you eat enough complete proteins or combinations of protein-rich foods in your diet, you should be getting all the amino acids you need. There are no conditions that increase the need for alanine. Side effects, toxicity, and interactions Using a single amino acid supplement may lead to negative nitrogen balance. This can lessen how well your metabolism works. It can make your kidneys work harder. In children, single amino acid supplements may cause growth problems. You should not take high doses of individual amino acids for long periods of time. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not use alanine supplements. Online Medical Reviewer: Bianca Garilli MD Online "}
