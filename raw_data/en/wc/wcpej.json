McCullough, MD, MPH It took less than a day since our [Base Spike Protein Detoxification Protocol](https://zenodo.org/record/8286460) was published for the [Biopharmaceutical Complex](http://www.couragetofacecovid.com) to come out with syndicate social media allies discrediting the most hopeful news long-COVID and vaccine suffers have heard since the start of their misery. Syndicate fact checker [Science Feedback](https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/science-feedback/), issued an unsupported false counterclaim on Instagram given below. Science Feedback is a science and climate blogging organization with no foundation in peer-reviewed medical publications is not advised by prominent physicians working in the COVID-19 field. Their major donor is former Microsoft and [Apple](https://www.influencewatch.org/for-profit/apple-inc/) executive Eric Michelman who is also a noted Democratic supporter, donating money to the Presidential campaigns of [Barack Obama](https://www.influencewatch.org/person/barack-obama/) and [Joe Biden](https://www.influencewatch.org/person/joe-biden/). Michelman is also a climate change activist, founding a climate change advocacy organization and publicly supporting a carbon tax. LinkedIn pulled a post indicating the COVID-19 vaccine causes more post-acute sequelae than SARS-CoV-2 which is my clinical opinion supported by the data. Base Spike Detoxification is an approach a to both problems. LinkedIn uncredentialed anonymous content moderators obviously disagreed and continue to push the false narrative indicating that long-COVID is unassailable and the only answer is more genetic shots. I have found it interesting that the fact checkers have never made claims against a myriad of drugs or supplements that were ineffective during the pandemic. They have exclusively targeted therapies with preclinical and clinical studies demonstrating signals of benefit and acceptable safety (iodine/xylitol nasal washes, vitamin D, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, budesonide). In a perverted way, the Biopharmaceutical Complex has confirmed Base Spike Detoxification is the path forward for so many patients suffering from long-COVID and or regretting the jab.
