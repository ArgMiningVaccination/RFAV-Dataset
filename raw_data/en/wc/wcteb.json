Sweating is a natural and important body function to regulate body temperature. The sweat forms an ideal breeding ground for bacteria that multiply and gather there. This can cause strong unpleasant odours. Conventional deodorants, so-called antiperspirants, try to prevent sweating. In sharp contrast, Biork Mineral Deodorant purifies, because the bacteria (and not the sweat) are the cause of the vapours in the summer months. How does a crystal deodorant work? When an antiperspirant claims to be \"aluminum-free,\" they are saying it does not contain aluminum chlorohydrate, aluminum chloride, aluminum hydroxybromide or aluminum zirconium\u2014all forms of aluminum commonly used in antiperspirants and deodorants. To stop the flow of sweat to your skin's surface, the aluminum plugs sweat ducts in the top layer of your skin stopping the natural flow of sweat to your skin's surface. The aluminum in crystal deodorant stones is a different type of aluminum, called alum. The most common form is potassium alum, also known as potassium aluminum sulfate. Potassium alum (and other alums) is a natural mineral salt made up of molecules that are too large to be absorbed by your skin. They form a protective layer on your skin that inhibits the growth of odour-causing bacteria. Biork\u00b4s crystal deodorant lasts longer than you are used to from other deodorants. In addition, the potassium alum contains important minerals. Of course, all ingredients have been dermatologically tested. "}
