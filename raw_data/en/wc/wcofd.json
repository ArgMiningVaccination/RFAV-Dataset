[View and download the MVP informational flyer](/mvp/michigan_vaccination_partners_most_valuable_provider_ceritification_06_27_2023_final.pdf) Our vision is to create healthy communities for all. To achieve this vision and sustain our efforts long-term, we are inviting health providers to become a Most Valuable Provider (MVP). MVPs offer vaccination and health clinic experiences that are accessible and welcoming to all people across Michigan, including people with disabilities. Why is MVP Needed? - Disability is Common: 1 in 4 adults in the United States has a disability. - People with Disabilities Experience Health Disparities: including higher rates of diabetes, stroke, COPD, cancer, and depression compared to those without disabilities. - People with Disabilities are Disproportionately Affected by COVID: People with disabilities were 6x more likely to die from COVID-19 than those without disabilities. - People with Disabilities Experience Barriers to Adequate Health Care Including: - Attitudinal: Ableism, stereotyping, stigma, and discrimination. - Physical: Obstacles that prevent access or block mobility such as curbs and steps. - Transportation: Lack of adequate and accessible transportation. - Social determinants of health: Including lack of affordable and accessible housing, and lower rates of employment, education, and income. - Lack of Disability Data Perpetuates Disparities: We measure what we treasure. - Data collection is a fundamental pillar of public health. - Inaccurate/inadequate data can misguide public health responses. - We can't show how we are moving the needle on disparities without disability status.
