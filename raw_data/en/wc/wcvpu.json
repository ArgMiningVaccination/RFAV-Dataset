Piper Cancer Care Network. Thank you for choosing us as a partner in your care. We understand this can be a very stressful time for you and your family. Our goal is to provide you with the most professional and courteous service possible. Getting a cancer diagnosis can immediately pause everything in your life \u2014 work, family commitments, long -term plans. While our focus is laser -sharp on treating your disease so you can recover as quickly as possible, it can be easy to forget a very important part of the equation: You. When you get a diagnosis, it's common to be overw helmed with advice and stories from well-meaning friends and family, however, sometimes you need an expert who's on your side. That's where the support services of the HonorHealth Virginia G. Piper Cancer Care Network come in. A team of navigators, socia l workers, exercise physiologists, nutritionists and librarians, as well as Mind, Body and Spirit support groups a nd classes are designed especially to help you and your caregivers. The enclosed information walks you through what to expect before, during and after your surgery. Of course, your care team will be with you every step of the way to answer any questions and help you feel prepared. Thank you for the opportunity to serve you. Sincerely, Mark Kharoufeh, RN, BSN, MBA System Director Oncology Service Line What to expect before surgery Being healthy Good nutrition is important before surgery. It is also very important after surgery to optimize healing. Your surgeon may refer you to a dietitian who can help you work out an eating plan before and after surgery. Notify your surgeon if you have troubl e eating, a decreased appetite or unexplained weight loss. If you drink alcoholic beverages, you should not drink anything with alcohol at least 24 hours before your surgery and avoid it after surgery since alcohol can interfere with wound healing and pain. Smoking Cessation Smoking decreases your body's ability to heal, especially your bones and . It also puts you at an increased risk for infections and complications related to anesthesia , such as pneumonia. If you smoke, quit before surgery. Ideally, this sh ould occur at least 90 days before your surgery . Ask your surgeon or nurse about available resources to help you quit smoking or for nicotine substitutes to help with nicotine cravings after surgery. Diabetes and blood sugar (glucose) control Blood glucos e control is very important for healing. Your surgeon may order a carbohydrate -control led eating plan while in the hospital to aid in managing y our blood glucose levels. We encourage you to follow this plan . While in the hospital, your surgeon may order blood glucose tests before your meals and at bed time. This may occur even if you do not check your blood glucose regularly at home. You may also be given insulin while in the hospital even if you do not use insulin at home. This is usually o nly temporary and you will likely resume your previous eating plan and medications after you leave the hospital. Medications Your surgeon and nur ses need to know what prescription and over -the-counter medications, supplements and herbal remedies you take. Some of these medications can increase your risk of bleeding and other complications during or after surgery. Your surgeon or a surgery pre -assessment nurse will tell you which medications to stop taking and when to stop taking them before surgery. T hey also will tell you which medications you should continue taking. If you have any questions about your medications, please contact your surgeon before your surgery. Your surgeon may have you avoid all n on-steroidal anti -inflammatory etc. , to decrease your risk of excessive bleeding. Plan before surgery If you have medical problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease or lung disease , your primary care physic ian and/or specialists need to agree that you can have surgery. To do so, they may recommend an EKG, chest x -ray, and blood and urine tests ahead of time. These results should be sent to your surgeon's office prior to your surgery. A pre-assessment nurse will call you before your surgery to discuss your surgery with you. They will assess your health status and review specific instructions to follow in preparation for surgery. Notify your surgeon immediately if you develop any signs of illness before surgery. This includes a cold, cough, fever, rash, infection, urinary tract infection or any change in your health. If you have advance directives, such as a Living Will or Medical Power of Attorney, please make copies to bring with you o n the day of surgery. Plan to pack a small bag of your personal belongings such as a toothbrush, toothpaste and other grooming items. Include loose -fitting clothing, such as a warm -up suit, and a good pair of shoes with rubber soles to wear home when you are discharged from the hospital. Try to keep personal belongings to a minimum to prevent them from being lost or misplaced. Make arrangements for a ride home from the hospital. Follow your surgeon's recommendations on when you can start driving. Along with driving activities, it would be beneficial to have a caregiver or friend who can help with your general care. Examples of h elp include : meal preparation, taking out the trash, housework, yard work, grocery shopping and trips to pick up needed medications. Nutrition before surgery Nutrition and diet are important before and after colorectal surgery. These are general diet guidelines to help you prepare fo r and heal after your surgery. They do not replace an individual nutritional consultation with our registered dietitian . Eating extra protein for at least seven to 10 days prior to your surgery may help the healing process after surgery. Try to include a protein -rich food or beverage from the following list at each meal and snack, unless you are on a special protein -restricted diet for another medical condition: Poultry o r fish Eggs Milk and milk drinks, Lactaid \u00ae or Fairlife \u00ae milk, cheeses or yogurt Nut butters Legumes or hummus Soy products such as tofu, tempeh, edamame, or soymilk Protein powders Nutritional supplement beverages such as Ensure \u00ae, Boost \u00ae,, Orgain, Kate Farms or Muscle Milk Protein bars Along with protein, you need calories from carbohydrates and fats to maintain your weight and fuel your body. At meals and snacks, try to combine a carbohydrate source such as grains, fruits or vegetables with your protei n. For example, eat peanut butter with crackers or cottage cheese with peaches. Your surgeon will give you specific diet instructions for the days before and the day of your surgery. It is very important to follow them. A clear liquid diet is typically p rescribed before your surgery. The clear liquid diet helps clean out your bowel and allows your digestive t ract to rest prior to surgery. These are allowed choices while on a clear liquid diet: Water, plain or flavored Clear broth and bouillon Lemon, lime, peach or orange flavored gelatin, plain without fruit Clear fruit juices without pulp such as apple and white grape juice Clear carbonated drinks , including lemon -lime soda pop Gatorade \u00ae, Powerade \u00ae or other clear electrolyte sports drinks, Ensure Clear \u00ae, Boost Breeze \u00ae Popsicles without fruit or cream, fruit ice Plain coffee and tea Your surgeon may also recommend that you drink a special carbohydrate -based drink two hours before your surgery. The surgery team will give you additional directions as needed. Night before surgery Your surgeon will discuss their recommendations for colon prep. If you have not yet received these instructions, please c all your surgeon so you will know what you need to have at home to prepare. Your surgeon will discuss any recommended showering guidelines prior to your surgery. Brush your teeth . It is recommended that you also use an antiseptic mouthwash. An anti septic mouthwash will help reduce bacteria that can cause respiratory infections after surgery. Do not shave the area or around the area where you will have surgery. Shaving skin creat es small cuts in the skin that can cause infections. Do not apply any deodorant, powder, per fume , aftershave, body lotions, creams or makeup. These promote bacteria growth that can cause infections. Morning of surgery Your surgeon will discuss any recommended showering guidelines prior to your surgery. Take only approved medications with a small sip of water. Follow the instructions of your pre -assessment nurse and surgeon on what medications to take the morning of surgery. Leave all valuables including your wallet, purse, jewelry and rings at home. Bring a small bag of your personal belongings such as a toothbrush, toothpaste and other grooming items. If you wear eyeglasses, hearing aids or dentures, bring them or wear them on the day of surgery. Please talk to your surgeon and check our website , www.honorhealth.com for the most up -to-date information on visitor restrictions. Day of surgery Pre-Op Once you are finished with hospital registration, you will be escorted to the surgery area where a nurse will prepare you for surgery. Preparing you for surgery includes having your blood pressure, temperature, heart rate measured , an IV inserted into your arm and medications given to you , if necessary. You will also be asked several questions regarding your health and medical history. You will speak to your surgeon and anesthesiologist and be asked to sign a surgical consent/permit before going into th e operating room. Occasionally, there may be a change in the time of your surgery. If this occurs, a nurse will update you regarding any delays and will keep you comfortable while you wait for surgery. Surgery The length of your surgery will vary, de pending on the type of surgery, location of cancer , your sur geon and your overall health. Colon Surgery There are a few different types of colectomy surgeries. You and your surgeon will discuss which type of surgery is recommended for your cancer. Total colectomy includes the removal of the entire colon Partial colectomy is only removing part of the colon. Sometimes this is also called a subtotal colectomy. Hemicolectomy is when either the right or left portion of the colon is removed. Sigmoidectom y is the removal of the lower part of the colon near the rectum. Low-anterior resection is the removal of the upper part of the rectum. Proctocolectomy occurs when the surgeon removes both the colon and rectum. Specialized equipment and padding will be us ed on you while you are positioned and repositioned by the surgical team before and during your surgery. Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) After surgery, you will be taken to the P ost Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) where you will remain for approximately one to two hours and then be transferred to your room. While in the PACU, you will be closely monitored as anesthesia wears off. Nurses will monitor your blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, urine output and surgical dressings. They will also manage your pain, enco urage you to take deep breaths and cough, and move your feet and ankles. When you are ready to leave the PACU, you will be transferred to your room. Family Waiting Area * When you are taken into the Operating Room, your family will be asked to wait in the surgical waiting areas. Many waiting areas are staffed by volunteers. If your family plans on leaving the waiting area or hospital, they shoul d notify the volunteer or a Pre -Op nur se and provide contact information. It is important your family tries to stay in the waiting room so they have an opportunity to speak with the surgeon after surgery. HonorHealth Hospitals have a wireless network service for visitors that provides internet access for personal wireless devices, such as cell phones, laptop computers and tablets. This wireless service is accessible throughout the hospital: main lobby, cafeteria, waiting areas and patient rooms. Refreshments are available in th e coffee shop, in the cafeteria and vending machines in some waiting areas. *Please note: Due to COVID -19 and out of abundance of caution, no visitors are currently allowed in inpatient hospital areas. What to expect after surgery White board There will be a white board in your hospital room . This board lists the names of your care team , along with the plan of care and goals that you and your care team have talked ab out. I f you have any questions or concerns, write them on the board so they can be addressed. The white board is where your nurse can write the name of any new medication s and associated side effects. Be cause you may be taking new medications , it is very important for you to notify your nurse of any side effects. This board will be updated frequently to make sure that your needs are being addressed . Walking and physical activity We encourage you to walk as soon as possible after surgery as directed by your surgeon. Walking improves recover y and helps prevent common problems after surgery such as constipation and blood clots. Please ask for staff assistance before getting out of bed. Sequential compression device (SCD) A sequential compression device (SCD) is a device placed on your legs tha t will inflate with air to squeeze/massage your legs to help promote circulation and prevent blood clots. You will have sequential compression devices on your legs after surgery and these can cause falls if not disconnected properly. Please ask for assista nce anytime you want to walk, get out of bed or need to use the bathroom. This is for your safety to prevent you from falling. Deep breathing exercises These can help reduce the risk for pneumonia . Your nurse or respiratory therapist will provide you with instructions on deep breathing exercises . You will receive an Incentive Spirometer to assist with these deep breathing exercises. Your nurse and surgeon will speak with you abou t your progress to determine when you are ready to go home. We want to make sure that you are able to eat, use the bathroom, walk safely and your pain is controlled. Before going home, you will receive written discharge instructions from you nurse and surgeon about your medi cations, care when you are at home and when to follow -up with your surgeon. Constipation Even if you have regular bowel movements prior to surgery, you are likely to experience constipation after your surgery. This is caused by the anesthetic and pain me dicine you will receive, changes in your diet and reduced physical activity. While you are in the hospital, it is very important to get out of bed to walk , drink plenty of fluids and take stool s ofteners or laxatives as advised by your surgeon . This will also be important to continue after you are discharged. Your nurse, surgeon and other healthcare team members will discuss this with you in more detail. Surgical site and bathing Surgical dressings will be changed according to your surgeon's instructions. It is normal for the surgical site to have swelling, bruising or a small amount of drainage. Your surgeon will indicate when you can shower. When showering, do not scrub your incision site. You will not be allowed to take a bath, use a hot tub or spa, or go swimming until your surgeon gives you permission. Urinary catheter You may have a urinary catheter. A urinary catheter is a small tube placed in the bladder to drain urine. The urine drains into a container so we can see how much urine you are making and how well your kidneys are working. Oxygen therapy You may feel oxygen tubing prongs just inside each nostril. Hydration You will still have your IV in place . We will encourage you to drink some water right away. Complications that may delay your discharge Nausea and vomiting: Many patients feel nauseated after surgery. We can give you medication for nausea. If you feel sick, please tell us. As long as you can keep yourself hydrated, the nausea will likely pass. Ileus: The stress of surgery can cause your bowel to stop working . This is called an ileus. Food and gas stop passing through the bowel . If you develop an ileus, it may last for a few days. . We designed our care program to reduce any possibility of an ileus. However, if an ileus develops , you may need a small tube inse rted down the nose to your stomach. The best ways to avoid an ileus after surgery is to take as low a dose of narcotic pain medication as possible, walk as much as possible and stimulate the bowel with small amounts of food and liquids. Anastomotic leak: This is a rare but serious complication. An anastomotic leak happens when the two ends of the bowel that were joined during surgery do not heal completely, thus leaving a small hole. An anastomotic leak can happen after surgery and your surgeon will be wat chful for this. Patients usually have severe abdominal pain, fever and vomiting. This often requires another operation. Wound infection: If a wound infection develops, this usually happens three to 10 days after surgery. Urinary retention: This means you are unable to urinate after we remove your catheter. We may need to reinsert the catheter until you can urinate on your own. Anesthesia, pain medications and decreased activity can cause urinary retention. At-home reminders Ambulate - Get up and walk as much as possible Incentive spirometer - Continue to use this at home Pain control - Don't get behind on controlling your pain Shower and washing - Talk with your surgeon about when you can shower Follow -up appointment - Make sure you have a follow -up appointment with your surgeon If you have diabetes, continue to manage it, restarting your home diabetes regimen as directed, and checking your blood glucose. Contact your diabetes doctor if you have blood glucose levels higher than 180 mg/dL. Nutrition after surgery The colon helps your body absorb water, minerals and electrolytes such as sodium and potassium and completes the digestion of food prior to elimination. Food tolerance after surgery varies from person to person. After surgery, you may need to temporarily adjust your food choices and food portions to help with the healing process. During this time, introduce foods slowly and in small portions. It may be helpful to keep a food diary to track which foods are best tolerated. After surgery , your diet will start with clear liquids and will be advance d as to lerated to solid foods. Although a regular diet may be ordered, it is best to choose lower fiber foods from the menu. Low-fiber foods include white breads, whi te rice, noodles, mashed pota toes, cream of wheat, corn flakes, cooked vegetables and canned fruits. Protein sources such as meats, poultry, fish, eg gs and cheese do not contain fiber but are needed for healing and can be eaten as desired. Wait two weeks, or as advised by your surgeon, to introduce higher fiber foods such as whole grains, raw vegetables, fresh fruits, nuts and seeds. If you have an ileostomy, you may need to stay on a low -fiber diet for a longer period of time. Refer to the dietary fiber c hart on page 11 for advice on reintroducing fiber into your diet. Follow these eating suggestions to help improve food digestion and absorption: Eat four to six small me als and snacks during the day. Smaller portions of food are easier on the digestive sys tem, reduce abdominal gas and tend to increase absorption of nutrients. As your colon heals, you can go back to three meals per day. Establ ish a regular eating schedule. Skipping meals can increase abdominal gas and loose stools. Chew your foods well and eat slowly for better digestion. If you have a colostomy or ileostomy, this is especially important to prevent blockage of the opening (stoma). Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. A general goal for daily fluid intake is a minim um of 64 ounces, or 8 cups, per day. Fluids include all beverages that you drink though water ; caffeine -free drinks and low-sugar liquids are preferred. Watch for signs of dehydration , including low urine output, dark colored urine, low blood pressure, dizziness, dry mouth a nd dry skin. Limit gas -producing foods and beverages if you have excessive gas or bloating , such as: Lactose in milk, ice cream, cream soups and cottage cheese Cabbage -family vegetables, including green peppers, asparagus, cucumbers, onions, garlic, and legumes Apples, melon, dried fruits and bran Carbonated bever ages, chewing gum, sugar alcohols , such as sorbitol , and drinking from a straw To start, only try small amounts of gas-producing foods and beverages to test your tolerance. If you have a reaction, avoid that item for a few weeks before you retry it. Inclu de foods high in soluble fiber such as applesauce, oats, peaches and bananas if you are having diarrhea or high -ostomy output. Opt for low -lactose foods and beverages including low - lactose milk ; milk alternatives like almond, coconut, soy, rice and oat mil ks; and yogurt to decrease diarrhea. Limit hot beverages with caffeine and fried foods as they stimulate bowel function. Replace electrol ytes with water, broth and low -sugar electrolyte beverages. Consult your registered dietitian to discuss your specific nutritional concerns. Dietary Fiber After Colorectal Surgery: Dietary fiber is only found in plant foods such as grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds. It is not found in meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy foods, oils, butter or other spreads. After your surgery, start with low -fiber foods and gradually reintroduce high er fiber foods. Limit any foods that cause you digestive problems. If you have an ileostomy or are receiving chemotherapy after surgery, you may need to stay on a low -fiber diet for an extended period of time. Please use this checklist to prepare for surgery and to guide your recovery. Before surgery One month before surgery Choose someone to make health decisions for you in the unlikely event that you are unable to speak for yourself. Talk with them about your wishes, and create an advance directive. Complete any blood tests ordered by your doctor If you smoke, vape, or use chewing tobacco, work with your doctor to quit in the weeks before surgery. Between 1 and 2 weeks before surgery Contact your surgeon's office to confirm date and time of your surgery. Expect a call from a pre-assessment nurse to review your medical hi story, plus the names and doses of your medications, and any allergies you have. Find out if you need to stop any medications before surgery. Make sure you have any supplies you need for your bowel prep. Purchase any special soap or washcloths if you were told to use them before surgery. The day before surgery Follow your doctor's instructions about when to start a clear liquid diet. Follow any instructions you were given for medications , bowel prep or shower . Do not remove any hair on your body by shaving or waxing. Pack clean, comfortable clothes. The morning of surgery Take medications as instructed. Shower with any special soap or washcloths, if instructed. If instructed , drink one of these: 12 ounces of appl e juice or a sport drink, (such as Gatorade \u00ae), or Ensure Pre-Surgery \u00ae. Finish the whole drink 2 hours before your surgery is scheduled. Bring with you to the hospital : Your health insurance cards . A photo ID . A list of any prescription and over -the-coun ter medications you take. A way to pay any copay or fees due when you are admitted. A copy of your advance directive (if you have one). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ After surgery After surgery A couple hours after surgery, nurses will help you get out of bed. Take a few steps, and sit in a chair. Drink clear liquids. Ask for medication to manage your pain. Tell your nurse if it does not help. Tell your nurse if you are worried about taking pain medication. First day after surgery Ask for help each time you get out of bed until you are steady on your feet. Walk in the hall at least three times. This gets your blood flowing and helps you heal. Stay out of bed at least six hours. Drink clear l iquids. Your surgeon will order solid food based on how you are feeling. Two days after surgery Walk in the hall at least three times. Stay out of bed at least six hours. Your surgeon will have more foods added to your meals based on how you are feeling. If you have an ostomy bag, ask your nurse to teach you how to: Apply, empty, remove and replace the ostomy bag. Care for the skin around the opening on your body, called a stoma . Stay hydrated. Three days after surgery Spend most of the day out of bed and walking. You will probably be eating solid foods by this time. ___________________________________________________________________ Before you go home Make sure you have: An appointment to see your surgeon in 1 to 2 weeks. Prescriptions for medications. Make sure you know when to call your surgeon for problems. Call your surgeon right away if you have signs of a wound infection like: The surgical area becomes red, pain ful or there is fluid coming from it. You have a fever of 101.5 F degrees or higher. If you have a new ostomy Ask your nurse what you should eat to thicken the waste in the bag. Practice how to remove and put on an ostomy bag with your nurse. Make sure you go home with ostomy supplies. Be sure you know how to order more.
