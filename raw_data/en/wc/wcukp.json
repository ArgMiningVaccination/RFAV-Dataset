Doctored for Super Sound/Super Stereo DFM for Mono and DFS for Stereo. Early jacket graphics featured a picture of a hypodermic needle to emphasize extreme \"Doctored Stereo\" or \"Sound\". The series contains much dance music as well as many \"Sound Effect\" recordings. There were at least 21 \"Sound Effects\" albums in this series. Many were available in gatefold jackets as well as standard jackets. Some of the artists and tracks were also released under an AFLP/AFSD catalog number. Production started in 1960. New titles were added into the mid 1970s. At least one was also manufactured by Capitol Records and had a Capitol number on the jacket and disk. They continued to be pressed under Audio Fidelity Inc., Audio Fidelity Records Inc, and Audiofidelity Inc. Some of the most popular titles were re-issued under a new label called \"DFS\". At least 5 of the titles were also released as \"Reel to Reel\" stereo tapes. Stereo tapes were usually released in both 3 3/4 ips and 7 1/2 ips and in 2 or 4 track versions. Most highly prized by collectors are the \"Racing\" and \"Military\" titles. The gaps in the catalog numbers indicate that this listing is almost certainly incomplete and will be updated in the future.
