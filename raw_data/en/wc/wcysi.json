Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese method of medicine that is used to relieve health conditions and symptoms, such as pain. During the session, an acupuncturist inserts very thin, steel needles into the patient's skin at multiple different \"acupoints.\" The needles are meant to rebalance the body's energy, or 'qi', and prompt the body to release natural chemicals to fight the illness or negative symptoms in patients. There have been many studies that have proven the effectiveness of this type of treatment. Acupuncture for Vertigo Treatment Acupuncture has been used to alleviate symptoms like pain, dizziness and vertigo for hundreds of years. For many patients, acupuncture is a safe, alternative method to help with their [vertigo](https://alignwc.com/top-10-things-to-know-to-overcome-vertigo/) and imbalance when traditional medications or prescriptions do not provide the relief they need. Acupuncture points can be found throughout the body, and points of the body used in the treatment of vertigo and dizziness are personalized for each patient and are dependent upon underlying health issues and symptoms.
