Vaccines can be a big deal for your immune and nervous system, especially with the levels of stress we've been exposed to this past year. Acupuncture, along with some pre & post home care can be helpful to support your body through the experience and may help to mitigate some common side effects. First off as a disclaimer I will say that in BC acupuncturists and TCMPs are not considered primary care providers and as such it is out of our scope of practice to give any medical information or advice on vaccines, the advantages or risks involved or provide personal opinions. Instead I am compiling some information on how to care for yourself before and after vaccination from a TCM view, should you chose to receive one. The simplified way of explaining a vaccine is that it teaches your immune system how to fight a specific infection by creating the appropriate immune antibodies (fighter cells). While your body creates antibodies, it is possible to feel similar to if your body was fighting an active infection. From a TCM view the vaccine by passes the \"Wei qi\" level (nose, mouth, mucosal membranes) and penetrates directly to interior levels of the body (intramuscular site of injection). This can show up as a \"shao yang\" pattern depending on your immune system response which causes symptoms like fever/chills, sweats, fatigue, muscle aches and soreness. To best prepare your body you can consider the following: The week before your shot treat your body like you are already sick to nurture your immune system eat warm cooked foods, rest plenty, get adequate hydration lessen intensity of physical activity, especially with menses, to conserve your qi & energy [acupressure and moxa Stomach qi line](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLf4fS_DgFD/)to support your immune system Day of your shot: avoid getting the shot while you are having any immune system taxation such as: intense allergies, cold/flu, autoimmune flairs cover your wind gates (the back of your neck) especially if you waiting outside in line book the rest of your day off if possible After your shot: take a day or two off to rest fully continue acting as if you are sick & fighting an infection - rest, warm cooked & easy to digest foods & hydration epsom salt baths can help with swollen lymph nodes, body aches and arm soreness [immune points and/or shao yang acupressure points sj5/gb41](https://www.carmellelauren.com/blog/2020/4/7/downloadable-acupressure-e-book)if side effects occur acupressure li 4 for headaches & pain (photo below) receive acupuncture if possible to help support your immune & nervous systems and to mitigate any side effects that may be present.
