We offer therapies for a wide range of mental health issues and offer hope where other therapies have not provided needed results. We guide and nurture clients through the process of change and transformation, formulate comprehensive treatment plans, help people achieve their mental health goals, and assist them in restoring balance and mental harmony. According to the Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine written by Michael Murray, ND, and Joseph Pizzorno, ND, \"Naturopathic Medicine is a system of medicine that focuses on prevention and use of nontoxic, natural therapies.\" These natural therapies refer to but are not limited to, proper diet and nutrition, exercise, nutritional supplements, herbology, homeopathy, and lifestyle modification and counseling. The six principles on which Naturopathy is established are: Medicine is returning to the grassroots it once followed. Today we are all becoming very aware that we are indeed interconnected and have multiple causes of ill-health that are being acknowledged instead of the traditional medical certainties widely used in the past. This means the evolving norm will be the naturopathic/holistic view, where the body, mind, emotions, social factors, and the environment all determine the health of the individual. We now know that \"curing the patient\" with drugs and surgery is possible without ever \"healing the patient.\" The re-emerging Naturopathic Physician is an example of the true meaning of the word \"doctor.\" Doctor, coming from the Latin \"docere,\" which means \"to teach.\" By teaching the patient how to achieve and maintain good health, the Naturopath empowers their patients with the proper education and motivational tools that are needed to actively participate in their own healing and health maintenance. The patient is changing from that of victim to that of empowered individual. By proper instruction, the patient learns how to achieve a state of balance that is conducive to disease prevention. The function of the Naturopath augmenting the daily health of the individual...incorporated with the Traditional Allopathic Physician interfacing in the time of fulminate disease and trauma...can only lead to a system that maximizes the functioning of the entire medical system.
