Introduction [1](#B1-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Renewable natural resources (such as plant extracts, microorganisms, algae, etc.) are used as biological precursors to synthesize NPs, avoiding the production of toxic and harmful by-products. Eco-friendly biosynthesis is useful for minimizing waste and reduction of pollution by utilizing sustainable and renewable feedstock. In contrast to chemical or physical methods that require highly toxic reductants or high radiation, as well as high temperature and pressure [ [2](#B2-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], biosynthesis utilizes low energy for the initiation the bio-reduction. Moreover, the implementation and use of toxic chemicals and solvents prevent the use of NPs in a range of biomedical and clinical applications [ [3](#B3-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [1](#B1-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Thus, scientists have utilized tissues/organs or whole organisms as the main bioreactors to execute the biosynthesis of metallic and metal oxide NPs with different properties. The production of NPs arising from the resistance mechanism of a certain living organism against a specific metal may alter the chemical nature of the toxic materials making them less- or non-toxic [ [4](#B4-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The natural synthesis can be a result of the bioreduction of the metal ions by enzymes that are oxidized or linking peptides that assemble into a more stable nanostructure [ [5](#B5-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. This means that the well-known instability of NPs in solutions due to agglomeration and dissolution can also be overcome by the natural capping mechanism that usually occurs during biosynthesis. Simultaneously, by using different organisms or extracts, biomolecules, or bioactive compounds in the presence of metal salts, researchers can produce NPs of various shapes, sizes, compositions, and biological activities, such as antimicrobial, anticancer, larvicidal, and antioxidant ones [ [6](#B6-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The strong bounding between biological structures by their functional groups and nanoparticles can produce benign nanoscale materials with demanding sustainable advantages. [7](#B7-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. On the other, except in allopathic medicines, worthy pharmaceutical compounds as key sources of antioxidants, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic moieties have been produced by using biomaterials from plants, herbs, different species, and macromolecules ( [Figure 1](#pharmaceutics-15-01650-f001)) with fewer side effects [ [1](#B1-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Natural materials from renewable energy sources also use safe solvents and reactants and minimize waste products that have health, social, and environmental benefits. Thus, biogenic NPs for biomedical applications have been engineered so that they have improved bioactive performance by complimenting the efficacy of NPs with that of the capping biological agent or are specifically directed towards the diseased cells while decreasing the side effects. A considerable advance has been achieved in many biogenic nanoengineering processes for biomaterial production. The commercialization of successful cost-effective and eco-friendly technologies is of utmost importance for humans but a critical view is necessary for the potential side effects and toxicity of these materials. For that reason, in this review, we have attempted to summarize the biogenic principles of bio-assembly and the construction of nanosystems with biomedical applications. Since many nano drugs rely on metal and metal oxide NPs, we have focused on the biosynthesis of these nanomaterials for therapeutics by giving a background on bio-nanotechnology prospective evolution. Furthermore, some significant applications of biogenic NPs such as cancer therapy and the delivery of antitumor drugs, antimicrobial/antifungal therapy, anti-inflammatory, wound healing, osteoinduction, anti-viral, and antiparasitic functions, as well as their nanotoxicity, have also been discussed. 2. Characteristics of Some Biosynthesized NPs [7](#B7-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Also, the electronic configurations of metal NPs are such that they allow the acceptation or donation of an electron to quench free radicals [ [8](#B8-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Metallic NPs can adopt various physical geometries and electronic assemblies that allow them to exhibit metallic, semiconducting, or insulating characteristics. [9](#B9-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The nano size of the particles also enlarges the penetration potential thus aiding in better utilization of NP properties. Thus, because of the higher site-specific delivery of drugs, the required dose of drugs and side effects will be reduced substantially. In nanosized form, NPs can penetrate the circulatory system and translocate the blood-brain barrier. Such NPs interact in different ways with a large range of biomolecules thus directing various cellular, physicochemical, and biochemical properties [ [10](#B10-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Most biological entities assist stabilization and act as capping agents protecting from coalescence and aggregation. Agglomeration is a phenomenon where the NPs lower the surface energy resulting in a reduction in surface area by increasing the particle size. The biopolymers enhance the biocompatibility of these NPs and prevent agglomeration in clusters that affect their bio-dispersity [ [11](#B11-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The stability of a NP can modulate the biological response by changing the bioavailability, cellular uptake, and toxicity in vitro and in vivo [ [11](#B11-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Factors that manipulate the stability of NPs are based on composition, surface properties, and aggregation state. The combination of molecules from a biological origin that participate in the reduction and capping of NPs promotes their stability, inhibits agglomeration, and impacts their therapeutic effect [ [7](#B7-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [12](#B12-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Today, the most commonly examined metallic NPs are Au, Ag, Pt, Pd, Cu, [13](#B13-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [15](#B15-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. They demonstrate outstanding surface plasmon resonance and can be combined with different biological assemblies, such as oligosaccharides, and proteins to enhance their functions. In the typical chemical synthesis of gold nanoparticles, chloroauric acid is reduced using NaBH4 or sodium citrate as reducing agents, and, at times, seeded growth control is performed to maintain their uniform nanoparticle morphologies. With the use of Au NPs in medicine, these chemical protocols seem detrimental and toxic to humans. Numerous efforts are taken in preparing hybrid AuNPs through chemical processes that involve drug-gold complexation and require surfactants and reducing agents. Various organisms like plants (Lonicara japonica) [ [16](#B16-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], bacteria (Delftia acidovorance) [ [17](#B17-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], fungi (Aspergillum sp.) [ [18](#B18-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], algae [ [19](#B19-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], etc. are used for the biosynthesis of Au NPs. The production is usually initiated by tetrachloroaurate salt (HAuCl4) while the most common shape is spherical, hexagons, and triangles. The preparation of hybrid AuNPs utilizing biomolecules such as proteins [ [20](#B20-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] and antibodies [ [21](#B21-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] is experimented with and has shown efficacy in cancer therapy. Choosing the right materials for biogenesis with a high abundance of reactive compounds, the reduction and capping properties of biocomponents assure stability for different biomedical applications. 2.2. Silver NPs [22](#B22-pharmaceutics-15-01650), [23](#B23-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Silver was found to be the most frequently used nanomaterial (435 products) [ [24](#B24-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Ag NPs are characterized by high sensitivity, conductivity, and chemical stability. Ag NPs exhibit antitumor activity by reducing cell proliferation and promoting intracellular ROS, DNA damage, and apoptosis [ [25](#B25-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. It is also well known that silver is highly toxic to microorganisms, including 16 major species of bacteria [ [26](#B26-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Nonetheless, some microorganisms may survive and grow under certain metal ion concentrations due to their resistance to silver. It is thought that the main mechanisms triggering resistance involve the presence of nitrate reductase enzyme [ [27](#B27-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The synthesis of Ag NPs through plant extracts (Madhuca longifolia) [ [28](#B28-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], bacteria (Bacillus subtilis) [ [ [30](#B30-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], and algae (Botryococcus braunii) [ [31](#B31-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] with different sizes and shapes have been reported. AgNO3 is usually used as precursor salt for biomimetic synthesis while the obtained NPs commonly have spherical, triangular, or hexagonal shapes. The biosynthesis of Ag NPs enhances their stability and may reduce their toxicity. However, despite many therapeutical and medical benefits, depending on the size, shape, and capping agents there may be a problem with the nanotoxicity of silver NPs in humans during long exposition time which will be discussed later in this study. 2.3. Platinum and Palladium NPs [32](#B32-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Few studies revealed that Pt NPs can be biosynthesized from cyanobacteria [ [33](#B33-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], seaweeds [ [34](#B34-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], tea extracts [ [35](#B35-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], honey [ [36](#B36-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], and eggs [38](#B38-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Although the biomimetic synthesis of Pt NPs is limited, a concise review to understand its mechanism and factors that influence NP morphologies has been conducted [ [39](#B39-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [40](#B40-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The biosynthesis of palladium (Pd) NPs is majorly reported from plant-based extracts such as leaf extracts [ [41](#B41-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], peel extracts [ [42](#B42-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], bark extracts [ [43](#B43-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], fruit extracts [ [44](#B44-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], root extracts [ [45](#B45-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] and plant gums [ [46](#B46-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. For biosynthesis, K2PdCl4 solution is usually used. Natural antioxidants, such as monosaccharides, vitamin C, and gallic acid, have been used as reducing agents in Pd NP biosynthesis [ [47](#B47-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. 2.4. Copper and Copper Oxide NPs [48](#B48-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Nowadays, as a promising contender at lower cost, Cu NPs are taking the place of Au and Ag NPs but Cu NPs are highly oxidant in air and water. Another challenging job is to stabilize the NPs after synthesis. The main advantage of using a biogenic route for the production of Cu NPs is stabilization [ [49](#B49-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. For example, capping agents in the phytosynthesis of Cu NPs help them to stabilize for more than 30 days in contrast to chemically produced ones that settle down after 24 h [ [50](#B50-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Biosynthesis involves the use of algae [ [51](#B51-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], sea cucumber [ [52](#B52-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], microorganisms [ [53](#B53-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], and plants [ [54](#B54-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. According to Ying et al., since copper is a transition metal, usually Cu NPs cannot be directly obtained from simple copper salt [ [55](#B55-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], while in biosynthesis cupric acetate (monohydrate (CH3COO)2Cu.H2O) [ [56](#B56-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] or CuSO4 the direct bio-production. [57](#B57-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Biosynthesized CuO NPs have been prepared from leaf extract of Eucaliptus globulos [ [58](#B58-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], mint leaves and orange peels algae (Anabaena cylidrica) [ [60](#B60-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], and bacteria (Serratia sp.) [ [61](#B61-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], usually by using copper sulfate salt precursor. The biosynthesized CuO NPs are thought to have increased antimicrobial activity compared to commercial NPs due to the participation of natural extracts used for reduction [ [3](#B3-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. However, CuO NPs were found to be highly toxic compared to other metal oxide nanomaterials [ [62](#B62-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. 2.5. Zinc Oxide NPs [63](#B63-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. ZnO NPs are considered one of the most promising antibacterial agents because of their low cytotoxicity, compatibility, and good heat resistance [ [63](#B63-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Chemically, the surface of ZnO NPs is rich in -OH groups allowing ZnO to dissolve slowly in both acidic (as in tumor cell microenvironment) and strong basic conditions. For that reason, in medicine, it is used as an antiplatelet agent, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenesis, gene- and drug delivery, dental material, and anti-cancer agent [ [64](#B64-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Due to its good antimicrobial and disinfectant properties, ZnO has found widespread utilization in various dermatological substances [ [65](#B65-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. However, the application of ZnO NPs can be limited because of the wide energy bind gap (3.37 eV) and the high complexation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs [ [66](#B66-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Fortunately, doping with other metal ions such as Au, Ag, Pd, etc., or compounding/capping with other non-metal materials such as chitosan [ [67](#B67-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] can reduce the wide bind gap and strengthen the antibacterial effect. For its biosynthesis, plants (Mentha pulegium) [ [68](#B68-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], (S. aureus) [ [70](#B70-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], and algae (Sargassum multicum) [ [71](#B71-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] have been used. The precursor salt solution can be zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2\u00b72H2O) [ [67](#B67-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] or zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(C2H3O2)2\u00b72H2O) [ [72](#B72-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. 2.6. Other Metal Oxide NPs and maghemite (-Fe2O3) NPs respond to an external magnetic field and can be naturally directed toward magnetic targeting to remotely control the distribution of drug molecules. As magnetic material, iron oxide NPs exposed to alternating magnetic fields can convert electromagnetic energy into heat, which makes them suitable agents for hyperthermia therapy of cancer. The magnetic properties of iron NPs can be tuned by changing the size and shape of the nanocrystals, inducing core-shell coupling, doping with other metals, or forming nanoclusters by or encapsulation [ [74](#B74-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The biosynthesis of Fe3O4 NPs allows the production of particles with a size of 2-80 nm, which is much smaller than the 87-400 nm size of the same wet chemically synthesized Fe3O4 particles [ [75](#B75-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [76](#B76-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. This property utilized for treating cancer is called photodynamic therapy. The biosynthesized TiO2 NPs are ecologically friendly and demonstrate high oxidizing potential [ [77](#B77-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. When comparing the anticancer activity of plain and biomodified TiO2 NPs, the superior performance of the biogenic NPs was also demonstrated [ [78](#B78-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Moreover, plant-mediated production of TiO2 NPs resulted in a synthesis of nanomaterial, having functional groups such as tannins and phenols, which help in the stabilization of TiO2 NPs and their increased antioxidant potential [ [79](#B79-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [80](#B80-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. In the biomedical field, CeO2 NPs are mostly used as therapeutic agents, drug-delivery carriers, and antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antiparasitic ointments because of their unique surface properties and their chemistry, biocompatibility, and high stability [ [81](#B81-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The presence of a mixed valence state (both Ce3+ and Ce4+) and quick transition of the oxidation states play an important role in the scavenging reaction of oxygen while the surface Ce3+:Ce4+ ratio influences biological interactions [ [80](#B80-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Biogenic synthesis of CeO2 NPs has been reported by using plant extracts [ [82](#B82-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], bacteria [ [83](#B83-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], fungi [ [84](#B84-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], algae [ [85](#B85-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], or biological products [ [86](#B86-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Biogenic CeO2 NPs have shown promising results in treating drug-resistant pathogens and fungi, as well as cancers such as colon, cervical, breast, and osteosarcoma ones [ [81](#B81-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. 3. Biogenic Metallic NPs Production [1](#B1-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [Figure 2](#pharmaceutics-15-01650-f002)illustrates the mechanisms, participating components and the affecting factors of the biogenic fabrication of NPs using plants and microorganisms. Despite being sustainable and environmentally friendly, the biosynthesis could be sluggish and time-consuming while the synthesized NPs may be not monodispersed [ [87](#B87-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. For that reason, optimization of the control factors and careful selection of the organisms may allow the implementation of such methods in large-scale production. After optimization, the time for biogenic production could be much shorter than physicochemical synthesis. For example, by using brown alga Padina pavonia, Abdel-Raouf et al. were able to synthesize silver NPs within 2 min [ [88](#B88-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Adding 200 mg of P. pavonia ethanolic or chloroform extract the color changed from colorless to brownish black within 2 min suggesting the formation of silver NPs whose sizes ranged from 49.6 to 86.4 nm. Moreover, to activate the process, a fusion of biogenic methods with alternative routes such as ultrasound and microwave was also applied [ [89](#B89-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Microwave heating, for example, provides fast primary heating and enhanced reaction kinetic thus boosting the reaction rate and increasing the yields [ [6](#B6-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [Figure 3](#pharmaceutics-15-01650-f003)). Simultaneously, the biogenic synthesis could face challenges in producing monodisperse NPs with fine tune particle size distribution [ [90](#B90-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Additionally, some nanoparticles produced by microorganisms can be less stable as opposed to those synthesized by chemical processes [ [91](#B91-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. However, with the proper selection of the best biological candidates based on their inherited properties of growth rate and biochemical activities as well as parameters such as pH, temperature, process time, and reagent concentration, the biogenic processes can be improved with an attempt to obtain high quality and yield of biosynthesized NPs at the expanse of lower cost because of lack of organic solvents, thermal stabilizers, and expensive production techniques. 3.1. Biosynthesized NPs by Using Plants and Their Extracts [5](#B5-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Although the mechanisms of plant-mediated synthesis of NPs are still under continual research, it is known that organic matter plays a vital role in crystal growth and forming certain particle sizes [ [92](#B92-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Negatively charged groups concentrate positive ions from the solution, thus contributing to ion saturation to initiate the nucleation. The main functional groups involved in the reduction of metal ions are hydroxyl, amino, carbonyl, and methoxide, which electrostatically interact with the ions and lead to their reduction [ [93](#B93-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The ionic forms of metal can be easily detached from anionic parts because of the reduction process that renders them stable in the presence of plant extracts [ [94](#B94-pharmaceutics-15-01650), [95](#B95-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [96](#B96-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. For instance, the many metal ions absorbed on the surface of preformed nuclei will lead to secondary reduction and enlargement of NPs [ [97](#B97-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. As the reaction temperature increases, the reduction rate rises and many metal ions are consumed for NPs formation, thus blocking the secondary reduction process on the surface of the preformed nuclei, which leads to small and highly dispersed NPs formations with increased yield [ [98](#B98-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Simultaneously, with the increase in reaction time the size of the metal NPs also increases due to aggregation. Under different pH conditions, desired size and shape uniformity can be obtained [ [99](#B99-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The growth rate of NPs increases with the increase of the reducing agents, but too many reducing agents may trigger a bridging effect among the produced NPs and their aggregation [ [100](#B100-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Additionally, the composition of the plant extract that contains a different concentration of phytochemicals is also an important factor in the bio-assembly. The phytochemicals responsible for the reduction and cupping amides, alkaloids, etc. These constituents effectively activate the reduction mechanisms and reduce and stabilize the produced NPs. Some plants, such as cruciferous vegetable extracts, are also capable of the synthesis of bimetallic NPs in the form of core-shell structures of Au core and Ag shell [ [101](#B101-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [Table 1](#pharmaceutics-15-01650-t001)demonstrates some recent achievements of plant-mediated NP synthesis together with the particle characteristics and their application. It can be summarized that biosynthesis is simple, relatively rapid, and cost-effective. When used in the nanobiotechnology field, many plants containing pharmacologically active substances can support the action of treatment. However, when using plants, it is hard to maintain monodisperse in the NP population as well as reproducibility of the process [ [102](#B102-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Because of the presence of many organic compounds in the plant extracts, it may also be difficult to identify the exact reactive components. Another issue in photosynthesis is the use of plants of commercial value as reducing and stabilizing agents, which affects the efficacy of the synthetic procedure [ [103](#B103-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Challenges associated with unoptimized reaction process parameters and unexplored qualitative growth kinetics of NPs are also obstacles for the successful commercialization of phytogenic processes [ [103](#B103-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. 3.2. Biosynthesized NPs by Using Microorganisms 3.2.1. Bacterial Synthesis [127](#B127-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Bacteria are extremely adaptable, fast-growing, and have environmental abundance. Bacteria are also capable of surviving various stressful conditions, including the presence of higher concentrations of toxic metals [ [128](#B128-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. When exposed to high concentrations of heavy metal ions, they use different defense mechanisms to overcome the stress conditions. Depending on the location of NP formation, the biogenesis of NPs can be either extracellular or intracellular by encapsulation in the cytoplasm. The mechanism behind the extracellular synthesis of NPs includes the aggregation of metal ions on the cell surface and the involvement of enzymes. The negatively charged polysaccharides containing phosphoric and carboxylic groups can bind to the positively charged metal/metal oxide ions via electrostatic interaction [ [129](#B129-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Moreover, because of the presence of negatively-charged amino acids, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid, various enzymes and peptides are essential for the reduction of metal ions to NPs. The main enzymes are oxidoreductases, such as nitrate reductase, sulfate reductase, and cellular transporters [ [130](#B130-pharmaceutics-15-01650), [131](#B131-pharmaceutics-15-01650), [132](#B132-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. For example, after the initial electrostatic interaction of the metallic ions with the cell wall of the bacteria, reduction and the bio-reduced metallic nuclei growth can be assisted by NADH the enzyme-assisted reduction, various amino-acid residuals can link to the metal or metal oxide ions and then reduce them to metal or metal oxide NPs [ [131](#B131-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Metal-reducing strains such as Shewanella have evolved a mechanism for electron transfer across the cell membrane via periplasm to the surface that involves c-type cytochromes from quinol at the inner membrane to metal oxide surface (Fe(III) oxide) at the outer membrane [ [132](#B132-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Other authors found that hemiacetal and aldehyde groups of exopolysaccharides in E. coli were involved as bio-reducing agents in Ag NPs production [ [133](#B133-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. After contact with exopolysaccharides, metal ions are chelated and after that reduced and capped by the various groups of reducing sugars. Although actinomycetes were found to synthesize NPs via both intracellular and extracellular mechanisms, extracellular biomineralization was commonly used for commercial applications [ [13](#B13-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Among them, Streptomyces sp. is most widely utilized in pharmaceutical applications because 55% of the known antibiotics are produced by them. [134](#B134-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The magnetosomes are organic-coated nanocrystals usually containing iron oxide NPs with an organic layer of bacterial phospholipid membrane that can be applied in cancer therapy, molecular imaging [ [135](#B135-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], or carrying drugs or other loads in cancer treatment [ [136](#B136-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [137](#B137-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. However, compared with plant synthesis, the bioproduction of NPs using microorganisms can be in some cases pathogenic to humans, and it requires precise control over cultivating and maintaining the microbial cells. Other main issues are the need for a mechanical breakdown of the cell wall, centrifugation, purification of NPs, and difficulty in controlling their geometry [ [138](#B138-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Compared with fungi, bacteria produce a much smaller volume of NPs because of their lower protein production [ [87](#B87-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The bacteria culturing is also tedious, the process conditions for bacteria growth are inflexible, and the reduction process is slow, lasting from hours to days [ [139](#B139-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. 3.2.2. Fungal Synthesis [140](#B140-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Fungi can secrete a large amount of red-ox active extracellular proteins, thus increasing the synthesis of NPs forming insoluble metal-protein conjugates. They were also found to have higher productivity and higher tolerance to metals because of the higher cell wall binding capacity of these ions with biomass and higher bioaccumulation ability [ [141](#B141-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Additionally, fungi possess reducing components, proteins, and enzymes (such as reductase) on their cell surface [ [142](#B142-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The polysaccharide chitin, a key ingredient in the fungal cell wall, was also found to be involved in heavy metal complexation and biogenic NP production [ [143](#B143-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [144](#B144-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The reduction of the metal ions to NPs is accompanied by the oxidation of NADPH to NADP+, whereas naphthoquinones and anthraquinones facilitate the reduction by a quinone-based shuttle [ [145](#B145-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Alternatively, NPs or metal ions may diffuse through the cell membrane and be reduced by red-ox systems in the cytoplasm. The change in pH in the medium can trigger the formation of NPs with different sizes since the changes in pH influence the acidic or basic nature of amino acids that participate in biogenic synthesis [ [146](#B146-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The incubation temperature, salt concentration, and incubation time also affected the size and rate of the extracellular bio-fabrication of Au NPs [ [147](#B147-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [148](#B148-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Fungal micelles can withstand pressure, agitation, flow, or other conditions compared to plant materials or bacteria. However, similarly to bacteria, the major drawback of fungi-produced NPs relates to biosafety and low rate for synthesis in comparison with plant extract. Some species, such as F. oxysporum, are pathogenic, which makes them a health concern, while others, such as Trichoderma fungus, are vastly utilized in food and medical application [ [149](#B149-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Attention should also be paid to the production of mycelia-free filtrates. 3.2.3. Yeast Synthesis [150](#B150-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. More focus is put on extracellular synthesis, since additional operations like ultrasound processing and chemical treatment are eliminated. [151](#B151-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] and Ag [ [152](#B152-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] NPs, but, recently, some other species have been adopted as biogenic NP producers. For example, Zhang et al. demonstrated a biosynthesis of Au NPs with hexagonal, ingens LH-F1 [ [153](#B153-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The genetically engineered yeast strain Pichia pastoris has also been used for the biogenic fabrication of Ag NPs [ [154](#B154-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The yeast strain was transformed with an from Mucor racemosus produced cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme. Thus, the yeasts were capable to produce stable Ag NPs with a size of 70-180 nm. Not only commonly produced Ag NPs but also Pd NPs with hexagonal form and a size of 32 nm were synthesized by Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ [155](#B155-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its three mutants with deleted genes were also used for the production of ZnO NPs with an average size of 20 nm [ [156](#B156-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Likewise, anatase TiO2 NPs with an average size of less than 12 nm were biosynthesized through incubation with Baker's yeast [ [157](#B157-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. They showed a significant antibacterial effect on selected pathogens especially against Gram-positive bacteria in the presence or absence of sunlight exposure. Easy control of mass production and rapid growth of yeasts make them preferred microorganisms for NP biosynthesis. [Figure 4](#pharmaceutics-15-01650-f004). [158](#B158-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Extra steps such as detergent treatment or ultrasonication, which further increase the price of production, are mandatory for the separation of NPs in the intracellular biogenesis route [ [159](#B159-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Additional limitations can be operational impediments such as (1) longer time (up to 120 h) for the reduction reactions; (2) hard retrieval of NPs from biomass; (3) selection of the best organism for the biosynthesis and biocatalyst state; and (4) picking the optimal conditions for cell growth and enzyme activity [ [103](#B103-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Additionally, problems related to the commercialization of the biosynthesis protocol at an industrial level are the main expected obstacles [ [103](#B103-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. 3.3. Virus Synthesis [13](#B13-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Hydroxyl groups in tyrosine and carboxyl groups in asparagine and glutamine or indole groups in tryptophan may participate in the reduction of the metallic ions. The sequence configuration has the potential to attract metal ions and controls the size and morphology of NPs [ [160](#B160-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Pathogens such as animal and plant viruses and bacteriophages have been used for nanobiotechnological purposes because of their structural and chemical stability, lack of toxicity and pathogenicity in humans, and ease of production [ [158](#B158-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Plant viruses are easy to cultivate and non-pathogenic to humus and, therefore, can be used to produce NPs with the nanomedical application. For example, a high yield of Au and Ag NPs with small sizes was reported to be biosynthesized when a low concentration of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was added to Hordeum vulgare (barley) or Nicotiana benthamiana plant extract as opposed to those without viral particles [ [161](#B161-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Recently, Thangavelu et al. produced Au-Ag composite NPs through plant pathogenic squash leaf curl China virus [ [162](#B162-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The hybrid NPs biosynthesized through virus nanobiotemplate good rare bacteriophage family, C3 morphotype), also used as a reducing agent, revealed the presence of NPs in the form of spheres, hexagons, triangles, rhomboids, and rectangles, with a size ranging from 20 to 100 nm [ [163](#B163-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Viruses can be used for the production of nanocomposites with metal NPs useful for target drug delivery and cancer therapy [ [164](#B164-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. For example, retargeted adenoviral vectors covalently bound to AuNPs have been also used as selective agents for the delivery of NPs to tumor cells [ [165](#B165-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. However, the involvement of host organisms for protein synthesis and a small amount of research on large-scale applications still limit NPs' production by viruses. Moreover, a few viruses displaying nucleation properties have been recently used as bio-templates for NPs synthesis [ [162](#B162-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Selecting the optimal process conditions for virus template synthesis and identifying the types of amino acids involved in the surface mineralization process are also crucial for the optimization of nucleation and growth of NPs [ [162](#B162-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. 3.4. Algae Synthesis [166](#B166-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Cyanobacteria strains grow faster than plants and are suitable for the eco-friendly and time-saving synthesis of NPs at ambient temperature. The interaction between Ag-containing solution and biomass allows the formation of Ag NPs without degradation of the biomass [ [167](#B167-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Microalgae-like diatoms (D. gallica and N. atomus) were also of producing Au NPs and Au-silica NPs [ [168](#B168-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. It was also discovered that the formulation of Ag NPs includes extracellular compounds (polysaccharides) participating in the cell-free culture media [ [169](#B169-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Al-Katib et al. [ [170](#B170-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] found that the presence of specific functional groups in proteins is important in cupping and stabilizing during the extracellular synthesis of Ag NPs in Gloeocapsa sp. In addition to microalgae, biosynthesis of [ [171](#B171-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] was also reported. Tetraselmus kochinensis has also been shown to produce intracellular Au NPs [ [172](#B172-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The marine algae are found to be suitable for many biomedical applications, such as anticancer, antiviral, antioxidant, etc. agents, because the biosynthesized NPs contain different bioactive compounds and secondary metabolites [ [149](#B149-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Algae are characterized by easy culturing, high growth rate and biomass productivity compared to other microorganisms, which makes the biogenic algae-mediated process cost-effective. However, similar to microorganisms, downstream processing for the extraction of intracellularly produced NPs is still challenging while extracellular biogenesis is greatly influenced by cultivation conditions [ [173](#B173-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Various challenges, such as strain selection, low reaction rate and yield, size control and monodispersity, and cytotoxicity to non-target cells, still limit the scaling up of the bio-process to a commercial scale [ [174](#B174-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Limited information is also available on NPs biogenesis using microalgae, which hinders their applicability [ [175](#B175-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. 3.5. Biosynthesized NPs by Using Enzymes and Biomolecules [176](#B176-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The first one is the most convenient and frequently used. Several natural compounds such as cellulose [ [177](#B177-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], chitosan [ [178](#B178-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], and silk fibers [ [179](#B179-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] have been reported as reducing agents of Au3+ utilized for the biosynthesis and stabilization of Au NPs. The biogenesis of TiO2 NPs using starch [ [181](#B181-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], albumen [ [182](#B182-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], and lysozymes [ [183](#B183-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] has been reported. Although different polysaccharides, such as cellulose, chitosan, dextran, and starch, have been used for the production of metallic NPs, they require additional stabilizing. In contrast, pullulan was found to be effective in the reduction and stabilization of Au NPs produced from HAuCl4 solution [ [184](#B184-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. An interesting study by Safat et al. demonstrated cerium oxide NP synthesis obtained from marine oyster extract used as a bio-reducing and capping/stabilizing agent. The marine biosynthesized NPs with a size of 15 \u00b1 1 nm had no cytotoxic effect on normal cells [ [185](#B185-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Therefore, a great variety of polymers with several functional groups can produce NPs. However, all these polymers should be precisely examined for their reducing activity, efficacy, and bio-toxicity. The difference in concentration of active molecules because of external factor changes can affect the biosynthesis procedure [ [186](#B186-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [187](#B187-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. With the increasing volume of enzymes, smaller NPs were produced. Similarly, an enzyme, Ia bacteriocin, belonging to nisin peptides, was also used for the biosynthesis of Au NP with a small size (25 nm) [ [188](#B188-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The enzyme consisting of 34 amino acids was obtained from Lactococcus lactis susbp. Arib et al. also reported a of hybrid Au NPs using manganese superoxide protein in the presence of a zwitterionic sulphonic acid-based buffer as a reducing agent [ [189](#B189-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. It follows that the enzymatic approach of NP synthesis proposes superior characteristics and easy purification of the obtained NPs but it is more expensive and time-consuming. [Table 2](#pharmaceutics-15-01650-t002)sums up the biosynthesized NPs of various sources together with their characteristics and application. 4. Therapy and Drug Delivery of Biosynthesized NPs [190](#B190-pharmaceutics-15-01650), [202](#B202-pharmaceutics-15-01650), [211](#B211-pharmaceutics-15-01650), [214](#B214-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. However, when loaded with drugs, their efficiency can be additionally enhanced. On the other hand, to achieve target delivery and seize the rapid degradation of drugs, the concept of controlled drug-delivery systems (DDS) that overcome both physicochemical and biological barriers has been developed [ [223](#B223-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Because of the large surface area, NPs have drawn significant attention as potential DDS that can bind, adsorb, or entrap different drug molecules. The drug intended for release is usually directly bound to the nanocarrier and the time for release is of prime importance because it should not dissociate before reaching the target. The small NPs can pass through the extracellular matrix and assess layers that normal drugs are unable to reach [ [223](#B223-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Because of their unique chemical and physical properties that completely differ from their bulk counterparts, using NPs as potent DDS can improve the loading capacity and resides in sustained drug release, higher bioavailability, and enhanced target intracellular penetration [ [224](#B224-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. It was also found that nanocarriers containing natural compounds may be useful for delaying the development of drug resistance and stimulating the low response to treatment with conventional medicine [ [225](#B225-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [226](#B226-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The selection of a particular metallic nano-vector is based on the physicochemical features of the drugs. Moreover, natural materials can provide different solutions for improving drug loading challenges. By presenting different active groups, chemicals such as covalent or hydrogen bonds, or physical interactions, such as electrostatic, may take place between drug polarities and capping or nanomaterials. Some drugs themselves, such as vancomycin and doxorubicin, also come from natural substances. 4.1. Antitumor Activity [227](#B227-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Therefore, the necessity of new drug development is an obvious and urgent task. Because of their large surface area, high drug-loading capacity, and tumor targeting, nano-drugs have attracted much attention with superiority in tumor treatment. Many studies, some of which are reviewed below, have shown that biogenic NPs themselves indicate significant chemotherapeutic effects on various tumor cells. The main mechanisms accounting for antitumor activity of biogenic NPs are (1) apoptotic pathways depending on increased levels of ROS that led to oxidative stress and DNA fragmentation; (2) interference with macromolecules such as proteins and DNA resulting in disturbance of cell functions; and (3) interaction to cell membranes thus changing its permeability and causing mitochondrial dysfunction [ [100](#B100-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The scientists mainly focus on biogenic NPs synthesized by plants because phytoconstituents could exert activity against cancer cells through the production of ROS participating in phagocytosis, regulation in cell proliferation, and intercellular signaling [ [228](#B228-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Furthermore, phenols and polyphenolic compounds were discovered to be associated with atherosclerosis and inhibition of cancer [ [229](#B229-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. 4.1.1. Biosynthesized Metal NPs in Cancer Therapy and Delivery of Antitumor Drugs [230](#B230-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Active targeting includes the conjugation of different molecules, such as DNA, peptides, and antibodies, to target specific cells [ [4](#B4-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. At present, Au NPs are known to be efficient as pharmaceutical drug carriers that improve antitumor efficiency. Au NPs themselves, with a size of 15-35 nm, extracellularly developed by using Paracoccus haeundaensis (marine bacterium), have demonstrated non-toxicity of human cells while preventing the growth of AGS and A549 cancerous cells at different concentrations [ [231](#B231-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Au NPs synthesized from Solanum xanthocarpum leaf extract also demonstrated induced apoptosis of the nasopharyngeal cancer C666-1 cell line with a decline in both cell viability and colony formation upon treatment [ [232](#B232-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The cell death was proved to be caused by autophagy and mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway. Similarly, the amalgamation of Au NPs with Scutellaria barbata plant extract possessed effective anticancer activity against the pancreatic cell line PANC-1 [ [233](#B233-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The authors found upregulation of the expression levels of Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Bax genes while the gene expression of Bid and BCl-2 genes was downregulated. Likewise, Zhang Y et al. reported that verboascoside (a major bioactive constituent of the Tsoong herb)-loaded Au NPs exhibited apoptosis in both in vitro (K562 tumor cells) and in vivo studies with mouse models [ [234](#B234-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The intravenous injection of the NPs effectively inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis of tumor cells. Additionally, the well-adsorbed tumor cells Au NPs were susceptible to radiation in the near-infrared region which is frequently used in heat therapy for selective cancer elimination [ [235](#B235-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [236](#B236-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. By using trisodium citrates capping and reducing agent, Au NPs with an average size of about 22 nm were biosynthesized and functionalized with PEG and folic acid and loaded with the anticancer drug Docetaxel [ [237](#B237-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. As compared with Docetaxel, the functionalized Au NPs demonstrated good potential for target drug delivery when tested by using the A549 cell line (lung cancer cell line). By using chitosan as a reducing and capping agent, Malati et al. demonstrated that Au NPs conjugated with rifampicin ensured the biocompatible controlled release of the drug in the body [ [238](#B238-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Modified by activated folic acid ligands, biosynthesized Au NPs loaded with chlorambucil showed higher toxicity towards HeLa, RKO, and A549 cell lines as compared to Au NPs and chlorambucil alone [ [239](#B239-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The release rate of the drug was faster at lower pH (5.4) than at pH 6.7 and pH 7.2. Therefore, the synthesized biogenic NPs demonstrated potential for pH-sensitive drug delivery in a tumor microenvironment where the pH value varied between 4.5 and 6.5 and slowed drug release in the bloodstream (pH 7.2). [240](#B240-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Doxorubicin is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent and several attempts have been made to tether them with metal nanoparticles. These efforts are continuing since most cancer cells have developed resistance to doxorubicin. By using curry leaves and neem extracts, Thirumurugan et al. [ [241](#B241-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] formulated Pt NPs and Ag NPs with encapsulated Doxorubicin (Dox). In vitro tests with MCF-7 cell lines revealed that a better inhibition value (IC50) against MCF-7 demonstrated Dox-coated Ag NPs than Pt NPs. Simultaneously, the toxicity of both drug-loaded nanomaterials was found to be concentration-dependent. It follows that the increased pharmacokinetic characteristics of the engineered nanocomposite result in better therapeutic effects. Phytogenic monodisperse (below 10 nm) Pt NPs and Pd by using the medical plant Gloriosa superba tuber extract showed high anticancer activity against the human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell line [ [242](#B242-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Pt anticancer activity than Pd NPs (36.3%). It was confirmed that the predominant mechanism in anticancer activity was apoptosis-induced due to the externalization flavonoids acquired from white (Camellia sinensis) extract with a size of 6-18 nm were found to be more antiproliferative towards human leukemia (MOLT-4) cells than pure white tee extract, doxorubicin or cisplatin [ [243](#B243-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The anticancer activity of the biosynthesized NPs was mediated through the induction of apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest. Recently, Prakashkumar et al. reported the preparation of neem gum-coated Pd NPs that NPs cells via ROS-induced MMP loss activating apoptosis. The demonstrated the biocompatibility of neem gum-coated Pd NPs as they did not exhibit any cytotoxicity or hemolysis, thus making them an ideal candidate for antimicrobial and cancer therapy [ [244](#B244-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. 4.1.2. Biogenic Metal Oxide NPs in Cancer Therapy and Delivery of Antitumor Drugs [122](#B122-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Similarly, biogenic porous rod ZnO NPs synthesized by using Borassus flabellifer fruit extract and an average size of 55 nm were utilized for drug delivery of Doxorubicin [ [245](#B245-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The conjugate had low systemic toxicity in a murine model and high loading capacity and therapy efficacy. Drug-loaded ZnO NPs indicated a pH-responsive release of drug preferentially to malignant HT-29 and MCF-7 cells. Not only plant-synthesized but also fungus-mediated ZnO Through with a size of 39-115 nm showed significant cytotoxic effects against rapidly dividing HEP-2 cell lines [ [246](#B246-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. TiO2 NPs induced cytotoxicity in human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, thereby proving to be anticancer agents with their utilization as drug delivery agents [ [248](#B248-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [249](#B249-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The authors attributed the apoptotic effect of copper oxide NPs to the generation of ROS triggering disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. [250](#B250-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. For that purpose, Tyagi et al. [ [251](#B251-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] have biosynthesized SPIONs via biogenic techniques and further coated them with tamoxifen-conjugated bovine albumin. The NPs were efficiently internalized into breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D) and effectively reduced cell proliferation with IC50 values of 5 \u00b1 0.4 M and 6.3 \u00b1 0.2 M in MCF-7 and T47D, respectively. The SPIONs were confirmed to be safe for use as DDS by acute toxicity studies in the rat. Likewise, cellulose nanofiber composites with a size of 62.5 nm with Fe3O4-Ag2O NPs loaded with etoposide and methotrexate demonstrated a slow and steady release of methotrexate (63.8%) and etoposide (78.9%) together with non-toxicity which suitable for anticancer application [ [252](#B252-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [Table 3](#pharmaceutics-15-01650-t003)shows some examples of biosynthesized metallic and metal oxide NPs, their characteristic features, tested objects, and the main outcomes of their antitumor activities. The cytotoxicity triggered by biosynthesized NPs is based on their type, shape, size, and surface chemistry. The mechanisms of action of biogenic NPs are still not fully studied but based on the results reviewed in this study, it can be concluded that they include both ROS generation and interaction with macromolecules. The formation of ROS by the NPs is an important mechanism in toxicity that interferes with the equilibrium between oxidant and antioxidant species thus causing changes in intercellular activities. The latter mainly includes DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, induction of oxidative stress, and membrane disruption ( [Figure 5](#pharmaceutics-15-01650-f005)). Both mechanisms activate apoptotic pathways or trigger necrosis. Most of the biogenic NPs achieve both passing targeting and obvious antitumor effects while drug loading for cancer therapy can additionally improve the efficacy and reduce the death rate. 4.2. Biogenic NPs for Antimicrobial/Antifungal Therapy [276](#B276-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Therefore, the activity of biogenic metal NPs depends on the type, size, shape, charge, and capping, as well as genus and species [ [277](#B277-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. For example, Hamed et al. demonstrated antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of Ag NPs synthesized from actinomycetes extracted from the marine sponge Crella cyathophora. These biogenic Ag NPs showed antimicrobial activity towards various Gram-positive and negative bacterial strains particularly P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae. Further, Ag NPs derived from marine actinomycetes exhibited significant biofilm inhibition against B. subtilis, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa [ [278](#B278-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Shabaan et al. reported the biogenesis of silver, selenium, and zinc oxide NPs from Streptomyces enissocaesilis, which also exhibited antimicrobial activities against the various standard and resistant bacterial isolates [ [279](#B279-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Small-sized (2-7 nm) Pt NPs biosynthesized Taraxacum leavigatum showed strong antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa and B. subtilis, which have strong defensive mechanisms against various antibiotics [ [280](#B280-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Phytosynthesized NiO NPs reduced with garlic and ginger increased the bactericidal activity against multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus [ [281](#B281-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. ZnO NPs with an size of 66.25 nm also biosynthesized with Albizia lebbeck stem bark extracts and revealed strong antibacterial potential against Bacillus cereus, S. aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Salmonella typhi pathogens [ [122](#B122-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Likewise, by using bark extract of Acacia ceasia (L.) Wild, ZnO NPs with an average size of 32.32 nm and hexagonal morphology have been synthesized by al. [ [282](#B282-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The biomimetically synthesized ZnO NPs exhibited strong antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (S. aureus) and, especially, against gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria strains at all tested (250, 500, and 1000 g) concentrations. [283](#B283-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. High inhibitory activity, especially against E. coli bacteria and T. harzianum fungal strain, was demonstrated by biosynthesized stem bark [ [284](#B284-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. However, the zone of inhibition was lesser in fungi as opposed to bacteria due to the difference in the structure of the cell walls of both organisms. [285](#B285-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Thus, the membrane permeability and intercellular communication are interrupted. NPs can interact with thiol groups and phosphorus of proteins and DNA thus disturbing the metabolic processes like DNA replication, protein synthesis, respiratory chains, etc., and causing cell death [ [286](#B286-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Some NPs can trigger the production of ROS thus causing phospholipid oxidation and the collapse of internal RNA, DNA, and proteins [ [287](#B287-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. In thick cell wall microorganisms, such as gram-positive bacteria, moderate antibacterial activity is usually observed, since the cell dislocates the NPs by a transport system. [288](#B288-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The induction of ROS and the initiation of oxidative stress cause interaction with different macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins that can lead to cell death [ [289](#B289-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [Figure 6](#pharmaceutics-15-01650-f006). They include direct contact of the NPs with the cell wall that damages the surface structures and penetration inside the cell. Additionally, the biogenic NPs can indirectly interact with the inside and outside cell environment generating ROS and metal ions that further damage the cell wall, change the permeability of the membrane, and affects protein, ribosome, and DNA functions. The biosynthesized NPs can also directly interfere with macromolecules, ribosomes, and mitochondria, thus ultimately triggering cell death by both mechanisms. [290](#B290-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The authors explained the fungicidal activity of the nanocomposite with inhibition of ergosterol synthesis and biofilm formation by increasing ROS levels. Furthermore, bio-synthesized by Chlorella vulgaris composites of biogenic CuFe2O4@Ag Ciprofloxacin high antibacterial activity against multi-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [ [291](#B291-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The synergetic effect of biosynthesized Ag NPs with Azithromycin and Clarithromycin against microorganisms causing dental caries and periodontal disease (such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, was also reported by Emmanuel et al. [ [292](#B292-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. All of these findings might be useful for determining if the potential efficacy of biosynthesized NPs of various types, sizes, and shapes might be boosted if different species are used for biogenesis. The effect of biogenic NPs on many bacteria is even better than that of bactericides or antibiotics. Most of the outcomes underline that these alternative antibacterial biogenic agents can prevent the growth and spread of microorganisms and alleviate microbial disease illnesses. 4.3. Anti-Inflammatory Activity [293](#B293-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Mild inflammation has a positive effect on living tissue for preventing the spread of pathogens and limiting the lesions. On the contrary, severe inflammation processes can cause denaturation or necrosis of organs, and can lead to fluid accumulation and mutual adhesion between organs, thus harming their normal functionality. Therefore, anti-inflammatory drug application is important in some disease treatments. The usually used steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have adverse effects and cause harmful reactions, which limit their application. Additionally, during acute inflammation, the drug efficacy is delayed because of slow absorption [ [294](#B294-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [295](#B295-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Likewise, gold NPs synthesized from Prunus serrulate fruit extract suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), A2 enzyme is known to participate in the primary way of producing prostaglandins. Biogenic ZnO NPs produced from Lantana camara flower extract with an average size of 21.4-27.2 nm were found to inhibit phospholipase A2 activity via binding Zn2+ ions to its active site [ [297](#B297-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], thus performing their anti-inflammatory activity. Similarly, biosynthesized ZnO NPs employing leaf extract of Pelargonium odoratissimum (L.) with an average size of 34 nm showed a concentration-dependent anti-inflammatory effect via stabilizing the biological membranes, thus preventing the release of active mediators of inflammation and lytic enzymes [ [298](#B298-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. A scheme summarizing the anti-inflammatory action of biogenic NPs is presented in [Figure 7](#pharmaceutics-15-01650-f007). Consequently, the development of biogenic nano candidates as an alternative clinical approach for anti-inflammatory treatment requires an understanding of the regulatory pathways and molecular mechanisms triggered by these nanomaterials. 4.4. Wound Healing Properties [299](#B299-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. During the healing of various cells, growth factors, cytokines, coagulation, and vascularization growth factors intricate each other. Current therapies involve applying steroidal, nonsteroidal, and chemotherapeutic drugs with various side effects or therapies such as dressing materials, vascular surgery, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, etc. With the advance of the nano concept and knowledge of the significant antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of biogenic NPs, these nano-substances were found to be appropriate to facilitate skin wound healing. Predominate bacteria found during the early stages of infections are Gram-positive (like S. aureus, S. pyogenes), whereas Gram-negative (such as E. coli, P. aeruginosa) are found later when a chronic wound develops [ [300](#B300-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. When the immune system is unable to remove the pathogens, the wound-healing process is disrupted [ 15-30 nm size Aloe vera extract in isolated bacterial nano-cellulose (BNC) were able to promote wound healing of human dermal fibroblast cells after 48 h [ [302](#B302-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The Fe2O3/BNC nanocomposite reduced the expression of microRNA (miR-29b and miR-29c) thus causing an increase in gene expression of other genes (TGF-1, CTNNB1, MMP2, MMp9, WNT4), which resulted in faster wound healing. Similarly, Barleria gibsoni leaf extract mediated synthesis of ZnO NPs with sizes between 30 and 80 nm improved substantially the wound healing efficacy in male albino Wistar rats [ [303](#B303-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The wound contraction percentage of the nano-ZnO gel formulation reached above 98% on the 20th day as compared with the control group, thus avoiding wound chronicity. Sankar et al. confirmed that the Ficus religiosa leaf extract-tailored copper oxide NPs demonstrated both substantial inhibition activity against human pathogenies strains and enhanced wound healing activity in Wistar Albino rats [ [304](#B304-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [305](#B305-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. In this regard, promising candidates are NP-loaded wound dressings that can reduce wound contraction time and wound infections without substantial side effects [ [306](#B306-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Such an approach includes the development of biodegradable and porous polymer membranes loaded with biogenic antimicrobial agents to promote healing and inhibit pathogens [ [307](#B307-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. For example, Augustine et al. used photosynthesized Ag NPs through black pepper (P. nigrum) to incorporate them in electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) membranes, and provided antimicrobial properties of the dressing composite material [ [308](#B308-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The membranes exhibited higher mechanical properties and antibacterial activities against both E. coli and S. aureus [ [309](#B309-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Moreover, the same research group utilized Ag NPs photosynthesized by Mimosa pudica to obtain electrospun biodegradable polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) membranes. The latter demonstrated good mechanical strength, wound fluid uptake, blood compatibility, cytocompatibility, and antibacterial potential. At optimum Ag NP composition, the composite membranes booted the wound healing in an in vitro wound contraction model. 4.5. Osteoinductive and Angiogenetic Activities [310](#B310-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] phyto-synthesized Au NPs by using Salacia chinensis to evaluate their osteoinductive activities. The NP exposure to GNPs and MG63 cell lines increased the percent of cell viability from 96 \u00b1 3.7 (control) up to 138 \u00b1 27.4, which confirmed their osteogenic potential. Consequently, it appears that such NPs may be used as active bone inductive material during implant placement. Plant (Anogenissus latifolia) polyphenol biosynthesized Au NPs that were found to be stable in a vast range of blood components were also utilized as an effective pain reliever and osteoinductive adjuvant of dental tissue implantation [ [311](#B311-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Similarly, ZnO NPs with an average size of 26 nm phyto-synthesized by Scutellaria baicalensis showed enhanced differentiation, proliferation, and mineralization during a 14-day period of cultivation with MG63 cells [ [312](#B312-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The authors proposed that the contact between the cells and biomaterial induced signal transduction pathway-regulated inductions, which influenced cell behavior. The biogenic ZnO NPs were non-toxic and biocompatible. Increasing the biocompatibility of the implant will ultimately lead to a longer life span of the graft and higher effectiveness of the implantation. [313](#B313-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. This includes activation of endothelial cells in pro-angiogenic growth, degradation of capillary walls of the existing vessels, branch point formation inside the vessel, and migration of endothelial cells into the extracellular matrix and then to the starting point of angiogenetic stimulation [ [314](#B314-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The activation of endothelial cells can happen in response to specific conditions (such as hypoxia and inflammation) or during would healing to enhance tissue regeneration [ [315](#B315-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Angiogenesis is controlled by pro-angiogenic and such vascular endothelial growth factor fibroblast growth factor (FGF), beta necrosis growth factor-alpha (TNF-), IL-8, etc. [ [316](#B316-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The role of nanostructures in promoting angiogenesis is widely recognized in tissue engineering [ [317](#B317-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. It was found that the application of magnetic stimulation can synergistically boost bone formation and pro-angiogenic potential more than just magnetic NPs alone [ [318](#B318-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. For that reason, Moise et magnetic properties. Negligible cytotoxicity of both moderately doped NPs on primary human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and human osteosarcoma-derived cells (MG63) was observed. A relatively strong AC susceptibility signal was detected from Zn-doped NPs compared to Co-doped NPs. With time the NPs were internalized by cells and stored within lysosomes. The osteogenic potential of hMSCs was unaffected by the uptake of Zn- and Co-doped NPs. It follows that utilizing biogenic NPs can yield superior bone regeneration accompanied by blood vessel formation in complex bone tissue engineering. However, more studies are required. 4.6. Anti-Viral Activity [320](#B320-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Moreover, metallic NPs are found to act as viricidal agents capable of blocking viral spread, interacting with viruses, and suppressing free virions [ [321](#B321-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The antiviral potential of NPs can be attributed to adsorption onto viral surfaces thus blocking the virus penetration and entry into the host [ [322](#B322-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], direct interaction of NPs with the viral proteins and viral genome [ [323](#B323-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], and inhibition of generic expression and production of viral constituents [ [324](#B324-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. When supported by the viricidal potential of capping biocomponents, their anti-viral activity can be accelerated. [325](#B325-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The cytotoxicity assays in Vero cells revealed that Andrographis paniculate Ag NPs were the most toxic with a maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD) value of 31.25 g/mL, followed by Tinospora cordifolia and Phyllanthus niruri Ag NPs. The cell viability tests also confirmed that Andrographis paniculate Ag NPs inhibited the virus to a maximum extent. Al-Sanea et al. synthesized Ag NPs by a biogenic route that were highly potent against SARS-CoV-2 [ [326](#B326-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The authors used strawberry (Fragaria ananassa ginger (Zingiber officinale) methanolic extracts for the biosynthesis of these Ag NPs with an average size of 5.9 and 5.8 nm, respectively, both with spherical shapes. The strawberry-synthesized NPs showed the highest antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 value of 0.099 g/mL. Molecular docking studies have shown that neohesperidin, a dereplicated compound, can bind to Aak1 (adoptor-associated kinase 1\u2014a host kinase that regulates the intracellular viral trafficking during the entry) through hydrogen bonds and thus can act as a dual inhibitor for both Aak1 and viral NSP 16 (SAM-dependent methyltransferase that methylates the RNA cap). In another study, Ag NPs have been synthesized by a biogenic route through Cinnnamomum cassia bark extract and tested against H7N3 influenza A virus in Vero cells [ [327](#B327-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The biosynthesized NPs were found to be effective in both treatments when incubated with the virus before infection and when introduced after infection. The biomimetic NPs were also proved to be non-toxic to Cero cells up to 500 g/mL. Biogenic Ag NPs (size of 12-28 nm) biosynthesized extract of mangrove Rhizophora lalarckii also showed anti-HIV activity by inhibiting HIV 1 type reverse transcriptase even at low doses [ [328](#B328-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. In vitro, the mangrove fabricated Ag NPs exhibited an IC50 of 0.4 g/mL on the HIV reverse transcriptase. Simultaneously, Dev et al. showed that Ag NPs conjugated with the anti-retroviral drug lamivudine were found to be highly prospective drug-delivery agents acting as a potent and selective inhibitors of type 1 and type 2 HIV [ [329](#B329-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. [330](#B330-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The biogenic Au NPs showed a reduced by 70% cytopathic effect of HSV-1 and HSV-2 at 10 L and 25 L, respectively. Ag NPs showed a decrease in cytopathic effect by 70% of HSV-1 and HSV-2 at 2.5 L. At the same time, the Au NPs were significantly non-toxic at all tested concentrations, while Ag NPs were toxic at higher concentrations. [331](#B331-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The average size of the biogenic Cu NPs was 17.5 nm varying from 2 to 69 nm. The authors showed a significant growth inhibitory effect against Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV). The effective concentration of CuO NPs against NDV was 100 g/mL. 4.7. Antiparasitic Activity [332](#B332-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Parasitic infections are usually treated by chemotherapeutic agents and phytoextracts. However, some of the treatments are no longer effective because some protozoa have developed resistance [ [333](#B333-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Additionally, the bioavailability of antiparasitic drugs is low because of their short half-life and insolubility [ [334](#B334-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The synthesis of biogenic NPs is an approach to combine the efficacy of plant-based material with the achievements of biogenic nanotechnology to obtain effective antiparasitic therapeutics. For example, the parasiticidal effect of Karthik et al. reported a biosynthesis of Ag NPs from Streptomyces sp. and the obtained antiparasitic activity of biosynthesized Ag NPs prepared by a combination of plant extracts of Phoenix dactylifera and Ziziphus spina-chrisri (traditionally used parasite Toxoplasma gondii [ to standard sulfadiazine drug therapy, nanoparticle pretreatment prevented liver damage as determined by significant inhibition of hepatic NO levels and elevation in liver superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. NP treatment decreased proinflammatory cytokines and boosted the antioxidant enzyme activity of liver homogenate compared with an untreated control group. NP treatment induced a reduction in immunoreactivity to TGF- and NF-kB in hepatic tissue, too. Improvements in the histological features of liver tissue and fewer degenerations were also observed. [337](#B337-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The study indicated strong antiparasitic activity against Leishmania infantum promastigotes for both biosynthesized (IC50 30.71 \u00b1 1.91 g/mL) as opposed to the chemically obtained (IC50 51.23 \u00b1 2.2 g/mL). At the same time, the MTT assay showed that the chemical Ag NPs exert higher toxicity than the biogenic Ag NPs. An efficient method of drug delivery to enhance the antileishmanial activity of miltefosine with Ag NPs was proposed by Kalangi et al. [ [338](#B338-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The biosynthesized Ag NP through Anethum graveolens leaf extract had an average size of 35 nm and demonstrated biocompatibility pertaining to >80% viability of macrophages. In combination with miltefosine (12.5 M and 25 M), the Ag NPs magnified the leishmanicidal effect of miltefosine by 2-folds. The enhanced effect of miltefosine (12.5 M) in combination with AgNPs (50 M) was confirmed by morphological aberrations and DNA fragmentations in promastigotes. Similarly, (48 g/mL) and amastigote form (51 g/mL) of the parasite [ [339](#B339-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. In another study, antileishmanial properties of ZnO were enhanced by formulating bimetallic ZnO/Ag NPs that were synthesized using Mirabilis jalapa [ [340](#B340-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The activity of the bimetallic NPs was greater than monometallic ones while increasing with the increase of concentration. A possible mechanism of the antiparasitic activity of biosynthesized NPs can be their interaction with the cell membrane and cellular enzymes, causing intracellular damage and a high level of production of ROS that trigger apoptotic mechanisms in the cell. 5. Cytotoxicity of Biosynthesized NPs [341](#B341-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. When biogenic NPs are subject to drug-delivery application, they can suffer from instability in the hostile environment and bioaccumulation that can trigger biotoxicity. The biogenic techniques can impart substantial stability by capping with various agents [ [342](#B342-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. According to Docea et al. the cellular uptake and colloidal stability of \"coated NPs\" are among the factors that control the toxicological features of NPs against cells [ [343](#B343-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. However, the shape, size, and composition of NPs are characteristics that also determine biogenic nanomaterial toxicity [ [344](#B344-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Therefore, modulating these parameters will enable the designing of metallic NPs with improved interactions, biological activity at a target site, and low cytotoxicity. Sharma et al. [ [345](#B345-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] stated that the rate of NP dissolution can be controlled by the size of the material, capping, or surface functionalization. It was found that the cell viability (MTT analysis) of bone stem cells after incubation for 24, 73, and 96 h with biogenic and chemically synthesized Ag NPs was decreased but the toxicity of the biogenic NPs was substantially (11 folds) lower [ [223](#B223-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. It is thought that the major toxicity of Ag NPs is associated with free silver ions that may negatively affect the eyes, skin, kidney, and liver cause respiratory problems and change blood cells [ [346](#B346-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Therefore, the non-toxic coatings (capping agents) provide a higher degree of biocompatibility and lower toxicity. [347](#B347-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The viability of the A549 and V79 cells presented cell death with low IC50 values when treated with AgNPE compared to AgNPR, but both materials exhibited physicochemical changes during exposure assays. In vitro, the cytotoxic effect of Ag NPs obtained by Butea monosperma bark extract against human PBMCs and leukemic KG-1A cell lines was tested by Pattanayak et al. [ [348](#B348-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. In KG-1A the IC50 value of Ag NPs was 11.5 g/mL while in human PBMCs it was 43.2 g/mL. In leukemic cells, the ROS generation level increased over 4 folds at the effective dose and typical characteristics of apoptosis like plasma membrane blebbing and formation of apoptotic bodies were observed. Chromatin condensation and fragmentation also suggested that the Ag NPs deserved potential genotoxic effects. However, no in vivo studies have been performed. [349](#B349-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] synthesized coated Ag NPs by curcumin derivate (ST06) and assessed their in vivo Ehrlich Ascites carcinoma tumor-induced mouse model. ST06-Ag NPs with sizes ranging between 50 and 100 nm exhibited higher ani-tumor efficacy because of impaired angiogenesis than free ST06 or Ag NPs. In a dose of 5 mg/kg, the biogenic NPs showed no significant toxic effects in the animals. Using an acute inflammation model in Wistar rats, Moldovan et al. [ [350](#B350-pharmaceutics-15-01650)] demonstrated that the presence of some functional groups with biological origin on the NP surface can reduce cytotoxic effects. Spherical Ag NPs (10-50 (Viburnum opulus L.) decreased the level of cytokines in the soft hind foot pad tissue early after the induction of inflammation (2h) and reduced the increase in paw volume by inhibiting the inflammatory processes with edema formation. [351](#B351-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The levels of antioxidant enzymes, such as CAT (catalase) and SOD (superoxide dismutase), decrease in the presence of tumors since cancer cells generate a large amount of hydrogen peroxide [ [352](#B352-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. When treated with F. religiosa derived Ag NPs (5-35 nm) the levels of these liver antioxidant enzymes increased near to normal in Dalton's ascite lymphoma mice models [ [353](#B353-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Histopathological studies also revealed recovery of liver architecture upon treatment with Ag NPs whereas hematological parameters revived to normal values after treatment. Similarly, Morus alba leaf extract formulated Ag NPs were examined for their hepatotoxicity in Wistar rats by intraperitoneal injection [ [223](#B223-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The authors observed that the therapy with Ag NPs at all doses (25, 50, and 100 g/kg) significantly restored the metabolic enzyme activities, which indicated improved physiological functioning of hepatic tissue. Histopathological observation confirmed the healing of hepatic parenchyma and regeneration of hepatocytes. [354](#B354-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. After 15 days of oral administration of Ag NPs (100 mg/kg) to the Wister rats, significant changes in renal architecture were seen in both receiving rats. The urine and blood chemistry data, as well as the renal epithelial cells and renal mitochondria, confirmed the toxic similarities between the Ag NPs produced by two different routes. Similarly, Ag NPs synthesized using sulfonated polysaccharide extract from size (20-480 nm) [ [355](#B355-pharmaceutics-15-01650)], did not cause mortality to rats up to 2000 mg/kg BW but triggered elevation of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. A low dose was effective in a revival of liver enzyme parameters to normal in intoxicated groups with paracetamol-induced liver injury. However, an apparent toxic effect on the kidney was also observed. [356](#B356-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. For example, biosynthesized Au NPs from Curcuma manga were found to be cytocompatible with human lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5) and human colon fibroblast cells (CCD-18Co) [ [357](#B357-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. These Au NPs also demonstrated hemocompatibility with less than 10% of hemolysis without any aggregation of erythrocytes. At the same time, Nandhini et al. reported the biogenesis of gold NPs from Enterococcus sp. RMAA and studied its cytotoxic potential against human hepatocellular cancer (HCC) cell lines. It was revealed that Au NPs resulted in about 20% cytotoxicity of cancer cell lines due to oxidative stress and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential that eventually induces cytochrome c release into cytosol leading to apoptosis of cancer cells [ [358](#B358-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Moreover, biosynthesized Au NPs using plant extract were shown to be non-toxic to normal L-cells at various concentrations (1 to 100 L) [ [359](#B359-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The results underlined the potential of an extract-based method for the synthesis of Au NPs for therapy and anticancer treatment. [360](#B360-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. It was concluded that the amount of 5-fluorouracil required to achieve 50% of growth inhibition was much lower for the conjugate than in free 5-fluorouracil. Additionally, the in vivo distribution of gold was increased mostly in the liver than in other organs. Lee et al. reported the synthesis of chitosan-capped gold nanospheres and nanostars, derived from green tea extracts. At the same time, gold nanorods were prepared by a conventional method. The authors demonstrated cytotoxicity of the biogenic Au NPs towards four cancer cell lines, of which the highest toxicity towards hepatocyte carcinoma was exhibited in nanorods, followed by nanostars and finally nanospheres. Further, the cellular uptake of Au NPs by human hepatocyte carcinoma cells (HepG2) followed the order nanospheres > nanorods > nanostars [ [361](#B361-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Moreover, the study of Mironova et al. demonstrated that after 3 days of incubation, 142 g/mL of 13 nm AuNPs cause nearly 40% apoptosis in human fibroblast cell lines while only 13 g/mL of 45 nm AuNPs triggered the same effect [ [362](#B362-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. However, after 14 days full recovery occurred for the fibroblast cells after the removal of both particles. Hence, it is demonstrated that the shape, size, and origin of metal NPs play a crucial role in therapy and as drug delivery agents. [363](#B363-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. Selim et al. reported cytotoxic tortuosa aqueous extract)-derived ZnO NPs with an average size of 15.2 nm on cancer cells. The authors demonstrated anticancer activity in vitro model against human colon (Caco-2) and lung (A549) cancer cell lines and compared them to human lung fibroblast (WI38) cell lines using MTT assay [ [364](#B364-pharmaceutics-15-01650)]. The biogenic NPs showed remarkable selective cytotoxicity against both examined cancer cell lines. As of now, one of the most challenging fields in anticancer treatment is the development of new anticancer drugs with minimal side effects and enhanced efficacy and selectivity, and the biosynthesis of NPs could pave the way toward more precise and effective anti-cancer treatment. However, it follows that the method of biosynthesis, reducing and capping biological material, type of NP, and its shape are all determinative for the toxicity of that NP. 6.
