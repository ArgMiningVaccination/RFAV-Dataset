Each unit is further broken down into knowledge and skills on the basis of which evidence is to be provided by the learner and the evaluation is to be done by the teacher or trainer. \"Mul ti-Skill Foundation Course\" (MSFC) is revised version of pre -vocational program V -1 \"Introduction to Basic Technology\", being implemented in Maharashtra since 1987. Nature of the course: The course is divided into four modules: Workshop & Engineering Techn iques, Energy & Environment, Gardening, Nursery and Agriculture Techniques, Food Processing Techniques (9th class) / Personal Health & Hygiene (10th class) The Engineering (material -joining, shaping and otherwise fabricating into usable articles, including housing) and Energy -Environment (application of electricity, non -conventional energy and systems, processes, and tools - computers, management techniques). It also covers basics of engineering and project management. Home -Health (related to human life), an d Agriculture (Plant and animal kingdom) give the skills related to clothing food and health of human beings. Agriculture covers the skill needed for production and preservation of food of both plant and animal origin, including care of plants/crops. BENEF ITS: 1. Multi -skill nature of the program helps students to select choice of his/her future specialization. He/she is a jack of all skills and will be enabled to select one for his/her future. 2. Most importantly, the variety of experiences students gets during \"Multi -Skill Foundation' training will stimulate their intellect. Multidisciplinary knowledge will help him to appreciate underlying principles and processes and apply that knowledge in new areas. 3. All ground level work activities need multi skills. For e.g . farmer need to have basic knowledge of electricity, food processing, agriculture and even construction. This helps him to become self - reliant under adverse conditions. A fabricator, who gets orders for construction of poultry, will be in better position to serve his client if he knows basics of poultry. This helps to develop such kinds of interdisciplinary approaches with appreciation for other fields. COURSE OBJECTIVES: On completion of the course, student should be able to: Apply effective oral and wri tten communication skills to interact with people and customers; Demonstrate the knowledge of constructional details and working of soak pit, and why wet and dry garbage needs to be separated.

Students should be take n to field visits for interaction with experts and to expose them to the various tools, equipment, materials, procedures and operations in the workplace. Special emphasis should be laid on the occupational safety, health and hygiene during the training and field visits. CLASSROOM ACTIVITIES - Classroom activities are an integral part of this course and interactive lecture sessions, followed by discussions should be conducted by trained vocational teachers. Vocational teachers should make effective use of a variety of instructional aids, such as audio -video materials, colour slides, charts, diagrams, models, exhibits, hand -outs, online teaching materials, etc. to transmit knowledge and impart training to the students. PRACTICAL WORK IN LABORATORY/WORKSHOP - Practical work may include but not limited to hands -on-training, simulated training, role play, case based studies, exercises, etc. Equipment and supplies should be provided to enhance hands -on learning experience of students. Only trained personnel should teach specialized techniques. A training plan that reflects tools, equipment, materials, skills and activities to be performed by the students should be submitted by the vocational teacher to the Head of the Institution. FIELD VISITS/ EDUCATIONAL TOUR - In field visits, children will go outside the classroom to obtain specific information from experts or to make observations of the activities. A checklist of observations to be made by the students during the field visits should be developed by the Vocati onal Teachers for systematic collection of information by the students on the various aspects. Principals and Teachers should identify the different opportunities for field visits within a short distance from the school and make necessary arrangements for the visits. At least three field visits should be conducted in a year. SKILL ASSESSMENT (PRACTICAL) - Assessment of skills by the students should be done by the assessors/examiners on practical demonstration of skills by the candidate. The assessors assess ing the skills of the students should possess a current experience in the industry and should have undergone an effective training in assessment principles and practices. Practical examination allows candidates to demonstrate that they have the knowledge a nd understanding of performing a task. This will include hands -on practical exam, viva voce and student portfolio (File/journal). Project Work (individual or group project) is a great way to assess the practical skills on a certain time period or tim eline. Project work should be given on the basis of the capability of the individual to perform the tasks or activities involved in the project. Projects should be discussed in the class and the teacher should periodically monitor the progress of the proje ct and provide feedback for improvement and innovation. Field visits should be organised as part of the project work. Field visits can be followed by a small -group work/project work. When the class returns from the field visit, each group might be asked to use the information that they have gathered to prepare presentations or reports of their observations. Project work should be assessed on the basis of practical file or student portfolio. Student Portfolio is a compilation of documents that supports the c andidate's claim of competence. Documents may include reports, articles, and photos of products prepared by students in relation to the unit of competency. Viva voce allows candidates to demonstrate communication skills and content knowledge. Audio or video recording can be done at the time of viva voce. The number of external examiners would be decided as per the existing norms of the Board and these norms should be suitably adopted/adapted as per the specific requirements of the vocational subject. Viva voce should also be conducted to obtain feedback on the student's experiences and learning during the project work/field visits. ORGANISATION OF FIELD VISITS: In a year, at least 3 field visits/educational tours should be organised for the students to exp ose them to the activities in the workplace. 1) Visit a nursery available near their home or school. Instruct students to observe following points in the nursery. Observation - Instruct students to classify and note down various plants available in the nurser y in the table below: Flowering Plants Fruit Plants Vegetables Medicinal Plants Ornamental Plants Seedlings cultivated by sowing seeds (Seedlings cultivated in seedling trays) Seedlings cultivated from branches Seedlings cultivated by graft ing Seedlings cultivated in pots Seedlings cultivated on ground Seedlings cultivated in greenhouse Instruct students to find answers for questions mentioned below, during field visit - - Which sections were available in the nursery? - What prec aution is taken while planting seedlings in pots? - What precaution is taken to prevent pests on seedlings? - Which method is used in nursery to cultivate good quality seedlings on large scale? - What is the approximate expense required to raise a seedling in a nursery? - Which methods are used in a nursery for seeding or cultivating seedling? 2) Visit a nearby fuel station. Instruct them to inquire about the rate of petrol and diesel to a fuel station attendant. Instruct students to gather information about question s mentioned below - - Which fuel is costlier? What is the reason behind it? - Why diesel is used in some vehicles instead of petrol? - How do few vehicles run on both fuels: petrol as well as diesel? Which fuel is environment -friendly? LIST OF EQUIPMENT AND M ATERIALS The list given below is suggestive and an exhaustive list should be prepared by the teacher. Only basic tools, equipment and accessories should be procured by the Institution so that the routine tasks can be performed by the students regularly fo r practice and acquiring adequate practical experience.
