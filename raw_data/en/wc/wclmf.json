This technique is a practice used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which has been around for thousands of years. How It Works In China, acupuncture is often used as a go-to treatment for everything from asthma to diabetes, but in the United States, it is more often used as a complementary treatment alongside other treatments or drugs for conditions like low [back pain](/back-pain/guide/), joint pain, and headaches, and sometimes to help ease nausea and vomiting. Chronic Pain Symptom Relief - Acupuncture is effective for the treatment of chronic pain. - The effects of acupuncture persist over time. - The benefits of acupuncture cannot be explained solely by the placebo effect. [osteoarthritis](/osteoarthritis/guide/)(OA), headache, or shoulder pain, acupuncture relieved pain compared with sham and no-acupuncture control groups. Additionally, they noted that treatment effects might persist up to a year. However, the researchers stated that the effect is highly dependent on the choice of control treatment. Other studies and reviews have shown that acupuncture helps with the following specific types of pain. Back Pain RELATED: [8 Great Pain Relievers You Aren't Using](https://www.everydayhealth.com/pain-management/photos/8-alternative-treatments-for-pain-management.aspx) Joint Pain Headache [migraines](/migraine/guide/). The 24-week randomized clinical trial consisted of four weeks of treatment followed by 20 weeks of follow-up. Researchers reported that acupuncture reduced migraine frequency and the number of days with migraine, as well as decreased pain intensity. General Health and Wellness Benefits of Acupuncture How Acupuncture Benefits Other Symptoms and Conditions While more research is needed to determine how effective acupuncture is for various conditions, some research shows it may benefit the following. [dizziness and vertigo](/vertigo/causes-risk-factors/)based on data collected from the questionnaires for Dizziness Handicap Inventory and Visual Analog Scale (VAS), along with heart rate variability. They found that acupuncture demonstrated a significant immediate effect in reducing discomforts and VAS of both dizziness and [vertigo](/vertigo-signs-symptoms-latest-treatments-home-remedies-tests-more/). A review that evaluated acupuncture for the treatment of cervical vertigo found that acupuncture may be more effective in improvement of clinical symptoms and average blood flow velocity of the vertebral-basilar artery compared with conventional medicine therapy for cervical vertigo. [endometriosis symptoms](/endometriosis/guide/symptoms/)more than other approaches like exercise, electrotherapy, and yoga, according to a meta-analysis of studies. Studies have also found that acupuncture can reduce pain from [endometriosis](/endometriosis/guide/)along with the blood level of CA-125, a protein associated with the disease. Researchers theorize that as acupuncture seems to promote relaxation, it reduces the muscle tension and stress that come with chronic pain. [psoriatic arthritis](https://www.everydayhealth.com/psoriatic-arthritis/guide/)(PsA) found that treatment approaches including acupuncture, [turmeric](/drugs/turmeric), sarsaparilla root, and [vitamin D3](/drugs/vitamin-d3), might reduce symptoms of PsA. [rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/)(RA) conditions, researchers concluded that acupuncture alone or combined with other treatments is beneficial to the clinical conditions of RA without adverse effects, can improve function and quality of life, and is worth trying. They noted benefits such as an anti-inflammatory effect, an antioxidative effect, and the regulation of immune system function. However, according to the researchers, there is inconsistency in the evidence and a lack of well-designed human-animal double-blind, randomized, controlled trials. [Fibromyalgia](https://www.everydayhealth.com/fibromyalgia/guide/)When researchers compared acupuncture therapy to sham acupuncture or conventional medication in 12 randomized, controlled trials, they found that acupuncture was significantly better than sham acupuncture for relieving pain and improving the quality of life, with low- to moderate-quality evidence in the short term. In the long term, acupuncture was superior to sham acupuncture. [ulcerative colitis](https://www.everydayhealth.com/ulcerative-colitis/guide/)(UC) compared with conventional medicine alone, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. However, the researchers warned that their findings should be interpreted thoughtfully due to high or unclear risk of bias in the 13 trials they analyzed. Another review of studies shows why it's hard to get an overall understanding of the benefits of acupuncture for UC. When researchers looked at 63 studies published between 1995 and 2015, the study designs were varied, such as whether the study analyzed acupuncture as an only therapy, in combination with medication, or in addition to other alternative remedies. Other differences included the placement of the needles on the body, how long treatment continued, and how outcomes were measured. Although these differences and variability make acupuncture difficult to study, it's revealing that so many studies and reviews show positive effects. [Crohn's disease](https://www.everydayhealth.com/crohns-disease/guide/). [Allergies](https://www.everydayhealth.com/allergies/)Acupuncture appeared to significantly reduce the number of days of [antihistamine](/antihistamine/guide/)use while improving rhinitis-specific quality of life and seasonal allergic rhinitis symptoms. [asthma](https://www.everydayhealth.com/asthma/guide/). One study found that patients with [allergic asthma](/hs/allergic-asthma-in-adults/allergic-asthma/)who added 15 acupuncture sessions to routine care over the course of three months saw greater improvements in disease-specific and health-related quality of life compared with patients who received only routine care. A review of research found that acupuncture in addition to [asthma treatments](https://www.everydayhealth.com/asthma/guide/treatment/)led to a statistically significant improvement in symptom response rates and resulted in lower levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), which the body produces in response to infections and injuries. Too much IL-6 can contribute to chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of asthma. [acupressure](/integrative-health/acupressure-therapy/guide/)lowered pain intensity for cancer pain. Moreover, some studies suggested that acupuncture for cancer patients taking opiate pain medications could lead to a reduction in their use. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center states that acupuncture is safe and effective for treating side effects of [cancer treatment](/cancer/guide/treatment/)such as: - Pain - Fatigue [Insomnia](https://www.everydayhealth.com/insomnia/guide/) - Dry mouth [Neuropathy symptoms](https://www.everydayhealth.com/neuropathy/guide/symptoms/)(pain caused by nerve damage) - Nausea and vomiting How to Get Acupuncture If you're interested in acupuncture, finding a licensed acupuncturist is the next step, and finding one who has experience in the condition causing you discomfort is even better. There are several types of licensed acupuncturists or licensed health professionals who can provide acupuncture: - Medical doctors can receive extra training in acupuncture. Many of these doctors are members of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture. Visit the referral directory on that group's [website](http://www.medicalacupuncture.org/Find-an-Acupuncturist). - People specifically train in acupuncture after completing a multiyear master's program in acupuncture or TCM and passing a national certification exam. You can find a certified practitioner on [this website](http://www.nccaom.org/find-a-practitioner-directory/)(click on \"Find a Practitioner,\" then input your city and state). You can also find updates about licensure on your individual state's regulatory board website, similar to looking up an MD's license status. - Naturopathic physicians are trained to give acupuncture. Find a practitioner at the website of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians. Put your ZIP code into the group's [online directory](https://naturopathic.org/search/). What to Expect During an Acupuncture Session During an acupuncture visit, an acupuncturist will ask about your medical history and any symptoms you're experiencing and examine you. Then a treatment plan will be created based on their evaluation of the causes and perpetuating factors for your concerns, similar to other health practitioners. For the specific acupuncture treatment, they'll have you sit or lie down on a table, often in a dimly lit room, and they will insert needles into acupuncture points on areas of your body. Needles typically remain inserted between 20 and 45 minutes while you rest comfortably in the treatment room. Some practitioners may also include moxibustion, [cupping](/integrative-health/cupping-therapy/guide/), acupressure, electrical stimulation to the needles, or external heat to your body. - Floating with a tingling, warm sensation - Heaviness, heat, and cold How frequently you'll need to receive acupuncture depends on what you are seeking relief from. If you have a chronic issue, you may need to go more frequently than if you have an acute problem. The College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Newfoundland and Labrador (CTCMPANL) points out that \"a small number of patients will experience a worsening of symptoms as the body's energies are returning to normal, but this is usual and is followed quickly by improvement.\" Fees: Is Acupuncture Expensive? And Will Insurance Cover It? [health insurance plans don't cover acupuncture](https://www.everydayhealth.com/chronic-pain/chronic-pain-relief-checklist-places-to-look-for-affordable-effective-low-risk-treatments/). However, in January 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) stated that it would cover acupuncture for Medicare patients with chronic low back pain. This was the first condition that Medicare decided to cover related to acupuncture. First-Time Visit - Cost range for a first-time acupuncture visit was $15 to $400. - The median for all 723 clinics was $112. Follow-Up Visits - For the follow-up visits, the cost range was $15 to $300. - The median price was $80 for all 723 clinics. Considerations - The symptoms you receive treatment for may get worse for a few days after having acupuncture. - You might experience changes in sleep, appetite, bowels, urination, or your emotional state, but all of these are a sign that acupuncture is starting to work. - Fainting, infection, and bruising may occur. - In very rare, unlikely cases, acupuncture could puncture vital organs.
