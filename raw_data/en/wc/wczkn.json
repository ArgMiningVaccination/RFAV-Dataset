Nine vaccines are examined. It is found that governments, mainly the US (with some not -for-profit entities ) decisively supported corporate investments, either for R&D, manufacturing, or both, by nearly EUR 9 billion, i.e. on average EUR one billion of grants per vaccine, with, however, vast variance across companies. Moreover, almost EUR 21 billion was allocated to companies through Advance Purchase Agreements. While the EU and MS support through Advance Purchase Agreements was key to de - risk the production of vaccines , the role of EU and MS support in directly supporting R&D was marginal compared with the US federal government . The study assesses the necessity for continuing public support to R&D on vaccines for SARS -CoV-2 future variants of concern and possibly other coronaviruses . After highlighting current market failures, new incentive mechanisms in the public interest for vaccine R&D are suggested to grant equity and accessibility, as well as rewards in line with risks.

Thanks to a joint effort , both goals were reached. Although usually it takes a decade or longer, the first vaccines for the new diseases were developed in less than 12 months : as of February 3, 2021, there were 289 experimental COVID -19 vaccines in development, including 20 in phase 3 of clinical testing (Wouters, 2021). By March 2021, less than a year after the pandemic had hit European countries, more than 34 million doses had been administered in the European Union, with this number rapidly increasing over the next weeks (by the beginning of April 2021 , 74 million doses were administered in the EU, and one year later more than 844 million doses ).1 These extraordinary achievements were reached thanks to two decisive factors: a) more than two decades of basic research and , b) to huge investments in the pandemic period by a range of funders . For b oth these aspects a strong involvement of the public sector was key . Indeed, basic research and early -stage development are frequently supported by the p ublic sector (see, among others, Galkina et al., 2018) . During the pandemic an unprecedent amount of resources were also deployed for the financing of clinical trials and scaling -up manufacturing capabilities, and A dvance Purchase Agreement s (APAs) . However, there is only limited understanding of the ultimate funding sources that were actually involved . A clear analysis of the funding for COVID -19 vaccines could provide critical insight for policy makers who need to address existing and future challenges relating to variants and R&D incentives. Against this background, the European Parliament's Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies has requested this study to support the Special Committee \"COVID -19 pandemic: lessons learned and recommendations for the future\" (COVI) of the European Parliament (EP). Aim and methodology The main objectives of the study are (i) to map the funding for R&D and the expansion of the production capacity for the manufacturing of major COVID -19 vaccines in order to estimate the relative importance of funds by different actors and (ii) to ascertain the need for continuing support COVID- 19 vaccines with public funds . This study focuses on funding allocated during the pandemic to the seven vaccines authorised for use in the EU (Comirnaty, from Pfizer and BioNTech; COVID and also to COVID -19 Vaccine Hipra (currently under rolling review, it would be the only vaccine entirely developed and produced in Europe and for this reason it has been analysed in the report), and CV nCoV from CureVac (although it has been withdrawn from rolling review, it received important public financing, thus being relevant for our analysis). The study does not take into consideration funds previously invested in basic research or some relevant applications and subsequently exploited to develop the new vaccines, although this was very relevant for the rapid development of the vaccines and played a crucial role for some of them (notably, Comirnaty, | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 10 The m ethodology employed to draft the study combines desk research, statistical analysis and interviews involving 30 expert stakeholders, belonging to three groups: (1) representatives of pharmaceutical companies involved in the production of COVID -19 vaccines ; (2) public health experts and scientists from the EU and the US ; and (3) public decision makers and experts within institutions , both at the EU and national level , as well as from the US . The interviewees were selected through a combination of purposive a nd snowball sampling. The interviews took place between December 2022 and the first days of March 2023 . Anonymity was ensured to the respondents ' opinion and evidence provided, but the names of the interviewees are reported when we were authorised by them to do so . In order to retrieve information on funding for R&D and extension of the production capacity for the manufacturing of vaccines, the first step was to investigate existing publicly available sources, such as public repositories, reports from the most relevant stakeholders , and scientific publications. This information was complemented and double -checked by interviews with relevant funders and pharmaceutical companies. Summary fiches summari sing available data on funding associated with each vaccin e were shared with the producers in order to give them the opportunity to amend them. Details about the feedback received by companies, if any, are reported. The compiled data on funding must be considered a best estimate, since much information on public and private investments is kept confidential, and publicly available data are fragmented and different sources are often challenging to reconcile. Key Findings Collected evidence suggests that from 2020 to early 2022 , combined support in various form by external funds (including mostly funds from governments , but also from some philanthropic entities, third private parties, international public -private partnerships and multilateral development banks ) for R&D and the expansion of production c apacity for th e nine vaccines included in the study were in the range of EUR 9 billion . Additional ly, there were about EUR 21 billion of APAs. While the information about R&D expenditures sustained by companies for COVID -19 vaccines is not publicly available, our estimate is in the range of EUR 4-5 billion for the period 2020 -2021. The government s and other public actors (hereafter also referred to as public sector ) represent over 80% of the total external funds mapped. The public sector support took the form of grants, loans, and APAs , (each with a different incentive role) representing, respectively, 27%, 0.6 % and 54% of total external funds mapped. The remaining funds were provided by philanthropic entities, third -party private companies, public -private partnerships, and the E uropean Investment Bank ( EIB). The share of public funding (i.e., provided by public entities at different governmental levels ) over total funding strongly varies from company to company, going from zero for Pfizer (but the vaccine, Comirnaty, was co-developed with BioNTech, which received substantial public support, so that even Comirnaty was co-financed by the public sector), to 100% for Moderna. On average, public funding covered not less than 50% of cumul ated R&D expenditures, which plac es governments as the principal partner in the development of COVID -19 vaccines. Such direct and indirect public support to R&D and expansion of the production capacity considerably de -risked corporate investment in the dev elopment and manufacturing of vaccines , and consequently increased returns to investors particularly for those firms that d id not claim to price the dose on a cost base. APAs, played an important de -risking role, shifting part of the risk from private firms to the public sector as these agreements were signed before vaccine approvals. Moreover, APAs allowed firms to better plan their production capacity and logistics. T here is no evidence, however, that they incentivised R&D , which for most companies relied on earlier public sector grants. Mapping of long -term public and private investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines 11 PE 740.072 Looking at fund s tracked , the role of the EU plus Member States in funding R&D was marginal compared to the US government (respectively, 1 % and 24.7% of total external funds mapped for R&D support only . If loans are also considered the respective shares are 2 .8% and 24.3% ). If external support granted for manufacturing vaccines is also considered, the role of the EU and Member States represents 10% versus 80% of the US . Adding loans, the respective shar es become 11.9% and 78 %. Indeed, t he EIB played some role, mainly with a loan of EUR 100 million to BioNTech (preceded by another loan before the vaccine development), but also to other companies in the European vaccine arena. Such loans may have decreased the financing cost of R&D, manufacturing operations , and offered a credibility signal in the financial market for the companies . EU role in supporting vaccine development revolved around APAs . Up to 2021, 8 APAs for 1 .3 billion doses (excluding optional doses except for Sanofi -GSK ) were signed by the EU and vaccine producers (including for the withdrawn vaccine CureVac). The cumulated value of such contracts is about EUR 6.8 billion , estimated with the leaked information from various sources on price per dose . Looking into the future, according to experts, the SARS -CoV- 2 virus is here to stay for at least the next ten years . Even in an optimistic scenario ( where no new variant of concern or a new pandemic wave would emerge) , rates of hospitalization and m ortality remain non -negligible among the at-risk population , particularly the elderly and the fragile. Moreover, while e xisting vaccines offer a robust defence against severe illness, they suffer from some limitations, the most important ones being the declining immunity over a relatively short time span, and their limited resilience to virus mutations. Therefore, further R&D investments are needed to deal with COVID -19, its v ariants, and, possibly, other coronaviruses. Scientific literature reviewed and experts interviewed for this study strongly suggest that R&D for COVID -19 vaccines should be sustained . Key research topics , according to some experts (but there is no consensus on all the items), include: (i) variant -proof SARS -CoV- 2 vaccines; ( ii) pan - sarbecovirus vaccines (i.e., against sarbecoviruses, the subgenus that includes all the SARS -like viruses); (iii) pan -betaCoV vaccines (i.e., against betacoronaviruses, which include sarbecoviruses, merbecoronaviruses like the one that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and two that now trigger the common cold); ( iv) pan -CoV vaccines ; v) needle-free vaccines . Beyond that, most experts mentioned the need to build a sophisticated monitoring system similar to that for influenza and to conduct studies to assess under -investigated topics on existing vaccines and comparative studies. While there are market opportunit ies for both established pharmaceutical companies and newcomers, several of the research topics mentioned above would require R&D strategies that are not in the immediate interest of the industry to self -fund and perform due to high- risk and low returns. Hence, public support to R&D on C OVID -19 vaccines, and possibly on other pandemic risk s related to coronaviruses, is still needed . The crucial question is how this support should best be provided, in order to obtain adequate returns on investments for gover nments and taxpayers . In this perspective, there are lessons to be learned from the recent experience in Europe , namely: (i) avoid ing fragmentation and duplication of funding of R&D on COVID -19 vaccines; (ii) ensur ing public support for clinical development of the next generation COVID -19 vaccines or vaccines protecting against unknown coronaviruses; (iii) creat ing a favo urable regulatory and infrastructural environment for clinical trials in Europe; (iv) careful examination, in the public health interest, of the conditionalities of future R&D grants and de -risk ing mechanisms. IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 12 In conclusion, the study points out that action would be needed for the EU to have a prominent role in supporting the development of future coronavirus vaccines. In the shor ter term, a stable and clear legal EU framework for corporate R&D support on COVID - 19 vaccines (and , more broadly, on vaccines for pathogens with pandemic potential) should be designed . This framework should include (a) a n innovative template for IPR arrangements in the public interest when taxpayers' money supports R&D, (b) well -defined conditionalities on the location of production and logistics, and (c) fairer delivery arrangements and price affordability for European citizens and l ess-developed countries. Also, the role of HERA should be reconsidered. Indeed, the current design of HERA does not provide for the managerial and scientific strengths of the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in the wider f rame of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response and cannot leverage on anything similar to the combined role of the NIH and BARDA (and other federal agencies) in the US. In the long term, to radically change the EU approach to support frontier biomedical science, a previous study for the European Parliament ( EP) (Florio et al. 2021) suggests exploring a more direct public intervention (as it was successfully implemented for space policy and other science- based sectors): the creation of a pan -European R&D infrastructure and delivery organisation for medicines in certain critical areas , with the budgetary scale and scientific ambition comparable to the US NIH , combining EU and MS efforts. Mapping of long -term public and private investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines 13 PE 740.072 INTRODUCTION This report at hands entitled \"Mapping of Long -term Public and P rivate Investments in the Development of Covid -19 Vaccines \" was requested by European Parliament's Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies to support the Special Committee \"COVID -19 pandemic: lessons learned and recommendations for the future\" (COVI) of the European Parliament (EP). 1.1. Motivation of the study At the end of 2019, a novel form of coronavirus disease, named COVID -19, caused by the SARS- CoV- 2 virus, was first spotted in China. The v irus proved to be highly contagious, and its initial strain was associated with a very high death toll. In early 2020, Italy was the first European country to be hit hard, followed by France and Spain, and eventually the virus spread to all EU countries an d worldwide. The COVID -19 pandemic resulted in profound challenges to global public health. In a race against time, a great number of research efforts were started with the aim of creating safe and effective vaccines. At the same time, production capacitie s had to be put into place to produce sufficient vaccine to inoculate a large part of the world population in a short time. The development of a vaccine candidate usually requires considerable investments in research and development (R&D) and take s many years, most of which are spent in the three consecutive phases of clinical trials. In view of the urgency, a number of shortcuts were taken, such as carrying out parallel tests and using Emergency Use Authorization / C onditional Marketing Authorisati on, while scaling up the manufacturing capacity already during the clinical tests. Unprecedented public and private financial investments were made, and scientific collaborations were put in place. By the end of 2020, the first vaccines started to be used as part of a large -scale vaccination efforts and, according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) vaccine tracker, a s of December 2022, 50 vaccines have been approved for general or emergency use around the world and there were a further 230 vaccines in clinical or in pre -clinical development . To accomplish these achievements, a massive amount of funding by a diversity of sources around the world was needed . Governments, international institutions, the private sector, research institutions and non- profits engaged in research activities, or their funding , and de -risking corporate investment. However, there is only limited understanding of the funding sources c ommitted and disbursed for the R&D and the investment s to make the COVID -19 vaccines available . A clear analysis of the funding sources for COVID -19 vaccines could provide critical insight for policy makers who need to address existing and future challenges relating to SARS -Cov2 variants and R&D incentives . By \"funding \"we understand here a set of different mechanisms, each with a different role, which will be analysed in some detail. 1.2. Objective and scope of the study The main objective of the study is to map investments both for the R&D and for the expansion of the production capacity for the manufacturing of selected major COVID -19 vaccines.2 The list of vaccines which are considered in the study is shown i n Table 1 below , and it includes the COVID -19 vaccines that were originally authori sed and that can still be used in the EU . Moreover, information on two other 2 In agreement with the European Parliament's Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies , the study will not cover the mapping of semi -finished products and other linked products, such as syringes and vials. IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 14 interesting cases have been collected, i.e. , CureVac and Hipra. The former, after having received support in various forms and from various bodies, including a loan from the European Investment Bank and an Advance Purchase Agreement signed with the European Commission ( EC), has been withdrawn from rolling review .3 Hipra, on the other side, is a vaccine currently under rolling review which was developed by a Spanish family -owned company. Hipra's COVID -19 vaccine is a bivalent vaccine based on an adjuvant recombinant protein. Despite its late arrival, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) decided to start th e rolling review based on preliminary results from non- clinical data and clinical studies in adults which compared the immune response to the vaccine (measured by the level of antibodies against SARS -CoV- 2) with that seen with the mRNA vaccine Comirnaty. The study covers the following fields and answers the associated questions: A mapping both of funding of R&D and the expansion of the production capacity for the manufacturing of COVID -19 vaccines, concentrating on the EU . What was funded, and by whom? Where is the main research and development being performed, and what are the amounts involved? Which amounts were spent by firms, which by governments or other entities? How does this evolve with time? The relative importanc e of funds invested into COVID -19 vaccines research by different actors . What was the relative importance of funds invested into COVID -19 vaccines research by different actors, such as governments, international institutions, private sector, research insti tutions and non -profits? The need for con tinuing support of COVID -19 vaccines with public funds . Is there a need for further public support? Much of the current research seems to concentrate on adapting existing COVID -19 vaccines to the fast mutations of the virus. Which level of investment will be needed for this ongoing adaptation? Is there still a need for substantial public funding, as opposed to the availability of private funding? In terms of geographical coverage, the focus of the study is mainly on the EU and, on the R&D public funding side, on the US, given their pivotal role. Most of public funding outside the US and the EU is not recorded, and most of the support at the level of individual countries is also not covered given the fragmentary natu re of the evidence. 3 A rolling review is a regulatory tool that EMA uses to speed up the assessment of a promising medicine or vaccine during a pu blic health emergency. The rolling review continues until enough evidence is available for a formal marketing authorization application.

Research methodology The study has been carried out by combining t hree research methods , i.e., d esk research, statistical analysis, and in terviews . The table below shows how each method contribute d to the three streams of research. Table 2: Methods and research streams Q1 - Mapping of funding of R&D and the production of COVID -19 vaccines Q2 - Relative importance of funds invested into COVID -19 vaccines R&D by different actors Q3 - Need for continuing support COVID -19 vaccines with public funds Desk r esearch Statistical analysis Interviews Source: Authors ' own elaboration . 2.1.1. Desk research The desk research aimed at collecting and reviewing publicly available sources, including news, reports, academic articles, previous studies, and data repositories providing information on funding of R&D and the production o f COVID -19 vaccines , as well as on the reasons (if any) for continuing support of these investments with public funds . A list of references and r epositories consulted is included in Annex I , with the relevant web links . In order t o guarantee that the identified sources cover the most relevant issues, we employ a systematic approach and methodology combining different strategies, which are laid out in the following : a list of the relevant keywords for online searching has been defined. The list has been enriched in an iterative process, where the results obtained from applying the search terms to the body of literature in scholarly databases such as REPEC and PUBMED or other repositories point to adding relevant keywords ; publications by the most relevant stakehol ders for contents relevant to the study topic have been screened. These include publications by the EC, the EP , the European Court of Auditors, ECDC, EMA, and other EU institutions, as well as some official publications by the governments of EU Member States. The reviewed literature also includes selected publications by international organisations , such as the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD) and the WHO , as well as relevant think -tanks and consultancies. The annual reports of pharmaceutical companies have also been reviewed , covering several years of reported R&D expenditures . To make sure that we include both official statements and innovative viewpoints, we also scan selected blog posts and conference proceedings relevant to the subject ; Mapping of long -term public and private investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines 17 PE 740.072 additional references have been collect ed through advice from experts willing to share their knowledge with the principal investigator (PI) once informed about the study topic and/ or interviewed as part of the study ; once the relevant body of literature has been collected, the documents/publications have been classified by topics and keywords. In order to retrieve information on funding for R&D and extension of the production for the vaccines listed in Table 1 , the first step was to investigate existing databases such as th ose respectively provided by the Global Health Centre , G-FINDER, Policy Cures Research, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (see Annex 1). The data collected were then supplement ed with in formation made available in English by bodies directly involved in the funding (e.g. CEPI, BARDA, European Commission) and by the annual reports and balance sheets (retrieved from ORBIS database managed by Bureau Van Dijk4) of the individual pharmaceutical companies involved. It is still likely that data for some funders may be missing. Where feasible, any repeated funding from/to the same entity has been tracked individually and aggregated only afterwards. O nly funding with clear amounts and explicitly allocated to one of the vaccines considered has been included . According to information available, the external funding mechanisms to incentivise the companies have been categorised as follow5: funds for resea rch and development (\"R&D only \"); funds for development a nd increasing production capacity (\"R&D + manufacturing\"); Advance Purchase Agreements (APA s), i.e., dose purchase s that were concluded before the vaccines received a recommendation for a condition al marketing authorisation . Although APA s are not direct funding towards R&D, it is believed that they may have played a role in enabling pharmaceutical companies to de -risk the development and production of vaccines. On the other hand, p urchases , in the strict sense, i.e., after marketing authori sation , were not included i n the analysis , as they do not play a direct incentive role. Moreover, i t is also worth noting that: funds by public or no t-for profit entities to support R&D or \"R&D +manufacturing \" may have taken the form of non- repayable support (i.e., grants) or repayable support (i.e., loans). Whenever possible and relevant we distinguish between these two forms of support. Conversely, private investment s from third parties in the f orm of venture capital (VC) have not been considered (but they are briefly discussed); investments carried out by pharmaceutical companies for vaccine R&D and expansion of the production capacity have been collected as far as possible. However, they may of ten be estimations by the study team, because most companies have not disclosed specific figures regarding their investment ; 4 https://www.bvdinfo.com/en- gb/our -products/data/international/orbis?gclid=Cj0KCQiA3eGfBhCeARIsACpJNU_lSA2aPIY3hqoibD - 7Z2Z7DR2h1pojB- gRsQPgx8DiESPXL9UVupQaAn -6EALw_wcB ; see also the users' guide : https://www.wu.ac.at/fileadmin/wu/s/library/databases_info_image/ugorbisneo.pdf 5 Due to the difficulty in finding transparent information and due to inconsistencies in the terminologies used by various institutions, in some cases the categorisation applied may be imprecise. IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 18 public funds provided before the pandemic to conduct pathfinding research underpinning the vaccine development (e.g. , decade long vaccine research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH-NIAID ); or research at the Oxford University on viral vectors ) have not been considered ; any transactions between partner industries (e.g. , between BioNTech and Pfizer) as well as funds provided directly to licensees that produce and distribute vaccines on behalf of lead developers, or to contract development and manufacturing organisations that contribute to lead developers' vaccine p roduction have not been considered . The time frame covered by the desk -based research includes the years 2020, 2021 and 2022. Although information regarding the latter is incomplete due to the lack of official reports, it is reasonable to assume that for most vaccines the funds for R&D were allocated earlier (in 2020 and 2021), so any shortfall in 2022 should not significantly change the overall picture. Based on information collected from publicly available sources and during the interviews with relevant funders and pharmaceutical companies (see section 2.1.3), a fiche summarising the fundings associated to each vaccine has been p repared and shared with the producers to get their feedback. The fiches are in Annex IV. 2.1.2. Statistical analysis The data on funds for the different vaccines have been compiled in a database to allow for data analysis. Before aggregating data, when currency was not reported in EUR, it was converted according to the average exchange rate referring to the year of financing. The statistical analysis consisted in analysing the data collected through the desk research and preparing descriptive statistics to show who has invested, how much, when, and where for both the R&D and the manufacturing of major COVID -19 vaccines. Visual aids have also been used to present the relative importance of funds invested into COVID -19 vaccines by different actors . It is important to notice that the statistical analysis cannot be considered to globally cover all the funding mechanisms for the reasons presented in Section 2.2 , particularly geographical coverage, hence it should be seen as an analysis on the sampled evidence. 2.1.3. Intervi ews The interviews were aimed at collecting fresh evidence and opinions from three different groups of stakeholders , namely: representatives of pharmaceutical companies involved in the production of COVID -19 vaccines ; selected public health experts and scientists from the EU and the US ; selected public decision makers within institutions both at the EU and national level as well as from the US . A total of 20 semi -structured online interviews involving 30 interviewees (see the list of interviewees in Annex III) have been conducted by the principal investigator , with the support of an assistant, between December 2022 and February 2023, following th is protocol : sending an invitation email (with the Letter of recommendation from the Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies enclosed ) to potential interviewees to explain the topic of the study and requesting their availabilities for scheduling the interview . Mapping of long -term public and private investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines 19 PE 740.072 Upon showing interest to participate by replying to the invitation, ea ch interviewee has been sent the interview guide. This allowed them to prepare their responses beforehand, which improved the overall flow of the interview session. The interview questionnaires are available in Annex II . Interviewees have been informed that their replies would be recorded but remain anonymous . Opinions or evidence arising from the interviews were usually needed to confirm or to suggest other sources, but in some cases provided unique evidence. These are reported simply in footnotes as \"Source: personal communication to the principal investigator by an interviewee\" . In addition , we received some answers or other contribution s in written form . The usual disclaimer applies, meaning that the authors, and not the interviewees or any organisa tions, are responsible for the views presented in the study. 2.2. Limitations Despite the possible inaccuracies in the estimates of funding , the resulting analysis combined with more qualitative information collected through interviews is considered robust enough to draw some policy recommendations . The main challenges in the data collection phase are listed below : Availability of pharma companies : All companies involved in the EMA -authori sed COVID -19 vaccines, one under rolling review, and one withdrawn, were contacted by the study team starting December 2022 for an interview. An online interview (about one hour) was conducted by the PI with Pfizer, Sanofi, Hipra, and with Vaccines Europe, a specialized group within the European Federation o f Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA). The above- mentioned three companies (Pfizer, Sanofi, Hipra) also sent written statements, and overall , they were willing to engage in a conversation about the study topics. Novavax sent a particularly d etailed written response. AstraZeneca and GSK respectively replied with written statements . CureVac and Valneva declined the request, invoking confidentiality issues. Moderna replied that they could provide only information publicly available, and did not further contribute. BioNTech did not respond at all despite many solicitations. Different people of Janssen promised to respond, but to date did not. In mid -January, all contacted companies were asked to provide feedback on the accuracy and completeness of information included in the Summary Fiche prepared by the study team based on publicly available information (reported in the Annex IV for details). Feedback on the Summary Fiches was provided by three companies, i.e., Novavax, CureVac, and Hipra. Pfizer , Sanofi and GSK replied that they could not provide additional feedback due to confidentiality issues. The remaining companies did not respond. Overall, there were around 120 emails exchanged to achieve direct contacts with ten companies . The study team appreciates that five of them contributed more actively to the study: AstraZeneca, Hipra, Novavax, Pfizer, Sanofi. Lack of official data sources : Due to the difficulty in finding adequate and systematic information from official sources, the data was collected relying on a variety of publicly disclosed information . However, since many funding arrangements are confidential, details regarding the specific breakdown of spending are often unknown . In general, only funding for which there was evidence of their actual amount, and not merely an intention or announcement, were considered. Any APA for which only the number of doses (but not the relative disbursement) were available were not considered, g iven the impossibility of providing a reliable estimate of the transaction due to the differences in price per dose paid by the various governments. Therefore, funding estimates by this mechanism are likely to be underestimated , especially coming from some countries /institutions with less open disclosure approach. IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 20 Inconsistency of information : The main limitation of the data collection concerns the inconsistency of information available across different sources. This is due to two issues: first, different institutions use different classification , so it is not always possible to clearly distinguish the type of funding or the purpose/destination of it. For example, the terms 'direct funding' or 'government grant' , often found in contracts and repor ts, could indistinctly refer to funding for R&D, for increasing production capacity, or for a mix of both. Again, in the case of APAs , it is possible that part of the amount stipulated is to be attributed to the actual sale, while a portion is for the deve lopment of the vaccine itself. Second, inconsistencies spotted in different sources can be due to differences between announcements and actual commitments as well as the ongoing update of pre-existing agreements. Mapping of long -term public and private investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines 21 PE 740.072 RESUL TS 3.1. Mapping funding of R&D and exten sion of the production capacity for the manufacturing of COVID -19 vaccines The COVID -19 pandemic posed a double challenge to governments and the pharmaceutical industry : to develop new vaccines for the novel threat and to produce billions of doses in a very short timespan. Thanks to a generalized effort , both goals were reached. These extraordinary achievements were made possible by building upon more than two decades of basic research . Basic research and early -stage development of vaccines are frequentl y supported by the public sector and charit ies (see, among others, Cross et al., 2021; Galkina et al., 2018) . For instance, the ChAdOx vaccine platform underlying the Oxford -AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine relies on two decades of R&D by the Oxford Vaccine Gr oup at the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, led by Professor Sarah Gilbert and Professor Adrian Hill. According to Cross et al. (2021) , the financing of such a vaccine platform was 97 -99% public and charitable. See also Florio (2022) on the science behind the Moderna vaccine, particularly the research by Barney Graham and other scientists at the NIH -NIAID, and since 2005 by Drew Weissman and Katalin Karik\u00f2 at the University of Pennsylvania. These are just examples of a wider and complex landscape not covered here. During the pandemic, further efforts have been made by many diversified entities around the world to rapidly develop vaccines capable of preventing the spread of the SARS -CoV- 2 virus. Resources have been invested in two directions: actual research and development , and funding to expand production capacity in order to be able to produce large numbers of doses quickly. Beyond that , advance purchase agreement s were also offered by governments to producers . APAs are so -called 'pull' incentives, meant to de- risk companies' investments in order to encourage the development and manufacturing of products for which society has a need but for which the market does not provide enough 'pull' incentives to enlist a co mpany to make the necessary investments (Boulet et al ., 2021) . APAs de -risks company investments in an often -costly research and development process, through upfront payments and through the promise to purchase products when they come to market. Ma ny gover nments and international platforms used APAs to secur e future vaccine suppl ies. Based on the data collected (see Section 2.1.2 on sources and methodology) , from 2020 to early 2022, the combined support to companies by external funds (including funds from governments, philanthropic entities, third private parties, international public -private partnerships and multilateral development banks) for either R&D and the expansion of production capacity or both were in the range of EUR 9 bill ion for the nine vaccine here considered, and for the sources of funding included. The external incentives would jump to nearly EUR 3 0 billion if APAs are also considered . Differentiating between types of funding , Table 3 shows the amounts of external funds received by the pharmaceutical companies involved in the production of COVID -19 vaccines in scope . The large figures for Moderna , Pfizer, and AstraZeneca , can be attributed to the following factors: the wide distribution worldwide, the earlier approv al date compared to competitors, and the significant economic support from the US government (for Moderna). It is worth noting that although Pfizer did not receive any government R&D funding to develop its vaccine, its partner, BioNTech, did so.6 According to data collected (see details in Annex IV), BioNTech received EUR 584.5 million in funding from the German government to assist with COVID -19 vaccine development and a loan of EUR 100 6 Moreover, even Pfizer benefited from past NIH research. IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 22 million by the European Investment Bank (EIB), which also assisted the company before the pandemic with a n earlier significant loan . Table 3: Amount of external support funds received by entity and by type (EUR million) R&D only R&D + manufacturing part of the vaccines authorised by EMA . * Grant is non -repayable support provided either by the public sector or other private companies. ** Loan is repayable finance provided either by the European Investment Bank or national public entities . *** The APA volume considered is the total volume of the contract for the purchase of doses (excluding optional ones) foreseen in the contract. The a mount may or may not include a down payment. APA volumes for BioNTech, and Oxford University are nil because marketing authorization for the vaccines they have developed is held respectively by Pfizer, and AstraZeneca. Source: Authors , see details and sources in Annex IV. Mapping the dynamics over time, it emerges that during 2020 and for the first part of 2021, all types of support ( grants/loans exclusively for R&D, for both R&D and manufacturing, and APA s) were provided (see Figure 1). In 2021, a s the conditional marketing authorisation of the vaccines started to be released, various institutions started to purchase doses, causing expenditure on purchases to soar. In 2022, the external funding for R&D, for both R&D and manufacturing, and APA s was clearly lower7, as effective vaccines were already available. It is also worth noting that vaccine s that started the EMA 's rolling review at the end of 2021 or 2022, such as Valneva and Hipra, received relatively less funds than first comers did. For inst ance, Hipra could not sign an APA because there were too many doses available in Europe when they approached the EC. Nevertheless, in August 2022, a joint procurement agreement was signed between Hipra and European Health Emergency Preparedness and Respons e Authority (HERA ) to ensure wider preparedness .8 This agreement is not a commitment but rather a right for the 14 participating countries to purchase up to 250 million doses once the vaccine receives a positive assessment by the EMA. 7 It is also worth noting that at the time of writing reliable data on the year just ended (2022) were more difficult to found. 8 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_22_4782 .

The evidence of direct corporate investments i n vaccine R&D and expansion of the production capacity is scant . Only a few companies have provided information in this regard for this study (see Box 1), which prevents making consistent comparisons between vaccines . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 24 Box 1: Three examples of direct corporate investment Source: Authors , based on information provided by cited companies for this study. Data in Table 4 come from company reports and are relative to total corporate R&D expenditures. For most of the companies , the study has considered as attributable to COVID -19 vaccines the increase of total R&D expenses of 202 0 (upper bound estimate), after making some adjustments to account for the R&D trends of the two years before the pandemic. R&D expenses of 2021 were inc luded only for companies whose vaccines was authorised in late 2021 or 2022. For Pfizer and Novavax the study relies on figures directly provided by the companies, summing to USD 3.8 billion. On the one side, it is possible that some R&D expenditures were not reported by companies in their reports for the fiscal year 2020 and are , to a certain extent , included in the fiscal year 2021. On the other side, the companies manage a wide portfolio of projects ; hence they may have increased their R&D outside the COVID -19 vaccines. This study does not extend to further post -authorisation corporate R&D, for example , on adapted vaccines or new projects related to C OVID -19. Summing up the figure s, the cumulated volume of corporate R&D expenditure incurred by producers (of the seven authorised vaccines only ) somehow attributable to COVID -19 vaccines is in the range EUR 4-5 billion of corporate R&D . In the rest of the study, we shall use this range, in order to match it with the external support provided in years 2020 and 2021, which, as mentioned , is about E UR 9 billion (for nine vaccines, out of which about EUR 8 billion is provided by public sector ). The EUR 9 The evidence of direct corporate investments in vaccine R&D and expansion of the production capacity were provided by three companies, Pfizer, Novavax, and Hipra, namely: According to information disclosed by Pfizer, the company invested globally at risk over USD 2 billion with over USD 1 billion into the European manufacturing and logistics network acro ss 12 EU Members States and hired more than 1500 employees. In early December 2022, Pfizer announced a USD 2.4 billion investment in two European manufacturing sites, Grange Castle in Dublin and Puurs in Belgium, creating approximately 750 Full Time Equiva lent across the sites - and securing mRNA manufacturing in Europe. According to information provided by Novavax , their research and development expenses increased to approximately USD 2.5 billion in 2021 as compared to USD 747 million in 2020, an increase of USD 1.8 billion due to the cost of develop ing activities relating to NVX - CoV2373. Moreover, according to Novavax's communication to the PI , during 2020, the company's investing activities primarily consisted of capital expenditures, advanced purchases o f raw materials and equipment, and acquisition of Novavax CZ , i.e., the Czech site. Capital expenditures for 2021 and 2020 were USD 57.5 million and USD 54.6 million, respectively. Official figures for 2022 are not available yet. However, Novavax claims to have expended significant capital for further development activities related to the NVX -CoV2373 program, including the additional build -up of research and development and manufacturing facilities and related equipment. According to information provided by Hipra's representatives, their vaccine has been 70% self-financed. Debt finance represents 27% and grants 3%. In particular, Hipra's total R&D expenditure directly related to the COVID -19 vaccine amounted to EUR 9,6 million in 2021 and EUR 28,4 million in 2022. However, these amounts do not include the following: expenses associated with registration, promotion, and production activities; capital investments; use of pre -existing equipment/facilities; and stock investment. Mapping of long -term public and private investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines 25 PE 740.072 billion figure (mostly in the form of grants), however, includes support to increasing production capacity. This does not consider additional funding, particularly by BARDA to suppliers (such as Merck) related products, such as vials, biocontainers, needles, syringes, etc.9 Table 4: Total corporate R&D expenditure (million), nine companies, 2018- 21 Company 2018 2019 2020 2021 Note Pfizer USD GBP 3,893 Source: Authors , based on companies' annual reports. As the corresponding expenditures in the increased production capacity by firms is not available for most of the companies, one cannot properly compare the total public and private investment. While for two companies (Pfizer and Novavax ) we were directly p rovided some figures by the interviewees, for all the companies involved in the development of authorised vaccines we recur to an indirect approach: we have collected the data on total fixed assets in the years before and after the (conditional) marketing authorisation . While any production increase may be supported by changes in the purchase of components, in the size of employment, or in procurement contracts with suppliers, some changes in fixed assets should be expected as well. In fact , fixed assets as for the usual accountancy conventions are defined as follows: \u00abFixed assets are physical or tangible items that a company owns and uses in its business operations to provide services and goods to its customers ... When a business acquires a fixed asset, it is recorded on the balance sheet - usually as property, plant and equipment ... Common examples of fixed assets include: computer equipment; vehicles; machinery; tools; land; buildings, furniture. Intellectual property, like patents, copyrigh ts and trademarks, can also be considered fixed assets. While they are not physical assets, they are intended to help generate revenue \u00bb10 We also checked the intangible fixed assets component in 9 https://medicalcountermeasures.gov/barda/influenza | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 26 order to guess the change in production assets. It is importan t to consider that in the pharmaceutical industry, intangible assets, such as patents, are often a major component of total assets. To fetch the data in a comparable way, we have used the largest repository of corporate account data, the ORBIS database, and extracted the information available on total fixed assets for the nine companies, in the years 2018 and 2019, before the pandemic and 2020 and 2021, after it. Table 5 reports such data. Balance sheets, however, do not usually specify the amount of investment, i.e. change in fixed assets, related to a specific product, such as a vaccine. Hence the data must be interpreted with caution, as they can refer to a range of different products, and not just the COVID -19 vaccines. Our guess is that the cumulative production investment s of the nine companies in 2020 -2021 may be in the range of EUR 1 1 +/- 3 billion, mostly depending on the missing data about Pfizer investment s outside Europe, about AstraZeneca worldwide, and how to interpret the total asset increase of some other companies, particularly the very high fixed investment of Moderna. Table 5: Total corporate fixed assets (EUR million), nine companies, 2018 -21 Company 2018 2019 2020 2021 Note Pfizer 95,6 30 119,98 GSK 45,89 6 70,758 65,91 the authorization date . Source: Authors based on Orbis data. Given the evidence, w e can confidently conclude that - albeit with significant differences across companies - US taxpayers were major funders of corporate R&D and productive investment on most of the nine COVID -19 vaccines considered . The incentive in grant form was about one billion per vaccine on average (including one withdrawn), but with a very wide variance across the considered vaccines and companies. Moreover, some of these incentives and the almost EUR 21 billion of APA s that we have been able to track may have also con tributed to de -risking around EUR 1 1 billion of corporate investment for the production capacity of vaccines until 2021. One issue this study has not examined is the potential role of venture capital in the EU and more in general of a Capital Markets Unio n (CMU)11 in the support of R&D for vaccines. While a full treatment of 11 of long -term public and private investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines 27 PE 740.072 this topic is beyond the scope of our analysis, the box below briefly discusses some facts and their implications. Based on that it is possible to conclude that VC probably made a littl e difference in the development of COVID -19 vaccines, compared with the critically important role of government emergency funds through BARDA in the US, but also, to a certain extent, with the role played by the EIB to support BioNTech, CureVac, and others . Even in the US context, despite its VC availability, leading economists (Athey et al . 2022b ) argue that \"there is a strong economic case for continued federal investment in COVID -19 vaccines and therapeutics. In brief, the private sector on its own will invest too little because COVID -19 vaccines and therapeutics generate enormous benefits for public health and the macroeconomy that private firms can only very partially capture. \" The bottom line is that while VC has played a role in the biotech landscape worldwide, it cannot remedy the market failures in the vaccine sector because, after all, the objective of VC is to identify potential high returns for their investors from early -stage projects, and not to select those projects based on public health needs per se, when financial returns are unclear. Box 2: Capital markets and COVID -19 vaccines Source: Authors, based on cited sources . The CMU was launched in 2014 by President Juncker and was restated by president Von der Leyen in 2019 in her Agenda for Europe. Several actions have been proposed to achieve a CMU. The question in our context is whether the structural problems of the EU capital markets may have contributed in the past and may risk in the future to slow down the development of vaccines (and more in general biomedical innovation) by European companies. If one focuses on how Ve nture Capital players reacted to the pandemic in the early months of 2020, when risk and potential reward of investment on vaccines (in general) were probably higher, the following data emerge: there were USD 2.3 billion of VC (until end of August 2020) go ing to vaccine companies worldwide, doubling the share of total VC funds from 0.6% (2015 -2019) to 1.2%. US - located companies raised nearly USD 1 billion, German companies over USD 800 million, France close to USD 50 million, and no transaction were recorde d in other EU countries (Savills Research, 2020) The difference between the role of VC in the US, where the sector is largely developed, and in the EU, where it is often considered lagging behind, does not seem significant. Moreover, there is strong evidence that VC in general has not been resilient to the pandemic, as it rather decreased its operations, see Bellavitis and others (2022). Using a dataset of 39,527 funding rounds occurring before and during the pandemic in 130 countries, these authors show that the effect of COVID -19 pandemic on VC was \" a significant decline in investments ... this decline is more pronounced for investments characterized by higher uncertainty, namely investments in seed -stage ventures, industries affected more heavily by the CO VID -19 crisis, international investments, and non- syndicated investments. Investor prominence partially moderates these effects .\" On the other side a JRC paper by Bellucci et al . (2020) suggests that there was some reallocation of VC towards deals in pandemic -related categories. Using Zephyr database, the authors looked for deals where five words were mentioned in the descriptions: biology, pharmaceutical, medicine, health, and su pply chain, and found a positive empirical relationship between the spread of COVID - 19 and VC investment in pandemic -related deals, in terms of invested amount and number of transactions. Again, these transactions are mostly unrelated to vaccines and high- risk R&D on infectious diseases. There is no evidence that VC made a difference in COVID -19 vaccine development. IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 28 3.2. The relative importance of funds invested into COVID -19 vaccines by different actors Shifting the focus from recipients to funders, Figure 2 shows the entities that contributed to the cumulated funding (for \"R&D only\", \"R&D + manufacturing\" and \"APA s\") of each vaccine. The most prominent among them are the US government , with EUR 15.4 billion (51.6% of total tracked funding ), the European Union12, with EUR 7.9 billion (26.3% of total tracked funding ), and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI), with EUR 4.6 billion (15.5% of total tracked funding ). Most of the funds mapped for the US came from the US BARDA. The European Union stream includes the funding provided by the EU budget as well as Member States through six APA contract s, the only ones f or which the funding amount has been disclosed .13 These figures do not include other types of procurement contracts after marketing authorisation. Altogether , governments and other public actors contributed by means of grants (27%), loans (0.6%), and APAs (54%), representing over 80% of the total external funds mapped . The remaining funds were provided by philanthropic entities, third -party private companies, public -private partnerships, and the European Investment Bank (EIB). 12 Including support provided by the EU, EIB, and MS tracked. 13 The cost per dose for Oxford -AstraZeneca and Moderna w as retrieved directly from contracts that have been made available in full, notably thanks to the work of Italian investigative journalists working for the RAI, the public television. For CureVac the APA volume was retrieved by the company annual report and confirmed by the company's representative. For Janssen, Sanofi/GSK, and Pfizer/BioNTech, the price list revealed by a Belgian minister was used to calculate the volumes of APA s. If the weighted average cost per dose calculated by the European Court of Auditor that is EUR 15 is applied (ECA, 2022) to all doses purchased through APAs regardless the pro ducers, the EU funding would j ump to EUR 16.9 billion. However, this amount would be overestimated because such a weighted average cost per dose was calculated including also the volumes of three purchase agreements.

Focusing only on the grants that were explicitly directed at the R&D o n vaccines (see Figure 3), with a total of EUR 19.5 million the share of funds coming from EU and MS is marginal compared to total funds mapped . As reported in Section 3.2.2, the EC provided EUR 350 million to support coronavirus vaccine development , however, these funds did not directly contribute to the development of one of the vaccines under the scope in this study . The US government and Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI )14 are by far the largest funders w ith, respectively , EUR 168. 8 million and EUR 351 .1 million . Together they cover 75% of total support funds for \"R&D only\" . They are followed by Fosun Pharmaceutical , a Chinese company, with EUR 118.4 million , the UK government with EUR 35.1, the US philanthropic foundations Dolly Parton COVID -19 Research Fund and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (respectively EUR 0.9 and EUR 2.2 million ). There may be other funding by these or other entities that we have been unable to confirm in spite of press releases not always followed by evidence. 14 It is worth noting that CEPI has secured financial support from many governments worldwide, private investors & philanthropie s. The EC also provides contribution to CEPI. Source: https://cepi.net/about/whowe are/ .

Concerning the grant s provided to support development and the extension of the production capacity , the US government is the major funder , with EUR 6.8 billion , representing 82% of the total funding (see Figure 4). It is followed by the German government ( EUR 876.5 million ) and CEPI (EUR 350.4 million ). According to one of the interviewed companies , the funding received from the US Government and CEPI were key to support the company's ability to expedite the clinical development and production of the vaccine, including at their facility in Europe .

When APAs are considered, the US government and the EU are by far the largest funders among those mapped (Figure 5). According to data collected, the US and EU together represent 73% of the total APAs whose amount has been disclosed . The other entities that used this type of funding are GAVI (EUR 4.6 billion ), the UK government (EUR 560.5 millio n), and the Israel government (EUR 214.9 million ). According to interviewed companies, APAs helped to rapidly produce and distribute COVID -19 vaccines amid the public health emergency by providing them with an efficient contracting process, funding for manufacturing scale -up, and predictable product demand . There is no evidence tha t APAs incentivised R&D. IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 32 Figure 5: Sources of COVID -19 vaccine APAs by funder Source: Authors ' own elaboration . Primarily with Operation Warp Speed (see Box below ), the US government contributed to all investment types for vaccines from R&D to APA s. Conversely, the EU and MS funds were mainly concentrated on APAs. Some companies explained that while the US financed the bulk of R&D and industrial scale -up on the US soil , the EC was relatively quick in sending teams to negotiate APA contracts. These have been instrumental in helping companies set up or expand their production capacity in the EU .

COVID -19 vaccines strategy by the EC The EC effort to secure vaccines for EU citizens focused on creat ing an ad -hoc and tailor -made procurement system. However, the EC action on procurement started later than the UK and US ones (ECA, 2022; Deters and Zardo, 2022) . Initially, France and Germany took the matter into their hands and launched an initiative for joint procurement in April 2020. They contacted pharma companies and invited Italy and the Netherlands to join what became the 'Inclusive Vaccine Al liance'. However, after ample political debate , it was decided to adopt an EU -wide approach, to be carried out by the European Commission on behalf of the Member States .15 Only on 17 June 2020, the EC published its COVID -19 vaccines strategy, which focuses on a centralised EU procurement process , and revolves around two pillars : i) securing sufficient production of vaccines in the EU and thereby sufficient supplies for its Member States; and ii) adapting the EU's regulatory framework to the current urgency a nd making use of existing regulatory flexibility. In parallel with the publication of its COVID -19 vaccine strategy, the EC signed an agreement with the 27 Member States, allowing it to conclude APAs with COVID -19 vaccine manufacturers on their behalf .16 With these contract s, the Commission secure d Member States' the right to buy a specified number of vaccine doses in a given timeframe and at a given price. In return, part of the development costs faced by vaccine manufacturers was financed by down payment s from the EU budget. As soon as a vaccine candidate is authorised by EMA, the down payments are used against purchases of the vaccine by the Member States. In case the vaccine is not authorised, these payments may not always be fully recovered (ECA, 2022) . According to the European Court of Auditors (ECA , 2022), between August 2020 and November 2021, the Commission signed 8 APA contracts with vaccine manufacturers (see Table 6). These 15 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/epsco/2020/06/12/ 16 Commission Decision of 18 June 2020, C(2020) 4192 and its subsequent approval by each Member State. Operation Warp Speed (OWS) was an interagency partnership among components of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and the Department of Defense (D oD). OWS engaged with private firms and other federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The initiative was launched in May 2020 by the Trump Administration to coordinate th e efforts of agencies to respond to the COVID -19 emergency by accelerat ing the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID -19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Initially, the US Congress directed almost USD 10 billion to this initiative through supplemental funding, including the CARES Act. The USD 10 billion included more than USD 6.5 billion designated for countermeasure development through BARDA and USD 3 billion for NIH research. Funding was then increased to about USD 18 billion by Oct ober 2020 . Out of this, over USD 12 billion ha d been invested in vaccine -related contracts . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 34 contracts were concluded before the vaccines received a recommendation for a conditional marketing authorisation from the EMA and were financed through the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI), a financing instrument directly managed by the EC that allows it to provide support within the EU in case of disasters. In the same period, three purchase agreements were signed ( with Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna ) for vaccines having already received an EU conditional marketing authorization. These contracts do not include any down payment from the EU budget, though Moderna required a down payment from the Member States .

According to ECA (2022), all 11 contracts signed between August 2020 and November 2021 include a clause on the location of vaccine production . Six contracts allow the contractors to use facilities in the US, Switzerland, the UK or the European Economic Area (EEA) . Four contracts specify that the contractor s need to inform the Commission if they intend to use additional facilities located outside the EU. In four other cases, the contractor needs to obtain the Commission's prior consent to use facilities outside the EU, UK, EEA or Switzerland . Although the EC strategy aimed at a sufficient produc tion of vaccines in the EU to ensure supply security, given the structure of the global supply and production chains, it had limited leverage to prevent production steps to take place in non- EU locations and overcome supply challenges. The EC only set up a task force to support manufacturing and supply chains in February 2021 . By comparison, the US and the UK anticipated manufacturing and supply problems earlier in the process, either by funding the development of industrial capacity or by actively monitori ng and supporting the production efforts of companies (GAO 2021a; GAO 2021b; and UK National Audit Office, 2020) .

When the COVID -19 outbreak reached Europe in March 2020, some funding opportunities were created by the EC to support clinical research projects on COVID -19. The Commission pledged EUR 1.4 billion under the Coronavirus Global Response initiative, of which about EUR 1 billion comes from Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (Annex 3 gives a n overview of funding mobilised under Horizon 2020 ( H2020) to contribute to the Coronavirus Global Response). Out of this , only EUR 350 million are dedicated to support coronavirus vaccine development though not directly targeting the vaccine producers .18 Prior to the COVID -19-specific investments, however, the EC claims to have invested over EUR 650 million through H2020 (2014- 2020) in vaccine and vaccination research and innovation (see, for instance, the case of BioNTech in box 6). 18 https://research -and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/research -area/health/coronavirus/vaccines_en and material shared by Directorate General for Research and Innovation . Sanofi -GSK: the production of VidPrevtyn Beta leverages the EU manufacturing footprint of Sanofi and GSK (for the adjuvant) with production s ites based in France, Italy, Belgium and Germany, covering the full value chain from drug substance to drug product. Novavax stated that much of its supply chain is based in Europe. They acquired a state -of-the- art vaccine manufacturing facility in Czechia, in which they invested significantly to produce the antigen, and they have significantly expanded the facility in Sweden where they produce the adjuvant. The Czech and Swedish sites collectively employ more than 650 people. Novavax also partnered with organisations in Germany, Ireland, Belgium, Spain, Poland, and the Netherlands that produce the final packaged product for European and global use. Beyond Europe, Novavax partnered with manufacturers around the world, including SK bioscience in the Republic of Korea, Takeda in Japan, and the Serum Institute of India. Pfizer claimed to have invested USD 1 billion into their European manufacturing and logistics network across 12 EU Members States and hired more than 1500 employees. Comirnaty is not only made in Europe as a finished product, but all the key components required to manufacture the vaccine are sourced in Europe. During the peak of the pandemic, Pfizer's European manufacturing network spanned 19 sites, including 12 contract manufacturing partners . Moreover, 235 components of the vaccine were sourced in Europe across 12 Member States and about 35 suppliers .

The list of projects funded through the first H2020 emergency call is in Annex V. On 3 March 2020, the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI ), supported through the EC's H2020, launched a special fast -track call for the \"Development of therapeutics and diagnostics combatting coronavirus infections\" with an EU contribution of EUR 45 million, which was subsequently increased to EUR 72 million .19 8 projects were short -listed for funding . On 19 May 2020, the EC launched a second request for expressions of interest for innovative and rapid health- related approaches to respond to COVID -19 and to deliver quick results for society for a higher level of preparedness of health systems (SC1 -PHE -CORONAVIRUS- 2020- 2) with a budget of EUR 129.5 million. 23 projects were short -listed for funding with a total of EUR 128.2 million . However, none of the projects awarded in the context of these two calls involve s funding for vaccines R&D . The EC also invested in developing clinical networks and research infrastructures to ensure preparedness to deliver clinical research . With nearly EUR 26.5 million coming from H2020, the EC funded the VACCELERATE project20. VACCELERATE platform acts as a single -entry point for vaccine developers that are interested in doing vaccine trials in Europe, maps clinical trial and laboratory sites across Europe and identifies the best locations for conducting Phase 2 and 3 vaccine trials. The project was launched at the beginning of 2021, nearly a year after the start of the crisis. It then took another year to develop a protocol. Hence, the platform started to operate in 2022 when the situation was completely changed with respect to 2020 . VACCELERATE currently implements three trials. The first trial studies the immune response of a second booster vaccine in the elderly (over 75 years old), the second trial studies the immune response of a second booster vaccine in the general adult population, and the third trial evaluate s regimens of reduced -dose vaccination in children.21 VACCELERATE has been conceived as a pilot project, ending in 2024, but the idea is to scale it up to serve other diseases. It will be part of the preparedness initiative for the next pandemic. In principle, the platform could also serve pharmaceutical companies. However, since big pharma usually works with global contract research organisa tions (CROs ), the platform is expected to mainly serve universities, research institutes and SMEs. Some related bibliography is presented in Annex 1. 3.2.2. EIB support for vaccines R&D and manufacturing The European Investment Bank (EIB ), working in collaboration with the European Commission, has supported the development of vaccines and the expansion of manufacturing . Loans are provided under the InnovFin Infectious Diseases Finance Facility , backed by Horizon 202022. Specifically: On 11 June 2020, the EIB and BioNTech signed a EUR 100 million loan agreement23 for the development and large- scale production of portfolio of vaccines, including a vaccin e candidate against SARS -CoV- 2. The deal also allowed the company to expand its manufacturing capacity in order to supply the vaccine worldwide quickly in response to the pandemic. BioNTech was not a new client for the Bank. In 2019, the EIB supported the company with a EUR 50 million loan agreement under the European Growth Finance Facility for BioNTech's | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 40 immunotherapy programme . Although the company - which was not revenue generating at the time - would have been able to raise the money need ed even without the EIB loan, thanks to the high capitalisation an d to the numerous partnerships in place, the support of the EIB offered the advantag e to be immediate. In July 2020, the EIB and CureVac sign ed a EUR 75 million loan agreement for the development and large -scale production of vaccines, including CureVac's vaccine candidate against SARS -CoV- 2.24 In addition, the loan was supposed to suppor t the c ompany's efforts to expand its existing Good Manufacturing Practice certified production capabilities and accelerate the completion of its fourth production site in T\u00fcbingen, Germany. In June 2021, the EIB and Univercells signed a EUR 30 million loa n agreement to enable the production of large volumes of COVID -19 vaccines in a new facility and to co -develop a pipeline of COVID -19 vaccines.25 On 19 October 2021, the EIB and Hipra signed a loan agreement worth EUR 45 million to support the development of a new COVID -19 vaccine.26 More specifically, the agreement covers R&D and manufacturing investments required to bring the vaccine to the market. In April 2022, the EIB signed a EUR 15 million loan with the Italian Biomedical Research Company (IRBM) to e xpand the capacity to make vaccines and increase research into the coronavirus and other diseases.27 The EIB, alongside the EC , also contributed to the global vaccine initiative COVAX , the international facility to ensure fair and universal access to COVID -19 vaccines. In December 2020, the Bank contributed EUR 400 million of financing to support the COVAX initiative to provide 1 billion doses for low - and middle -income countries. The EIB loan complemented a EUR 100 million EU grant to Gavi, the vaccin e alliance, that administer s the COVAX Facility.28 Up to March 2022, COVAX has received a total of EUR 900 million from the EIB. In April 2022, The EIB pledged an additional EUR 1 billion to support COVAX. 3.3. The need for continuing support ing COVID -19 vaccin es with public funds The previous sections have presented some evidence on the role of private investors, governments, and NGOs in the funding of R&D and production of COVID -19 vaccines . This section discusses whether and to what extent it can be warranted to deploy such financial efforts in the future, focusing on the potential role of the EU and its Members States, and provides some policy recommendations . It does so after having presented the pandemic scenario for the next years, the R&D needs in such a future scenario , and current market of long -term public and private investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines 41 PE 740.072 3.3.1. Pandemic or endemic C OVID -19 in the next years? Forecasting the evolution of the pandemic is not an easy task , given the unpredictable mutations of the virus, the possible changes in socio -economic conditions across the globe, and the transformation of policy responses. A notable example is the unexpected and sudden transition of China from a 'zero Covid' policy to one much more relaxed, with huge implications in terms of infection surges .29 The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC ) has developed several models (see ECDC 2022b ) to forecast how the COVID -19 pandemic may evolve in terms of cases, hospitalisations and deaths .30 Most of the existing models focus on a time horizon of 9 -12 months, which is not particularly helpful to decision -making on vaccine R&D, which may take years to deliver a viable innovation. Several reviewed papers tend to align with statements such as the following one by Reiner et al. (2022) : \"As infection- derived and conferred protection wanes, we expect infections to rise, but given the large proportion of the population that had some level of immunity to SARS -CoV -2 as of June 1, 2022, all but the most pessimistic forecasts in thi s analysis do not predict a massive global surge by November 30, 2022. All signs point towards COVID -19 transitioning into a more endemic transmission regime (lower, but sustained disease burden), and with the introduction and proliferation of novel therap eutic interventions expected in mid - to late 2022, the likelihood of returning to past levels of COVID -19 mortality is low. The characteristics of future COVID -19 variants are difficult to predict, and our forecasts do show some considerable variation in o utcomes as a function of variant properties. \" However, the ECDC ( 2022 a) has provided some qualitative scenarios to 2032 , summari sed in Figure 7, which shows a range of possible outcomes from a 'diminished threat' to 'a new pandemic', with intermediate cases, depending upon different combinations of factors such as: viral properties , including v iral evolution , growth rate , disease severity (intrinsic), s easonality ; immunology , including i mmune protection from severe outcomes , duration of protection ; societal factors, including s ocietal tolerance for non- pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures , societal tolerance for the residual risks of COVID - 19, v accination acceptance , healthcare system capacities ; medical interventions including v accines , antiviral medications , diagnostics. 29 See Nixon et al. (2022) on the conceptual and technical issues involved. 30 See the European COVID -19 Scenario Hub launched in May 2022. It will serve as a resource for Member States in their pandemic planning and inform decisions aimed at minimising the expected burden caused by COVID -19 unde r different scenarios. The hub is developed and run by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in co -operation with the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID) at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medici ne (LSHTM). IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 42 Figure 7: Qualitative long -term scenarios uncertainties surrounding possible trajectories for the COVID -19 pandemic, particularly in light of the continued high levels of viral transmission globally, and the possibility that new variants of concern may arise, it seems clear that SARS -CoV -2 is here to stay . As such, public health systems, clinical services and society in general will need to adapt to the fluctuating levels of threat that this virus is likely to present in the coming years. [...] Common to all scenarios is the perp etual risk posed by new SARS -CoV -2 variants . A key message is that even when or where current scenarios appear to be less severe, adequate surveillance and monitoring systems need to be in place to detect changes in the level of threat posed by SARS -CoV -2, and preparedness must be strengthened in order to mount an effective and proportionate response to rapidly deteriorating situations.\" The experts consulted for the present study broadly concur with this view . The following statements have some implication s for R&D needs discussed in the next section: \"SARS -Cov -2 is here arise\" . \"A new pandemiccannot be excluded \". 3.3.2. R&D needs The scientific knowledge about how to design C OVID -19 vaccines has made significant progress in the last three years, but it is far from having achieved a steady state. According to the dashboard made available from the Covid -19 - living NMA initiative , on January 20, 2023, there were 932 ongoing clinical studies from phase 1 to 4 cover ing a range of technologies: R NA based vaccine ( 27% ); Protein subunit ( 25% ); (17% ); Inactivated virus ( 16% ); Others (15%). The latter are studies on other technologies, classified as: DNA based vaccine, virus-like particle, replicating viral vector, viral vector (non- replicating)/ APC (antigen presenting cell) and others . Several studies are of Mapping of long -term public and private investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines 43 PE 740.072 comparative nature and may cover the effica cy of different technologies. Overall, about 4,4 million patients were involved in clinical studies (as of 5 January 2023). Concerning the sponsor/funder of the st udies , it is interesting to observe that along with major companies, many studies are supported by public sector organisations, universities, and not -for- profit entities . For example, just considering RNA based vaccines (all phases , totaling to 255 studies as of 20 January 2023), along with companies such as BioNTech (20 studies) , Moderna (14 studies) , CureVac (6 studies) , AIM Vaccine (5 studies) , Sinocelltech (4 studies) , Can Sino (3 studies) , GSK (3 studies) , there are a large number of studies registered by such entities as National Institute of Health -National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIH- NAIAD (14 studies) , Thai National Vaccine Institute , Murdoch Children' s Research Institute, University Medical Center Utrecht (with 5 studies each ), University of Cologne, Chulalongkorn University, University College Dublin (with 4 studies each ). Focusing only on the 41 studies at Phase 3 (as of 20 January 2023) , 17 are registered by companies and the remaining 24 by a mix of public / not -for-profit entities . A similar pattern of industry and public sector sponsored studies can be observed for the other vaccine technologies , with public and private sector sponsored studies registered for phase 1 and phase 2 having similar shares . Consensus exists on continuing support of COVID -19 vaccines adopting a port folio strategy . The fact that so many studies are going on worldwide, with so many research teams involved, indicates that several research questions are still not answered. Looking at the literature (drawing also from Remuzzi and Florio , forthcoming 2023) and based on interviews with experts , including particularly Prof. Oliver A. Cornely (University of Cologne ), Dr. Gary L. Disbrow (BARDA), Emily Erbelding (Mario Negri Institute) , and with some compan y representatives, the potential avenue of public support is many- fold : Developing a novel vaccine platform to target some more stable features of the virus in order to induce durable sterili sing immunity . For the COVID -19 mRNA vaccine, data suggest that protection to viral infection may last 3 months or shorter, despite a remarkable and durable protection against hospitalization, severe disease and death. To overcome this limitation and to keep up with mutations, multiple booster shots have been authorised to restore antibody waning and confer additional protection. However, recent data suggest that the efficacy of updated bivalent vaccine boosters may not be as effective in preventing viral infection against different variants. This finding could be explained by the so called 'immune imprinting' : an initial exposure to a virus limits a person's future immune response against different variants by triggering the antibody response against the initial viral strain encountered during vaccination or infection (Brazil, 2023). Therefore, a ccording to some experts' opinion 31, R&D should focus at developing novel vaccine platform to target so me more stable features of the virus in order to induce durable sterilizing immunity (see box below). 31 Source: intervie w with Professor G. Remuzzi by the PI. IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 44 Box 7: Novel vaccine platform : approaches Source: Remuzzi and Florio , forthcoming 2023. Investing in the so -called next/new/second generation COVID -19 vaccines , i.e., vaccines that offer a longer protection and /or a broader range of protection, meaning they are multi -balanced (Marks et al ., 2023) . With a new -generation SARS -CoV- 2 vaccine, it would not be necessary to modify the vaccine every time a variant comes up and to have a booster shot to restore protection . Possible approaches to achieve more durable SARS- CoV- 2 vaccine immunity include the followings: (i) variant -proof SARS -CoV- 2 vaccines; (ii) pan -sarbecovirus vaccines (i.e., against sarbecoviruses, the subgenus that includes all t he SARS -like viruses); ( iii) pan -betacoronavir us Regarding variant -proof SARS- CoV- 2 vaccines , different approaches are possible (see box below) . Other strategies seek to cover incrementally broader Corona Virus ( CoV ) space. A strategy seeking to confer pan -sarbecovirus coverage is the nanoparticle vaccine (Mosaic -8b) developed by Cohen and colleagues (Cohen et al ., 2022). For the other two approaches , see the next bullet point. Among others, CEPI invests in exploring a distinct way of designing a shot that will be broadly protective against one or more coronaviruses.32 Since it is not known yet which scientific approaches will work, CEPI considers having a portfolio of options to maximise the chances of success - just as it was done with first generation COVID -19 vaccine development. CEPI's approach is considered promis ing by all the interviewed experts. Box 8: Variant -proof SARS- CoV -2 vaccines : approaches formulations with distinct variants (with or without the ancestral SARS -CoV- 2 Spike strain); inserts designed to elicit cellular responses (such as Nucleocapsid, that is an internal RNA -binding protein which has long been viewed as an important target for T -cell response, that may eventually confer broad protection); or the ancestral SARS -CoV- 2 Spike strain in a platform deemed to elicit broader and more potent immunity. It is important to note that these variant -proof strategies do not necessarily include distinct variant sequences , because it is argued that a given vaccine candidate based on the ancestral SARS -CoV- 2 antigen could offer superior immune responses that would c over a broad array of viruses. In this regard, researchers at Duke University have developed a vaccine candidate based on the ancestral SARS - CoV- 2 strain and aimed to be vari ant-proof (Li D et al., 2022). The approaches to develop novel vaccine platform to target some more stable features of the virus in order to induce durable sterilizing immunity migh t include, among many other methods, targeting S protein viral sequences that are immutable, immunogenic, and accessible to neutralizing antibodies; including other targets from the virus such as portions of the membrane, envelope, or nucleocapsid proteins ; targeting conserved or occluded (structurally hidden) epitopes using nanoparticles of randomly arrayed receptor binding domains; and developing vaccines based on T -cell receptor constructs that specifically recognize the SARS -CoV- 2 RNA - dependent RNA poly merase (Marks et al., 2023). Mapping of long -term public and private investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines 45 PE 740.072 Investing in the fundamental research for the so -called universal coronavirus vaccines , or at least a pan -betacoronaviruses vaccine .33 This avenue of research, which is, for instance, in the NIH- NIAID agenda34, is the most ambitious and risky. Anthony Fauci, former director of the NIAID, called the development of universal coronavirus vaccines a n \"urgent need\" .35 He argued that more resources are needed to continue the fight, and he has been publicly lobbying lawmakers to allocate them. However, other experts are more sceptical , and point out at the experience with influenza for which, despite decades of research, such a next -generation vaccine has not been developed yet. Hence, they suggest to invest on monitoring, adaptation, and periodic boosters rather than on R&D on a pancoronavirus vaccine. In fact, because COVID -19 might become endemic and because the possibility to develop a universal vaccine is highly uncertain, it is als o cons idered necessary to continue investing in a sophisticated monitoring system similar to what governments have put in place for influenza. Indeed, the influenza vaccine composition is reviewed before every flu season because influenza viruses constantly evolve through antigenic changes. To inform vaccine updates, laboratories that contribute to the World Health Organization Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System monitor the antigenic phenotypes of circulating viruses all year round. Vaccine strains are selected in anticipation of the upcoming influenza season to allow adequate time for production. Since booster doses of existing vaccines are still needed, studies on under -investigated topics on existing vaccines are necessary , including : 1) studies on the vaccines for children and their dose (some experts do not see this as a critically important issue, except as an indirect way to protect elderly patients through increased vaccination of the children) ; 2) real -life studies to determine effectiveness of vaccines with updated composition and according to different platform technologies over time and across target populations; 3) studies to investigate more in -depth the differences of responses to vaccines for specific immunocompromised populations in order to adjust vaccine schedules . Since activation of innate and adaptive immunity by SARS- CoV- 2 vaccines is essential for triggering host immune response, immunosuppressive agents given chronically to these patients might restrict such response, eventually reducing the efficacy of the vaccine . An example is the case of people w ith multiple sclerosis who are considered at high risk for COVID -19-related complications and at increased risk of disease relapse induced by the infection (Capone et al ., 2023). Needle- free vaccines . Most people dislike getting a needle in their arm, so the idea of getting a vaccine in a puff of nasal spray sounds attractive in terms of social acceptance, particularly for children . Beyond this, there are signs (Tang et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2022) that intranasal vaccines may be better than ordinary vaccines at preventing respiratory viruses from spreading between people because they induce an immune response concentrated in the mucosal tissues of the airways, where the C OVID -19 virus enters the body . According to an expert opinion 36, there are at least 12 nasal vaccines that are in clinical development, and 4 have reached phase 3 randomi sed, placebo -controlled trials, with promising results. However, w hile for an intramuscular COVID -19 33 A pan -betacoronaviruses vaccine would be against betacoronaviruses that includes the original SARS -CoV -1, and MERS -CoV, as well as the pandemic SARS -CoV -2, some of the seasonal coronaviruses that cause common colds in people, and several other coronaviruses that circulate widely in bats . There are ongoing studies testing pan- betaCoV vaccines, but details on the vaccine inserts are Universal Coronavirus Vaccines \u2014 An Urgent Need, New England Journal of Med icine Prof. G. Remuzzi by the PI. IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 46 vaccine it is easier to assess the effectiveness , measuring the neutralizing -antibody levels circulating in the blood, for mucosal vaccines the measuring of immune responses is not straightforward (Waltz, 2022; T opol and Iwasaki, 2022) . Nasal vaccine technology is still relatively new and , therefore, further trials to study the immune response of such vaccines and their overall effectiveness are needed . Comparative studies: Safety of vaccines approved by the major agencies is overall good , and adverse events are rare and, in most cases, allow full recovery. However, s ince not all plat forms cause the same reactions, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms according to which the vaccines cause side effects, in conjunction with the identification of the vaccine components and/or platforms that are responsible of these reactions in terms of pharmacovigilance, could probably enable the improvement of future vaccines against COVID -19 and/or even other pathological conditions , as highlighted by one of the interview ed experts . Stabilisation of vaccines: the cold chain particularly for mRNA vaccines preservation is challenging, particularly in countries with frequent electricity interruptions. CEPI has launche d a call for ne w ways to preserve the vaccines 37. The list is not exhaustive but representative of the open research questions . 3.3.3. Market mechanisms and possible failures Several of the above -mentioned issues would require R&D strategies that are not in the immediate interest of the industry to self -fund and perform. A previous study for the European Parliament (Florio et al ., 2021 ; Florio and Gamba, 2021 ) has identified six structural market and policy failures in pharmaceutical R&D. They are briefly recalled below , where it is also argued why they are relevant to COVID -19 vaccines. Disconnection between corporate R&D choices and public health priorities : The industry has been successful in providing a portfolio of vaccines against SARS -CoV- 2 in a very short time. This result stands on the shoulders of more than two decades of substantial intellectual contributions by public and not -for-profit entities. Concerning the mRNA technology, t he public contribution include s specific intramural and extramural programs of the NIH-NIAID, and discoveries at the University of Pe nnsylvania, which were instrumental to the development of both the Moderna and Pfizer -BioNTech vaccines (see Lalani et al. (2021) and Florio (2022 )). For the viral vector- based vaccines, previous research conducted at the University of Oxford was, for instance, essential to developing the Oxford -AstraZeneca vaccine. Moreover, several more traditional inactivated virus vaccines worldwide were developed by scientists in public research institutes and only later produced and distributed by companies (Wouters et al., 2021 ). In fact, most established companies have divested R&D on vaccines and infectious diseases in the last decades (Taghreed et al., 2019; PharmaProjects, 2020) and they rushed on the COV ID-19 arena when the business case became highly favorable. Even such rush was sustained by exceptional disbursement of public money in various forms and other de- risking mechanisms , as documented in the previous sections. Hence, with only a small number o f exceptions (an example is the vaccine candidate by Hipra, a Spanish 'outsider' company specializing in veterinary medicine), established companies were substantially incentivi sed to deliver vaccines by governments, international institutions, and not -for-profit long -term public and private investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines 47 PE 740.072 Mismatch between open science in the public sector and patents protecting the investors: The business model of the pharmaceutical industry for COVID -19 vaccine s heavily relies on the 'legal monopoly' provided by filing a patent or family of patents. The traditional aim of patent legislation is to counterbalance the private incentives of legal monopoly with an obligation to publicly disclose information on invent ions in the patent files. This disclosure in principle would create a positive externality, as the social value of a patent would be greater than its private value because third parties would benefit from such public information. However, this disclosure mechanism has limited scope because trade secrets remain de facto undisclosed. This fact was evident in the case of the Moderna vaccine. Moderna announced it would not start legal actions against imitators of its vaccine , but refused to collaborate with the mRNA hub that the WHO has established in South Africa. 38 The intellectual property model adopted by pharmaceutical companies has contributed to inequitable access to COVID -19 vaccines and has created a public debate about the need for a COVID -19 intellectual property waiver, a view shared by the majority vote of the European Parliament39, and by initiatives supported by over one hundred countries at the WTO (Foss -Solbrekk, 2021). The protection granted by patents is even more disproportionate considering the increasing diffusion of open science practices in fundamental research, primaril y funded by public money, providing free access to a wealth of scientific results to private companies. An example is the immediate availability of the SARS- CoV- 2 genome in the public domain after its sequencing in China and deposi t to the GenBank (Wu et a l., 2020) . In the legislation or actual practice, there is n o systematic policy frameworks to deal with the protection of the public interest when a combination of open science upstream, government subsidies to R&D, patents, and market authorization leads to unaffordable prices and scarcity of medicines in specific fields . Excessive rents for financial investors in the industry . The issue of expensive drugs and high profitability of the pharmaceutical industry has attracted the attention for example by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO, 2017) and others respected economic analysts (see, e.g., Ledley et al., 2020; The Economist, 2019). Even after discounting for R&D expenditures and risk s, the return on sales and other financial performance ind icators from official company reports signal that the pharma industry is highly profitable . Negotiated prices for COVID -19 vaccines are, in most cases, unknown, as well as the marginal cost and the average cost per dose. Thus, income earned by sales of COVID -19 vaccines is also unknown, but a back of the envelope calculation suggests it is extremely high. According to the ECA (2022) , the average price of COVID -19 vaccine doses acquired by the European Commission until December 2021 was EUR 15. The first A PA between the EU and Moderna and the EU and AstraZenec a mention a price of EUR 2.90/dose for the la tter company, and at USD 22.90/dose for the f ormer. 40 Kates et al. (2022 ) estimates the US federal government has paid Pfizer and Moderna USD 19.50 per dose and USD 15.25 per dose, respectively . Concerning the average cost per dose, the Imperial College researchers (Kis and Rizvi, 2021) estimate the cost per dose for mRNA vaccines to be about USD 1.18 for Pfizer/BioNTech and USD 2.85 for Moderna41, which would generate huge profits if compared with these price s per dose The report from People's Vaccine Alliance provides example of prices charged by different companies to different countries. Pfizer/ BioNTech is said to charge the lowest price of USD 6.75 to the African Union and the highest price of USD 28 a dose to Israel . Moderna IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 48 Given the total EC purchase expenditure of EUR 71 billion reported by the European Court of Auditors (ECA ) at EUR 15 av erage price per dose, income of the order of tens of billions have been earned by investors and extracted from European taxpayers in less than two years. Corporate taxation may have recouped ex -post some extra -profits, but to a limited extent and not mainly for the EU taxpayers, given that US -based companies had the lions' share in the market, and consequently in the income earned from the contracts. Private profits may further increase since, following the Biden Administration announcement to prepare for the transition of COVID -19 vaccines to the commercial market , some compa nies have indicated a prospect price increase up to 1 30 USD per dose without evidence of corresponding increased costs .42 Oligopolistic market power on the supply side, and issues of access and affordability . The current market landscape of approved COVID -19 vaccines shows a highly skewed distribution: an oligopolistic core with a fringe of companies. This market structure may contribute in the future to high vaccine prices, which, in turn, may create affordabi lity problems for patients and sustainability of healthcare systems, particularly, but not only , in less developed economies . To the best of our knowledge, n o competitive mechanism has been put in place . For example, we have not been able to spot any intention by governments and international authorities to recur to competitive bids for procurement43, even among those COVID -19 vaccines that are based on similar technologies or when the effectiveness varies from vaccine to vaccine. Cost- effectiveness of vacci nes is something which deserves attention . The price of vaccines per dose differs by orders of magnitude, from USD 3-4 for Oxford -Astra Zeneca vaccines to over USD 100 USD according to Pfizer communication to investors for future sales. Hence, the implied cost -effectiveness , e.g., the deaths avoided per Euro spent acros s available vaccines, also varies hugely. Inadequate optimisation studies after market authorisation . While companies have the incentives to invest money in preparing clinical trials and other studies to support their applications for marketing authorisations, they have no incentive to perform comparative clinical trials and 'real life' studies after a drug has been authori sed (Lacombe et al ., 2019) , especially if they include post - authorisation comparisons across medicines, including those of competitors . Since these aspects are relevant in a public health perspective, regulators may try to convince companies to perform long -term studies, or they can commission such studies from third parties. The first approach may not be successful for lack of incentives. The second approach has been implemented, so far, only in a non- systematic and often voluntary manner by non- commercial entities , as suggested by the analysis of existing clinical trials for COVID -19 vaccines .44 Clearly, there are statistical di fficulties in offered South Africa a price between USD 30 -42 a dose. Colombia has paid twice the price paid by the US for Moderna vacci nes. Senegal said it paid around USD 20 a dose for Sinopharm vaccines. 42 Pfizer indicated that the expected commercial price per dose for its vaccine is in the range of USD 110 -130: https://s28.q4cdn.com/781576035/files/doc_downloads/2022/10/IDWeek22/P FE-USQ_Transcript_2022 -10-20.pdf , while Moderna has suggested a commercial price between USD 82 and USD 100 per dose: https://s29.q4cdn.com/435878511/files/doc_presentations/2022/09/Moderna -Final -R-D-Day -Slides_PDF- (09.08.22).pdf . 43 While negotiated procedures can be inevitable in case of extreme urgency, in normal times, competitive bids for procurement help governments spur competition, which is a crucial element in price setting since it naturally leads to price decreases. The ob jective of international competitive bidding, or open tendering, is to provide potential bidders an equal opportunity to participate in the tend er procurement system. Awards should be based on the most attractive offer from suppliers who meet the tender provisions regardi ng quality, price, and additional supplier services (e.g. speed, cold chain logistics, and supply security). If the creation of a competitive environment for procurement next -generation COVID -19 vaccines seem too far -fetched, pull mechanisms in the form of Ad vance Market Commitments should at least be considered. These are commitments to suppliers as a group rather than bilateral contracts with individual firms (such as APA). They aim to incentivize suppliers by promising to buy an agreed quantity of qualifyin g products at a fixed price without committing specific volumes to particular suppliers (for a discussion see e.g. Towse et al., 2021; Thornton et al. 2020). In principle, Advance Market Commitments can also differentiate the reward to reflect quality diff erences between products (see for instance the proposal of Chalkidou et al., 2020). 44 Available at: https:// Covid -19 - living NMA initiative .

Information asymmetries in the public procurement . Pharmaceutical companies have no interest in sharing information on the cost structure of R&D, or the production and distribution cost. Hence, most public authorities have limited data to ascertain whether their public procurement arrangements, including the l ong -term resilience of production capacity in a country, are efficient. The pandemic has revealed and confirmed some structural failures of market arrangements and current policies in this area. New policy options should be considered for the future. 3.3.4. Polic y options Betting on a benign evolution of the COVID -19 pandemic does not seem in compliance with a precautionary principle from a health policy perspective. In spite of the current global data pointing to endemic disease with low fatality rate (worldwide 1% deaths out of confirmed infections, seven times less than at peak in March 202045), four out of five ECDC scenarios suggest that the future impact of COVID -19 will be non -negligible in terms of stress on the health system because of hospitali sations, vac cination demand, and medical assistance demand, particularly for the elderly and other patients at risk. Given the demographic structure of the EU in the next decade, this is not a minor challenge. According to Eurostat data, i n early 2018 , there were 101.1 million older people (aged 65 years or more) living in the 28 EU countries, which is 19.7% of the total population (Eurostat, 2019) . According to latest data, in 2021, more than one- fifth (20.8 %) of the EU population was aged 65 or more and the share of people aged 80 years or above in the EU's population is projected to have a two and a half fold increase between 2021 and 2100, from 6.0 % to 14.6 %.46 Hence, even in the more limited perspective of health threats for the higher- risk population, the forecast that SARS -CoV -2 will be around for at least the next ten years calls for sustained attention . Particularly for vaccination, given that, until now, other medical remedies, including antiviral drugs, played a limited role. Moreover, even in the endemic scenario, the impact of a pathology , year by year affecting a non -negligible part of the population , has socio -economic consequences in terms of absence from work and assistance to relatives. In this regard, t he global burden of pediatric COVI D- 19 is potentially not insignificant as well (Kaslow et al ., 2022) . The crucial question is, therefore, whether , in a scenario of the continued need for vaccinations globally with high priority for older people and those with co- morbidity, there is a need for further R&D on COVID -19 vaccines . The currently available vaccine portfolio has limitations that cannot be ignored. The most important one is the drop of antibodies over a relatively short time and their limited resilience to virus mu tations, particularly those mutations changing the spike glycoprotein (since most existing vaccines activate the immune system with the spike glycoprotein as the target). By looking at the clinical trials submitted for registration by current and potential new players, it seems clear that the industry will continue to invest in the R&D of adapted vaccines . Nowadays, the size and profitability of the COVID -19 vaccine market are considerable (even if not without risk for some companies). Hence, most experts d o not 45 see https://ourworldindata.org/mortality -risk-covid 46 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics -explained/index.php?title=Population_structure_and_ageing . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 50 expect a need for a new \"Warp Speed\" size operation in the range of billions of Euros of subsidies to the industry to push it to invest in R&D and new production capacity. However, the industry is unlikely to deploy the effort needed on all or most of the research avenues previously discussed (see section 3.3.2) , particularly if this would imply abandoning previous corporate investment when new solutions may risk crowding ou t established market dominance. After all, one can assume that a company would develop selected projects based on its business case and not mainly on public health considerations. Moreover, there are lessons to be learned from the recent past for what concerns the European scenario . Namely: avoid fragmentation and duplication of funding of R&D on COVID -19 vaccines . In the US, the yearly budget of NIH in 2021 was USD 43 billion47 (Sekar, 2022), while the budget of BARDA48 for pandemic preparedness in normal times is USD 1.5 -2 billion per year, out of which about USD 550 million for advanced research and development and USD 300 million for pandemic , and this is part of wider HHS department frame.49 In Europe, the lack of a p an-European major public research institute has the undesirable consequence that for vaccine science (as for the rest of biomedical research), grants of relatively small size are disbursed by several players with very limited coordination among them, both at EU 50 and at the level of the Member States.51 Thus, there is the risk that no program reaches the necessary critical mass to orientate private R&D investments. With the launch of HERA and the forthcoming Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda52 for pande mic preparedness , the situation may improve, but probably not dramatically. Indeed, HERA 's funding mechanisms suffer significant vulnerabilities (see box 9). 47 From FY2016 through FY2022, NIH has seen funding increases each year. In 2016 the budget was USD 32.3 billion, in 2022 USD 46.1 billion (Congressional Research Services. 2022. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Funding: FY1996 -FY2023). 48 It is within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Ser vices . 49 https://aspr.hhs.gov/AboutASPR/BudgetandFunding/Pages/BudgetandFundingFY2021.aspx . 50 One cluster out of six of the EU Research Framework Programme for 2021 -2027 is specifically dedicated to health. Such cluster also support the Innovative Health Initiative, a public -private partnership aimed at supporting pre -competitive research for products or solutions that respond to unmet public health needs and that can be implemented into healthcare systems. The resources availa ble to IHI are up to EUR 1.2 billion provided by the Horizon Europe Health Cluster, at least EUR 1.0 billion provided by the member industry associations, and up to EUR 200 million from Contributing Partners (source: Innovative Health Initiative, 2022). The work pro gramme for 2023 of the EU4Health Programme provides EUR 100 million to Thematic Innovation - Research, Innovation and Digitalisation Window financial product (more specifically, in the policy area '1.1 Health innovation investment') implemented by the EIB under the InvestEU Fund. The aim is to support investments into R&D of medical countermeasures for pandemic preparedness, in particular into vac cines and other preventive interventions, therapeutics, and diagnostics. HERA will cooperate with EIB for the successful implementation of the action. The work programme for 2023 of the EU4Health Programme also provides EUR 84 million to s upport HERA to speed up the development of, access to and/or uptake of innovative technologies and critical medicines . 51 The fragmentation of the health research system is also recognised in the by the Innovative Health Initiative (see IHI, 2022). 52 In 2023, HERA, together with other Commission's services and in cooperation with Member States, will be involved in the preparatory phase of the EU Partnership on Pandemic Preparedness, which intends to develop a S trategic Research and Innovation Agenda for pandemi c preparedness by 2024. Mapping of long -term public and private investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines 51 PE 740.072 Box 9: The HERA arrangements in the domain of R&D promotion and funding : some issues Source: Authors, based on EC (2022), EC (2023); EP (2021), and Renda et al . (2023). In a previous study for the EP (2021), the creation of a European R&D infrastructure and delivery organisation for medicines was suggested. One of the options considered is to set up such infrastructure with a focus on infectious diseases at the sc ale, for example, of the European Space Agency (around EUR 7 billion in 202253, including contributions to specific missions by some participants ), and with independent governance delegated to the scientific community. This action would close the gap with the US in this area and terminate the current fragmented situation, by achieving over one hundred innovative products in 3 0 years in areas neglected by industry or where there are social affordability concerns because of high prices. 53 https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2022/01/ESA_budget_2022 . The total budget of HERA for 2022 amount ed to EUR 1.3 billion . Out of this, EUR 306.8 million were dedicated to promoting R&D (EC, 2022). In 2023, the total HERA's budget is 1.267, 6 million and includes contributions from EU4Health (EUR 242,75 million) , Horizon Europe (EUR 389 million) and UCPM/rescEU (EUR 636 milli on) Programmes . Out of this, EUR 474.6 million (of which about EUR 390 comes from Horizon Europe ) are dedicated to p romoting advanced R&D of medical countermeasures and related technologies (EC, 2023). HERA's activities in promoting R&D for medical countermeasures are mainly implemented via calls under Horizon Europe. The limited funding and the reliance on Horizon Europe calls generate some weaknesses. First, Horizon Europe calls have a fairly limited duration of funding, i.e. 3 to 5 years. They are mainly focused on comparatively short -term impacts (diagnostic devices, etc.), rather than on urgently needed horizon -scanning activities or on the long process of developing medical countermeasures . Second, HERA's R&D funding is constrained by Horizon Eu rope rules (e.g. consortia must usually be composed of at least three organisations, funding is allocated via open competitive calls, priorities are defined in biannual programmes agreed through the comitology procedure and there are geographical limitatio ns to projects). Third, HERA's ability to allocate funding more flexibly and in fast -track when needed is strongly limited (e.g. , in comparison with BARDA). Allocating larger sums of money in a single call or grant, or focusing the scope of calls on certai n technologies or research areas will therefore be difficult for HERA. Fourth, the scientific independence to set the priorities of the research agenda, activities, and outputs might not be guaranteed, since HERA currently relies on an external advisory fo rum composed of experts that can provide scientific advice, when needed (a strategic agenda for research and innovation needs and gaps for pandemic preparedness will be ready for 2024) . The current arrangement is different from a governance where the scientific community is empowered of a co -decision process. Finally , the scale of funding provided altogether by Horizon Europe calls and EU4Health programmes to HERA does not match the funding needs required to support R&D for a new vaccine, a new drug or a new technology (on average may require EUR 1 billion per each project). IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 52 Box 10: Portfolio approach Source: Authors based on BARDA's Expanding, COVID-19 Medical Countermeasure Portfolio and Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit, 2022. Even if initiated soon, the creation of such infrastructure would require several years to reach a consensus among Member States and possibly some non -EU partners. Hence, in the short term, the design of the current R&D funding mechanisms for coronavirus in the EU and the role of HERA should be reconsidered . The latter should evolve into a n autonomous science -based agency - without the constraint to leverage on different funds - with , among others, the potential to drive the COVID -19 vaccine landscape. Currently, in fact, the fund ing of future R&D on COVID -19 vaccines remains disbursed by different actors and program s54, that evolve along different legal basis, management styles, and timing. Ensure p ublic support for late development of the next generation COVID -19 vaccines or vaccines protecting against unknown coronaviruses. While i n the first two phases of vaccine development the financing is well covered by government s and investors such as CEPI, some private foundation, PATHS and others, in the third stage, which actually a ccounts for about 70% of total development costs, there is a big gap in financing (Yamey et al ., 2020). It cannot be expected that private companies alone invest in late development, especially when there is not a clear market to serve. Previous own negati ve experience on vaccines may also determine the reluctance of some pharmaceutical companies to join the race of new vaccine developments. Therefore, 54 See footnote 51. A possible criticism of the proposal to create a European public infrastructure for biomedical R&D is that the pandemic has shown the difficulty of determining in advance which vaccine would be the most effective and timely. The US BARDA and the German gov ernment are two cases in point. For example, BARDA's COVID -19 medical countermeasure portfolio includes 105 products, of which eight were vaccines. Among others , they supported the Sanofi -GSK recombinant protein vaccine, which was initially unsuccessful, a nd the Merck -IAVI vaccine project, which was then cancelled. Another example is the German government's decision to initially support BioNTech and CureVac vaccines . The latter was then withdrawn. In 2022, the German Government reinforced its partnership wi th five companies (BioNTech; CureVac/GSK; Wacker/CordenPharma; Celonic; and IDT Dessau) in the form of a fee for production capacity until 2029 possibly also for new pandemic episodes, with a contract of EUR 2.861 billion. Hence, the German government is b etting on different players for the next generation vaccines . The lesson to be learned from the BARDA and German government story of support to vaccine R&D is that failures are part of the scientific landscape and , therefore, public support, in whatever fo rm, cannot focus just one project, or even to avoid any support to R&D because of the risk of failure. Thus, should European institutions take the bold step to create a European R&D infrastructure and delivery organisation for medicines , a portfolio approach with competing candidates screened and recommended by the scientific community could be developed under one roof. A portfolio approach is different from duplications and fragmentation of resources that we have noticed in the current EU context, where a plethora or relatively small projects are funded with public money, either by the Member S tates or by EC managed programs, without a unique place where a comparative appraisal of scientific merits is done by an expert body empowered to do so , as, by compar ison happens at CERN or EMBL. Mapping of long -term public and private investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines 53 PE 740.072 ensuring consistent funding during the whole process of vaccine development is essential. In the US, NIH s upport s basic research and potentially phase 1 of clinical trials , then BARDA carr ies out phase 2, and if possible, phase 3. BARDA also supports the scale up and manufacturing process. Current HERA arrangements miss a solid and agile mechanism to ensure in teraction with research institutes and the private sector , an element that proved essential, inter alia, for BARDA's successful handling of R&D during the COVID -19 pandemic (Renda et al ., 2023) . Should the European Union want to have a prominent role in supporting the development of future coronavirus vaccines , as well as to fill existing gaps in unmet clinical needs , and be prepared for high- impact health threats,55 it should invest reasonable funding to directly address area s where the disconnection betw een corporate R&D and public health needs is larger. According to interviewed experts, investments on the scale of EUR hundreds of millions would be needed to support phase 2 and phase 3 studies (and billions for a portfolio approach of vaccines and medical counter measures on selected pathogens ). Create a favorable regulatory and infrastructural environment for clinical trials in Europe . Another peculiarity of Europe is the difficulty to conduct clinical trials. The difficulty has three roots. First, volunteers are needed for conducting trials , and these volunteers should be preferably na\u00efve56, which is almost impossible to find in Europe. The second difficulty has a regulatory nature. Until 2022, each clinical tr ial had to be approved by each Member State. This creates a very cumbersome and lengthy process. In 2014, a new Regulation on clinical trials57 was adopted to introduce a coordinated approval, but its application only started in January 2023 due to technical difficulties with the development of the IT systems . The Regulation introduces an authorisation procedure based on a single submission via a single EU portal, an assessment procedure leading to a single decision, rules on the protection of subjec ts and informed consent, and transparency requirements. The new Regulation will make it easier for pharmaceutical companies and scientists to conduct multinational clinical trials, which should increase the number of studies conducted within the EU. The ethical review of the trial remains a separate process to be conducted by each country in accordance with its laws . However, a time limit of 60 days has been introduced for the ethics committee s to express their opinion ; after that, the trial is considered a pproved. Although the Regulation is expected to overcome some of the bottlenecks experienced in the past, the interviewed stakeholders expressed concerns about the functioning of the Clinical Trial Information System 58 and the limits imposed on the use of i ndividual pat ient data. The third difficulty relates to rivalry to perform clinical trials between universities and hospitals and among hospitals, since in some countries the Ministry of Health grant s extra money based on the research activity. Such a system disincentivise s collaboration. The incentive provided by the EU Research Framework Programme to run multinational clinical trials does not help since the funding is in the range of EUR 100 million per year. Although funding for VACCELERATE pl atform will be ensured in the next years, the difficulty of conducting clinical trials will not be settled unless action is taken to address its three roots. 55 The Intelligence Gathering and Threat Assessment Medical Countermeasures Intelligence Platform will establish and regularly update a list of high- impact health threats requiring medical countermeasures preparedness and map and analyse existing and developing medical countermeasures, and remaining gaps. 56 A na\u00efv e volunteer is someone who has been neither exposed to the virus nor to the vaccine. 57 REGULATION (EU) No 536/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 16 April 2014 on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC . 58 It has been explained that the system does not allow for more than one amendment of the trial at a time. Since it takes two m onths to get an approval for a new amendment, it means that it is possible to make one amendment every tw o or three months. IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 54 Careful examination , in the public health interest, of the conditionalities of future R&D grants a nd de -risk mechanisms. A new policy framework is needed to avoid future vaccine science supported by the taxpayer will be fully privati sed without any guarantees concerning intellectual property rights (IPR) , equitable distribution, and affordable prices. During the pandemic the negotiations were conducted under pressure and in a context of asymmetric information. The current landscape would instead allow fairer arrangements between funds' providers and beneficiaries, including the possibility that IPR and licensing power are attributed , fully or partly, to public institutions that supported R&D . The agreements with companies should be done in much more transparent way , in more stable legal framework, in order to offer clear guidelines to the stakeholde rs and accountability to citizens. Mapping of long -term public and private investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines 55 PE 740.072 CONCLUSIONS Although information on public funding for R&D and the expansion of the production capacity for the manufacturing of COVID -19 vaccines is generally publicly available, this is, by nature, very fragmented. Indeed, a large number of different actors took part in the generalised effort to develop new vaccines for the novel threat and to produce billions of doses in a very short time span . On the other si de, almost all pharmaceutical companies have not disclosed figures regarding corporate R&D investments for COVID -19 vaccines since these data are considered confidential . However, information on the source of funding for COVID -19 vaccines, the amount of fu nds, and their timing is crucial to understand where the stimulus to innovation came from, as well as the distribution of risks. This , in theory, should have important implications in terms of accessibility to vaccines and redistribution of the returns, as well as equity . Moreover, it is strongly relevant to design informed policies for the development of , and access to , new medical countermeasures in the future, especially in the area of unmet clinical needs (including, among others, antimicrobials and dru gs for rare diseases) .59 Lastly, it is important in order to grant transparency and to account for public expenditures to taxpayers. For these reasons, this study attempts to provide a clearer picture of the funding for the development and the expansion of production capacities granted to a sample of COVID -19 vaccines, and in particular to shed light on the role of the European Union. It does so for the seven vaccines authorised for use in the EU (Comirnaty, from Pfizer and BioNTech; COVID Pasteur), while providing information also for COVID -19 Vaccine H ipra (currently under rolling review, it would be the only vaccine entirely developed and produced in Europe and for this reason it has been analysed in the study), and CVnCoV from CureVac (although it has been withdrawn from rolling review, it received important public financing, thus being relevant for the analy sis). To reach this goal, data from different publicly available sources were gathered through desk research and were subsequently complemented and double- checked through 20 interviews involving 30 expert stakeholders : representatives of pharmaceutical companies ; public health experts and scientists from the EU and the US ; and public institutions. Importantly, data presented may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies due to the lack of official data (mainly on corporate investments) and inconsistency among sources; for these reasons, results should be considered a best -attempt estimate. Our results point out that, although revenues from COVID -19 vaccines were fully privati sed, external funds provided during the pandemic were critically important, with gr ants per vaccine of about EUR one billion, with a surprisingly high variance across companies. If, in addition to funding for R&D and the expansion of production capacities, also APAs are considered as an incentive, the role of external funds becomes even more significant (nearly EUR 30 billion). This result is further reinforced if previous funding for basic research subsequently exploited to develop the vaccines (not considered in this study ) would be taken into account. 59 Several public incentives have been proposed to stimulate R&D in this area, and in particular for antimicrobials, whose devel opment represents the next challenge for the public sector (given the low profitability of these drugs for firms, and their importance for public health). In this context, HERA has commissioned further analysis of an annual revenue guarantee to stimulate antibiotic innovation, while the EC is expected to include transferable exclusivity vouchers in the proposed revision of the pharmaceutical legislation, expected in March 2023 (Ardal et al., 2023). The evaluation of each incentive scheme should consider its cost for the public sector, as w ell as its impact on innovation, accessibility, the market of generics and biosimilars, and the sustainability for health care systems. IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 740.072 56 External funds are mainly provided by the public sector ( over 80%), through grants, loans and APAs, while the remaining part is financed by philanthropic entities, third part y private companies (to be noted that private investments from third parties in the form of venture capital have not been considered ), public -private partnerships and the EIB. This implies that governments played a central role as a major partner of private firms in the development of vaccines, although the amount of public fundings, the type of funds, as well as the sh are of public funding over corporate ones, strongly vary from company to company. Among governments, the US and the UK ones are by far the largest funders of vaccines' R&D (not considering China, Russia and other countries). The role of the EU and its Memb er States was overall marginal to support R&D . If also funds for the extension of the production capacity are considered, the share of cumulated funding provided by the EU and its Member States increase thanks to the German support to BioNTech. EIB also gr anted some loans for R&D and extension of the production capacity. If also APAs are considered, the US government and the EU lead public financing for the vaccines we have considered in our sample of evidence, since they account for the majority of the tra cked APAs funding in developed economies . While the US government extensively used all financing incentives to support vaccine development, the EU mainly contributed through APAs, signed on behalf of Member States. The EU strategy secured enough vaccines f or the EU citizens and fair distribution of vaccines within the EU (at high price relative to marginal cost), and to a certain extent contributed to vaccination efforts in low - middle - income countries . External funds to R&D and manufacturing, as well as APAs, were very salient in 2020, decreasing in 2021. These results highlight that external funding played a fundamental role in the development and manufacturing of COVID -19 vaccines. This should not surprise: given their low returns in the past and the hi gh risk associated with their development, vaccines (as well as other areas of research sharing the same characteristics, such as orphan drugs) often suffer from underinvestment from the pharmaceutical industry. External funds and the tools implemented to finance R&D and manufacturing played an important de -risking role, shifting part of the risk from private firms to the public sector, consequently increasing the returns for the pharmaceutical companies. According to interviewed experts, COVID -19 is here t o stay, and further R&D is required in order to improve vaccines for what concerns the resilience to virus mutations and more durable immunity . Further studies on under- investigated topics on existing vaccines, as well as comparative studies, are also needed. Since, as mentioned above, vaccines represent a salient example of the mismatch between corporate R&D choices and public health priorities, and comparative studies hold no interest for pharmaceutical companies, public intervention will still be needed in these areas of research (as well as on other pandemic risks), as confirmed by the experts. In this context, to ensure that health challenges are tackled equitably, and that rewards are in line with the distribution of risks, conditionalities of future R&D grants and de- risking mechanisms should be scrupulously detailed. IPR arrangements should take into account the role of public funds, and pricing policies should reflect previous public R&D investments and support . Similarly, clauses to ensure supply security should be carefully listed. A stable legal environment is also in the long -term interest of the competitiveness of the European industry . If the EU wants to play a prominent role in supporting the development of future coronavirus vaccines, fragmentation and duplication of funding should be avoided . Moreover, as mentioned, a stable and clear legal EU framework for corporate R&D support on COVID -19 vaccines (and more broadly on vaccines for pathogens with pandemic potential) should be designed and a favorable regulatory and Mapping of long -term public and private investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines 57 PE 740.072 infrastructural environment for conducted clinical trials within the EU should be pursued . In the short term, the design and role of HERA should be revised to ensure it possibly becomes an autonomous entity with its own budget. HERA is burdened with being the flagship of the EU's capacity to react to future pandemics. Still, its leverage in terms of legal instruments, political consensus, and funding is not yet proportionate to its ambition. As suggested by a STOA study (Florio et al ., 2021), i n the long run, the creation of a pan -European R&D infrastructure and delivery organi sation focusing on threats and areas of re search and development that are underinvested under the current business model should be considered. The infrastructure should have the budgetary scale and scientific ambition of the US NIH, and be equipped with home -grown research and development capacity, with a combined effort of the EU institutions and the Member States.

INTERVIEW QUESTIONNAIRE S Questionnaire for companies 1 Did your company has received funds in the form of grants to support R&D for Covid -19 vaccine from the following entities: European Commission One or more EU Member States One or more non- EU Member States Other entities, such as charities, international bodies (such as CEPI and IVI) For each entity, please specify donating body, time and amount. 2 Please describe the conditions attached to such grants and problems if any encountered in the process, such as 'red -tape' issues. 3 Would you say that such support to R&D was critically important? 4 Did your company enter in an Advance Purchase Agreement (APA) with the European Commission and/or with an EU Member State? Please describe the conditions attached to such APAs and problems if any encountered in the process, such as 'red -tape' issues. 5 Would you say that such APAs were critically important to speed up R&D or production of vaccines? 6 Did yo ur company receive loans or other form of support from European Investment Bank (EIB) or other multilateral development banks? How would you describe the impact of these financial mechanisms in the perspective of accelerating R&D and production of vaccines ? 7 What is the total amount of R&D expenditure by year on Covid -19 vaccines by your company? 8 In which countries is the main intramural research and development of Covid -19 vaccines being performed by your company? How many researchers are involved within the company respectively in the EU and outside? Do you perform extramural R&D in the EU with Universities, CROs, other companies and institutes? 9 Similarly, in which countries is the majority of the respectively past and current investments in Covid -19 vaccines production capacities being made? 10 How much was invested, and how much continues to be invested by your company overall for Covid -19 vaccines? 11 Much of the current research seems to concentrate on adapting existing COVID -19 vaccines to the fast mutatio ns of the virus. Which level of investment will be needed for this ongoing adaptation? 12 Is there still a need for substantial public funding for R&D of Covid -19 vaccines? Questionnaire for experts & decision makers 1 Several companies received funds to support R&D on Covid -19 vaccines by European Commission (EC), one or more EU Member States, one or more non- EU Member States, other entities (e.g. charities, international bodies such as CEPI and IVI). Would you say that such Mapping of long -term public and private investments in the development of COVID -19 vaccines 67 PE 740.072 support to R&D was critically important to increase speed and effectiveness of vaccine discovery? 2 What are (if any) the lessons learned from public funding of Covid -19 vaccines R&D? Should conditions on patents, prices, delivery mechanisms have been attached to public support of R&D? 3 Some companies entered in an Advance Purchase Agreement (APA) with the European Commission and/or with an EU Member State. Would you say that such APAs were critically important to speed up R&D or production of vaccines? Should better conditions have been negotiated? 4 Do you evaluate that the amount and mechanisms of public support to the development of Covid -19 vaccines was overall adequate in terms of proportionality with the outcome? Too much tax -payers money or too li ttle? 5 Much of the current research seems to concentrate on adapting existing COVID -19 vaccines to the fast mutations of the virus. Do you think that the current R&D landscape is adequate to manage future challenges or that radically innovative R&D avenues are needed? 6 Is there still a need for substantial public funding for R&D of Covid -19 vaccines or companies have already sufficient market incentives? 7 Do you have further advice on public support to R&D on Covid -19 vaccines looking at the future of the pa ndemic?
