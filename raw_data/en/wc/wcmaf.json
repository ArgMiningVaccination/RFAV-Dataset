This programme will ult imately target all children 2 -16 years of age with the aim of not only directly protecting the children themselves, but also protecting the remainder of the population ( ie the vulnerable elderly) by red ucing transmission in the population . This document describes and reports on the cumulative uptake of influenza vaccine in children of primary school age during the 2015 to 2016 influenza vaccine season , with a focus on the results from the final end of season data submitted to Public Health England at school -level between March -April 2016 . The school -level data returns presented in this report include analysis on consents, refusals, contraindications, and population level ecological predictors of low vaccine uptake . The overall uptake in school years 1 and 2 was 55.1% in those areas using a school delivery model and 30.1% for those using a primary care/pharmacy model . The o verall uptake in pilot areas for children in school years 1 -6 was 55.6%, with a pattern of decreasing uptake with increasing age. Ecological population level predictors of uptake found that lower uptake in both children of school years 1 and 2 age across England and children school years 1 to 6 in pilot areas was significantly and ind ependently associated with both increasing deprivation and ethnicity . The lowest uptake was reported in the most deprived deciles of deprivation or areas with the largest proportion of black or minority ethnic groups. Childhood Flu Vaccination Programme, England 2015 to 2016 5 Background Seasonal influenza is a very common infection among infants and children . Health y children under five years of age have the highest influenza hospital admission rates compared to other age -groups1. The United Kingdom (UK) has a long standing selective influenza vaccination programme targeted at all those 65 years and over, under 65 and in a clinical risk group, and pregnant women. Based on the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI ) in 2012 , England is i n the process of imple menting a universal paediatric influenza vaccination prog ramme to ultimately cover all children 2 -16 years of age2. The programme is being introduced incrementally across a number of influenza seasons. In 2013 to 20 14 vaccination against influenza with a newly licensed live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) was first offered nationally across the UK to all children aged two and three years of age through GP practices . Additionally Public Health England (PHE) commissioned a pilot vaccination programme to cover children of primary scho ol- age ( 4-11 years) . The programme ran in seven geographically distinct pilots areas (Bury, Cumbria, Gateshead, Newham, Havering, South East Essex, and Leicester *). The purpose of the pilots was to undertake an operational evaluat ion including of different modes of vaccine delivery, specifically school based vs . primary care delivery (GP practice/p harmacy). Pilot regions offered LAIV to healthy and at -risk children in whom the vaccine was not contraindicated. The pilot achie ved a final overall uptake of 52.5%, ranging from 35 .8% to 71.5% between individual pilot areas3. In 2014 to 20 15 the national programme was further extended to include vaccination of all children two to four years of age through GP practices . In addition the 2014 to 20 15 season saw the extension of the school -age pilot vaccination programme to 14 areas across England targeting a) primary school age children 4 -11 years of age , b) secondary school children aged 11 -13 years or c) both groups. Pilot a reas primarily delivered the programme through schools with the exception of two areas which used a pharmacy based model with GP involvement (Cumbria and Arden, Herefordshire and Worcestershire) . In addition , one local authority (LA) follow ed a primary care GP delivery model (Leed s). London , with the exception of Havering LA, covered special schools only. The pilot achieved a final uptake of 53.2% for children of primary and secondary school age children (4 -13 years)4. During the 2015 to 2016 vaccine ca mpaign all children in England of school years 1 and 2 age were offered influenza vaccine as well as children of school years 1 to 6 age in pilot areas. Cumulative school -level vaccine uptake data were manual ly submitted through ImmForm for all children of school age on a monthly basis. Vaccine uptake was recorded locally at school level and then reported to ImmForm by LA /Area T eam (AT) Childhood Influenza Vaccination Programme, England 2015 to 2016 6 and year group (Annexe A). At the end of the influenza season ( March -April), final vaccination data was collected at school -level across England and submitted to PHE including additional information on consen ts, refusals, and contraindications . *Leicester city, East Leicestershire and Rutland Methods End of season data for 2015 to 2016 were collected at a school -level and submitted to PHE between March -April 2016 by ATs. The majority of schools used a data collection tool created by PHE where data were entered for each child in the school. These data were aggregated into school totals which were provided to the LA. The end of season collection variables requested are outlined in Annexe B . Key indicators Uptake End-of-season programme uptake was calculated based on the number of children in the target population who were reported to have received at least one dose o f influenza vaccine during the campaign period ( 1 September 2015 until 31 January 2016 ). Second doses were not counted . The target population was defined as the number of primary school age children (5-7 years ) born between 1 September 2008 and 31 August 2010 eligible for vaccination across England as well as the number of primary school age children (5 -11 years) born between 1 September 2004 to 31 August 2010 resident in the selected pilot areas . Predictors of u ptake To assess how population level predictors may be associated with vaccine uptake , the postcode of each school and the urban/rural data were matched using the GeoConvert: UK Data Service Census Support tool to vario us predictors available at 2011 census Office for Nationa l Statistics (ONS )5. Data on religion, ethnicity by age, sex, and Lower Super Output Area level (LSOA ) were downloaded from Nomis (provided by the ONS)6. Religion and ethnicity predictors w ere calculated for those aged 0 to 15 years old. Each LOSA had a population range of 1,000 - 3,000 and were used to assess potential ecological associa tions with uptake7. The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is an overall score assigned to each LSOA summarising its relative level of deprivation based Childhood Influenza Vaccination Programme, England 2015 to 2016 7 on seven topi c areas: income, employment, health, education, crime, service access and living environment7. IMD scores were calculated and, based on the distribution, categorically grouped into deciles . Information on ethnic constitution of each LSOA is available acco rding to the following categories: White/Mixed/Asian/Black/Other8. The proportion of LSOA classified as belonging in a black or minority ethnic (BME, defined as non -white British ) categorically grouped into quartiles. Information on the religious constitu tion of each LSOA is available with the categories of Christian/Buddhist/Hindu/Jewish/Muslim/Sikh/Other/None9. Proportions were analysed, focusing on Jewish and Muslim because of the issues reported the previous season s around the use of porcine gelatine in the vaccine. The proportion of LSOA identifying as Jewish was grouped into 0% and >0% (95% of schools were in an area with Jewish population less than 1%) and Muslim into 0%, 1 -5% and 6%+. Classification of the LSOA as rural (Town and fringe/Village or hamlet/Isolated dwelling) or urban (Major conurbation/Minor conurbation/City and town) was available from the ONS 2011 census5. Vaccine uptake was calculated by each of these population characteristics. A l inear regression ana lysis was undertaken to assess whether any of the population characteristics were significantly related to uptake. Uptake in primary schools was linearly regressed against the sa me population -level variables (area , deprivation, ethnicity, rel igious constitution and rurality) to determine if changes in uptake could be explained. Variables significant in univariate analysis (p<0.01) were included in a multiple linear regression model to provide adjusted estimates and the m odel fit was assessed. This method was previously used by Green et. al10. Consent, refusal and n on-responders Parental consent forms for influenza vaccination were sent to parents through schools . The return of these forms was record ed by the school/ local authorities and information on consents, refusals, and no returns was submitted to PHE at the end of the season. Not all areas returned consent, refusal , and no return data and not a ll schools within each LA identified these groups consistently. Additionally, some are as merged consent/refusal/no return data for all vaccinating year groups. Consent - Calculated from number of consent forms returned by all children in a year group, divided by the final denominator for that year group. Consent is defined as direct parent al consent to vaccinate. In some cases consents include child ren who are contraindicated for vaccination with LAIV . Childhood Influenza Vaccination Programme, England 2015 to 2016 8 Refusal - Calculated from number of forms returned refusing consent by all children in a year group, divided by the final denominator for that year group. Refusal is recorded as direct refusal to vaccinate. In some cases refusals include children who are contraindicated for the vaccination with LAIV . No return - Calculated from the number of forms not returned in a year gro up (non - responders), divided by the final denominator for that year group. Non -responders were defined as parents that did not return consent forms whose children were subsequently not vaccinated. Non -responder counts were either provided by the school lev el data submission or calculated from the final denominator by subtracting the count of consents and refusals. No returns may also include children contraindicated for vaccination with LAIV . Contraindications Children contraindicated for vaccination with LAIV ( ie children in clinical risk groups) were identified prior t o the use of LAIV in the 2015 to 2016 study. Risk groups are clinically outlined in Green Book11. The numbers of children contraindicated for vaccination were recorded, and then aggregated by risk group. Contraindications were split into two groups: Prior Contraindication s and On -day Contraindications. The first describes pre -existing contraindications to vaccination that parents were aware of eg severe asthma . The second describes contraindications described on the day of vaccination eg a child being congested. Not all area recorded data for all risk groups, and not all schools within each pilot site identified risk groups consistent with the end o f season dat a return variables . Children contraindicated for vaccination with LAIV were either offered injectable quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine on site by providers or referred to their general practice for vaccination. Data l imitations It is important to note that there were differences in missing data and data return among the pilot areas in 2014 to 2015 and the 2015 to 2016 season. Years 1 and 2 across England A total of 127 LAs were included and 26 LAs were not included in the school age surveillan ce. Of these latter , data was not returned for 15 LAs, and there were eight LAs that used a GP delivery model and two LAs that used a pharmacy delivery mode l (Annex C) . Data for Bassetlaw and Nottinghamshire were collected independently . The remaining 126 LAs provided vaccine uptake at a school level, however, some areas were not accounted for due to missing information or when the numerator was greater than the denominator (Annex D). A total of 153 schools in London and eight school s in Childhood Influenza Vaccination Programme, England 2015 to 2016 9 South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw returned data for years 1 and 2 combined, therefore these schools were only assessed when combining years 1 and 2 data for the entire countr y. Pilot areas All 11 LAs in the pilot areas returned data. The schools in Havering LA either presented data for years 1 to 2, 3 to 6 or 1 to 6 combined . As a result the data were used for when assessing vaccine uptake by individual year group. Greater Manchester only provided data for school years 1 and 2, therefore vaccine uptake was not assessed for years 3 to 6 in this area and these year groups could not be compared to the other pilot areas. Uptake predictors For the linear regression anal yses of children of school years 1 and 2 age, a total of 11,073 of the 14,016 (79.0%) schools were used for analyses with 2,943 schools (21.0%) missing. A total of 11,073 were matched with IMD and urban/rural classifications while 2,262 schools were unable to be matched and could therefore not be used for analysing uptake predictors. A further 218 schools were unable to be matched to data on religion and ethnicity. For the linear regression analyses of child ren of school years 1 -6 age in p ilot areas, a total of 1,066 of 1,306 (81.6%) of schools were used for the analyses with 204 schools (18.4%) missing. A total of 1,066 schools were matched to IMD and urban/rural classifications while 240 schools were unable to be match ed. The same 240 schools could not b e matched to LSOA for religion and ethnicity class ifications. Results Uptake (school years 1 and 2 across England) A total of 8 2.4% (12 6/153) LAs used a school delivery model as their main mode of delivery returned data. Of these areas, an estimated 593,805 of 1,077,531 children of school years 1 and 2 age in England received at least one dose of influenza vaccine during the period 1 September 2015 t o 31 January 2016 in schools . Overall uptake for children in school year 1 and 2 age vaccina ted in schools in these areas was 55.1% with uptake ranging from 40.2% in London to 66.8% in North Yorkshire and Humber (Table 1) Childhood Influenza Vaccination Programme, England 2015 to 2016 10 A total of 5. 9% (9/153) LAs used a GP delivery model as their main mode of delivery. An estimated 32.9% (28,489 of 86,533) o f children of school years 1 and 2 age in England received at least one dose of influenza vaccine during the period of 1 September 2015 to 31 January 2016 by GP delivery models . Finally, a total of 1.3% (2/153) LAs used pharmacies as their main mode of del ivery. An estimated 16.1% (2,772/17,178) of children of school years 1 and 2 age in England received at least one dose of influenza vaccine during the period of 1 September 2015 to 31 January 2016 by pharmacy delivery models (Table 2) . The remaining 10.5% (16/153) LAs did not provide data for the analysis. These 16 LAs have an estimated population size of 147,085 children. Table 1.

Uptake by PHE region Vaccine uptake for children of school years 1 and 2 age vaccinated in schools in England varied across PHE regions . Uptake at school level ranged from 0 to 100%. In the North of England, of the 4 ,497 primary schools reporting vaccine uptake data for years 1 and 2 , the median uptake was 59.3 % (with int erquartile range of 47.1% to 69.9%). In London, of the 1,474 schools reporting vaccine uptake data for schools years 1 and 2, the median uptake was 41.7% (with i nterquartile range of 28.7% to 52.9%). In the Midlands and East, of the 5,694 schools that reporting vaccine uptake data for school years 1 and 2, the median uptake was 60.3% (with interquartile range of 49.2% to 70.1%). Finally, in the South of England, o f the 2,363 schools reporting vaccine uptake, the median uptake was 59.6% (with interquartile range of 50.0% to 68.8%) (Figure 1 ). Figure 1.

Areas with an ethnic population of 34% or more had a 22.0% lower uptake compared to areas with a minority population of <5%. The more deprived an area, the lower the uptake, with those in the least deprived decile of deprivation showing uptake 18.7% greater than those in the most deprived decile . In terms of religious beliefs, uptake w as 18 .2% lower when 6%+ of the LSOA population iden tified as Muslim relative to 0%, while a 4.0% lower vaccine uptake was observed if the LSOA contained Jewish residents compared to none . A lower uptake was seen in urban relative to rural areas, with a difference in uptake of 8.1% and an in crease was seen in pilot areas by 4.6% than in non -pilot areas . Finally, uptake by PHE region compared to the North of England indicate that uptake was not significantly higher in Midlands and East and the South of England . However, a significantly lower uptake was seen in London with a difference of 17.5% (Table 4). After ad justing for all area level characteristics in the multivariable regression analysis (Figure 3 ), the largest independent predictor was seen for deprivation. The association was strongest for tho se in the most deprived decile . Areas in least deprived decile of deprivation had a 14.8% higher uptake than those in the most deprived decile . Areas with a BME population of 34% or more had 9 .9% lower uptake compared to areas with a BME population of <5%. The association wi th Muslim populations decreased but remained significant. A reas with a Muslim population of 6%+ had an uptake 3.7 % lower than those with 0% Muslim population. Similarly, a significantly lower uptake persisted in urban areas compared to rural (0.9 % lower). These results are similar to those seen in the first year of the pilot vaccination programme in 2014 to 20154 were all independently associated with low vaccine uptake in children. During the 2014 to 2015 season vaccine uptake was 14.1% lower in the lowest quintile of deprivat ion, and areas with BME >34% had 8. 5% lower vaccine uptake than areas with <5% BME for 4 to 11 year olds in Pilot areas across England4. The results were also similar to findings in 2014 to 20154 for Muslim and Jewish populations where Muslim populations 6+%had 5.8% lower vaccine uptake than areas with 0% Muslim populations and areas with >0% Jewish populations had 1.4% lower uptake than populations with 0% Jewish population for children ages 4 -11 years old in pilot areas in England . A significantly higher uptake in pilot areas than in non -pilot areas was also observed where pilot areas had a 1.9% higher vaccine uptake. F inally, after adjusting for area -level characteristics relative to the North of England , uptake in Midlands and East of England were insignificant ly different . Uptake in the South of England was significantly higher with a 3.3% increase than in the North of England. However, London was sig nificantly lower, with 8 .8% lower uptake .Childhood Flu Vaccination Programme, England 2015 to 2016 13 Table 4.

Overall uptake for children in school year 1 to 6 age vaccinated in schools was 55.6% with uptake ranging from 34.8% in London to 76.7% in Greater Manchester (Table 3). Vaccine uptake in the pilot areas ranged from 60.7% in year 1 to 54.7% in year 6, with an overall decreasing uptake with increasing age (Figure 2). Table 3.

London experienced a 25 .3% lower vaccine uptake than in the North of England. There was a decreasing trend in vaccine uptake as the BME population increased. Areas with a BME populat ion of 34% or more had 14 .8% lower uptake than those with a BME population of <5%. Generally the more deprived an area, the lower the uptak e, with those in the second most deprived decile and the most deprived of deprivation having 13.6% and 12 .8% lower uptake than those in the least deprived decile, respectively . Uptake was 9 .5% lower when 6%+ of the LSOA population identified as Muslim relative to 0%. After adjusting for all area level characteristics in the multivariab le regression analysis (Table 5, Figure 4 ) PHE region and deprivation score were significant factors for lower uptake along with ethnicity . Vaccine uptake was 27 .9% lower in London compared to the North of England. Depriv ation remained significant , with those in the least deprived decile of deprivation showing uptake 12.9% lower than those in the most deprived decile . Areas with a BME population of 34 % or more had 7 .9% lower uptake compared to areas with a BME population of <5% . After adjustin g for other predictors , Jewish population, Muslim population, and rural vs. urban schools were no longer significant predictors of low uptake.

Promising uptake levels were achieved across most area s in children of school years 1 and 2 age , demonstrating the feasibility of rolling out the pr ogramme to further year groups nationally . For children years 1 and 2 age vaccine uptake was found to be the lowest in London and highest in North Yorkshire and Humber. For the Pilot areas , vaccine uptake varied by year group, which w as also observed during the 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015 influenza seasons3, 4. Vaccine uptake decreased as the year groups increased in age . Among all pilot areas t he lowest vaccine uptake was in London and the highest vaccine uptake was in Greater Manchester . Analysis on the ecological predictors of uptake suggest that low uptake children of school years 1 and 2 age is significantly and independently associated wit h deprivation and ethnicity , with the lowest upt ake being reported in the most deprived decile of deprivati on or areas with a larger BME population. Areas identifying with the Muslim faith reported significantly lower uptake in children school year 1 and 2 age . These results are similar to those found in the first year of the pilot va ccination programme in 2014 to 20154 where areas with 6+% had 5.8% lower vaccine uptake for children ages 4-11 years in pilot areas across England . Ecological analysis of children school years 1 to 6 age in pilot areas indicate that lower uptake is significantly and independently associated with PHE region, deprivation and ethnicity, with the lowest uptake being reported in London, areas in the most deprived decile of deprivation or in areas with larger BME population. The level of association between vaccine uptake and deprivation and ethnicity are similar to those found in the first year of the pilot va ccination programme in 2013 to 20 143 and in 2014 to 20154. Areas identifying with Muslim or Jewish faith were not significantly associated with lower uptake in children school year 1 to 6 age. Comparing to the 2014 to 2015 season pilot areas, areas with Muslim and Jewish faith were independently associated with lower vaccine uptake. Consent, refusal and non -response rates for children school years 1 and 2 age indicate that consent rates, refusal rates and no return rates varied among the different AT . The overall no return rate was 30.6 %. A reduction in no return would increase the overall consent and vaccine uptake. Childhood Flu Vaccination Programme, England 2015 to 2016 24 Among the pilot areas, c onsent, refusal , and non -response rates indicate that decreasing uptake appears to be linked mainly to an increase in non -response rates and a decrease in consent forms as school year group age increases. These differences in response and refusal rates may be a reflection of parental perc eptions of the importance of influenza vaccination for older children. Younger children are typically more likely to suffer complications from influenza than older children, and are therefore a higher risk group12, 13. Further work is required to understand and a ddress these differences. Data on contraindications were variable in children schools year 1 and 2 age and in children ages 1 -6 in pilot areas . Most contraindications occurred on the day of the vaccination campaign and the most common contraindication was child not well on the day of the campaign. The most common contraind ications repor ted prior to the day of vaccination were 'immunosuppression of a family member ' and 'egg allergy ' in both pilot and non -pilot areas . The childhood influenza vaccination programme continues to show promising uptake levels with population level impact of the programme in terms of prevention of influenza as the ro ll out of the campaign progresses13. The programme is continually strengthened through the fu rther roll out of the programme, which is seeing a further extension in the 2016 to 2017 season. From October 2016 all children of sch ool years 1, 2, and 3 age in England have been offered LAIV vaccination mainly through a school - based programme . As seen in previous years, all children age d two, three, and four years on 31 August 2016 have been offered influenza vaccination throu gh GPs. Additionally the five pilot areas that have been piloting the primary school vaccination programme over the past two season s have continue d to offer LAIV to all primary school -age children. The evaluati on of the season will continue to inform the best strategy to roll out influenza vaccination to al l target ages in seasons to come .
