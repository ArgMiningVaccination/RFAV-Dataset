{"title": "COVID-19 Vaccines Safety Tracking (CoVaST): part I", "author": "Authors", "url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/26632", "hostname": "frontiersin.org", "description": "Acceleration of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mass vaccination has been a chief priority for health systems globally since the first emergency approvals of COVID-19 vaccines in late 2020. Nevertheless, vaccine hesitancy (VH) which is nourished by misinformation about vaccines' effectiveness and safety remains as a serious threat for vaccination strategies worldwide. Aversion to post-vaccination side effects, the lack of trust of pharmaceutical industry, and the lack of knowledge about vaccines' safety are among the VH drivers; therefore independent (non-sponsored) and active surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines safety is of utmost importance for suppressing VH.The overarching aim of this Research Topic is to synthesize a collection of the studies that evaluate the short-term side effects of different types of COVID-19 vaccines; i.e. mRNA-based, viral vector-based, inactivated virus-based, and protein subunit-based vaccines in various countries worldwide. The post-vaccination side effects can be evaluated either using the data of passive surveillance systems; e.g. VAERS, DAEN, EudraVigilance, etc or through active surveillance (epidemiological) studies; e.g. cohort, cross-sectional studies, etc. We welcome the submission of manuscripts including, but not limited, the following topics: Epidemiological observational studies of the short-term side effects following COVID-19 vaccination; Hypothesis-driven analyses of the data of the passive surveillance systems of COVID-19 vacc...", "sitename": "Frontiers", "date": "2014-06-02", "cleaned_text": "About this Research Topic The overarching aim of this Research Topic is to synthesize a collection of the studies that evaluate the short-term side effects of different types of COVID-19 vaccines; i.e. mRNA-based, viral vector-based, inactivated virus-based, and protein subunit-based vaccines in various countries worldwide.
