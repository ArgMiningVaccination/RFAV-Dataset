We live in a society that screams at us MORE, MORE, MORE on a 24/7 basis, especially when advertising food and health products. It is my opinion that this constant stream of more, as it relates to food specifically, is detrimental to our overall health and longevity. Ikaria Integrative Health's approach to helping you achieve optimal wellness actually starts with LESS. It's true our bodies were designed to work FOR us, cleaning, filtering, and keeping our overall health in check. However, with lifestyle factors such as increased amounts of processed foods and exposure to thousands of chemicals on a daily basis, our built-in filters, like our livers, become sluggish and can't function with the efficacy and efficiency of their original design. Can you imagine never changing your air filter in your home, or the filter in your dryer? Now imagine the foods we ingest, the medications we take, the cosmetics and creams we put on our skin and multiply those actions over a lifetime. Your liver must metabolize and decide whether to excrete those compounds (through urine, sweat, stool or bile) or to store it somewhere safe in your body (primarily in fat cells). Symptoms we commonly attribute to -oh, that's just life- like weight gain, skin breakouts, fatigue or insomnia, and mood instability, much of the time, stem from a liver that is trying to work for you, but has been slowed down over time, become congested and is now causing a traffic-jam of toxic build-up in your body. A functional medicine detox can open up your liver pathways to help return your body to an optimal level of functioning. Much like we need a vacation once we feel the burnout from work, our body's systems also need a periodical break to destress- I call that periodical break a functional medicine (FM) detox. An FM detox is centered around an elimination style diet, decreasing the amount of high-inflammatory foods you are typically exposed to multiple times a day when consuming a standard American diet. An FM detox also incorporates a style of fasting- one of the only proven methods by which mammals increase their longevity. Finally, a functional medicine detox incorporates three supplements: a high-quality activated daily multi-vitamin, along with two supplements that work to enhance your liver's overall functionality. This FM detox truly emphasizes the importance of using food as medicine, and works to rebalance your body in ways that include balancing blood sugar, removing toxins, easing digestive issues, decreasing overall inflammation, and jump-starting weight loss-- all of which work to prevent chronic disease and increase longevity.
