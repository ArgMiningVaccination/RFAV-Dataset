Approval of Pfizer/BioNTech bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine We have approved the Pfizer/BioNTech bivalent COVID-19 vaccine as a booster after it was found to meet our standards of safety, quality and effectiveness. The brand name for the bivalent vaccine is Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1. The updated booster vaccine targeting the original coronavirus strain and the Omicron BA.1 variant, has been approved for use in individuals aged 12 years and above. This decision has been endorsed by the [Commission on Human Medicines](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/commission-on-human-medicines/about/membership), after a careful review of the evidence. Safety monitoring in clinical trials showed that the types of side effects observed were the same as those seen for the original Pfizer/BioNTech monovalent vaccine (brand name Comirnaty) booster dose and were typically mild and self-resolving, and no new serious safety concerns were identified. Please see the [Press Release](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pfizerbiontech-bivalent-covid-19-booster-approved-by-uk-medicines-regulator) and the [Decision page](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizerbiontech-bivalent-originalomicron-booster-vaccine) for bivalent Original/Omicron booster vaccine.
