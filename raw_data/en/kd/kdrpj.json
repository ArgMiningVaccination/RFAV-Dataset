This annual loss has remained constant since the 1940s, when most farmers and ranchers began using agrichemi - cals to control pests. Agrichemical methods of protecting crops are costly to the farmer, po - tentially harmful to the environment and, despite widespread use, have not proved 100-percent effective. Problems persist due to pest resistance and the uncanny ability of pests to overcome single-tactic control strategies. A National Academy of Science 1997 Proceedings paper, \"A Total Sys - tem Approach to Sustainable Pest Management,\" called for \"a fundamental shift to a total system approach for crop protection [which] is urgently needed to resolve escalatory economic and environmental consequences of combating agricultural pests.\" Many farmers are seeking such an approach, one that relies less on ag - richemicals and more on mimicking nature's complex relationships among different species of plants and animals. Known as \"ecologically based pest management\" or simply \"ecological pest management,\" this approach treats the whole farm as a complex system. The old approach strives for 100 percent control of every pest using one strategy or agrichemical for each pest. The new approach, ecological pest management, aims to manage the whole farm and keep pests at acceptable populations using many complementary strategies. Ecological pest man - \u0018 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesagement is a preventive approach that uses \"many little hammers\" or strate - gies, rather than one big hammer, to address pest problems on the farm or ranch. Ecological pest management employs tactics that have existed in natu - ral ecosystems for thousands of years. Since the beginning of agriculture \u2014 indeed, long before then \u2014 plants co-evolved with pests and with the natural enemies of those pests. As plants developed inherent protective mechanisms against pests, they were helped by numerous partners in the ecosystem, for example: n Beneficial insects that attack crop insects and mites by chewing them up or sucking out their juices n Beneficial parasites, which commandeer pests for habitat or food n Disease-causing organisms, including fungi, bacteria, viruses, protozoa and nematodes that fatally sicken insects or keep them from feeding or reproducing. These organisms also attack weeds. n Insects such as ground beetles that eat weed seeds n Beneficial fungi and bacteria that inhabit root surfaces, blocking attack by disease organisms A crimson clover cover crop prevents erosion, improves soil, fixes nitrogen and attracts beneficial insects.Dave Clark, USDA ARSIntroduction n \u0018By integrating these natural strategies into your farming systems, you can man - age pests in a way that is healthier for the environment and eliminates many of the problems associated with agrichemi - cal use. Knowing the life cycles of pests and understanding their natural enemies allows you to better manipulate the sys - tem to enhance, rather than detract from, the built-in defenses available in nature. Another National Academy of Science report (1996), Ecologically Based Pest Management (EBPM), stated that EBPM \"should be based on a broad knowledge of the agro-ecosystem and will seek to manage rather than eliminate pests\" in ways that are \"profitable, safe, and durable.\" In addition to reducing pest damage, shifting your farming system to ecological pest management will bring multiple benefits to your operation. For example, moving from monoculture to longer rotations improves wa - ter- and nutrient-use efficiency . Cover crops planted to attract beneficial insects also suppress weeds, improve the soil, provide moisture-conserving mulch, fix or store nitrogen for subsequent crops and contribute to overall nutrient management goals. About Manage Insects on Your Farm Pests of agricultural crops include weeds, insects, pathogens and nema - todes. This book is focused mostly on managing insect pests, but it ad - dresses all crop pests to some degree, because no pest or category of pests can be addressed in isolation. The ecological pest management strategies presented here will contribute to overall ecosystem health. We first lay out the principles behind ecologically based pest management. Then, we describe strategies used by farmers around the world to address in - sect problems within the context of their whole farm systems. A full section is devoted to how you can manage your soil to minimize insect damage. Flip to Chapter 5 to learn about beneficial insects you can put to work for you. Photos of some beneficials and pests can be found on pages 50-54. Aleiodes indiscretus wasp parasi\u00ad tizing a gypsy moth caterpillar.Scott USDA ARS\u0018 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesIn Lancaster County, Pa., Steve Groff built a farming system based on cover crops, inten - sive crop rotation and no-till. Although he de - signed his crop and vegetable farm without targeting specific pests, Groff and the scien - tists using his farm as a real-world laboratory have documented significant benefits in pest management, including: n Increased populations of beneficial insects in cover crops n Reduced populations of Colorado potato beetles in tomatoes n Delayed onset of early blight in tomatoes n Minimal to no aphid pressure on any of his crops n Reduced cucumber beetle damage in pumpkins n Tolerable levels of European corn borer, thanks to releases of the parasitic wasp, trichogramma ostriniae n Reduced weed pressure, although monitoring and managing weeds are still a top priority on his farm Those benefits come at some cost, however. Groff spends more time man - aging his complex system to ensure that cover crops are seeded and killed at the right time and to scout for weeds. Moreover, he monitors soil temperature because no-till and cover crop residues delay soil-warming in the spring. Not all pest management problems have been solved, either. Spider mites still attack Groff's tomatoes, particularly in dry years, while slugs sometimes hide under cover crop residues in wet years. Nonetheless, consider the num - bers. Groff has cut pesticide use by 40 percent and seen soil or - ganic matter increase by almost 50 percent with a 10 percent net increase in yield averaged over all crops. \"It's working for us, \" Groff says. Groff's system is described in greater detail on pages 60-63.Cover Crop SyStem Deter S peStS Steve Groff's cover crop of cereal rye and flowering rapeseed pro\u00ad vides multiple benefits compared to neighboring plowed fields.R. Weil, Univ. of MarylandIntroduction n \u0018Throughout the book, we present specific examples of successful pest management strategies. While some examples may fit your farm or ranch, most are crop- or climate-dependent and will serve mostly to stimulate your imagination and help you better understand that while every sys - tem is unique, the general principles of ecological pest management apply universally . Use this book as a stepping-stone to develop a more complex, more diverse system on your own farm. Look for \"Tip\" boxes throughout the book for specific suggestions. This book does not address the multiple ecological benefits of further diversifying your farm or ranch by integrating livestock into the system. If you also raise animals, consult other information resources about the management and benefits of integrated crop-livestock systems (Resources, p. 104). In short, nature has already provided many of the tools needed to suc - cessfully combat agricultural pests. This book aims to describe those tools and present successful strategies for using them to manage insects on your farm or ranch.Eric Brennan, Univ. of Calif. Workers harvest celery next to a strip of bachelor button flowers planted to attract beneficial insects. \u0018How Ecologically Based Pest Management Works2 To bring ecological pesT managemenT to your farm, consider three key strategies: n Select and grow a diversity of crops that are healthy , have natural defenses against pests, and/or are unattractive or unpalatable to the pests on your farm. Choose varieties with resistance or tolerance to those pests. Build your soil to produce healthy crops that can with - stand pest pressure. Use crop rotation and avoid large areas of mono - culture. n Stress the pests. You can do this using various management strategies described in this book. Interrupt their life cycles, remove alternative food sources, confuse them. n Enhance the populations of beneficial insects that attack pests. Intro - duce beneficial insects or attract them by providing food or shelter. Avoid harming beneficial insects by timing field operations carefully . Wherever possible, avoid the use of agrichemicals that will kill benefi - cials as well as pests. EBPM relies on two main concepts: Biodiversity in agriculture refers to all plant and animal life found in and around farms. Crops, weeds, livestock, pollinators, natural enemies, soil fauna and a wealth of other organisms, large and small, contribute to biodiversity . The more diverse the plants, animals and soil-borne organ - How Ecologically Based Pest Management Works n \u0018isms that inhabit a farming system, the more diverse the community of pest-fighting beneficial organisms the farm can support. Biodiversity is critical to EBPM. Diversity , in the soil, in field boundar - ies, in the crops you grow and how you manage them, can reduce pest problems, decrease the risks of market and weather fluctuations, and elimi - nate labor bottlenecks. Biodiversity is also critical to crop defenses: Biodiversity may make plants less \"apparent\" to pests. By contrast, crops growing in monocultures over large areas may be so obvious to pests that the plants' defenses fall short of protecting them. Biological control is the use of natural enemies \u2014 usually called \"ben - eficial insects\" or \"beneficials\" \u2014 to reduce, prevent or delay outbreaks of insects, nematodes, weeds or plant diseases. Biological control agents can be introduced, or they can be attracted to the farming system through ecosystem design. Naturally occurring beneficials, at sufficient levels, can take a big bite out of your pest populations. To exploit them effectively , you must: 1) identify which beneficial organisms are present; 2) understand their individual biological cycles and resource require - ments; and 3) change your management to enhance populations of beneficials. \"It's a subtle effect, but over time the advantage increases. Your system moves slowly toward a natural balance and your pest problems decrease.\" \u2014 Z ach berkowi TZ, california vineyard consul TanT The goal of biological control is to hold a target pest below economically damaging levels \u2014 not to eliminate it completely \u2014 since decimating the population also removes a critical food resource for the natural enemies that depend on it. In Michigan, ladybugs feed on aphids in most field crops or \u2014 if prey is scarce \u2014 on pollen from crops like corn. In the fall, they move to for - est patches, where they hibernate by the hundreds under plant litter and snow. When spring arrives, they feed on pollen produced by such early-\u0018 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesBiological control Voca Bulary When farmers release natural enemies, or beneficials , to manage introduced pests, they are using biological control tactics. Classical biological control is the importation and re - lease of beneficial insects against exotic pests. When farmers add a species of natural enemy to a field where it is not currently present, or present only in small numbers, they are using augmentation biological control: they can either inundate a field with large numbers of natural enemies or inoculate it with relatively few at a critical time. When they conserve the augmented natural enemies or the ones that are already present in and around their fields, they are using conservation biological control. Parasitoids \u2014 a class of beneficials \u2014 are par - asitic insects that kill their hosts.

Debbie Roos, North Carolina Cooperative Extension (left) assassin bug feeding on colorado potato beetle larva. How Ecologically Based Pest Management Works n \u0018season flowers as dandelions. As the weather warms, they disperse to al - falfa or wheat before moving on to corn. Each component of biodiversity \u2014 whether planned or unplanned \u2014 is significant. For example, if dande - lions are destroyed during spring plowing, the ladybugs lose an important food source. As a result, the ladybugs may move on to greener pastures, or fail to reproduce, reducing the population available to manage aphids in your cash crop. Research shows that farmers can indeed bring pests and natural enemies into balance on biodiverse farms by encouraging practices that build the great - est abundance and diversity of above- and below-ground organisms (Figure 1). By gaining a better understanding of the intricate relationships among soils, microbes, crops, pests and natural enemies, you can reap the benefits of biodiversity in your farm design. Further, a highly functioning diversity of Figure 1. the pillars of ecological pest management, explained in this book, can be categorized into above-ground and below-ground principles and practices. Ecological pest management is based on the use of multiple tactics to manage pests in the agroecosystem, rather than a \"silver bullet\" to control them.AgRoECosyst EM DEsigNThe Pillars of ecological PesT managemen T BEloW gRoUND HABitAt MANA gEMEN t, Biot A ACtivAtioN AND DivERsifiCAtioN (soil NUtRiENt MANA t)ABovE soil H EAltH CRoP HEAltHREDUCE MAiNtAiN soil CovER ADD oRgANiC MAttER NUtRiENt MANA gEMEN t CRoP DivERsity RotAtioNs CovER CRoPs PlANt BREED iNg 10 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiescrucial organisms improves soil biology , recycles nutrients, moderates micro - climates, detoxifies noxious chemicals and regulates hydrological processes. What Does a Biodiverse f arm l ook like? Agricultural practices that increase the abundance and diversity of above- and below-ground organisms strengthen your crops' abilities to withstand pests. In the process, you also improve soil fertility and crop productivity . Diversity on the farm includes the following components: n Spatial diversity across the landscape (within fields, on the farm as a whole and throughout a local watershed) n Genetic diversity (different varieties, mixtures, multilines, and local germplasm) n Temporal diversity , throughout the season and from year to year (different crops at different stages of growth and managed in different ways)n Diversify enterprises by including more species of crops and livestock. n Use legume-based crop rotations and mixed pastures. n intercrop or strip-crop annual crops where feasible. n Mix varieties of the same crop. n Use varieties that carry many genes\u2014 rather than just one or two\u2014for tolerating a particular insect or disease. n Emphasize open-pollinated crops over hybrids for their adaptability to local environments and greater genetic diversity. n grow cover crops in orchards, vineyards and crop fields. n leave strips of wild vegetation at field edges. n Provide corridors for wildlife and beneficial insects. n Practice agroforestry: where possible, combine trees or shrubs with crops or livestock to improve habitat continuity for natural enemies. n Plant microclimate-modifying trees and native plants as windbreaks or hedgerows. n Provide a source of water for birds and insects. n leave areas of the farm untouched as habitat for plant and animal diversity. (see Chapter 4 to learn about enhancing belowground biodiversity)EnHancing aBoVEground Biodi VErSity: a cHE ckli St For Far MErSHow Ecologically Based Pest Management Works n 11How diverse is the vegetation within and around your farm? How many crops comprise your rotation? How close is your farm to a forest, hedgerow, meadow or other natural vegetation? All of these factors contribute to your farm's biodiversity. Ideally , agricultural landscapes will look like patchwork quilts: dissimi - lar types of crops growing at various stages and under diverse manage - ment practices. Within this confusing patchwork, pests will encounter a broader range of stresses and will have trouble locating their hosts in both space and time. Their resistance to control measures also will be hampered. Plant diversity above ground stimulates diversity in the soil. Through a system of checks and balances, a medley of soil organ - isms helps maintain low popula - tions of many pests. Good soil CAUTION! increasing bio - diversity takes a lot of knowledge and manag ement, as it can backfire. s ome cover crops can provide pest habitat, and mulches can boost populations of slugs, cu tworms, squash bugs and other pests. a rosemary cash crop teams with flowering buckwheat, which improves the soil and attracts beneficials, in a Brentwood, calif., apricot orchard.

Students learn about ecological farm design from oregon fruit and vegetable grower larry thompson. Jerry DeWitt, iowa state Univ.in oregon's Willamette valley, larry thompson's 100- acre fruit and vegetable farm blossoms with natural insectaries. \" to keep an equilibrium of beneficials and pests and to survive without using insecticides, we have as much blooming around the farm as we can,\" he says. thompson uses cover crops to recruit ladybugs, lacewings and praying mantises in his battle against aphids. overseeded cereal rye is already growing under his lettuce leaves be - fore he harvests in late summer and fall. \" it creates a nice habitat for overwinter - ing beneficials and you don't have to start over from ground zero in the spring,\" he says. Between his raspberry rows, thompson lets his dandelions flower into a food source for nectar- and pollen-seeking insects before mowing them down. forced out of the dandelions that nurtured them in early spring, the beneficials pursue a succession of bloom. they move first into his raspberries, then his marionberries and boysenberries. later in the year, thompson doesn't mow his broccoli stubble. instead, he lets the side shoots bloom, creating a long-term nectar source into early winter. \"the bees really go for that,\" he says. How Ecologically Based Pest Management Works n 13tilth and generous quantities of organic matter also can stimulate this very useful diversity of pest-fighting soil organisms. As a rule, ecosystems with more diversity tend to be more stable: they exhibit greater resistance \u2014 the ability to avoid or withstand disturbance \u2014 and greater resilience \u2014 the ability to recover from stress.14 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesF a r M FEa t u r E diVErSity in EVEry Fi Eld and P En n diversifies crops within space and time n Plants windbreaks and grassy field borders n integrates crop and livestock operations n Builds soils with diverse organic matter n uses resistant crops i t's been two decades since Ron and Maria Rosmann began transition - ing their west central Iowa farm to organic. Their crops \u2014 soybeans, corn, alfalfa, turnips, grasses, oats, rye and other small grains \u2014 were certified organic in 1994. Their 90 stock cows and 650 broiler chick - ens followed in 1997, while their 20 antibiotic-free Berkshire sows are \"natural pork.\" Except for seed staining in their soybeans \u2014 transmitted by bean leaf beetles \u2014 and aphids and leafhoppers in their alfalfa, Rosmann Family Farms are bothered by few pests. While most of their neighbors have readily switched to \"biotech\" varieties, the Rosmanns' corn and soybean yields, over a 20-year average, are at least as high as the county's. \"Things are working well here and there's got to be a reason \u2014 and it's not just one,\" says Rosmann. \"We look at it as a whole system.\" Biodiversity is hard at work above and below ground On their fourth-generation farm near Harlan, the Rosmanns plant wind - breaks, grassy field borders and \u2014 for pheasants and quail \u2014 native prairie species. Generous populations of lacewings and ladybugs indi - cate that the Rosmanns' commitment to biodiversity is keeping preda - tors in balance with prey . Nesting boxes support three pairs of Ameri - can kestrels, which return the favor by snatching up small rodents. Rather than alternating corn and soybeans every other year, the Ros - manns' primary rotation spans six years: corn, soybeans, corn, small grains and two years of alfalfa. Instead of expansive monocultures, they break up their 620 acres into about 45 fields, letting topography decide 14 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategies How Ecologically Based Pest Management Works n 15how each field is divided. If their light infestations of corn borers drop a few ears of corn onto the ground, their cattle glean them after harvest. \"Most conventional farmers continue to tear out their fences,\" says Ros - mann. \"They don't have anything running on their fields to pick up the fallen grain. It's wasted on most farms. That's ridiculous.\" livestock enrich soils If he had to offer just one reason why his farming system is so resilient, Rosmann would say it's his healthy soils. He beds his livestock in oat, rye and barley straw \u2014 his hogs are treated to the Swedish deep-bed - ding system of 2-foot-thick straw \u2014 then composts the straw with their manure. He feeds his soils every cubic inch of that compost and tills his fields very minimally . For example, he plants his corn and soy - beans into ridges and turns those fields under only after the rotation's third year. \"I think our soil biology is balanced and that the bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms really help us out,\" he says. \"They must be help - ing our productivity and breaking our disease and insect cycles.\" How Ecologically Based Pest Management Works n 15ron (left) and david rosmann use long rotations and minimum tillage to grow healthy crops, resulting in minimal pest problems.\u00a9 the Rodale institute\u00ae 2005 from www.newfarm.org 1\u0018 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesPrinciples of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 1\u0018Indeed, the Rosmanns have only used one insecticide in their corn and soybeans in the past 20 years \u2014 Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) against corn borers \u2014 but the insects didn't affect yields that year anyway and the Rosmanns haven't used the product since. \"We try to keep our in - put costs down. As long as our yields are not being compromised, why purchase inputs?\" he asks. Rosmann controls the aphids and leafhoppers in his alfalfa by har - vesting earlier when possible. That decreases production, but he can \"put up with it.\" He also plants orchard grass with alfalfa, which dis - courages some pests. 1\u0018 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesGenerous populations of lacewings and ladybugs indicate that the Rosmanns' commitment to biodiversity is keeping predators in balance with prey . Besides soil health, the Rosmanns control crop diseases with resistant varieties. They shop aggressively for disease resistance, but they're be - coming discouraged. No resistance is currently available to prevent the beetle-transmitted seed staining that sometimes sends their soybeans to feed markets rather than to Japanese tofu buyers. \"There's very little public plant breeding going on right now,\" says Rosmann. \"The interest is in biotechnology and that's where the dollars are going, sad to say .\" His ridge-tilled fields are much cleaner than conventionally tilled fields, with only one-seventh to one-tenth as many weeds. Early tillage, rotary hoeing after planting and cultivation destroy most of the weeds in Rosmann's other fields. The rest of his weeds he simply lives with, peaceably and profitably . abundant small fields foster diverse practices Rosmann Family Farms has several advantages many other farms don't: although they used pesticides for about 10 years during the 1960s and 1970s, the family never abandoned its mixed crop-livestock approach nor its generous crop rotations. In addition, the Rosmanns' 600-plus acres give them exceptional flexibility \u2014 and protection. \"We have such a diversity of fields in different locations that we generally don't have problems in all of our fields at once \u2014 just a portion of a field.\"How Ecologically Based Pest Management Works n 1\u0018The Rosmanns' practices are as diverse as their crops. They rotate some of their crop fields into grass-legume pastures, especially if those fields are building up unacceptable levels of weeds. They use cover crops in the corn they plant for silage but not in other corn fields. They rotate their grazing as well as their crops, thereby improving their pasture productivity and pest control. To provide feed for their cattle from mid-September until late fall, when corn stalks become available, they also follow barley and oats with turnips, rye and hairy vetch in mid-July . The Rosmanns have been evaluating their individual practices with on-farm research trials for 15 years. They know what contributes to yield improvements and what doesn't but they haven't precisely pin - pointed cause and effect \u2014 or whether interactions, rather than dis - crete practices, produce crop and soil benefits. \"There's no doubt, absolutely no doubt, that our approach is better for the environment and for us,\" Rosmann says. \"But we just plain need research \u2014 on-farm systems research \u2014 to answer questions on farms like ours.\" How Ecologically Based Pest Management Works n 1\u001818Principles of Ecologically Based Pest Management3 A whole fArm Appro Ach calls for designing a system that in - tegrates ecological pest management into other aspects of crop and soil manag ement. Each decision you make in designing your system for managing pests should be based in part on the impacts on the rest of the system. Your steps toward implementing ecological pest management should be linked with soil organic matter management, soil nutrient management, tillage, and other efforts to reduce erosion and compaction. Creating field boundaries, borders and buffers designed to protect waterways also can lead to positive impacts on pest populations. The following sections outline management strategies designed to aug - ment the good bugs that will help ward off pests. You will learn ways to select plants that attract and feed beneficial insects, manage habitat to discourage pests, exploit plant breeding and natural plant defenses in your system, and maintain and improve soil diversity to benefit plant health. Managing Aboveground Habitat Diversify plants within agroecosystems. You can attract natural ene - mies and improve biological pest control by planting polycultures of annu - al crops \u2014 two or more crops simultaneously growing in close proximity . You can also let some flowering weeds reach tolerable levels or use cover crops such as buckwheat or sunflowers under orchards and vineyards. For three decades, Dick Thompson has planted cover crops, managed Principles of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 19weeds like covers instead of like pests, and lengthened and expanded his crop rotation. \"I'm not saying we don't have any insect problems, but they do not constitute a crisis,\" says Thom pson, who farms in Boone, Iowa. \"We don't have to treat for them. We haven't done that for years.\" Numerous researchers have shown that increasing plant diversity \u2014 and thereby habitat diversity \u2014 favors the abundance and effectiveness of natural enemies: n In the Latin American tropics, lower numbers of leafhoppers and leaf beetles have been reported in small farms where beans are intercropped with corn. Corn earworm populations were reduced when corn was intercropped with legumes. n In Canadian apple orchards, 4 to 18 times as many pests were parasit - ized when wildflowers were numerous compared to when they were few. In this research, wild parsnip, wild carrot and buttercup proved essential to maintaining populations of a number of parasitoids. n In California organic vineyards, growing buckwheat and sunflowers between the vines attracts general predators as well as the leafhopper egg wasp ( Anagrus species) to help manage grape leafhoppers and Cover crops in a California orchard reduce soil erosion and contribute to overall farm diversity. Gary Kramer, USDA NRCSTIPGrow two or more crops \u2014 such as corn and beans, or cabbage and fava beans \u2014 simultaneously to boost beneficial populations.20 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesthrips. When these summer-blooming cover crops flower early , they allow populations of beneficials to surge ahead of pests. When they keep flowering throughout the growing season, they provide constant supplies of pollen, nectar and alternative prey . Mowing every other row of cover crops is a management practice that forces those benefi - cials out of the resource-rich cover crops and into vines. n Georgia cotton fields strip-cropped with alfalfa or sorghum had higher populations of natural enemies that attack moth and butterfly pests. Beneficials reduced pest insects below economic threshold levels in cotton that was relay-cropped with crimson clover, eliminating the need for insecticides. n At Michigan State University , researchers discouraged potato leaf - hoppers in alfalfa by adding forage grasses to alfalfa stands. The grasses don't provide the leafhoppers with enough nutrition to develop eggs, but the leafhoppers feed on them anyway for 5 to 8 minutes before trying another plant and eventually flying away . By diverting leafhop - pers from alfalfa and by increasing their chances for dispersal, alfalfa- orchar dgrass mixtures held 30 percent fewer leafhoppers than pure alfalfa stands. Because potato leafhoppers are often controlled later in the season by a naturally occurring fungus, this strategy may reduce leafhopper damage below threshold levels. A mixture of perennial rye and chewings fescue helps moderate vigorous vine growth in deep valley soils. Grasses go dormant in the summer and begin growing again in the fall. See page 30. Zach BerkowitzPrinciples of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 21Strategies to Enhance Beneficials One of the most powerful and long-lasting ways to minimize economic damage from pests is to boost populations of existing or naturally occur - ring beneficial organisms by supplying them with appropriate habitat and alternative food sources. Beneficial organisms such as predators, parasites and pest-sickening \"pathogens\" are found far more frequently on diverse farms where fewer pesticides are used, than in monocultures or in fields routinely treated with pesticides. The following characteristics are typical of farms that host plentiful pop - ulations of beneficials: n Fields are small and surrounded by natural vegetation. n Cropping systems are diverse and plant populations in or around fields include perennials and flowering plants. n Crops are managed organically or with minimal agrichemicals. n Soils are high in organic matter and biological activity and \u2014 during the off-season \u2014 covered with mulch or vegetation. T o conserve and develop rich populations of natural enemies, avoid cro pping practices that harm beneficials. Instead, substitute methods that enhance their survival. Start by reversing practices that disrupt natural biological control, such as insecticide applications, hedge removal and compr ehensive herbicide use intended to eliminate weeds in and around fields. Even small changes in farming routines can substantially increase natu - ral enemy populations during critical periods of the growing season. The simple use of straw mulch provides humid, sheltered hiding places for nocturnal predators like spiders and ground beetles. By decreasing the vi - sual contrast between foliage and bare soil, straw mulch also can make it harder for flying pests like aphids and leafhoppers to \"see\" the crops they attack. This combination of effects can significantly reduce insect damage in mulched garden plots.CAUTION! Before introducing additional crop(s) into your system, be sure to consider the possibility that the new crop may compete for water, nutrients, light or other resources needed by the cash crop for optimal growth. Seek local knowledge and/or test the new system on a small portion of your acreage. How might a very wet or a very dry year affect your results?22 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesMichigan State University scientists have eval uated orchard-scale ground cover experiments in estab - lished commercial orchards and in a new tart cherry orchard at the Northwest Horticultural Research Station. They studied orchard floors covered with compost, mulch or cover crops such as crimson clover, berseem clover, white clover, indigo vetch, alfalfa, rye, annual ryegrass, hard fescue and Buffalo grass. So far, findings include: n Season-long populations of beneficial mites were attributed to the use of a red clover cover crop. n Season-long, vegetation-free strips using either herbicide or mulch increase pest mite populations. n Orchards with ground covers\u2014irrigated but not treated with herbicides to manage weeds\u2014 had fruit yields that were not significantly lower than conventional pra ctices over a five-year period. Note the irrigation may be critical in this system to prevent the ground cover from competing with the fruit trees for water. n Adding mulch, cover crops and/or compost increases soil organic matter, populations of beneficial soil microbes and amounts of active soil carbon and nitrogen available to trees. n Fewer beneficial nematodes, more plant- parasitic nematodes and more nitrate leaching were associated with lower-quality conventional-system soils. n Hay or straw mulch, applied 6 to 8 inches deep, improved tree growth and yields despite higher pest mite populations. n Nitrate leaching\u2014greatest in spring and fall\u2014was substantially reduced by veg etation growing under trees during these periods.Innov AtIvE tArt Ch Erry orChArd SyStEMSPrinciples of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 23n In-row soil population densities of beneficial nematodes, mycorrhizae and earthworms were greater under an organic production system. n Young trees benefited from adding mulch or compost but can be severely stunted by competition with groundcover plants for moisture and nutrients. n Trees with heavy mulches produced soft fruit in two of seven years. The scientists also are examining the impact of mixed-species hedgerows on insect pest movement into and out of orchards. In addition, they are evalu - ating insect pheromone mating disruption, mass trapping of plum curculio,14- inch groundcover bands around mulched center lines, and intercropping with such income-generating woody species as sea buckthorn and Si - berian pea. Orchards offer advantages over annual row crops in biologi - cal pest control, says MSU IPM tree fruit integrator David Epstein. Because they do not undergo major renovation every year, or - chard systems can be developed to let beneficials get established. \"Ground covers can be used to encourage beneficials to build up their populations and remain in the orchard throughout the year,\" he says. How much the beneficials actually reduce pests, however, depends on weather, pest popu - lations and the effectiveness of growers' monitoring programs. \"To say that if you plant red clo - ver you'll never have to spray for mites again would be erroneous,\" says Epstein. \"But if you know what's out there\u2014what levels of pests, predators and parasit - oids you have\u2014then you can make an informed decision as to whether or not you can save a spray.\" (For more information about this project, see http://www. ipm.msu.edu/tartcherry.htm)Season-long populations of beneficial mites were attributed to the use of a red clover cover crop. Charles Edson, Mich. State Univ.24 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesAs with most strategies described in this book, multiple benefits accrue from diversification. For example, care - fully selected flowering plants or trees in field margins can be important sources of beneficial insects, but they also can modify crop microclimate, add organic matter and produce wood or forage. Es - tablishing wild flower margins around crop fields enhances the abundance of beneficial insects searching for pollen and nectar. The beneficials then move into adjacent fields to help regulate in - sect pests. As an added benefit, many of these flowers are excellent food for bees, enhancing honey production, or they can be sold as cut flowers, improving farm income. Increase the population of natural enemies. To an insect pest, a fertilized, weeded and watered monoculture is a dense, pure concentration of its favorite food. Many have adapted to these sim - ple cropping systems over time. Natural enemies, however, do not fare as well because they are adapted to natural systems. Tilling, weeding, spraying, harvesting and other typical farming activities damage habitat for beneficials. Try instead to support their bio - logical needs. To complete their life cycles, natural enemies need more than prey and hosts; they also need refuge sites and alternative food. For example, many adult parasites sustain themselves with pollen and nectar from nearby flow - ering weeds while searching for hosts. Predaceous ground beetles \u2014 like many other natural enemies \u2014 do not disperse far from their overwinter - ing sites; access to permanent habitat near or within the field gives them a jump-start on early pest populations.CAUTION! Using mulch to increase populations of spiders and ground beetles only works if the pests attacking your crops are prey for those predators. Straw mulch provides hiding places for such nocturnal predators as spiders and ground beetles.Valerie Berton, SAREPrinciples of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 25Provide supplementary resources. You can enhance populations of nat - ural enemies by providing resources to attract or keep them on your farm. In North Carolina, for example, erecting artificial nesting structures for the red wasp (Polistes annularis) intensified its predation of cotton leafworms and tobacco hornworms. In California alfalfa and cotton plots, providing mixtures of hydrolyzate, sugar and water increased egg-laying by green lacewings six-fold and boosted populations of predatory syrphid flies, lady beetles and soft-winged flower beetles. You can increase the survival and reproduction of beneficial insects by allowing permanent populations of alternative prey to fluctuate below damaging levels. Use plants that host alternative prey to achieve this; plant them around your fields or even as strips within your fields. In cabbage, the relative abundance of aphids helps determine the effectiveness of the general predators that consume diamondback moth larvae. Similarly , in many regions, anthocorid bugs benefit from alternative prey when their preferred prey , western flower thrips, are scarce. Another strategy is to augment the population of a beneficial insect's preferred host. For example, cabbage butterflies (a pest of cole crops) are the preferred host for two parasites ( T richo - gramma evanescens and Apanteles rebecula) . Supplemented with continual releases of fertile females, populations of this pest escalated nearly ten-fold in spring. This enabled populations of the two parasites \u2014 both parasitic wasps \u2014 to buildup earlier in spring and maintain themselves at effective levels all season long. Because of its obvious risks, this strategy should be restricted to situations where sources of pollen, nectar or alternative prey simply can't be obtained. Manage vegetation in field margins. With careful planning, you can turn your field margins into reservoirs of natural enemies. These habitats can be important overwintering sites for the predators of crop pests. They also can provide natural enemies with pollen, nectar and other resources. Many studies have shown that beneficial arthropods do indeed move into crops from field margins, and biological control is usually more effec - tive in crop rows near wild vegetation than in field centers:Select flowering plants that attract beneficial insects, such as this adult syrphid fly.Jack Kelly Clark, UC 26 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesn In Germany , parasitism of the rape pollen beetle is about 50 percent greater at the edges of fields than in the middle. n In Michigan, European corn borers at the outskirts of fields are more prone to parasitism by the ichneumonid wasp Eriborus terebrans. n In Hawaiian sugar cane, nectar-bearing plants in field margins im - prove the numbers and efficiency of the sugar cane weevil parasite (Lixophaga sphenophori) . n In California, where epos (a parasitic wasp) reduces grape leafhopper populations in vineyards adjacent to French prunes, the prunes harbor an economically insignificant leafhopper whose eggs provide Anagrus with its only winter food and shelter.CAUTION! If you are tolerating or enhancing pest or host populations in order to provide continuing resources for beneficial organisms, be sure to monitor these populations carefully as they can build to economically- damaging levels. Lady beetles follow food sources from field margins into cash crops over the course of the season. Principles of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 27FArM FE A t u r E no-tILL Cov Er Cro PS yIEL d So IL And P ESt BEnEFItS n uses conservation tillage, manure and cover crops to manage pests n uses cover crops to conserve moisture n Integrates crop and livestock operations W ith slopes as steep as 7 percent and winds that sandblast his seed - lings, Mark Vickers decided to try no-till production and cover crops on his Coffee County , Ga., farm nine years ago. A fourth-genera - tion cotton and peanut grower who also plants corn or soybeans when the market is right, Vickers assumed his conservation-tillage system would keep his highly erodible soils in place. It did that, but it also did a whole lot more. Along with regular ma - nuring with poultry litter, Vickers' new farming practices eased many of his pest problems. Moreover, it made a \"night and day\" difference in his soils. \"There's just no comparison,\" he says. \"It's beginning to re - semble potting soil rather than clay .\" Production costs decrease by up to a third With the cover crop acting much like \"a jacket,\" Vickers' healthier soils hold moisture, prevent runoff and stretch his irrigation dollars. In its entirety , his farming system trims a quarter to a third off Vickers' pro - duction costs \u2014 mostly for labor, equipment and fuel. He sidedresses a bit of nitrogen and applies several conventional herbicides, but cutting back to just one preplant insecticide in his peanuts slashed the insecti - cide share of his budget by 50 to 60 percent. Vickers now plants Bt cotton against bollworms and hasn't used insect icides against any cotton pests for the past two years. Ladybugs, fire ants, wasps, assassin bugs and bigeyed bugs are abundant in his fields. \"It took between three and four years to build up the beneficial populations,\" he says. \"I still have the same pests, but the beneficials seem to be keeping them in check and not letting them get over the threshold numbers.\" Principles of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 27 28 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesHistorically , Vickers has rarely been plagued with insects in his pea - nuts. When corn earworms uncharacteristically erupted last year, he treated them with pyrethroids. On the other hand, infestations of white mold and tomato spotted wilt virus were common occurrences before Vickers began using cover crops. He hasn't seen either of those diseases in his peanuts since. Standout cover crop is rye Although Vickers grows wheat, rye and oats as high-residue winter covers \u2014 and also sells the oats \u2014 it's the rye that's made him a believer in the value of cover crops. He uses it to prevent root-knot nematode problems and credits it with \"dramatically\" boosting his weed control, deterring weeds and \"shading everything out.\" Vickers sows his cover crops all the way to his field edges and even into his roads. He feeds them lightly with nitrogen if he thinks they need it. In spring, when he plants his summer cash crop, he kills the cover crop with a herbicide and plants either peanuts or cotton right into the standing litter. When he grows corn, he sows that directly into the green cover crop. Cutting back to just one preplant insecticide in his peanuts slashed the insecticide share of his budget by 50 to 60 percent. Vickers' improved farming practices let him produce profitable cash crops without hiring labor. \"I do all of it myself \u2014 everything \u2014 but there's plenty of time to do it,\" he says. \"If I weren't doing it this way , I couldn't farm. There would not be enough time for me to do every - thing that needed to be done to plant a crop.\" Minimum-till: From \"no way\" to a better way Mike Nugent, another Coffee County cotton and oat grower, says his minimum-till system has increased his cotton yields by half \u2014 to about 1,250 pounds of cotton lint per acre. Nugent plants an oat cover crop in late fall, lets his cattle graze it for a few months in winter and still harvests 80 bushels of certified oat seed per acre in spring. He irrigates about 40 percent less than the county's conventional farmers and saves $30 to $40 an acre on insecticides, not including application costs. 28 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesPrinciples of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 29\"If you had told me 10 years ago that I would be farming no-till, I would have laughed at you and said there was no way in the world that would work,\" says Nugent. However, when he began easing into his new system seven years ago, he was struck by how many more beneficials inhabited his cover crop than his still-conventional fields. It's been three years now since Nugent last sprayed his cotton for budworms or bollworms. He uses herbicides in his Roundup Ready\u00ae cotton and treats his seed with fungicides, but he relies on scouting to manage his insect pests. \"You have to watch what you're doing,\" he says. \"If they ever get out of hand, we'll have to spray them. But we let the pop ulations get to a certain point, because the beneficials won't stay without anything to eat.\" Even when pest populations reach thre shold levels, Nugent keeps scout - ing for another few days. \"I've seen lots of times, when you wait one day and scout again, the population comes down \u2014 and once it comes down, it will keep coming down every day .\" Less tillage, fewer weeds The very first year he strip-tilled, Nugent also noticed many more weeds where he tilled than where he didn't. He responded by narrow - ing the tilled strip and now needs a third less herbicide. He also uses very little commercial fertilizer, depending instead on poultry litter and on recycled nutrients that are pulled from the ground by his oats and returned through their dead straw. In the beginning, his neighbors were skeptical. Now, Nugent says, \"they've switched over, too, because they've seen that it works. It's the only way to farm, as far as I'm concerned.\" Principles of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 2930 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesFArM FE A t u r E A to ASt to E CoLoGICAL GrAPE Produ CtIon n uses cover crops to enhance beneficials and restrain plant vigor n Manages riparian vegetation to reduce pests n Matches flowers to resource needs of beneficials Few wine drinkers are in the market for Cabernet Sauvignon with hints of asparagus or green pepper \u2014 herbaceous or \"green\" characters prompted by overly vigorous vines. Fewer still want utterly tasteless wines that have been drained of their flavors by spider mites. In the vineyards of California's North Coast, consultant Zach Berko - witz's clients know that their wines will inevitably tell the tale of how their grapes were grown. During his three decades of advising grape growers, Berkowitz has learned that some pest management methods favor flavor while others put it at risk. Berkowitz, who calls himself a \"first-generation farmer,\" earned a degree in plant science from the University of California-Davis in 1980. Long committed to sustainable production, he says what he learned there about integrated pest management \"immediately struck a chord.\" Now working with 10 or more growers and 1,500 or more acres \u2014 mostly in Napa and Sonoma counties \u2014 he tries to encourage beneficial organisms to keep production systems in balance while he manages for superior wine quality . Start with cover crops At the very least, Berkowitz says all grape growers can sow a no-till cover crop in the highly trafficked \"avenues\" surrounding their vine - yards. \"If those areas are seeded and mowed, that helps keep down dust, which helps keep down mites.\" He also advises his clients to plant either annual or perennial cover crops in their vineyard rows \u2014 preferably between mid-September and mid-October. For vineyards whose soil is shallow or whose vines aren't strong, he recommends an annual mix of 'Zorro' fescue, 'Blando' brome 30 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategies Principles of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 31and clovers. For those on flatter ground and with stronger vines, he prefers blends of such native perennial grasses as California brome, meadow barley and blue wildrye. By curbing the vines' excessive vigor, these cover crops boost the grapes' appeal to wine drinkers and diminish their palatability to west - ern grape leafhoppers. Berkowitz suspects that cover crops \u2014 espe - cially \"insectary\" blends of flowering plants \u2014 also intensify popula - tions of spiders, lacewings and other natural enemies of leafhoppers, thrips and mites. \"It's kind of a subtle effect, but I think that over time the advantage increases,\" says Berkowitz. \"You get that natural balance happening and it seems like your pest problems decrease.\" Densely forested creeks surround many North Coast vineyards. \"We're not cultivating fenceline to fenceline; we're striving to avoid monoculture,\" Berkowitz says. There's \"reason to believe\" this addi - tional biodiversity contributes to pest control, he says, but more re - search would help. Patience pays Berkowitz says he likes to \"preach patience,\" especially in managing fall-planted annual cover-crop mixes. \"People want to mow it so it looks nice and tidy , but it's best to just let it go to seed,\" he says. By delaying mowing until April or May , growers can watch their thick layer of thatch turn golden brown in summer, then germinate naturally with the fall rains. He makes an exception if the annual cover crop is infested with tall-growing mustards or other \"junky resident weeds.\" Then, growers should mow first in January or February before those weeds set seed, setting their blades high enough to safely clear the crop. Repeated over several years, this process eventually creates the right conditions for the cover crop to dominate and the weeds to \"kind of go away .\"During decades of advising grape growers, Berkowitz has learned that some pest management methods favor flavor while others put it at risk. Principles of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 3132 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesBy late spring, when his clients mow their perennial grass-legume mixes, those cover crops have also served as alternate hosts for natural enemies. Berkowitz's experience indicates that, in the long term, even grass cover crops trim populations of leafhoppers, though not neces - sarily below economic thresholds. Sow and mow strategically Some growers like to cultivate every other row of their cover crops in early April and mow the rows in between. Then, they disk the mowed rows in May . To Berkowitz, that's better for pest management than mowing too early and almost as good as allowing the covers to go en - tirely to seed. Other growers \u2014 not ready for a solid floor of no-till cover crops \u2014 don't plant those alternate rows to begin with. Instead, they simply sow every other row . Berkowitz endorses that practice for sites where soils aren't rich or deep and vines aren't overly vigorous. \"It gives producers a little bit of a compromise and over time they can go to complete no-till.\" Berkowitz cautions growers not to overfertilize insectary blends, whose energy should go towards flowering rather than towards vegeta - tive growth, and he advises against fertilizing grass-legume mixtures at all, since the legumes will eventually help supply nitrogen. He supports fertilizing solely when growers of grass-only covers want \"quick, thick\" stands for erosion control. Manage flexibly and responsively On the rare occasions that leafhoppers or thrips exceed economic thresholds in his clients' vineyards, Berkowitz recommends insecti - cides. \"We try to use systems that control pests without chemicals, but sometimes you're just stuck.\" That's often the case with Pierce's disease, whose damage can force frequent replanting. Berkowitz says insecticide treatment for the blue- green sharpshooter during the first hot spells can regulate this vector's early movement into vineyards. Another approach showing \"some merit\" is riparian vegetation management: replacing host plants with non-hosts. This reduces the sharpshooter's populations while broaden - ing diversity . \"Today we try to manage the vector, but someday we hope to be able to control the disease itself,\" he says. 32 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesPrinciples of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 33Over the years, Berkowitz has learned not to include 'Berber' or - chard grass or annual ryegrass in cover crop mixtures because they're simply too competitive with grapevines. He has also observed that us - ing sulfur to organically control powdery mildew kills predaceous ben - eficial mites faster than its kills prey mites. \"You think you're doing a good thing by dusting with sulfur, but at the end of the season you wind up with these mite problems.\" In vine - yards where this has occurred, Berkowitz advises producers to substi - tute non-sulfur controls like biofungicides after early-spring treatments with sulfur. He has watched that strategy \"really help\" in repeatedly mite-infested vineyards. \"It's a systems approach,\" says Berkowitz. \"That's what makes sustainable agriculture interesting to me: everything is connected.\" Principles of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 33California vintners seed mixtures of Blando brome grass, Zorro fescue and crimson and rose clovers to prevent erosion, regulate vine growth and attract beneficial insects.Zach Berkowitz 34 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesIn Norway's apple orchards, the abundance of apple fruit moth pests de - pends largely on the amount of berries produced by the European moun - tain ash (Sorbus aucuparia), a wild shrub. Because only one apple fruit moth larva can develop inside each berry , the number of these pests is directly limited by the number of berries. Thus, when European mountain ash fails to bear, apple fruit moth populations fail as well. Unfortunately , that also spells death for a naturally occurring parasite of the apple fruit moth, the braconid parasitoid wasp (Microgaster politus) . Entomologists have advised Norwegian orchardists to plant a cultivated Sorbus (ash) for its regular and abundant crops. By sustaining both apple fruit moths and Microgaster , this practice allows the natural enemies to hold the moths at levels Sorbus can support. The result: the moths don't abandon Sorbus for orchards. Manage plants surrounding fields to manage specific pests. One practice, called perimeter trap cropping, works best when plants like snap beans or cowpeas are grown to attract stink bugs and Mexican bean beetles away from soybeans. In perimeter trap cropping, plants that are especially attractive to target pests are planted around a cash crop, encircling it com - pletely without gaps. Conservation filter strips can include flowering plants to attract beneficials and provide quality habitat for many species of wildlife.Bob Nichols, USDA NRCSPrinciples of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 35Tree fruit growers seeking alternatives to broad-spectrum pesticides are looking to manage insect pests using a more environ - mentally friendly approach. In Washington state pear orchards, SARE-funded research has found that mowing once a month rather than two or three times a month creates alluring habitats for beneficial insects. An ARS researcher partly funded by SARE ran trials at three orchards and varied mowing frequency (weekly, monthly and just once a season). With less frequent mowing, the natural enemies moved into the ground cover in greater numbers, likely attracted to the pollen and nectar newly available from flowering plants as well as more abundant prey, such as aphids and thrips. Re - searcher Dave Horton found more lacewing larvae, spiders, ladybug beetles, damsel bugs, parasitoids and minute pirate bugs. \"If you mow a lot, you won't have much in the way of natural enemies on the ground,\" Horton said. \"By re - ducing the frequency to once a month, you see a dramatic increase in natural enemies moving into the ground cover without a big increase in pests that feed on fruit.\" Questions remain whether the predators migrate from the ground cover into the pear trees to attack orchard pests, although evidence supports that some predators, especially spiders, appeared in higher numbers in pear trees in the less frequently mowed plots, good news for pear growers. One of Horton's farmer collaborators, who received a SARE farmer/rancher grant to study similar ways to manage orchard pests, is convinced that minimal mowing provides control. \"I'm practicing this, and I've never had to spray for mites, \" said George Ing of Hood River, Ore., who has a 16-year-old orchard. \"Other or - chards that are conventionally treated have more pests. I'm convinced it helped. \" At the behest of area growers, who provided a research grant through their pear and apple association, Horton will test how seeding cover crops such as white clover between tree rows affects populations of both pests and pest predators. rEduCE Mo WInG FrEquEnCy to InCrEASE BEnEFICIALS uSdA ArS researcher dave horton found that less frequent mowing in orchards attracts more beneficial insects to prey on pear psylla, leaf miners and other serious pests.USDA ARS36 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesCAUTION!Field boundary plants that harbor beneficials can go to seed, contaminating field edges with weeds. Mow or plow down these plants before seeds are mature or maintain field margins at a small distance from the field edges to prevent weed problems in your cash crop. Perimeter trap cropping can sharply reduce pesticide applications by attracting pests away from the cash crop. By limiting pesticide use in field borders or eliminating it entirely , you can preserve the beneficials in the main crop. Extension vegetable educators at the University of Connecticut report that up to 92 percent of pepper maggot infestation occurs on trap crops of unsprayed hot cherry peppers, effectively protecting the sweet bell peppers inside. Applying pesticide to the trap crop during the flight of the adult pepper maggot fly reduces infestations in the unsprayed bell peppers by 98 to 100 percent. Connecticut commercial grow - ers with low to moderate pepper maggot populations have con - firmed the method's success on fields as small as one-quarter acre and as large as 20 acres. In Florida, researchers with the USDA-ARS found that a collard trap crop barrier around com - mercial cabbage fields prevented diamondback moth larvae from exceeding action thresholds and acted as a refuge planting to build parasite numbers; cabbage growers who used perimeter trap cropping reduced their insecticide applications by 56 percent. In Ontario, Canada, researchers also found that planting 'South - ern Giant' mustard around fields of cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli pro - tected them from flea beetles. Alternately , flowering plants such as Phacelia or buckwheat can be grown in field margins to increase populations of syrphid flies and reduce aphid populations in adjacent vegetable crops. This method is most effective for pests of intermediate mobility . Consider plants that support beneficial in - sects and can be harvested to generate revenue.Planting squash as a \"trap\" crop draws pests like cucumber beetles away from cash crops, reducing insecticide use and improving yields. T. Jude Boucher, Univ. of Conn. Principles of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 37Create corridors for natural enemies. You can provide natural en - emies with highways of habitat by sowing diverse flowering plants into strips every 165 to 330 feet (50-100 m) across the field. Beneficials can use these corridors to circulate and disperse into field centers. European studies have confirmed that this practice increases the di - versity and abundance of natural enemies. When sugar beet fields were drilled with corridors of tansy leaf (Phacelia tanacetifolia) every 20 to 30 rows, destruction of bean aphids by syrphids intensified. Similarly , strips of buckwheat and tansy leaf in Swiss cabbage fields increased populations of a small parasitic wasp that attacks the cabbage aphid. Because of its long summer flowering period, tansy leaf has also been used as a pollen source to boost syrphid populations in cereal fields. For more extended effects, plant corridors with longer-flowering shrubs.

A complex of predators entered the vineyard sooner, circulating continuously and thoroughly through the vines. The subsequent food-chain interactions enriched populations of natural enemies and curbed numbers of leafhoppers and thrips. These impacts were measured on vines as far as 100 to 150 feet (30-45 m) from the corridor. CAUTION!The plants you choose must provide food resources early in the season so that populations of beneficials can build before pests colonize fields. Also, make sure these plants don't harbor viruses or other diseases or high densities of insect pests. Some grass species can be important for natu - ral enemies. For example, they can provide temperature-moderating overwintering habi - tats for predaceous ground beetles. In Eng - land, researchers established \"beetle banks\" by sowing earth ridges with orchard grass at the centers of cereal fields. Recreating the qualities of field boundaries that favor high densities of overwintering predators, these banks particu - larly boosted populations of two ground bee - tles (Demetrias atricapillus and tachyporus hyp - norum), important cereal aphid predators. A 1994 study found that the natural enemies the beetle banks harbored were so cost-effective in preventing cereal aphid outbreaks that pes - ticide savings outweighed the labor and seed costs required to establish them. The ridges in this study were 1.3 feet high, 5 feet wide and 950 feet long (0.4 m x 1.5 m x 290 m).

Principles of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 39Select the most appropriate plants. Beneficial insects are attracted to specific plants, so if you are trying to manage a specific pest, choose flowering plants that will attract the right beneficial insect(s). The size and shape of the blossoms dictate which insects will be able to access the flowers' pollen and nectar. For most beneficials, including parasitic wasps, the most helpful blossoms are small and relatively open. Plants from the aster, carrot and buckwheat families are especially use - ful (Table 1). Timing is as important to natural ene - mies as blossom size and shape, so also note when the flower produces pollen and nec - tar. Many beneficial insects are active only as adults and only for discrete periods during the growing season: They need pollen and nectar during those active times, particularly in the early season when prey is scarce. One of the easiest ways you can help is to provide mixtures of plants with relatively long, over - lapping bloom times. Examples of flowering plant mixes might include species from the daisy or sunflower family (Compositae) and from the carrot family (Umbelliferae). Information about which plants are the most useful sources of pollen, nectar, habitat and other critical needs is far from complete. Clearly , many plants encourage natural enemies, but scientists have much more to learn about which plants are asso - ciated with which beneficials and how and when to make desirable plants available to key predators and parasitoids.

Cecarelli was one of about 30 farmers in New England to adopt a perimeter trap cropping strategy recommended by a University of Connecticut researcher who, with a SARE grant, tested the theory over two seasons - with terrific results. The system, popular among growers, encircles a vulnerable vegetable with a crop that can attract and better with - stand pest pressure, reducing the need for pesticides. \"What you're seeking in a trap crop is something that gets up and out of the ground fast with lots of foliage and won't be over-run easily when beetles come into the field, \" said T. Jude Boucher, Extension Educator and project leader, who recommends a thick-skinned squash called Blue Hubbard. \"If we can stop bee - tles during the seedling stage, we can eliminate most of the damage. \" In 2004, nine New England growers, including Randy Blackmer (below), in - creased yields of cucumbers and summer squash by 18 percent and reduced insecticide use by 96 percent, earning an extra $11,000 each, on average, Bouch - er said. The research compared a dozen farms using perimeter trap cropping to farms that used the typical regimen of four sprays per year. Growers planting perimeters applauded the time savings in pest scouting and pesticide spraying, and the improved economics thanks to lower input costs and higher, better-quality yields. Despite pessimism that the Blue Hubbard squash wouldn't appeal to cus - tomers, most participating farmers found that Blue Hubbard resisted beetle damage and sold at their markets. In post- project surveys, farmers said the system not only saved money, but also that planting a perimeter was simpler than applying mul - tiple full-field insecticide sprays. \"We're trying to get away from the 'silver bullet' mentality that you can put on a pes - ticide and it'll stop your problem, \" Boucher said. \"We're changing the pest populations' dynamics in the field. \"Surround InG Cro PS WIth PErIME tEr Foo LS PEStS randy Blackmer examines pumpkins planted as a trap crop to draw cucumber beetles away from squash on his Connecticut farm.T.

In lieu of universal recommen - dations, which are impossible to make, you can discover many answers for yourself by investigating the usefulness of alternative flowering plants on your farm. Also consider tapping into informational networks, such as Extension, NRCS and nonprofit organizations. Other farmers make great information sources, too (Resources, p. 104). Use weeds to attract beneficials. Sometimes, the best flowering plant to attract beneficials is a weed, but this practice complicates management. Although some weeds support insect pests, harbor plant diseases or com - pete with the cash crop, others supply essential resources to many benefi - cial insects and contribute to the biodiversity of agroecosystems. In the last 20 years, researchers have found that outbreaks of certain pests are less likely in weed-diversi - fied cropping systems than in weed- free fields.

See additional precautions in this section. less apparent to their prospective attackers. In other cases, it is because the alternative resources provided by weeds support beneficials. Unquestionably , weeds can stress crops, but substantial evidence suggests that farmers can enhance populations of beneficials by manipulating weed species and weed-management practices. A growing appreciation for the complex relationships among crops, weeds, pests and natural enemies is prompt - ing many of today's farmers to emphasize weed management over weed control . Using weeds in your biological control program will require an investment of time and management skills. First, define your pest management strategy precisely , then investigate the economic thresholds that weeds should not exceed. If you choose to work with weeds in your bio - diverse farming system, consider the fol - lowing management strategies: n Space crops closely . n Limit weeds to field margins, corridors, alternate rows or mowed clumps within fields, rather than letting them spread uniformly across fields. n Use species sold in insectary plant mixtures. n Prevent or minimize weed seed production. n Mow weeds as needed to force beneficial insects into crops. n Time soil disturbances carefully \u2014 for example, plow recently cropped fields during different seasons \u2014 so specific weeds can be available when specific beneficials need them. n Except in organic systems, apply herbicides selectively to shift weed populations toward beneficial weed species. dandelions are an important early- season source of nectar and pollen for beneficial insects. Scott Bauer, USDA ARS44 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesEnhance plant defenses against pests. The first line of defense against insect pests is a healthy plant. Healthy plants are better able to withstand the onslaught of insect pests and can respond by mobilizing inbred mecha - nisms to fight off the attack. You can enhance natural defenses by improv - ing soil and providing the best possible growing conditions, including ad - equate (but not excess) water and nutrients. As plants co-evolved with pests, they developed numerous defenses against those pests. Some of those defenses have been strengthened over time through plant breeding, while others have been lost. Some plant de - fenses \u2014 spines, leaf hairs and tough, leathery leaves \u2014 are structural. Others are chemical: n Continuous, or constitutive defenses are maintained at effective levels around the clock, regardless of the presence of pests; they include toxic plant chemicals that deter feeding, leaf waxes that form barriers, allelopathic chemicals that deter weed growth and other similar de - fenses. n Induced responses are prompted by pest attacks; they allow plants to use their resources more flexibly , spending them on growth and re - production when risks of infection or infestation are low but deploy - ing them on an as-needed basis for defense when pests reach trigger levels. The most effective and durable plant defense systems combine continu - ous and induced responses. Under attack by a plant-eating insect or mite, a crop may respond directly by unleashing a toxic chemical that will damage the pest or obstruct its feeding. It may also respond indirectly, recruiting the assistance of a third party . Many plants produce volatile chemicals that attract the natural enemies of their at - tackers. To be effective, these signals must be identifiable and distinguishable by the predators and parasites whose help the crop is enlisting. Fortunately , plants under attack release different volatile compounds than plants that have not been damaged. Crops can even emit different blends of chemicals in response to feeding by different pests. Dif - ferent varieties of the same plant \u2014 or even different parts or growth stages \u2014 can release different amounts and proportions of volatile compounds. TIPExcess nitrogen fertilizer may ham - per cotton's ability to send a chemical call for help.Principles of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 45Leaves that escape injury also produce and release volatiles, intensifying the signaling capacities of damaged plants. For example, when a beet armyworm chews on a cotton plant, the plant releases a specific chemical signal blend into the air. Female parasitic wasps pick up this signal and use it to locate the armyworm. They sting the army - worm and lay their eggs inside it, causing an immediate and dramat - ic reduction in armyworm feeding. This greatly reduces damage to the plant that originated the signal. In - terestingly , inappropriate levels of added nitrogen can change the ratio of the molecules that comprise the chemical signal, thereby changing the sig - nal and rendering it unnoticeable by the wasp. Plant breeding \u2014 though overwhelmingly beneficial in the short term \u2014 can have unforeseen consequences that unravel the best-laid plans of plant geneticists. Since the focus of plant breeding for pest resistance is often limited to a specific plant/pest interaction, selecting for one resistant gene could inadvertently eliminate other genes affecting other pests or genes that play a role in attracting the natural enemies of the pest. In response to attack by insect pests, cotton emits a chemical signal calling beneficial wasps to the rescue.Joe Lewis, USDA ARS CAUTION!Plant varieties are not equal in their abilities to defend themselves: some modern varieties lack the defenses of their native predecessors.46 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesIn addition, newly developed variet - ies may stand better or yield more at the expense of natural defenses that are of - ten unintentionally sacrificed for those other qualities. Selecting for one trait such as height could mean selecting in - advertently against any one of the many inborn plant defenses against pests. For example: n Scientists in Texas found that nec - tar-free cotton varieties attract fewer butterfly and moth pests, as their developers intended; however, as a consequence, these varieties also attract fewer parasites of tobacco budworm larvae and are thus more susceptible to that pest. n According to USDA Agricultural Research Service scientists in Gaines - ville, Fla., today's higher-yielding commercial cottons produce volatile chemical signals at only one-seventh the level of naturalized varieties, impairing their ability to recruit natural enemies. Fortunately , our knowledge of plants' roles in their own defense is steadily expanding. This knowledge can be used to breed and engineer plants whose defenses work harmoniously with natural systems. More re - search as well as plant breeding programs that focus on enhancing natu - ral defenses are needed. Such programs might emphasize open-pollinated crops over hybrids for their adaptability to local environments and greater genetic diversity . horticulturist Philip Forsline exa - mines hybrid grapes developed in a uSdA breeding program.

He calculates that those blueber - ries need a half-mile of weeding every two or three weeks \u2014 a full mile if you figure both sides. The semi-load of mulches he buys each year suppresses his annual weeds, but perennials like sorrel and quackgrass \u2014 the latter so tenacious he's come to admire it \u2014 persist. At $8 an hour, Carlson's hand weeding costs five to 10 times as much as herbi - cide treatments. \"I know what I'm getting into, so I'm starting small,\" says Carlson. Fortunately , he has an urban customer base willing to pay what it costs to grow organic blueberries. Because Carlson sells 95 percent of his fruit right on his Bayfield County farm \u2014 70 percent of it pick-your-own \u2014 he also has custom - ers eager to sample novel scab-resistant apples like Jonafrees, Redfrees, Priscillas, Pristines and Liberties . He doubts that would be case if he were selling his apples wholesale. Fortunately , his direct-market emphasis al - lows Carlson to take risks growing diverse varieties that other produc - ers would be reluctant to try . Carlson, who earned dual bachelor's degrees in horticulture and agronomy from the University of Wisconsin in 1983, first began fol - lowing his dreams in 1989. That's when he left a seven-year job at the UW fruit pathology laboratory to grow his own hardy blueberries. Reared in the Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa, he chose 40 \"excep - tionally beautiful\" acres on a finger of northern Wisconsin that juts into Lake Superior. Gradually , he expanded to 3 acres of blueberries, 1\u00bd 48 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesHis direct-market emphasis allows Carlson to take risks growing diverse varieties that other producers would be reluctant to try. 48 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesacres of raspberries, an acre of fresh-cut and everlasting flowers and 1,200 apple trees. Economic sustainability comes first Environmental sustainability has been an objective of Carlson' s enterprise from the beginning. \"We wanted people to come here, enjoy the envi - ronment and be able to walk around and buy healthy food,\" he says. However, financial reality quickly earned equal billing. \"You have to make the system economically sustainable first and then use the tools that are available to you to make it environmentally sus - tainable,\" says Carlson. \"That's always been a struggle for me. My ideal is not using any synthetic chemicals, but I need to stay in business.\" That's why Carlson now sparingly uses malathion to stop leafhop - pers from infecting his flowers with aster yellows disease, which they can briskly do within 24 hours. With about a fifth of his 250 flower species susceptible to the plant-killing virus, Carlson scouts his fields daily when his climate is ripe for leafhoppers, spraying once or twice if he must. It's also why he has adopted a \"low-spray\" program for his apples, treating them conservatively with the relatively short-lived organophos - phate Imidan: twice around petal-fall for plum curculio and codling moth and about twice after petal-fall for apple maggot flies. \"I feel like it's the least amount that I can put out there and still have a marketable crop,\" he says. He times his apple maggot sprays with red visual traps. Alternative disease management slashes fungicide use For two years, Carlson cooperated with UW researchers as they built a predictive model for apple scab around measurements of air tempera - tures and leaf surface moisture. Some years, he uses only half as many fungicides as conventional growers do on his three scab-susceptible apple varieties \u2014 Cortland, Gala and Sweet 16 \u2014 while other years he can eliminate only one or two treatments. Principles of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 49 Principles of Ecologically Based Pest Management n 49On his 1,000 scab-resistant trees, which outnumber his susceptible trees five-fold, Carlson applies no fungicides at all. During the grow - ing season, he quickly cuts out branches showing the earliest signs of fireblight and, during the dormant season, he aggressively prunes any possibly overwintering cankers. \"T ypically , apple growers tank fungicides plus insecticides,\" says Carlson. \"On my scab- resistant block, I'm not putting fungicides into the tank, so I feel good about that.\" Carlson planted his apples densely \u2014 and consequently more ex - pensively \u2014 on dwarfing rootstocks. That has allowed him to respond more nimbly to changing consumer tastes, since trees on dwarf root - stocks typically start bearing in two years rather than five. While his customers like learning that their apples were grown without fungi - cides, Carlson knows that flavor is what sells fruit and that consumer preferences can rival aroma compounds for volatility . rested raspberries reward their producers Carlson is also experimenting with alternate-row production in rasp - berries. By mowing every other row of his berries, he hopes to signifi - cantly reduce fungicide applications and to use preemergence herbi - cides only once every three or four years. \"You would think you would also cut your yields in half, but that's not necessarily the case,\" he says. \"Because of how well the plant responds to a rest year, the research shows that you can get up to 75 percent of your normal production.\" According to Carlson, a plethora of cane diseases make raspberries difficult to raise organically , so he grows them with what he calls a \"basically conventional IPM approach.\" He trickle-irrigates them and makes sure 1\u00bd to 2 feet of circulation-enhancing space separates his plants, minimizing the odds of raspberry disease. After almost 15 years as an agricultural entrepreneur, Carlson likens fruit crops to \"waves coming into shore.\" They don't produce harvests immediately but, like those waves, they \"will come in the long run.\" Although working for himself \u2014 and for the health of his customers and the environment \u2014 is less predictable than his old university pay - check, Carlson makes sure he's still waiting on the shore by keeping his risks manageable.50Predators Jiri Hulcr rove beetle (nudobius lentus) Whitney Cranshaw depressus) Debbie Ground beetle (calosoma sycophanta) Vincent J Hickey, MD Soft-winged flower beetle Sevenspotted lady on aster Debbie stink Debbie Roos Spined nymph Big-eyed bug with whitefly (geocoris PES tS Debbie Roos 52 Jack Kelly Clark, UC Adult minute pirate bug (orius tristicolor) Richard Leung Assassin bug (apiomerus or BEnEFICIALS A nd PES tSJack Kelly Clark, UC Jack Kelly Clark, UC Jack Kelly Clark, UC NEUROPTERA: USDA aphid (Myzus persicae) Jack Kelly BEnEFICIALS A nd PES tSScott Bauer, USDA ARSScott Bauer, USDA ARS Scott Bauer, USDA ARSScott Bauer, USDA ARS LEPIDOPTERA: by chalcid wasp554 Agricultur Al prActices thAt promote heAlthy soils are a pillar of ecologically based pest management. Good soil management can improve water storage, drainage, nutrient availability and root development, all of which may , in turn, influence crop-defense mech - anisms and populations of potential beneficials and pests. In contrast, adverse soil conditions can hinder plants' abilities to use their natural defenses against insects, diseases, nematodes and weeds. Poor soils can cause plants to emit stress signals to potential attackers, height - ening the risk of insect damage. For more information about improving your soil quality , see Building Soils for Better Crops, 2nd Edition (Resources, p. 104). Healthy Soils Produce Healthy Crops A healthy soil produces healthy crops with minimal amounts of external inputs and few to no adverse ecological effects. It contains favorable bio - logical, physical and chemical properties. A biologically healthy soil harbors a multitude of different organisms \u2014 microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, amoebae and paramecia, as well as larger organisms like nematodes, springtails, insect larvae, ants, earthworms and ground beetles. Most are helpful to plants, enhancing the availability of nutrients and producing chemicals that stimulate plant growth. Managing Soils To Minimize Crop Pests 56 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesAmong the vital functions of soil organisms are: n Breaking down litter and cycling nutrients n Converting atmospheric nitrogen into organic forms and reconverting organic nitrogen into inorganic forms that plants can use n Synthesizing enzymes, vitamins, hormones and other important substances n Altering soil structure n Eating and/or decomposing weed seeds n Suppressing and/or feeding on soil-borne plant pathogens and plant-parasitic nematodes A very compact soil has few large pores and thus is less hospitable to such organisms as springtails, mites and earthworms. By adding cover crops and switching to no-till, Junior Upton drastically improved his habitually compacted soil. Dan Anderson, Univ. of Ill.A healthy , biodiverse soil will support high levels of potentially benefi - cial soil organisms and low levels of potentially harmful ones. A soil rich in fresh residues \u2014 sometimes called particulate or light fraction organic matter \u2014 can feed huge numbers of organisms and foster abundant bio - logical activity . A soil's physical condition \u2014 its degree of compaction, capacity for water storage and ease of drain - age \u2014 is also critical to soil and plant health. Good soil tilth promotes rain - fall infiltration, thereby reducing run - off and allowing moisture to be stored for later plant use. It also encourages proper root development. When aeration and water availabil - ity are ideal, plant health and growth benefit. For example, crops growing in friable soils with adequate aeration are less adversely affected by both wet and dry conditions than those growing in compacted soils. Soils with good physical structure remain sufficiently aerated during wet periods, and \u2014 in contrast to compacted soils \u2014 they are less likely to become physical Managing Soils to Minimize Crop Pests n 57A healthy soil: n Accommodates active and diverse populations of beneficial organisms, with plant pest populations minimized by beneficials n Contains high levels of relatively fresh residues that provide beneficials with food n Includes high levels of decomposed organic matter, which help it retain both water and readily leachable nutrients n Contains low levels of such toxic compounds as soluble aluminum and only low to moderate concentrations of salt n Supports adequate levels of nutrients because excessive nutrients can make the crop more attractive to insect pests or can increase the threat of surface or subsurface water pollution n Has a sufficiently porous surface, with many pores connected to subsoil to permit easy entry by rainfall or irrigation water n Has good tilth that allows plant roots to easily penetrate large volumes of soilQUaliTieS Of a Heal THy SOil barriers to root growth as conditions become very dry . Organic matter im - proves aeration by promoting the ag - gregation of soil particles. Secretions of mycorrhizal fungi, which flourish in organic matter, also improve a soil's physical properties. Among the important chemical determinants of a soil's health are its pH, salt content and levels of avail - able nutrients. Low quantities of nutrients, high levels of such toxic elements as aluminum and high concentrations of salts can adverse - ly affect the growth of your crops. Healthy soils have adequate \u2014 but not excessive \u2014 nutrients. Excessive available nitrogen can make plants Nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacteria flourish in healthy soil. David Nance, USDA ARS 58 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesmore attractive or susceptible to insects, and overabundant nitrogen and phosphorus can pollute surface and groundwater. Well-decomposed organ - ic matter helps healthy soils hold onto calcium, magnesium and potassium, keeping these nutrients in the plants' root zone. The biological, physical and chemical aspects of soils all interact with and affect one another. For example, if your soil is very compact, it will have few large pores and thus will be less hospitable to such organisms as springtails, mites and earthworms. In addition, its lower levels of oxygen may influence both the forms of nutrients that are present and their avail - ability; under anaerobic conditions, for instance, significant quantities of nitrate may be converted to gaseous nitrogen and lost to the atmosphere. Managing Pests With Healthy Soils Healthier soils produce crops that are less damaged by pests. Some soil- management practices boost plant-defense mechanisms, making plants more resistant and/or less attractive to pests. Other practices \u2014 or the favorable conditions they produce \u2014 restrict the severity of pest damage by decreasing pest numbers or building beneficials. Using multiple tactics \u2014 rather than one major tactic like a single pesticide \u2014 lessens pest dam - age through a third strategy: it diminishes the odds that a pest will adapt to the ecological pest management measures. Practices that promote soil health constitute one of the fundamental pillars of ecological pest management. When stress is alleviated, a plant can better express its inherent abilities to resist pests (Figure 2). Ecological pest management emphasizes preventative strategies that enhance the \"immunity\" of the agroecosystem. Farmers should be cautious of using reactive management practices that may hinder the crop's im - munity . Healthier soils also harbor more diverse and active populations of the soil organisms that compete with, antagonize and ultimately curb soil-borne pests. Some of those organisms \u2014 such as springtails \u2014 serve as alternate food for beneficials when pests are scarce, thus maintaining viable populations of beneficials in the field. You can favor beneficial organisms by using crop rotations, cover crops, animal manures and composts to supply them with additional food. TIPEncourage beneficial organisms by using crop rotations, cover crops, animal manures and composts to supply them with additional food.Managing Soils to Minimize Crop Pests n 59In southern Georgia, cotton and peanut growers who planted rotation crops and annual high-residue winter cover crops, then virtually eliminated tillage, no longer have problems with thrips, bollworms, budworms, aphids, fall armyworms, beet armyworms and white flies. The farmers report that the insect pests declined after three years of rotations and cover crops. They now pay $50-$100 less per acre for more environmentally benign insect control materials such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), pyrethroids and/or insect growth regulators. In their no-till research plots with cover crops and long rotations, Uni - versity of Georgia scientists haven't needed fungicides for nine years in peanuts, insecticides for 11 years in cotton, and insecticides, nematicides or fungicides for 17 years in vegetables. They also are helping growers of cucumbers, squash, peppers, eggplant, cabbage peanuts, soybeans and cotton reduce their pesticide applications to two or fewer while harvest - ing profitable crops.

After more than 20 years \u2014 seven of them in no-till vegetables \u2014 Groff says he would \"never come back\" to conventional production. \"I'm increasing beneficial insects to the degree that I'm getting a posi - tive pest-control response. There's no doubt about that,\" he says. \"But we haven't 'arrived' yet.\" Crops need 40 percent less pesticide Groff estimates that he has pared down pesticide use by 40 percent on his Cedar Meadow Farm in Lancaster County , Pa. By transplanting his 25 acres of tomatoes directly into rolled-down cover-crop mulch, he has sliced $125-an-acre from that crop's pesticide bill alone. His cover-crop mixes of hairy vetch, crimson clover and rye \u2014 or vetch and rye alone when clover is too expensive \u2014 harbor beneficials. They also seem to obstruct, exhaust, confuse and otherwise inhibit Colorado potato beetles, discouraging their colonization, says Aref Abdul-Baki, USDA Agricultural Research Service vegetable production specialist. Likewise, the killed cover crop may be dissuading cucumber beetles in Groff's 30 acres of pumpkins. Groff says he hasn't sprayed his tomatoes against Colorado pota - to beetles for the past seven years, nor has he used post-emergence chemicals against cucumber beetles in pumpkins. He can also delay protective sprays for early blight for three to seven weeks in his toma - toes: in conventional systems, heavy raindrops pick up disease spores 60 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategies Managing Soils to Minimize Crop Pests n 61on plants, wash them down to plastic mulch, then splash them back up onto the crop; Groff's natural mulch lets spore-laden raindrops flow through to the ground, says Abdul-Baki. Similarly , the cover-crop mulch keeps his pumpkins cleaner and less prone to rot. integrated approach is essential Although the mulches break up insect and disease cycles, Groff gives much of the pest-management credit to his long-term rotations. There's no single \"magic bullet,\" he says: all three components of his system are equal partners. In his 25 acres of sweet corn, Groff uses moth-trap monitoring to keep his corn earworm losses in check. In cooperation with a multi- state team of scientists led by Cornell University , Cedar Meadow Farm is also participating in investigatory releases of the parasitic wasp T richogramma ostriniae against European corn borers. For reasons he doesn't quite understand, Groff says aphids trouble none of his crops. He credits beneficials. In exceptionally dry years, Groff's farm isn't spared from significant spider mite damage. \"Right now we don't have a solution for that,\" he says. \"This system is not foolproof.\" In wet years, he sees more slugs than his neighbors do. \"Now, there is an instance where the residue and moisture definitely favor a pest,\" he says. Because gardeners' remedies like beer traps aren't even remotely economical on 80 acres of veg - etables, Groff is considering a \"soft,\" narrow-spectrum insecticide that targets slugs without threatening earthworms. Weeds get the personal touch Each of Groff's fields has its own \"recipe\" for weed control. On his four- wheeler, he diligently scouts his crops, searching for small weeds and weighing his options. \"It's intensive management of weeds, and it's not a second or third priority \u2014 it's a top priority ,\" he says. To control weeds, Groff depends primarily on crop rotation and cover crops but he says the third component of his system \u2014 no-till \u2014 curtails their numbers to begin with. \"The long-term effect of no-till is that you're not tilling up weed seeds, so if you keep up with the weeds, you can get away with not using as many herbicides.\" Although annual weeds aren't a problem on his farm, Groff says he frequently spot-treats Managing Soils to Minimize Crop Pests n 6162 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesperennial weeds. He has grown some crops without herbicides, but only when his cover crops smothered all of the weeds. adapting, innovating and learning for success Because no-till soils are slower to heat up in the spring, Groff cleans off narrow bands where he will plant his sweet corn seed.

Unable to find what he needed in the marketplace, Groff designed a no-till vegetable transplanter, uses a Buffalo rolling stalk chopper and modifies much of his other equipment. His cover-crop mixes of hairy vetch, crimson clover and rye ... seem to obstruct, exhaust, confuse and otherwise inhibit Colorado potato beetles. While his system clearly presents challenges, its benefits overwhelm them: Groff says his farm's organic matter has increased from 2.7 per - cent to 4.8 percent, his soil microbial biomass has tripled and his soil aggregate stability has quadrupled. Over the years, his crop yields have improved \u2014 on average \u2014 about 10 percent. Groff advises interested farmers to start out small and learn all they can. \"There's a lot of art and technique to this way of farming,\" he says. \"It may work right off the bat but it may take you a couple of years to learn how to use it. One of the biggest challenges is knowing how and why the system works.\" Managing Soils to Minimize Crop Pests n 6364 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesAs many as 120 species of beneficial arthropods have been found in southern Georgia soils when cotton residues were left on the surface and insecticides were not applied. In just one vegetable-growing season, 13 known beneficial insects were associated with cover crops. When eggplant was transplanted into crimson clover at 9 a.m., assassin bugs destroyed Colorado potato beetles on the eggplant by evening. Similarly , other ben - eficials killed cucumber beetles on cucumber plants within a day . Underlying those benefits, accord - ing to the Georgia researchers, was the soil-improving combination of cover crops with conservation tillage: soil organic matter increased from less than 1 percent to 3 to 8 percent in most of their plots, and a majority of growers saw similar improvements in soils and pest management. Impacts of Fertilizers on Insect Pests By modifying the nutrient composition of crops, fertilizer practices can in - fluence plant defenses.

Researchers have demonstrated that high nitro - gen levels in plant tissue can decrease resistance and increase susceptibility to pest attacks (Table 2). Although more research is needed to clarify the relationships between crop nutrition and pests, most studies assessing the response of aphids and mites to nitrogen fertilizer have documented dra - matic expansion in pest numbers with increases in fertilizer rates.

Crops could be expected, therefore, to be less prone to insect pests and diseases where organic soil amendments are used, since these amendments usually result in lower concentrations of soluble nitrogen in plant tissue. Indeed, most studies documenting fewer insect pests in organic systems have attributed these reductions in part to lower nitrogen content in the crop tissues: n In Japan, the density of whitebacked planthopper (Sogatella furcifera) immigrants in organic rice fields was significantly less than their density in conventional rice fields. Fewer adult females settled in the organic fields and fewer immatures survived, leading to smaller ensu - ing generations. These results have been partly attributed to lower nitrogen content in the organically farmed crops. n In England, conventional winter wheat fields were plagued with more rose-grain aphids than their organic counterpart. Top-dressed in April with nitrogen, the plants treated with soluble synthetic fertilizers con -66 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiestained higher levels of free protein amino acids in their leaves in June and attracted larger populations of aphids. Researchers concluded that the aphids found the conventionally grown wheat to be more pal - atable than the organically grown wheat. n In Ohio greenhouse experiments, European corn borer females laid significantly more eggs on sweet corn growing in conventionally fertil - ized soils than they did on plants growing in organically farmed soils collected nearby . Interestingly , egg-laying varied significantly among the chemically fertilized treatments but was uniformly low in organically managed soils. The difference appears to be evidence for a form of bio - logical buffering more commonly found under organic conditions. n In California, organically fertilized broccoli consistently developed smaller infestations of flea beetles and cabbage aphids than con - ventionally fertilized broccoli. Researchers attributed those reduced infestations to lower levels of free nitrogen in plant foliage, further supporting the view that farmers can influence insect pest preferences with the types and amounts of fertilizers they use. n In tropical Asia, by increasing organic matter in irrigated rice, re - searchers enhanced populations of decomposers and plankton-feeders \u2014 key components in the food chain of predators; in turn, numbers of generalist predators of leafhopper pests rose significantly . Organic matter management proved to underlie higher levels of natural bio - logical control. Implications for Fertilizer Practices Conventional synthetic fertilizers can dramatically affect the balance of nu - tritional elements in plants. When farmers use them excessively , these fer - tilizers likely create nutritional imbalances with their large pulses of avail - able nitrogen, which in turn compromise crops' resistance to insect pests. In contrast, most organic farming practices lead to increased organic matter and microbial activity in soils and the gradual release of plant nu - trients; in theory , this should provide more balanced nutrition to plants. While the amount of nitrogen that is immediately available to the crop may be lower when farmers use organic inputs, their crops' overall nutritional status appears to improve. By releasing nitrogen slowly , over the course of several years, organic sources may help render plants less attractive to pests. Organic soil fertility practices also can supply secondary and trace Managing Soils to Minimize Crop Pests n 67elements, such as boron, zinc, manganese and sulfur, which are occasion - ally lacking in conventional farming systems that rely primarily on syn - thetic sources of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. If, indeed, biochemical or mineral-nutrient differences in organically grown crops enhance resistance, this may explain \u2014 at least in part \u2014 why lower pest levels have been reported in organic farming systems. Observa - tions of these lower levels support the view that long-term management of soil organic matter leads to better plant resistance to insect pests. At the USDA Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, researchers discov - ered a molecular basis for delayed leaf senescence and tolerance to diseases in tomato plants grown in a hairy vetch mulch, compared to the same crop grown on black plastic. The finding is an important step toward a scientific rationale for alternative soil management practices. Probably due to regulated release of carbon and nitrogen metabolites from hairy vetch decomposition, the cover-cropped tomato plants showed a distinct expression of selected genes, which would lead to a more ef - ficient utilization and mobilization of C and N, promote defense against disease, and enhance crop longevity . These results confirm that in intensive conventional tomato production, the use of legume cover crops offers ad - vantages as a biological alternative to commercial fertilizer, in addition to minimizing soil erosion and loss of nutrients, enhancing water infiltration, reducing runoff, and creating a \"natural\" pest-predator relationship. Traditionally considered in isolation from one another, aboveground and belowground components of ecosystems are now thought to be closely linked. The (crop) plant seems to function as an integrator of the above ground and below ground components of agroecosystems. This holistic approach is enhancing our understanding of the role of biodiversity at a global level. In agriculture, such close ecological linkages between above- ground and belowground biota constitute a key concept on which a truly innovative ecologically based pest management strategy can be built.685Beneficial Agents On the Farm Biological control is the use of natural enemies to manage pests. The natural enemy might be a predator, parasite, or dis - ease that will attack the insect pest. Biological control is a form of enhancing natural defenses to achieve a desired effect. It usually involves raising and releasing one insect to have it attack another, almost like a \"liv - ing insecticide.\" You can facilitate a biological control program by timing pesticide applications or choosing pesticides that will be least harmful to beneficial insects. A durable biological control program depends on two main strategies: 1) Using ecological farm design to make your farm more attractive to biological control \"agents.\" 2) Introducing beneficial agents onto your farm. When plant pathogens are not inhibited by naturally occurring enemies, you can improve biocontrol by adding more effective beneficials. Such \"di - rected biocontrol\" operates in several ways. As naturally occurring enemies would do, introduced beneficials may: n produce antibiotics n parasitize target organisms n form physical or chemical barriers to infection n outcompete plant pathogens for niches n simply help the plant grow better, masking symptoms where disease is present. Beneficial Agents On the Farm n 69Predators Predators occur in most orders of insects but primarily in the beetle, dragon - fly , lacewing, wasp and Hemiptera and Diptera, respectively). Their impacts have been highlighted worldwide by eruptions of spider mite pests where chemical insecticides have eliminated the mites' predators. Tetranychid mites, for example, are usually very abundant in apple orchards where pesticides have destroyed natural predator populations. The diversity of predator species in agroecosystems can be impressive. Researchers have reported more than 600 species \u2014 from 45 families \u2014 of predaceous arthropods in Arkansas cotton fields and about 1,000 species in Florida soybean fields. Such diversity can apply major regulatory pres - sures on pests. Indeed, many entomologists consider native, or indigenous, predators a sort of balance wheel in the \"pest-natural enemy complex\" The role of natural enemies in the regulation of pest populations.

Even where predators can't force pest populations below economically damaging lev - els, they can and do slow down the rate at which potential pests increase. In spray-free apple orchards in Canada, five species of predaceous true bugs were responsible for 44 to 68 percent of the mortality of codling moth eggs. Biodiverse farms are rich in predatory insects, spiders and mites. These beneficial arthropods prey on other insects and spider mites and are critical to natural biological control (Table 3). They can feed on any or all stages of their prey , destroying or disabling eggs, larvae, nymphs, pupae or adults. Some predators \u2014 like lady beetles and ground beetles \u2014 use chewing mouthparts to grind up and bolt down their prey . Others \u2014 like assassin bugs, lacewing larvae and syrphid fly larvae \u2014 have piercing mouthparts; they often inject powerful toxins into their prey , quickly immobilizing them before sucking their juices. Many predatory arthropods \u2014 including lady beetles, lacewing larvae and mites \u2014 are agile and ferocious hunters. They actively stalk their prey on the ground or in vegetation. Other hunters \u2014 such as dragonflies and robber flies \u2014 catch their prey in flight. In contrast, ambushers patiently sit and wait for mobile prey; praying mantids, for example, are usually well camouflaged and use the element of surprise to nab their unsuspect - ing victims. Most predators are \"generalist\" feeders, attacking a wide variety of in - sect species and life stages. They may have preferences \u2014 lady beetles and lacewings, for instance, favor aphids \u2014 but most will attack many other prey that are smaller than themselves. Some important predator species are cannibalistic; green lacewings and praying mantids are notorious for preying on younger and weaker members of their own species. The diet of most predators also includes other beneficial insects, with larger predators frequently making meals of smaller predators and parasites. As a rule, predators are predaceous regardless of their age and gender and consume pollen, nectar and other food as well as their prey . However, some species are predaceous only as larvae; as adults, they feed innocently on nectar and honeydew or aid and abet the predatory behavior of their young by laying their eggs among the prey . Lacewings are predaceous only during their immature stages. Other species are lifelong predators but change targets as they mature.72 n Manag E Ins ECts on Your Far M: a guide to Ecological strategiesPrincipal Insect Predators Spiders. Spiders are among the most neglected and least understood of predators. They rely on a complex diet of prey and can have a strong stabilizing influence on them. Because spiders are generalists and tend to kill more prey than they actually consume, they limit their preys' initial bursts of growth. Many spiders live in crop canopies but most inhabit the soil surface and climb plants. Fields with either living plants or residue as soil cover tend to harbor diverse and abundant spider populations. Up to 23 spider families have been documented in cotton and 18 species have been tallied in apples. Because such diverse populations of spiders remain relatively constant, they maintain tolerable levels of their associated prey without extinguishing them. TIPFields with either living plants or residue as soil cover tend to harbor diverse and abundant spider populations. Living mulches composed of clover or other soil plant covers attract spiders, while residue from plants like barley or rye also harbor spider populations. Lady beetles (Coccinellidae , also called ladybugs or ladybird beetles). With their shiny , half-dome bodies and active searching behavior, lady beetles are among the most visible and best known beneficial insects. More than 450 native or introduced species have been found in North America. They are easily recognized by their red or orange color with black mark - ings, although some are black with red markings and others have no mark - ings at all. Lady beetles have been used in biological control programs for more than a century and are beneficial both as adults and larvae. Most larvae are blue- black and orange and shaped like little alligators. Young larvae pierce their prey and suck out their contents. Older larvae and adults chew entire aphids. Any crop prone to aphid infestation will benefit from lady beetles, even though this predator's vision is so poor that it almost has to touch an aphid to detect it. Growers of vegetables, grains, legumes, strawberries and or - chard crops have all found lady beetles helpful in managing aphids. In its lifetime, a single beetle can eat more than 5,000 aphids. In the Great Plains, Beneficial Agents On the Farm n 73studies of greenbug pests in grain sorghum have shown that each lady beetle adult can consume almost one of these aphids per minute and dis - lodge three to five times that many from the plant, exposing the dislodged greenbugs to ground-dwelling predators. While their primary diet is aphids, lady beetles can make do with pol - len, nectar and many other types of prey , including young ladybugs. In - deed, their extensive prey range \u2014 which includes moth eggs, beetle eggs, mites, thrips and other small insects \u2014 makes lady beetles particularly valuable as natural enemies. Ground beetles (Carabidae) . Predaceous ground beetles, or carabids, belong to a large family of beneficial beetles called the Carabidae whose adults live as long as two to four years. Several thousand species reside in North America alone. Generally nocturnal, most predaceous ground beetles hide under plant litter, in soil crevices or under logs or rocks during the day . At night, their long, prominent legs allow them to sprint across the ground in pursuit of prey . Some species even climb up trees, shrubs or crops. Most adult ground beetles range in length from 0.1 to 1.3 inches (3.2- 32 mm). Their antennae are fairly threadlike and their bodies \u2014 although quite variable \u2014 are often heavy , somewhat flattened and either slightly or distinctly tapered at the head end. Some species are a brilliant or metallic purple, blue or green, but most are dark brown to black. Armed with large, sharp jaws, adult predaceous ground beetles are fero - cious. They can consume their body weight in food each day . Some cara - bids grind and eat such annual weed seeds as foxtail and velvetleaf. Larval carabids are not always predatory . In the Lebia genus, for example, adults are predators but first-instar larvae are parasites of chrysomelid beetles. (Instars are stages between successive molts.) Normally colorful, Lebia adults are just 0.1 to 0.6 inches (2.5-14 mm) long. Lebia grandis is a native and specialist predator of all immature stages of the Colorado potato beetle in cultivated potatoes in the eastern and mideastern U.S. Lacewings (Chrysoperla spp.) . Green lacewings \u2014 with their slender, pale-green bodies, large gauze-like wings and long antennae \u2014 are very common in aphid-infested crops, including cotton, sweet corn, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, asparagus, leafy greens, apples, strawberries and cole crops.74 n Manag E Ins ECts on Your Far M: a guide to Ecological strategiesThe delicate, fluttering adults feed only on nectar, pollen and aphid honeydew. About 0.5 to 0.8 inches (12-20 mm) long, they are active fliers \u2014 particularly during the evening and night, when their jewel-like golden eyes often reveal their presence around lights. The larvae \u2014 tiny gray or brown \"alligators\" whose mouthparts resem - ble ice tongs \u2014 are active predators and can be cannibalistic. Indeed, green lacewing females suspend their oval eggs singly at the ends of long silken COvER CROPS LuRE BENEFICIAL INSECTS , IMPRO vE BOTTOM LINE IN COTTONSARE-funded researchers in Georgia seeking new ways to raise healthy cotton \u2014 traditionally one of the most pest-plagued, thus one of the most chemically treated commodities \u2014 focused on attracting insects that prey on damaging pests. A group of scientists from USDA's Agricultural Research Service, the University of Georgia, and Fort Valley State University planted a variety of flowering cover crops amid cotton rows to test whether their blooms would bring earworm- and budworm-killing predators to minimize the need for insecticides. Working on seven mid- and southern Georgia cotton farms, the team eliminated one insecticide application by planting legume cover crop mixes that brought pred - ators like the pirate bug, big-eyed bug and fire ants to prey on damaging worms. Using conservation tillage to plant cotton amid the cover crops also improved yields \u2014 on average, 2,300 pounds of seed cotton compared to 1,700 pounds on control plots. (Seed cotton weight includes lint and seed before cleaning.) Growing a mix of balansa clover, crimson clover, and hairy vetch prolonged cover crop flowering from early March through late April and had the added ben - efit of out-competing weeds. \"With this range of blooming, we're able to start building the beneficial populations early in the season,\" said Harry Schomberg, an ARS ecologist and project leader. \"Reducing one application of insecticides could be pretty substantial on a larger scale like 100 acres.\" Glynn Tillman, an ARS ento - mologist who collaborated on the project, found that predator bugs moved from the cover crops into the cotton early in the season, providing more worm control. Moreover, the conservation tillage and cover crop residue resulted in more benefi - cial soil organisms that likely contributed to better cotton yields. To demonstrate their results, the team went beyond holding field days. Till - man introduced the promising cotton-cover crop-conservation tillage system to hundreds of thousands attending the Sun Belt Ag Expo in Moultrie, Ga. \"It was Beneficial Agents On the Farm n 75stalks to protect them from hatching siblings. Commonly called aphid li - ons, lacewing larvae have well-developed legs with which to lunge at their prey and long, sickle-shaped jaws they use to puncture them and inject a paralyzing venom.

They will journey up to 100 feet in search of food and can destroy as many well received,\" Tillman said, adding that she fielded many questions from growers, some calling later for more information on adopting cover crops into integrated pest management systems for cotton. Schomberg cautions that the system requires careful management. In the fall, they seeded alternating strips of cereal rye and legume cover crops. In the spring, they killed the 15-inch-wide strips of rye with an herbicide and followed by planting cotton in the same rows, using conservation tillage. \"Spacing is key,\" he said. \"You have to think about and tinker with your planting equipment.\" Killing cover crops, he added, is easier than killing a diverse population of winter weeds. Georgia researchers planted cotton into rows of legume cover crop mixes to attract insect predators to prey on damaging worms.Glynn Tillman, USDA ARS 76 n Manag E Ins ECts on Your Far M: a guide to Ecological strategiesas 200 aphids or other prey per week.

These often-underestimated \"true bugs\" are very small \u2014 a little over 0.1 inch (3 mm) long. The adults' white-patched wings extend beyond the tips of their black, somewhat oval bodies. The briskly moving nymphs are wingless, teardrop-shaped and yel - low-orange to brown. Minute pirate bugs are common on pasture, in orchards and on many agricultural crops, including cotton, peanuts, alfalfa, strawberries, peas, corn and potatoes. They feed greedily on thrips, insect eggs, aphids and small cat - erpillars and can devour 30 or more spider mites a day . Clasping their as - sorted small prey with their front legs, they repeatedly insert their needle-like beaks until they have drained their victims dry . They are prodigious consum - ers of corn earworm eggs in corn silks and also attack corn leaf aphids, potato aphids, potato leafhopper nymphs and European corn borers. Minute pirate bugs can even deliver harmless but temporarily irritating bites to humans. Because they depend on pollen and plant juices to tide them over when their preferred prey are scarce, minute pirate bugs are most prevalent near spring- and summer-flowering shrubs and weeds. Big-eyed bugs (Geocoris spp.) . Named for their characteristically large, bulging eyes, big-eyed bugs are key and frequent predators in cotton and many other U.S. crops, including warm-season vegetables. Geocoris punc - tipes and G. pallens are the most common of the roughly 19 Geocoris species found in North America. Adult big-eyed bugs \u2014 normally yellow or brown but sometimes black \u2014 are oval and small (0.12 to 0.16 inch, or 3-4 mm, long). Their un - usually broad heads are equipped with piercing, sucking mouthparts. The similarly armed nymphs look like smaller, grayer versions of the adults. Big-eyed bugs are omnivorous. Their diet includes plants but they pre - fer to prey on smaller insect and mite pests. They have been observed charging their intended victims, stabbing them quickly with their extend - ed beaks and sometimes lifting them off the ground in the process. Big-eyed bugs attack the eggs and small larvae of bollworm, pink boll - worm and tobacco budworm and most other lepidopteran pests. They also target all life stages of whiteflies, mites and aphids and the eggs and Beneficial Agents On the Farm n 77nymphs of plant bugs. Laboratory studies indicate that a ravenous, growing nymph can exterminate 1,600 spider mites or about 250 soybean looper eggs before reaching maturity; adults have bolted down 80 spider mites or four lygus bug eggs a day . Syrphid flies. Also known as hover flies because they hover and dart in flight, these brightly colored bee and wasp mimics are unusually vora - cious predators, as larvae, of aphids and other slow-moving, soft-bodied insects. Depending on the species, many syrphid flies over-winter, giving rise to adults in spring. Adult syrphid flies feed on pollen, nectar and aphid honeydew. Each female lays hundreds of white, football-shaped eggs, about 0.04 inch (1 mm) long, amidst aphid colonies. The narrow, tapered slug-like larvae that hatch from these eggs can pierce and drain up to 400 aphids apiece during the two to three weeks it takes them to complete development. Unable to perceive their prey except through direct contact, syrphid fly larvae find their dinners by flinging their forward ends from side to side. Parasitoids Most parasitoids \u2014 parasitic insects that kill their hosts \u2014 live freely and independently as adults; they are lethal and dependent only in their im - mature stages. Parasitoids can be specialists, targeting either a single host species or several related species, or they can be generalists, attacking many types of hosts. T ypically , they attack hosts larger than themselves, eating most or all of their hosts' bodies before pupating inside or outside them. When the parasitoid emerges from its pupa as an adult, it usually nour - ishes itself on honeydew, nectar or pollen \u2014 although some adults make meals of their host's body fluids and others require additional water. Adult female parasitoids quickly seek out more victims in which to lay their host- killing eggs. With their uncanny ability to locate even sparsely populated hosts using chemical cues, parasitoid adults are much more efficient than predators at ferreting out their quarry . Different parasitoids can victimize different life stages of the same host, although specific parasitoids usually limit themselves to one stage. Thus, parasitoids are classified as egg parasitoids, larval (nymphal) parasitoids or adult parasitoids. Some parasitoids lay their eggs in one life stage of a 78 n Manag E Ins ECts on Your Far M: a guide to Ecological strategiesInternal Internal Internal Internal Internal or external Internal Internal or external Internal External Internal or external Internal Internal Internal Internal or external Internal (mostly)Table 4 Common Parasitoids* * See Key to Beneficials and Pests, pp. 50-54.ORDER FAMILY HOST OR PREY MODE OF ATTACK Diptera (true flies) Hymenoptera termites, flies, others Scale insects Flies mealybugs, aphids Moth eggs True bugs, flies, beetles, leafhopper eggs Eggs of true bugs and moths Larvae of beetles, caterpillars, wasps Larvae sawfliesBeneficial Agents On the Farm n 79victim but emerge at a later life stage. Parasitoids are also classified as either ectoparasites or endoparasites depending, respectively , on whether they feed externally on their hosts or develop inside them. Their life cycle is commonly short, ranging from 10 days to four weeks. Principal Parasitoids Dipteran flies. Entomologists have described more than 18,000 species of dipteran, or fly , parasites, which have diversified over an expansive range of hosts (Table 5). Unlike parasitic wasps, most species of parasitic flies lack a hardened structure with which to deposit eggs inside their hosts. Instead, they lay their eggs or larvae on plants, where the parasitoid larvae can easily penetrate the host but also where their target victims can eat them. Individual species of parasitic flies are extraordinarily capable of sur - viving on many kinds of foods. The tachinid Compsilura concinnata, for example, has been successfully reared from more than 100 host species and three different host orders. Members of other Diptera families \u2014 such Populations of the ichneumonid parasitoid, Bathyplectes curculionis, and its prey, the alfalfa weevil, fluctuate throughout the growing season.

For both natural and applied biological control, the chal - cid wasps of the superfamily Chalcidoidea are among North America's most important insect groups. About 20 families and 2,000-plus species have been found on the continent \u2014 among the smallest of insects. Because they are so diminutive, chalcid wasps are often underestimated in their numbers and effectiveness.

They parasitize a great number of pests, and different species attack different stages of the same host. The following six families have proven especially useful in managing pests. Fairyflies (Mymaridae) . At between 0.008 and 0.04 inches (0.2-1 mm) long, these smallest of the world's insects can fly through the eye of a needle. Viewed under the microscope, the back wings of fairyflies contain distinctive long hairs. Fairyflies parasitize the eggs of other insects \u2014 commonly flies, beetles, booklice and leafhoppers. Many fairyfly species, especially those belonging to the genus Anaphes, play crucial roles in biological control. The intro - duced egg parasite A. flavipes, for example, is one of two parasites that have been established for cereal leaf beetle management in small grains. In pes - ticide-free California vineyards with ground vegetation, the tiny Anagrus epos wasp can make a densities. Trichogramma wasps (Trichogrammatidae) . Trichogramma wasps are the most widely released natural enemies. The tiny female wasp \u2014 gener - ally less than 0.04 inch (1 mm) long \u2014 lays an egg inside a recently laid host egg, which blackens as the larva develops. The host range of many Trichogramma wasps spans numerous species and families of insects. Moths, butterflies, beetles, flies, wasps and true bugs are all frequent victims. Some Trichogramma wasps even use their wings in a rowing motion to reach aquatic hosts. Among commercially available species in the U.S. are T. minutum, T. platneri and T. pretiosum, which are released into fields on cards loaded with the parasitized eggs of non-pest hosts. Some foreign species \u2014 in - cluding T. ostriniae, T. nubilale and T. brassicae \u2014 also are being evaluated for augmentation biocontrol against corn borers. Eulophid wasps (Eulophidae) . Eulophid wasps number more than 600 in North America, making theirs one of the largest chalcid families. About 0.04 to 0.12 inches (1-3 mm) long, they are often brilliant metallic blue or green. Some species of eulophids are mite predators while others attack spider egg cases, scale insects and thrips. Most eulophids, however, parasitize flies, 82 n Manag E Ins ECts on Your Far M: a guide to Ecological strategiesother wasps or the larvae or pupae of beetles or moths. Leaf-mining and wood-boring insects are frequent hosts. Eulophids destroy many major crop pests. In the Midwest alone, Sympi - esis marylandensis is an important parasite of spotted tentiform leafminer in apples. Diglyphus isaea \u2014 available commercially \u2014 is a primary parasite of agromyzid leafminers in greenhouses. Edovum puttleri attacks the eggs of Colorado potato beetles. Finally , Pediobius foveolatus \u2014 introduced from India and also available commercially \u2014 parasitizes Mexican bean beetle larvae. Pteromalid wasps (Pteromalidae) . This large family of wasps assaults many types of insects, including the larvae of moths, flies, beetles and wasps. Several pteromalids target scale insects and mealybugs and some even act as \"hyperparasitoids\" \u2014 parasitizing other parasites within their hosts. In the upper Midwest, Pteromalus puparum is a key enemy of imported cabbageworm pupae, each of which can involuntarily host more than 200 Pteromalus offspring. Anisopteromalus calandrae , which attacks the larvae of beetles that infest stored grain, impressed scientists several decades ago with its ability to suppress 96 percent of rice weevils in wheat spillage in Most parasitoids used in the biological control of insect pests are either Diptera flies-especial - ly from the family Tachinidae\u2014or Hymenop - tera wasps from the superfamilies Chalcidoi - dea, Ichneumonoidea and Proctotrupoidea (Table 4). Parasitoid diversity is directly related to plant diversity: different crops, ground cov - ers, weeds and adjacent vegetation support different pests, which in turn attract their own groups of parasitoids. In large-scale monocultures, parasitoid diversity is in less-disturbed and pesticide-free agroecosystems, it is not unusual to find 11 to15 species of parasitoids hard at work. In many cases, just one or two species of parasitoids within these complexes prove vital to the natural biological control of primary insect pests. In California's alfalfa fields, the braconid wasp Cotesia medicaginis plays a pivotal role in regulating the alfalfa caterpillar.

A. calandrae can now be purchased for release in grain storage and handling facilities. Encyrtid wasps (Encyrtidae) . Responsible for much of the classical biological control of scale insects and mealybugs in fruit trees, this impor - tant family of natural enemies encompasses about 400 species in the U.S. and Canada. Its extensive host range includes soft scales, armored scales, mealybugs and the eggs or larvae of insects in about 15 families of beetles, 10 families of flies and 20 families of moths and butterflies. Several commercially available encyrtids now help manage scale and mealybugs in greenhouses: for black, hemispherical, nigra, citricola, brown soft and soft scales. Other noteworthy encyrtids include Ooencyrtus kuwanae , an introduced parasite of gypsy moth eggs, and Copidosoma floridanum , a native parasite of cabbage wasps (Aphelinidae) . The effectiveness of aphelinids in managing scale insects has earned them one of the best reputations in bio - logical control. They also destroy mealybugs, whiteflies, aphids and other families of Homoptera. Aphelinus greenbugs, A. mali targets the woolly apple aphid, and members of the genus Eretmocerus attack silverleaf whitefly . Enca rsia formosa, in commercial use since the 1920s, is now released into greenhouses worldwide ; it kills almost 100 greenhouse whitefly nymphs during its 12-day life span. Principal Insect Pathogens Just like humans and other vertebrates, insects are susceptible to many disease-causing organisms known as pathogens. Thousands of species of bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa and nematodes can sicken or kill insects. Even if the insects survive, the pathogens' \"sub-lethal\" effects can keep their victims from feeding or reproducing. Bacteria. Most bacteria infect specific insect orders. Some naturally oc - curring insect-pathogenic bacteria have been isolated and mass-produced for commercial use. One of these, Bacillus thuringiensis or Bt, is the world's most widely applied biological control agent. It exerts its toxicity only after 84 n Manag E Ins ECts on Your Far M: a guide to Ecological strategiesOrganic farmers have expressed concerns about the widespread use of plants engi - neered to contain Bt. They note that normal applications of Bt \u2014 one-time, high-level doses \u2014 may kill some nontarget insects, but plants with Bt in their stalks, leaves and pollen can poison nontarget insects \u2014 including beneficials \u2014 throughout the growing season. Not only may Bt crops potentially reduce biological diversity, say ecologists and organic growers, but these engineered plants also increase the risk of pests developing resistance. That would remove a major weapon in an organic farmer's arsenal. For more information on the pros and cons of Bt crops, see http://www. bt.ucsd.edu/, http://www.ota.com/organic/benefits/generic.html, and/or http: //www.soybean.com/gmoarg.htm.Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) plant-eating insects actually consume it. A highly dense protein crystal, the Bt toxin kills victims by first paralyzing their mid-gut, then their entire bodies. Like most other bacterial pathogens, Bt is specific to certain insect orders. Its short residual period also makes it an ideal candidate for pest management in fruits and vegetables. Fungi. Although an estimated 700-plus species of fungi can infect in - sects, fewer than 20 have been developed for insect management. Most in - sect-pathogenic fungi need cool, moist environments to germinate. Com - pared to most other insect pathogens, they have an extensive host range. Beauveria bassiana, for example, can help manage beetles, ants, termites, true bugs, grasshoppers, mosquitoes and mites as well as other arthropod pests. It unleashes a toxin that weakens its host's immune system, then over - whelms its dead host's intestinal bacteria with an antibiotic. The tell-tale sign of B. bassiana's carnage is its victim's \"white bloom\" of fungal spores. Fungi can invade their insect host through natural openings in its cu - ticle. Thus, hosts need not consume pathogens but only come into direct contact with them. Although some fungi can take up to several weeks to kill their hosts, most infected insects die within three to seven days. Viruses. Most viruses that attack insects belong to a group called nucle - ar polyhedrosis viruses or NPVs. Their victims are usually young larvae of Beneficial Agents On the Farm n 85butterflies and moths, which become infected by eating NPV particles and typically die within several weeks. Some infected larvae hang limply from the tops of crop canopies, prompting the common name \"caterpillar wilt\" or \"tree top\" disease. Prevailing environmental factors heavily influence the insect-killing ef - ficiencies of viruses. For example, they are adversely affected by sunlight, while the relatively slow speed at which they kill has also hindered their widespread acceptance for biocontrol. Nematodes. Nearly 40 known families of nematodes parasitize and consume insects and other arthropods. Some are hunter-cruisers while others are ambushers. The most beneficial of these \"entomopathogenic\" nematodes belong to the Heterorhabditidae and Steinernematidae families. Both families are \"obligate\" parasites: their survival depends on their hosts and on the symbiotic relationships the nematodes have evolved with dis - ease-causing Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus bacteria. Parasitic nematodes transport bacteria inside their host, penetrating the host via the mouth, anus, spiracles or cuticle. Once inside, the nematodes release the bacteria, which quickly multiply and kill the host. In turn, the nematode uses the bacteria and insect cadaver for food and shelter, matur - ing, mating and reproducing inside it. Infective-stage juvenile nematodes eventually emerge from the cadaver and seek out another host. Because they are highly mobile and can locate and destroy new victims in just a few days, entomopathogenic nematodes make outstanding can - didates for all kinds of biological control. Some are applied to soils to suc - cessfully manage the underground life stages of insect pests.866 Agroecology \u2014 the science that underlies sustainable farming \u2014 integrates the conservation of biodiversity with the produc - tion of food. It promotes diversity which in turn sustains a farm's soil fertility , productivity and crop protection. Innovative approaches that make agriculture both more sustainable and more productive are flourishing around the world. While trade-offs be - tween agricultural productivity and biodiversity seem stark, exciting op - portunities for synergy arise when you adopt one or more of the following strategies: n Modify your soil, water and vegetative resource management by limit - ing external inputs and emphasizing organic matter accumulation, nutrient recycling, conservation and diversity . n Replace agrichemical applications with more resource-efficient meth - ods of managing nutrients and pest populations. n Mimic natural ecosystems by adopting cover crops, polycultures and agroforestry in diversified designs that include useful trees, shrubs and perennial grasses. n Conserve such reserves of biodiversity as vegetationally rich hedge - rows, forest patches and fallow fields. n Develop habitat networks that connect farms with surrounding eco - systems, such as corridors that allow natural enemies and other ben - eficial biota to circulate into fields.Putting It All Together Putting it All Together n 87Different farming systems and agricultural settings call for different combinations of those key strategies. In intensive, larger-scale cropping systems, eliminating pesticides and providing habitat diversity around field borders and in corridors are likely to contribute most substantially to biodiversity . On smaller-scale farms, organic management \u2014 with crop rotations and diversified polyculture designs \u2014 may be more appropriate and effective. Generalizing is impossible: Every farm has its own particular features, and its own particular promise. Designing a Habitat Management Strategy The most successful examples of ecologically based pest management sys - tems are those that have been derived and fine-tuned by farmers to fit their particular circumstances. To design an effective plan for successful habitat management, first gather as much information as you can. Make a list of the most economically damaging pests on your farm. For each pest, try to find out: n What are its food and habitat requirements? n What factors influence its abundance? n When does it enter the field and from where? Growing rye between vineyard rows suppresses weeds and attracts beneficial insects such as lady beetles to this Monterey County, Calif., vineyard.Chuck Ingels, Univ. of Calif.88 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesn What attracts it to the crop? n How does it develop in the crop and when does it become economi - cally damaging? n What are its most important predators, parasites and pathogens? n What are the primary needs of those beneficial organisms? n Where do these beneficials over-winter, when do they appear in the field, where do they come from, what attracts them to the crop, how do they develop in the crop and what keeps them in the field? n When do the beneficials' critical resources \u2014 nectar, pollen, alterna - tive hosts and prey \u2014 appear and how long are they available? Are alternate food sources accessible nearby and at the right times? Which native annuals and perennials can compensate for critical gaps in tim - ing, especially when prey are scarce? n See Resources p. 104 and/or contact your county extension agent to help answer these questions. CAUTION! Converting to organic production is no guarantee that your fields will be pest-free, even if you surround them with natural vegetation. Pest levels are site-specific: they depend on which plants are present, which insects are associated with them and how you manage both. The examples below illustrate specific management options to address specific pest problems: n In England, a group of scientists learned that important beneficial predators of aphids in wheat over-wintered in grassy hedgerows along the edges of fields. However, these predators migrated into the crop too late in the spring to manage aphids located deep in the field. After the researchers planted a 3-foot strip of bunch grasses in the center of the field, populations of over-wintering predators soared and aphid damage was minimized. n Many predators and parasites require alternative hosts during their life cycles. Lydella thompsoni, a tachinid fly that parasitizes European corn borer, emerges before corn borer larvae are available in the spring and completes its first generation on common stalk borer in - stead. Clean farming practices that eliminate stalk borers are thought to contribute to this tachinid fly's decline.Putting it All Together n 89FIne-TunInG FArM MAnAGeMenT To enh AnCe sPeCIFIC bene FICIA lsThe principles discussed in this book will lead to a healthier, more diverse farm sys - tem overall. As you identify and address specific pest problems, you can fine-tune your farming practices to attract, retain or enhance populations of beneficials for your specific situation. Answer the questions on page 88 about the specific pest, its needs and habits. Much of this information is still being developed or confirmed by sci - entists and farmers. Even though answers aren't always at hand, a body of knowledge that farmers can apply is building. n Alternative prey also may be important in building up predator num - bers before the predator's target prey \u2014 the crop pest \u2014 appears. Lady beetles and minute pirate bugs can eventually consume many European corn borer eggs, but they can't do it if alternative prey aren't available to them before the corn borers lay their eggs. n High daytime soil temperatures may limit the activity of ground- dwelling predators, including spiders and ground beetles. Cover crops or intercrops may help reduce soil temperatures and extend the time those predators are active. Crop residues, mulches and grassy field borders can offer the same benefits. Similarly , many parasites need moderate temperatures and higher relative humidity and must escape fields in the heat of day to find shelter in shady areas. For example, a parasitic wasp that attacks European corn borers is most active at field edges near woody areas, which provide shade, cooler temperatures and nectar-bearing or honeydew-coated flowering plants. Enhancing Biota and Improving Soil Health Managing soil for improved health demands a long-term commitment to us - ing combinations of soil-enhancing practices. The strategies listed below can aid you in inhibiting pests, stimulating natural enemies and \u2014 by alleviating plant stress \u2014 fortifying crops' abilities to resist or compete with pests. 90 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesn Add plentiful amounts of organic materials from cover crops and other crop residues as well as from off-field sources like animal manures and composts. Because different organic materials have different effects on a soil's biological, physical and chemical properties, be sure to use a vari - ety of sources. For example, well-decomposed compost may suppress crop diseases, but it does not enhance soil aggregation in the short run. Dairy cow manure, on the other hand, rapidly stimulates soil aggregation. n Keep soils covered with living vegetation and/or crop residue. Residue protects soils from moisture and temperature extremes. For example, residue allows earthworms to adjust gradually to decreasing tempera - tures, reducing their mortality . By enhancing rainfall infiltration, resi - due also provides more water for crops. n Reduce tillage intensity . Excessive tillage destroys the food sources and micro-niches on which beneficial soil organisms depend. When you reduce your tillage and leave more residues on the soil surface, you create a more stable environment, slow the turnover of nutrients and encourage more diverse communities of decomposers.CAUTION! When designing fields to manage specific pests, other pests can reach damaging levels. For example, spacing crops closely can prompt disease outbreaks. Compost, judiciously applied, can replace mineral fertilizers and feed beneficial soil organisms. Greg Porter, Univ. of Maine Putting it All Together n 91n Adopt other practices that reduce erosion, such as strip cropping along contours. Erosion damages soil health by removing topsoil that is rich in organic matter. n Alleviate the severity of compaction. Staying off soils that are too wet, distributing loads more uniformly and using controlled traffic lanes \u2014 including raised beds \u2014 all help reduce compaction. n Use best management practices to supply nutrients to plants without polluting water. Make routine use of soil and plant tissue tests to de - termine the need for nutrient applications. Avoid applying large doses of available nutrients \u2014 especially nitrogen \u2014 before planting. To the greatest extent possible, rely on soil organic matter and organic amendments to supply nitrogen. If you must use synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, add it in smaller quantities several times during the season. Once soil tests are in the optimal range, try to balance the amount of nutrients supplied with the amount used by the crops. n Leave areas of the farm untouched as habitat for plant and animal diversity . Individual soil-improving practices have multiple effects on the agro - ecosystem. When you use cover crops intensively , you supply nitrogen to Frank bibin of Quitman, Ga., checks a house he built in his pecan orchard to attract predatory wasps. Preston Roland 92 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesthe following crop, soak up leftover soil nitrates, increase soil organisms and improve crop health. You reduce runoff, erosion, soil compaction and plant- parasitic nematodes. You also suppress weeds, deter diseases and inoculate future crops with beneficial mycorrhizae. Flowering cover crops also harbor beneficial insects. Strategies for Enhancing Plant Diversity As described, increasing above-ground biodiversity will enhance the natu - ral defenses of your farming system. Use as many of these tools as possible to design a diverse landscape: n Diversify enterprises by including more species of crops and livestock. n Use legume-based crop rotations and mixed pastures. n Intercrop or strip-crop annual crops where feasible. n Mix varieties of the same crop. n Use varieties that carry many genes \u2014 rather than just one or two \u2014 for tolerating a particular insect or disease. n Emphasize open-pollinated crops over hybrids for their adaptability to local environments and greater genetic diversity . n Grow cover crops in orchards, vineyards and crop fields. n Leave strips of wild vegetation at field edges. n Provide corridors for wildlife and beneficial insects. n Practice agroforestry , combining trees or shrubs with crops or live - stock to improve habitat continuity for natural enemies. n Plant microclimate-modifying trees and native plants as windbreaks or hedgerows. n Provide a source of water for birds and insects. n Leave areas of the farm untouched as habitat for plant and animal di - versity . As you work toward improved soil health and pest management, don't concentrate on any one strategy to the exclusion of others. Instead, combine as many strategies as make sense on your farm. Nationwide, producers are finding that the triple strategies of good crop rotations, reduced tillage and routine use of cover crops impart many benefits. Adding other strategies \u2014 such as animal manures and composts, improved nutrient management and compaction-minimizing techniques \u2014 provides even more.Putting it All Together n 93Rolling out your Strategy Once you have a thorough knowledge of the characteristics and needs of key pests and natural enemies, you're ready to begin designing a habitat- management strategy specifically for your farm. n Choose plants that offer multiple benefits \u2014 for example, ones that improve soil fertility , weed suppression and pest regulation \u2014 and that don't disrupt desirable farming practices. n Avoid potential conflicts. In California, planting blackberries around vineyards boosts populations of grape leafhopper parasites but can also exacerbate populations of the blue-green sharpshooter that spreads the vinekilling Pierce's disease. n In locating your selected plants and diversification designs over space and time, use the scale \u2014 field- or landscape-level \u2014 that is most consistent with your intended results. n And, finally , keep it simple. Your plan should be easy and inexpensive to implement and maintain, and you should be able to modify it as your needs change or your results warrant. In this book, we have presented ideas and principles for designing and implementing healthy , pest-resilient farming systems. We have explained why reincorporating complexity and diversity is the first step toward sus - tainable pest management. Finally , we have described the pillars of agro - ecosystem health (Figure 1, p. 9): n Fostering crop habitats that support beneficial fauna n Developing soils rich in organic matter and microbial activity Throughout, we have emphasized the advantages of polycultures over monocultures and, particularly , of reduced- or no-till perennial systems over intensive annual cropping schemes. Nationwide, producers are finding that the triple strategies of good crop rotations, reduced tillage and routine use of cover crops impart many benefits.94 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesPreven TIve MAnAGeMenT PRE-sEAson ThRoUGh PlAnTInG TIME (building internal strengths into the system) 6.

Without hefty bills for agrichemicals at planting \u2014 and with an effective year-round marketing program \u2014 his cash flow is more stable than it was in the mid-1980s, before he began converting his 3,000 acres to organic. The north central Montana dryland farm sells its organic barley , buckwheat and wheats \u2014 hard red winters, durums and hard red and soft white springs \u2014 for at least 50 percent more, on average, than conventional farms do. It also produces organic lentils and \u2014 under Quinn's Kamut\u00ae brand \u2014 the ancient Egyptian wheat khorasan. With fewer inputs and higher-value outputs, Quinn added a partner \u2014 Thad Willis \u2014 and another thousand acres. The expanded operation, now farmed entirely by Willis, supports two families instead of one. \"That's a different direction than most of agriculture is going,\" says Quinn. Indeed. rotation, rotation, rotation Quinn attributes the farm's profitability to its soil-building, pest-thwart - ing, four- to five-year rotations. Its alfalfa, clover and grains are thick with predaceous lady beetles, and its last serious insect infestation was 15 years ago. \"Most people can't believe it,\" he says. \"For many years, people thought I was spraying at night. They couldn't believe anyone could succeed without chemicals.\" Similarly , the viral diseases and root rots that used to sicken the farm's grains are \"mostly gone,\" and pathogens flare only in the rare year when pre-harvest rains fuel black tip fungus in highly susceptible khorasan fields. 96 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesPutting it All Together n 97The farm's green-manure based weed-control \"works as well as conventional spraying,\" Quinn says: kochia has nearly dis - appeared (\"I think it needs highly soluble nitrogen to compete with wheat\"), wild oat seeds germinate more sparsely (\"They're a problem for us, but not nearly as much as you would expect with no chemicals\") and thistle is contained. Fanweed and mustards \u2014 which the partners unfortunately see more often now than they used to \u2014 succumb to the cultivator or to switchbacks between spring to fall planting. \"For many years, people thought I was spraying at night. They couldn't believe anyone could succeed without chemicals.\" With no large livestock operations nearby to supply manure, the farm's \"primary and only\" instrument of soil improvement is green ma - nure. In high-moisture years, that means weed-throttling alfalfa \u2014 un - derseeded in a grain crop the first year, hayed the second year and in - corporated into the soil the third year. In intermediate-moisture years, the partners plant less-thirsty sweet clover with a companion grain the first growing season and disk or plow it under the second. In really dry years, they sow green-manure peas in the fall or green-manure lentils in the spring, turning them under by the first of June. \"I think the rotation and soil-building program we have in place al - lows a great diversity in soil biology , and that's what keeps the pests in place,\" Quinn says. In their grain storages, Quinn and Willis dissuade pests with cool, drying air and with a dusting of insect-shredding diatomaceous earth laced with tempting pheromones. After they load their grain into bins, they level off the cones to eliminate peaks in which pest-supporting moisture and heat can concentrate. kamut\u00ae: world markets for local product Because of his frequent and direct contacts with consumers, Quinn says he no longer thinks of himself as a commodity producer but in - stead as a grower of life- and health-sustaining food. He promotes and researches his Kamut\u00ae wheat worldwide when he's not developing a 100-megawatt wind farm in central Montana.

They are used in more than 400 kinds of products \u2014 primari - ly cereals in the U.S., breads in northern Europe and tarts, pastries and pastas in southern Europe. The Egyptian government has dis - couraged production of that nation's na - tive khorasan wheat because of its low yield potential \u2014 a problem in Egypt's high-input, modern irrigation systems. That's not an issue in north central Mon - tana, where dryland fields don't have high yield potential to begin with. That's precisely why khorasan is such a good fit, Quinn says. A 500-mile diameter area carved out of north central and northeastern Montana, southern Sas - katchewan and southern Alberta is also the least likely to get rain when Kamut\u00ae wheat is most vulnerable to black tip \u2014 a dark discoloration of the germ end of otherwise healthy wheat kernels. Rather than try to develop resistance to black tip, Quinn has used a post-harvest color sorter to \"knock out the worst of it\" when it oc - curs. \"I'm not sure I want to breed in resistance,\" he says. \"We like the wheat the way it is and don't want to take a chance on losing any of its wonderful qualities. So we've chosen not to tamper with it, to grow it in regions of the world where it's most successful and to be satisfied with lower yields.\" Besides, he notes, the lower numbers of bushels can be offset with higher prices. real results, real independence, real fun Despite the partners' profitability , Quinn says only a handful of farmers in their area have adopted similar practices. \"It's hard for a lot of people to change what they're doing,\" he says. \"There are a lot of unknowns in this, and there's also a transition period when you will certainly ex - perience lower yields without getting the organic premium.\" There's another reason, too: The word being spread by agrichemical companies bob Quinn's last serious insect infestation was 15 years ago. 98 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesPutting it All Together n 99\u2014 and still coming down through traditional educational circles \u2014 is \"that this it not real.\" It's real all right, says Quinn, but it's certainly not real easy . \"It takes a lot more management and thinking ahead. So if you aren't careful with your weeds, you can easily let them get ahead of you, and if you aren't careful with your rotations, the system won't work properly .\" Farmers who make it work, however, find they are working directly for their customers rather than for Uncle Sam. \"It puts us in a position to be paid a livelihood by the consumers rather than relying on govern - ment payments \u2014 and I think that's a very big plus,\" says Quinn. Besides, he adds, \"It really brought the fun back into farming.\" Putting it All Together n 99100 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategiesUniversal Principles, Farm-Specific Strategies The key challenge for farmers in the 21st century is to translate the prin - ciples of agroecology into practical systems that meet the needs of their farming communities and ecosystems. You can apply these principles through various techniques and strategies, each of which will affect your farm differently , depending on local opportunities and resources and, of course, on markets. Some options may include both annual and perennial crops, while others do not. Some may transcend field and farm to encom - pass windbreaks, shelterbelts and living fences. Well-considered and well- implemented strategies for soil and habitat management lead to diverse and abundant \u2014 although not always sufficient \u2014 populations of natural enemies. GuIdel Ines For des IGnInG heAlThy And PesT-res IlIenT FArMInG sys TeMsn Increase species in time and space with crop rotations, polycultures, agroforestry and crop-livestock systems. n Expand genetic diversity with variety mixtures, local germplasm and multilines (or varieties that contain several different genes for resistance to a particular pest). In each case, the crop represents a genetically diverse array that can better withstand disease and pests. n Conserve or introduce natural enemies and antagonists with habitat enhancement or augmentative releases. n boost soil biotic activity and improve soil structure with regular applications of organic matter. n Enhance nutrient recycling with legumes and livestock. n Maintain vegetative cover with reduced tillage, cover crops or mulches. n Enhance landscape diversity with biological corridors, vegetationally diverse crop-field boundaries or mosaics of agroecosystems.Putting it All Together n 101As you develop a healthier, more pest-resilient system for your farm, ask yourself: n How can I increase species diversity to improve pest management, compensate for pest damage and make fuller use of resources? n How can I extend the system's longevity by including woody plants that capture and recirculate nutrients and provide more sustained support for beneficials? n How can I add more organic matter to activate soil biology , build soil nutrition and improve soil structure? n Finally , how can I diversify my landscape with mosaics of agroecosys - tems in different stages of succession? Because locally adapted varieties and species can create specific genetic resilience, rely on local biodiversity , synergies and dynamics as much as you can. Use the principles of agroecology to intensify your farm's effi - ciency , maintain its productivity , preserve its biodiversity and enhance its self-sustaining capacity .102 n Manage Insects on Your Far M: a guide to ecological strategies10 Indicators of Soil Quality Assign a value from 1 to 10 for each indicator, and then average all 10 indicators.

FritzMANAGE INSECTS On Your Farm A Guide to Ecological Strategies Farmers, ranchers and scientists around the world are developing and imple - menting new strategies to address insect problems. They are redesigning their farms based on \"ecologically based\" pest management, the use of multiple strat - egies that aim to manage rather than control insect pest populations. In this book, examples of successful pest man - agement strategies will stim ulate your ideas to minimize insect damage, put \"good bugs\" to work for you and create healthy soils and healthy plants. Use this book as a stepping stone to develop a more complex, diverse sys - tem on your farm or ranch. Learn about: n Increasing above-ground and below- ground diversity n Enhancing plants' natural defenses against pests n Attracting beneficial insects n Managing soil to minimize crop pests \"Well written and illustrated, Manage Insects on Your Farm provides both a framework for understanding ecologically based pest management as well as many of the useful details to help minimize insect pest problems. \" \u2014 Fred Magdoff, soil scientist, University of Vermont \"The book's emphasis on ecological pest management practices fills a void and provides the kind of research-based information farmers crave. The solid discussion of ecological principles, backed up by farm profiles and strategies in a variety of cropping systems and geographic regions, gives me the ideas I need to design strategies to help farmers in my region.
