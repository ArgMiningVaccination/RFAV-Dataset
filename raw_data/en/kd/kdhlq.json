Since 1985, LIFE STAR has been saving lives in Connecticut and beyond, making sure patients in critical or emergency care situations receive the highest level of patient care. LIFE STAR, which has bases in Norwich and Hartford, operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, transporting more than 1,200 patients each year. Hartford Medical Group and MidState Medical Group Receive Highest Recognition Both Hartford Medical Group (HMG) and MidState Medical Group (MMG) are pleased to announce their recent recognition as a Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH), the highest recognition by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). PCMH is a team-based model of care led by a personal physician who provides continuous and coordinated care throughout a patient's life. The PCMH practice is responsible for providing for all of a patient's health care needs or appropriately arranging care with other qualified professionals. This in- cludes the provision of preventive services, treatment of acute and chronic illness, and assistance with end-of-life issues. 2More than half of American adults drink coffee every day. The energy-boosting ingredient in coffee is one of nature's earliest known stimulants: caffeine. When we're tired, our bodies re - lease a chemical called adenosine that makes us feel drowsy. Caffeine fools the brain by binding to adenosine re - ceptors, jump-starting the nerve cells and triggering a surge of revitalizing adrenaline. A typical cup of coffee contains roughly 200 mg of caffeine. Stressed- out and sleep-deprived Americans drink about 2.6 cups of coffee a day, which adds up to 45 million pounds of coffee each year. Caffeine's power to reduce physi - cal fatigue and increase alertness ac-counts for its role as the world's most widely used psychostimulant drug. In some individuals, however, coffee's energizing advantages may be outweighed by its drawbacks. Caffeine-sensitive individuals often experience anxiety, restlessness or wakefulness after only a cup or two. People who have trouble sleeping should avoid caffeine in the second half of the day because the potent alkaloid stays in the brain for up to eight hours. \"Patients sometimes complain about extra heart beats after drink - ing coffee,\" says cardiologist Donna M. Polk, M.D., director of Preventive Cardiology at Hartford Hospital. \"Ask your doctor about caffeine if you have cardiac arrhythmia or high blood pressure.\" Headache Help Does caffeine cause or cure a headache? Before being stricken with a migraine, headache sufferers often experience visual disturbances, diz - ziness, nausea or vomiting. Some mi - graine sufferers report that they can stave off a looming headache with a strong cup of coffee. \"Caffeine can prevent a headache,\" says neurologist Tanya R. Bilchik, M.D., of the Hartford Headache Center, \"but it's a double-edged sword. Caffeine withdrawal gives you a worse headache, so then you drink more coffee.\" In one small controlled study, researchers found that caffeine alone was as effective as acetaminophen at relieving tension headaches. \"Caffeine is often combined with other drugs to treat cluster and migraine head - aches,\" says Dr. Bilchik. \"Both over- the-counter and prescription head - ache remedies contain the stimulant, which has been shown to increase the effectiveness of both aspirin and acetaminophen (Tylenol).\" Caffeine's effects on the brain vary enormously depending on how often it's consumed. Studies of dependency show that daily coffee drinkers are motivated more by avoidance of the punishing withdrawal symptoms than by craving for caffeine's stimu - lating effects. More than 85 percent of Americans consume caffeine ev - ery day. Genetic factors leave some individuals especially vulnerable to developing caffeine dependency. As tolerance builds up, the brain begins to crave the anticipated rush of en - ergy. Skipping the daily coffee ritual swells blood flow in the brain, trigger - ing a ferocious headache. Mood and Mind Coffee may provide more than a fleeting rush of energy. \"Our results support a possible protective ef - fect of caffeine, mainly from coffee consumption, on risk of depression,\" wrote Harvard University research - ers who followed more than 50,000 women for 10 years as part of the Nurses Health Study. Women who routinely consumed two to three cups of coffee daily had a 15 percent lower risk of depression in comparison with non-coffee drinkers, while those who drank more than four cups a day had a 20 percent lower risk. A 2008 French study in the journal Neurology found that women who drank three or more cups of coffee a day were 30 percent less likely to have memory problems at age 65 than those who consumed one cup or less. Researchers theorize that caffeine acts as a cognitive stimulant. Memory decline was 70 percent less likely in women over 80 who drank three or more cups daily. Coffee consumption may also protect against Parkinson's disease. Although further research is necessary to confirm the connection, several large studies have linked high caffeine intake with reduced risk of developing the pro - gressive neurological disorder. About a quarter of the population has a specific gene that makes them likely to benefit from experimental drugs that mimic the effects of caffeine on the brain.A Jolt of Java Invigorates the Brain 3Dr. Robert Gallagher and the da Vinci robotic surgical system.Thoracic SurgeryThe da Vinci Robot's Newest Frontier: 44It's been an eventful year for Bob Fusco, who first learned about robotic surgery after a sudden heart attack last March. The emergency cardiac team at Hartford Hospital's Chest Pain Center quickly opened his blocked coronary artery and placed a stent, which saved his life. But another major vessel on the front of his heart could not be treated with angioplasty. Bob was scheduled for a robotic-assisted coronary artery bypass through the left side of his chest. During the work-up in preparation for the procedure, physicians discovered a mass in the upper lobe of his right lung. After undergoing his first successful robotic procedure in May, he left the hospital and immediately began cardiac rehab in preparation for his next robotic procedure\u2014removal of the lobe of the lung that contained the tumor. Thanks to his quick recovery from bypass surgery, the Glastonbury resident was convinced of the advantages of robotic surgery. \"It's amazing how swiftly I recovered,\" he recalls. \"I was in the hospital for four days with only minimal pain.\" As Bob was strengthening his heart with 36 sessions of stationary biking and treadmill running, Hartford Hospital surgeons were preparing to extend the robot's reach to the other side of his chest. Although minimally invasive techniques have revolutionized nearly every surgical specialty, the chest has remained a challenge. In October, Bob underwent a non-cardiac thoracic (chest) procedure called a lobectomy to remove the tumor. After the right upper lobe was successfully removed with robotic-assisted surgery, he again made a rapid recovery and was out of the hospital in only four days. Hartford Hospital surgeons have pioneered many innovative robotic proce - dures since 2003, when Hartford Hospital became the first medical center in Connecticut to acquire the revolutionary da Vinci robot. Smaller scars, less pain, minimal blood loss and a speedy recovery have spurred the rapid growth of minimally invasive surgery in recent years. Minimally invasive techniques allow physicians to perform life-saving surgery with far less risk of blood loss or infection than conventional \"open\" methods. Robotic-assisted techniques have revolutionized surgical control and precision, allowing complex procedures to be performed through very small incisions. Surgeons avoid cutting deeply into underlying muscles, instead making small slits, or ports, in the skin and inserting instruments and a fiberoptic camera through the tiny ports. Slipping a flexible scope tipped with a camera through a \"keyhole\" in the ribs disrupts sensitive tissues far less than a lengthy incision with a surgeon's scalpel. Until recently, thoracic surgeons had to make large incisions in the chest and then spread the ribs that form a bony protective barrier around the vulnerable lungs and heart. Not until instruments became so miniaturized that they could slip through tiny spaces between the ribs was it possible to remove Bob's lung tumor through an incision only about 1\u00bd\" in size.The da Vinci Robot's Newest Frontier: 5PHYSICIAN PROFILE Daniel S. Fusco, M.D., a cardio - thoracic surgeon with Hartford Specialists, is board-certified in both General Surgery and Cardiothoracic Surgery. His areas of interest in - clude robotic cardiac surgery, heart transplantation and robotic thoracic surgery. Dr. Fusco earned his under - graduate degree at the University of Connecticut in 1986 and a master's of science degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1993. He received his medical degree from the University of Connecticut in 1995. He completed his general surgical resi - dency at Baystate Medical Center in 2000 and a thoracic surgery residency at the Medical College of Virginia (2000-2002), followed by fellowship training in Heart Transplantation and Aortic Surgery at Yale-New Haven Hospital (2002-2005). He is a clinical instructor in sur - gery at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. His hobbies include mountain climbing, stair rac - ing (as in running up all 38 floors of the CityPlace tower) and running up Mt. Washington. Dr. Fusco, who has nearly completed his pilot training, also enjoys sailing, ham radio and playing the piano. Daniel S. Fusco, M.D. Flexible and Versatile Robotic surgery's high-tech tools offer advanced techniques for per - forming a biopsy, removing a lobe of the lung, or treating esophageal can - cer. Tumors in the center part of the chest (mediastinum), including those of the thymus gland or lymphomas, are particularly well suited to robotic techniques. \"Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) allowed us to look inside the chest cavity after making very small incisions,\" says cardiothoracic surgeon Robert Gallagher, M.D., of Hartford Specialists. \"Now we've taken it one step further with robotic-assisted techniques.\" While standard endoscopic (VATS) tools are just straight instruments, robotic tools have seven degrees of freedom, just like the human wrist. \"The robot allows us to change direction while operating,\" says Daniel S. Fusco, M.D., of Hartford Specialists (no relation to Bob Fusco, the patient). \"The robot allows surgeons to work quickly and steadily, with less trauma and faster recovery for the patient.\" \"The robot is an evolutionary leap for lung cancer surgery,\" says pulmo - nologist J. Samuel Pope, M.D., of Connecticut Multispecialty Group, not - ing that new World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines urge regular screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT (cat) scans. \"We hope that regular screening will help us find lung cancer early, when it's more likely to be cured.\" The da Vinci robot's versatility gives the surgeons the ability to insert and manipulate instruments even more freely than the human hand. \"Surgery is the best therapy for early lung cancer,\" says Dr. Gallagher, the first cardiothoracic surgeon at Hartford Hospital to utilize the da Vinci ro - bot's unique capabilities to remove the entire lobe of the lung. The robot's flexibility allows surgeons to navigate deep within the chest. Seated at the console across from the operating table, Dr. Gallagher scrutinizes the 3D images relayed by the fiberoptic scope inserted into the patient's chest as four robotic arms operate in concert with the move - ments of his hands. Eyes glued to the viewfinder, his feet glide across bright yellow and blue foot pedals. \"Ten years ago, we had to make large incisions and spread the ribs,\" says Dr. Gallagher. \"The robot's dexterity, along with the camera's 10- power magnification system and high-definition screen, allows us to maneuver safely even in delicate regions near the heart.\" Thoracic Cancers The thoracic oncology team at the Helen and Harry Gray Cancer Center is a multidisciplinary group of experienced specialists skilled in the diag - nosis and treatment of thoracic malignancies. Medical thoracic surgeons, radiologists, radiation therapists, patholo - gists, nurses and other specialists all participate in the decision-making process. This collaborative process ensures that the patient receives the best care possible. More than 220,000 Americans are diagnosed with lung cancer and an estimated 160,000 die of the disease each year. Lung cancer accounts for more deaths among men and women than any other form of cancer in the United States. Each lung is divided into lobes\u2014two on the left and three on the right. When lung cancer is caught early, surgeons can often success - fully treat the disease by removing the whole lobe of the lung. \"While radiation therapy and chemotherapy are often used in patients with lung cancer, surgery offers a clear survival advantage if the cancer hasn't yet spread to distant organs,\" says Dr. Gallagher. 6\"The major advantage of robotic surgery is that it is much less invasive,\" adds Dr. Fusco. \"In the early days of thoracic surgery, surgeons would have to cut through the back muscles and take out a rib to remove a tumor.\" Surgeons now make only a few small incisions in the side of the chest, zoom in with the camera, and manipulate robotic arms with the hand and foot pedals. \"When filled with air the lung is a relatively large structure,\" says Dr Fusco. \"Using the robot, we collapse it to about a third of its size, encase it in a plastic bag and remove it through a very small incision.\" Today, Hartford Hospital is the Northeast's largest robotic surgery center, with seven Intuitive Surgical da Vinci robots. \"Surgeons from all over the country observe procedures and undergo advanced robotics training at the hospital's Center for Education, Simulation and Innovation (CESI),\" says Dr. Fusco. Thanks to Hartford Hospital's leadership in minimally invasive pro - cedures, patients can now take advantage of the speed and safety of robotic thoracic surgery.

People suffering from diabetes either don't make enough insulin or can't use the hormone effec - tively. When insulin levels drop, the body can't utilize the glucose (sugar) in food for energy, and blood sugar levels soar. \"The goal of diabetes management is the best possible control of blood sugar without producing a low blood sugar reaction,\" says endocrinologist Robert M. Oberstein, M.D., director of Hartford Hospital's Diabetes LifeCare program. \"When blood sugar drops too low, adrena - line surges, causing dizziness or shaki - ness. Such an adrenaline rush isn't good for the heart. Yet if the sugar levels are too high, multiple complications result. Most patients achieve good control with a com - bination of two or three medications.\" Diabetes afflicts an estimated 26 mil - lion people in the United States, with seven million unaware that they have the disease because they have no symptoms. Warning signs include excessive thirst, frequent urination, weight loss, blurred vision and fatigue. Nearly two million Americans over age 20 and 215,000 chil - dren and adolescents were diagnosed with diabetes in 2010 alone. Who Gets Diabetes? Type 1 diabetes is an endocrine dis - order that usually strikes in childhood, when the body stops producing enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. Experts theorize that some triggering event\u2014possibly a virus\u2014destroys the insulin-producing cells in genetically sus - ceptible individuals. Type 1 diabetes, formerly called \"juve - nile\" diabetes, requires lifelong treatment with insulin and constant monitoring of blood sugar levels. \"Early and aggressive treatment of newly diagnosed type 1 dia - betes significantly reduces the risk of later complications,\" says Dr. Oberstein. \"Type 1 diabetes is no longer a death sentence.\"Controlling Blood Sugar is vital to managing your diabetes 8Links to Obesity In Type 2 diabetes, which can develop at any age, the pancreas produces insulin, but the body becomes resistant to its effects, often because of obesity or excess weight. Diabetes and high blood pressure, linked to obesity, are among the leading causes of chronic kidney disease. Studies show that type 2 diabetes more than doubles the risk of a heart attack or stroke. Today, one in 10 Americans suffers from type 2 diabetes, a number that is expected to grow along with expanding American waistlines. Obesity afflicts nearly a third of all adults and has doubled in prevalence since 1980. Another 34 percent of all adults are considered to be overweight, but not obese. If current trends continue, one in three adults in the United States will suffer from diabetes by the year 2050, accord - ing to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Tools for a Healthy Life Diabetes LifeCare is Hartford Hospital's multidisciplinary approach to teaching patients how to control their blood sugar, a practice that has been shown to reduce long-term complications. Diabetes LifeCare offers day and evening classes, individu - alized nutritional counseling, and group sessions in English or Spanish. Dietitians meet one on one with patients to help them develop low- carbohydrate meal plans. \"We don't tell people what they can or can't eat, but how to make healthy choices,\" says Dr. Oberstein. \"We also urge patients to exercise.\" Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure and new cases of blindness among adults in the United States. Diabetic \"reti - nopathy\" causes the blood vessels of the retina to swell and leak fluid. \"Patients need to see an eye doctor every year for an exam,\" says Dr. Oberstein. \"With good preventive care, we can usually prevent blindness.\" As diabetics age, the disease often leaves them vulnerable to a painful and Kelly Johnson-Arbor, M.D. (right), is medical director of Hartford Hospital's Center for Wound Healing and Hyperbaric Medicine, where 10 patients at a time breathe 100 percent oxygen under pressure. 9often irreversible type of nerve damage called dia - betic neuropathy. Patients learn how to examine the bottoms of their feet for early signs of ulcers or inju - ries. Prompt foot care is crucial to preventing small abrasions from turning into debilitating wounds that can lead to loss of a limb. \"With tight control of blood sugar, we can usually prevent complications,\" says Dr. Oberstein. \"Diabetic neuropathy directly correlates with sugar control.\" Wound Healing Hartford Hospital's Center for Wound Healing and Hyperbaric Medicine, which opened in 2004, helps patients with diabetic foot wounds avoid limb amputa - tion. Seated comfortably in the 10-person hyperbaric chamber\u2014the only one of its kind in New England\u2014pa - tients wear transparent hoods that deliver 100 percent oxygen that has been compressed by the pressure inside the chamber. \"The pressure increases oxygen in the bloodstream, which speeds the healing process,\" When Hal Moffie learned he had diabetes 14 years ago, his reaction wasn't surprising. \"I was scared,\" recalled Hal. \"I conjured up so many negative things, like the loss of a limb, even death.\" Then he met Neil Grey, M.D., then-Medical Director of Hartford Hospital's Diabetes LifeCare pro - gram, and himself a diabetic. Suddenly, it wasn't the end of the world. With Dr. Grey's encouragement and guidance, Hal learned to manage his diabetes and live a normal life over the years. They formed a warm friendship that went beyond the doctor-patient relationship. When Dr. Grey passed away suddenly in May 2007, Hal was \"as shocked as anyone.\" Knowing that Dr. Grey's dedicated work had to be continued, he chaired a fund-raising committee to create an en - dowment\u2014the Neil J. Grey, M.D., Fund for Diabetes\u2014 as a fitting and lasting tribute to Dr. Grey's legacy. A long-time supporter of the hospital's Diabetes LifeCare program, Hal also set the pace for the effort with a remarkably generous leadership gift. \"For me, it was a way to give back to this man who helped so many in our community affected by diabe - tes and afraid of the disease,\" explained Hal. \"Dr. Grey was a regular guy, so humane, so self-effacing, and so highly respected for knowing all about this disease and helping thousands of people to manage it.\" Gifts to the fund over the past four years have been used for the education of and care for patients with diabetes, with an emphasis on researching and applying best practices in disease and complication management. The fund is also used for travel, sup - plies and the education of the entire health care team within the clinical setting and beyond. \"We've been very pleased with the growth of the fund, and people continue to give,\" added Hal. \"It explains Kelly Johnson-Arbor, M.D., medical director of the Center. Patients suffering from chronic wounds or severe bone infections undergo a daily two-hour treatment for two to three months, but the payoff is increased blood flow and new blood vessel formation within the wound. \"We bring together multidisciplinary resources to provide comprehensive evaluation and treatment,\" says Dr. Johnson-Arbor. \"Healing chronic wounds is a complicated and time-consuming process.\" Most patients who manage their chronic disease by sticking to a low carbohydrate diet and rigorously con - trolling their blood sugar won't ever need to face the frightening prospect of blindness or amputation. New understanding of the importance of maintaining blood sugar levels as near normal as possible, combined with advances in insulin delivery systems and high-tech wound care, are keeping patients alive longer than they ever expected. For more information, see www.harthosp.org/diabetes. A Disease, a Friendship, a Gift, a Legacy has supported some wonderful lectures that have been well attended and well received. All in all, the fund has allowed Dr. Grey's passion to live on, and he would be most proud to know that his work continues.\" For more information about The Neil J.

Mr. Hal Moffie 10Each month, more than 800 pa - tients spend two to four hours at the Hartford Hospital Eye Surgery Center in Newington, where nearly 40 eye surgeons from across the re - gion perform outpatient procedures in a convenient suburban location. The Hartford Hospital Eye Surgery Center\u2014one of the largest in New England \u2014is a 13,000-square-foot building with four operating rooms and a laser treatment room. Parking is available in a large lot adjacent to the center. For those who need transportation, round-trip, door-to- door car service is only $25. \"Eye procedures are performed under local anesthesia at our state- of-the art facility,\" says ophthal - mologist David Emmel, M.D., medi - cal director of the outpatient center. Procedures include cataract and glaucoma surgery, corneal surgery (including transplants) and plastic surgery on the eyelids to improve function or appearance. The center's laser technology is used to treat glaucoma, retinal problems or vision clouding that sometimes develops after cataract surgery. As people age, vision is often diminished by a cataract that de - velops in the clear lens of the eye. According to estimates from the National Eye Institute, more than 20 million people over age 40 in the United States have cataracts. By age 80, more than half of all Americans will have them. \"People who regularly take medications for diabetes or asthma are at increased risk for cataracts,\" says Jerry Neuwirth, M.D., director of Hartford Hospital's Department of Ophthalmology. \"Your ophthal - mologist will recommend cataract surgery if you have blurred vision, colors start to look less vivid or you have trouble seeing in the glare of headlights at night.\"Center of Excellence The Hartford Hospital Eye Surgery Center \"Cataract surgery is not only the most commonly performed op - eration, it is also one of the safest operations you can undergo,\" says Dr. Emmel. \"It's an operation that brings almost instant gratification because of the dramatic improve - ment in vision it provides.\" Friendly staff members greet cataract patients and guide them through paperwork and the pre- operative process. \"They go to the operating room, and 20 to 30 min - utes later they are in the recovery room enjoying a warm muffin and a cup of coffee before heading home. No one stays overnight.\" The tiny cataract incision\u2014 barely 1/8\" long\u2014is delicately de - signed to seal itself without stitch - es. \"Minimally invasive surgery heals quickly with less discomfort and lower risk of infection or other complications,\" says Dr. Emmel. \"It's not unusual for patients to experience improved vision within hours of undergoing surgery.\" Significant advances in cataract surgery include the development of intraocular lens implants that correct for astigmatism or allow the patient to see both far and near. Although not covered by insurance or Medicare, the new implants are growing in popularity because they often reduce dependence on glasses. The center holds regular meet - ings and workshops to help eye surgeons stay up to date with the latest developments in ophthal - mic surgery. \"Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness in the U.S., but it can be well controlled with treatment,\" says glaucoma specialist Kristy Mascarenhas, M.D., who recently taught other eye surgeons how to perform a procedure called Trabectome for advanced glaucoma. Cornea specialists at the center perform traditional corneal trans - plants, as well as several new cor - neal transplant modifications. Eye plastic surgery procedures include operations to lift sagging lids or to repair problems that cause eyes to tear excessively. Hartford Hospital Eye Surgery Center is Connecticut-licensed, Medicare-certified and accred - ited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations as an outpatient surgery center.

A steaming cup of tea relieves the conges - tion of a wintertime cold or flu. In countries across the globe, tea drinking is a daily ritual, whether served by a kimono-clad geisha or an English duchess. The leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant can be har - vested at different times during the growing season and processed to create white, green or black tea. Australian researchers found higher bone mineral density in older women tea drinkers, according to a 2007 study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Darjeeling tea In the Darjeeling region of eastern India, tea leaves are plucked by hand. Grown at high altitudes under strong sun, Darjeeling oolong tea is given names like \"autum - nal flush\" or \"monsoon\" (depending on when it's har - vested). \"Black tea\" is more oxidized than oolong, green and white varieties and contains more caffeine. Green tea Packed with antioxidant-rich polyphenols, green tea fights disease by reducing oxidative damage to cells. Researchers who followed 8,500 Japanese men and women for 12 years found that men (but not women) who drank four cups of green tea daily were significantly less likely to die of heart disease than men who drank about a cup a day. Ask your doctor before drinking green tea if you have cardiovascular problems or if you're taking blood thinners (warfarin or Coumadin). Green tea contains antioxidant compounds that may affect the body's absorption of folic acid, a B-complex vitamin that helps prevent birth defects. Ginger Tea Ginger tea is a popular home remedy for motion sick - ness, stomachache and sore throat. A 2004 study in Obstetrics & Gynecology showed that ginger relieves nau - sea and vomiting in early pregnancy. A 2007 study at the University of Michigan showed inhibition of the growth of ovarian cancer cells in the laboratory. Ask your doctor before drinking ginger tea if you have cardiovascular problems or if you're taking blood thinners. Jasmine Tea Jasmine tea is made by blending fresh jasmine flowers with green tea leaves in the traditional Chinese way. A 2005 study at Japan's Kyoto University showed that a strong odor of jasmine tea calms the mood and signifi - cantly decreases the heart rate. Jasmine is prized in Chinese medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties. Peppermint Tea Peppermint \"tea\" is a tisane (infusion) used in Europe as a digestive aid. Studies have demonstrated that the beverage relaxes the muscles of the intestinal tract and eases pain, bloating, gas and diarrhea. 12 WHAT'S GOING AROUND...News & Breakthroughs in the DOCTOR'S OFFICE Lupus is one of many chronic disorders of the immune system called \"autoimmune\" diseases. Autoimmune disorders result when the disease-fight - ing system overreacts and turns against the body it's supposed to protect. Formally known as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), what's described here as \"lupus\" is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease that can affect nearly every organ system in the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, lungs and central nervous system. \"Lupus can vary widely in its severity,\" says rheu - matologist John A. Vischio, M.D., of Rheumatology Associates. \"Common symptoms include fatigue, low- grade fevers, joint pain, hair loss and rash. In more se - vere cases, however, lupus can lead to potentially fatal damage to the kidneys, lungs and nervous system.\" In the United States, lupus affects approximately 1 in 1,000 individuals. \"Lupus occurs in genetically susceptible individuals, although the genes respon -Life with Lupussible have not been completely determined,\" says Dr. Vischio. \"The onset of the disease usually occurs between the ages of 15-45. Exposure to sunlight may trigger a 'flare' of the condition.\" Autoimmune disorders, including lupus, over - whelmingly afflict women, especially during the childbearing years. Lupus often strikes during or just after pregnancy. \"Increased estrogen activity likely plays a role, as lupus is approximately 10 times more common in women,\" adds Dr. Vischio. The disorder disproportionately affects African Americans, Asians and Hispanics. Although most patients with lupus test positive for anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), the diagnosis is based upon a thorough history, physical examination and laboratory tests. \"The ANA test is not a specific test for lupus,\" says Dr. Vischio. \"It may be positive in other autoimmune disorders, particularly thyroid disorders. In addition, a small proportion of healthy individuals may test positive for low levels of ANA.\" Treatment varies widely depending upon the severity of the condition. \"Milder symptoms, such as rash, fatigue and joint pain can be treated with topical or low-dose oral corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and hydroxychloroquine. More severe cases, including those with involvement of internal organs, usually require high-dose corticoste - roids and/or other immunosuppressant medications.\" In 2011, the FDA approved Benlysta \u00ae (belimumab), the first new medication for lupus in more than 50 years. Belimumab is approved for patients with mild to moderate disease in combination with existing medi - cations. \"Patients should be followed closely by a rheuma - tologist,\" says Dr. Vischio. \"People with lupus should avoid sun exposure and adopt a healthy lifestyle to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.\" Rare Scare Northern Arizona University researchers are studying how \"strain 398\" of antibiotic-resis - tant Staphylococcus au - reus is transmitted. Clinical Infectious Diseases reports that half the chicken, beef and pork samples from U.S. grocery stores\u2014and three-quarters of turkey samples\u2014were contami - nated with Staph, which causes skin infections, heart inflammation and pneumonia. Always cook meat thoroughly.Sleepless Nights Up to 70 million adults in the United States have chronic sleep or wakeful - ness disorders, according to the National Institutes of Health. The percentage of adults who average less than seven hours of sleep per night has jumped by about a third since the 1980s. Sleep disorders are associated with an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and obesity.Raw Data A McGill University study shows that eating plenty of fruit and raw veg - etables can lower heart attack risk in people who are genetically suscep - tible to cardiovascular disease. About one-fifth of those of European ancestry have the high- risk 9p21 gene variant. Plos Medicine reports that a diet high in raw vegeta - bles, fruit (or fruit juice) and berries can counter - act the effects of the gene.Skin Deep In a study published in Gene Therapy, Oxford University researchers report that they trans - formed patients' skin cells into cancer-fighting weapons against their own disease. Scientists hope to harness the pa - tient's own immune sys - tem to mount a targeted attack on cancerous cells. Advances in stem cell technology may someday lead to clinical trials of immunotherapy-based cancer treatments. 13PARVOVIR uS B19 Fifth disease is caused b y infection with parvovirus B19. This contagious virus infects children and adults and causes a telltale \"slapped cheek\" rash on the face and a lacy red rash elsewhere on the body. In adults, it also can cause small-joint arthritis lasting up to six months. Rarely, the usually mild virus causes complications in pregnant women. A blood test can confirm the diagnosis. stomach bug Norovirus is a highly contagious illness that causes acute gastroenteritis. Violent and repeated bouts of vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramps leave sufferers feeling weak and fatigued. Careful hand washing is the best way to prevent infection with the virus, which spreads rapidly on cruise ships or in nursing homes. Dehydration can be dangerous for elderly or immunocompromised individuals.hepatitis Hepatitis A virus causes an infection that does not become chronic. International travelers and others at risk for the virus can be vaccinated against the virus, transmitted by contaminated food and water. There is also a vaccine for hepatitis B, spread by blood and body fluids. No vaccine yet exists for hepatitis C, the leading reason for liver transplantation. Hepatitis C is initially a silent infection that can cause cirrhosis (scarring), liver failure and liver cancer. \"Hepatitis C can be diagnosed with a simple blood test,\" says Dr. Ross. \"Hartford Hospital's liver disease specialists have exciting new options that can potentially cure people infected with the virus, helping even those with cirrhosis, prior treatment failure or who may need a liver transplant.\" rsv Respiratory syncytial virus is a potentially serious illness that can lead to pneumonia in older individuals. The virus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes, releasing respiratory droplets into the air. No vaccine exists for the contagious disease that peaks during the winter and causes a fever, runny nose, cough, wheezing, nose, sore throat and headache. herpes zoster Shingles results from the varicella-zoster (VZV) virus that causes chickenpox. After lying dormant for decades, the virus can erupt, causing blisters and severe pain, tingling or itching (usually only on one side of the body). See your primary care physician right away because early antiviral treatment can lessen the severity of the outbreak and prevent lingering pain. To reduce your risk of shingles, Dr. Ross recommends getting the Zostavax vaccine if you're 50 or older. herpes simplex Cold sores result from infection with contagious type 1 or type 2 herpes simplex virus. Cold sores usually occur outside the mouth, on the lips and chin, or in the nostrils. Antiviral drugs\u2014acyclovir (Zovirax) and valacyclovir (Valtrex)\u2014 are often prescribed to reduce pain and speed healing, although they won't cure a herpes outbreak.Viruses are inventive and tenacious, colonizing a host, hijacking cells and replicating themselves with frightening speed. Antibiotics can treat bacterial infections, but they don't work against viruses. Make sure you're up to date on available immunizations. \"Everyone should have an annual flu shot,\" says Director of the Division of Infectious Disease Jack W. Ross, M.D. \"Antiviral drugs can often reduce symptoms when the illness is caught early, so see your primary care physician (PCP) promptly.\" Listed below is a sampling of common viruses that can cause mild or severe illnesses, in addition to the three to five mild common \"colds\" we get each year.

The flavorful whole- grain dish is nutritious and satisfying, yet low in fat and calories. Soba noodles are traditional thin Japanese noodles made from buckwheat, a gluten-free grain rare in the American diet. The hot-and-spicy peanut sauce is packed with heart-healthy fiber and pungent garlic, with subtle accents of ginger and pepper. Any whole-grain noodles can be used for the recipe, but be sure to avoid standard pasta noodles made from heavily refined wheat flour. Look for the words \"whole grain\" on the package and don't be fooled by \"multigrain\" or \"100% wheat\" claims. A diet rich in whole grains provides a feeling of full - ness (satiety) and helps delay hunger. Whole grains are rich in complex carbohydrates, believed to stave off type 2 diabetes and help those who already have the dis - ease improve blood sugar control. Serve the vegetarian noodles as a side dish or add chicken or tofu to create a meal.Ingredients 8 oz. whole-wheat spaghetti or soba noodles 2 tsp . oil 2 cloves garlic, crushed 1 tsp. minced ginger 1 tsp. minced hot peppers 5 green onions (scallions), sliced 1/3 cup chopped red pepper 1 carrot, thinly sliced1 Tbs. smooth peanut butter 2 Tbs. soy sauce 1 cup vegetable or chicken stock Add the noodles to a large saucepan of boiling water. Boil, uncovered, just until tender. While the noodles are cook - ing, heat the oil in a nonstick frying pan. Add the garlic, ginger, peppers, carrot and onions. Stir-fry for one min - ute and remove from heat. Stir in the peanut butter and soy sauce; gradually add the stock, stirring until smooth. Stir over heat until simmering; simmer for two minutes. Drain the noodles and add them to the spicy sauce. Stir until noodles are coated. Serves 4 as a side dish or add stir-fried chicken (or tofu) for a main course.
