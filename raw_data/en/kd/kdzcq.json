Whether you suffer from chronic pain or you need to get over an injury more quickly and completely, chiropractic massage therapy could be just what the chiropractor ordered. The skillful combination of chiropractic adjustment and therapeutic massage techniques can help you combat pain without drugs, increase your range of motion, and enjoy a higher overall standard of health. Take a look at how chiropractic massage therapy can help you through your particular challenges. Massage for Healing and Pain Management Massage has a long and distinguished history as a proven therapeutic modality. The manipulation of soft tissues can increase blood and lymph flow, relax tight muscles and tendons, and help an injured body part heal itself more readily while also ridding itself of inflammatory substances more efficiently. Different forms of massage can address different health and wellness needs. Swedish massage, for instance, soothes and relaxes surface tissues, while deep tissue massage breaks up internal scar tissue and treats chronic problems closer to the bones. Trigger point massage relieves muscle knots that can cause pain throughout the body. Sports massage may use any of these techniques to work on specific muscles that must perform optimally or recover from overuse. Dr. Masri may prescribe massage therapy to address problems such as: - Acute sprains and strains - Chronic musculoskeletal pain - Sleep problems - Carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive motion injuries - Arthritis inflammation - Circulatory disorders - Mood disorders - Prenatal discomfort - Chronic headaches - Neck or back pain Massage therapy can also promote your ongoing wellness. Enhanced blood flow, organ function, and fluid drainage can help you enjoy a stronger immune system response, while relaxed muscles are less prone to injury. What to Expect From Chiropractic Massage Therapy at Get Wellness Chiropractic care and massage work together extraordinarily well. Massage relaxes the body so that your muscles won't resist chiropractic adjustments, yielding more satisfying results from your adjustment sessions. At the same time, the realignment of joint components removes a source of stress that might otherwise promote chronic musculoskeletal strain and pain. Dr. Masri may schedule massage therapy for you immediately before your chiropractic adjustments so you take best the full benefit of this combination. Ongoing sessions may prove most helpful if you suffer from a chronic pain condition. Multiple sessions usually offer the greatest benefits for injury treatment as well.
