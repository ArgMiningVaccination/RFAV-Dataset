Last updated on Sep 3, 2023. What is a COVID-19 2-dose vaccine? The vaccine is given as a shot into a muscle in your shoulder area to help prevent COVID-19. Two doses are needed for full protection. The time between doses varies, depending on the vaccine you receive. Make an appointment to get the second dose at the time recommended by your healthcare provider. Vaccination is recommended for everyone 6 months or older. Healthcare providers recommend vaccination even if you have already had COVID-19. What do I need to know about COVID-19 vaccine approvals and emergency use authorizations (EUAs)? An EUA means the vaccine has not been fully approved but is given because the benefits outweigh the risks. A vaccine may be fully approved for certain ages. The same vaccine may also have an EUA for anyone younger than the minimum approved age. Ask your healthcare provider if you have questions about the different 2-dose vaccines. What do I need to know about booster shots? A booster shot is an additional dose that helps your immune system continue to protect against severe COVID-19. A booster is recommended for everyone 6 months or older. Additional boosters may also be recommended. Your healthcare provider can help you schedule boosters. The number and timing of boosters depends on the age and health of the person getting vaccinated. What do I need to tell my healthcare provider before I get the vaccine? - You have thrombocytopenia, a blood clotting disorder, or are taking blood thinning medicines. - Your immune system is weakened from medicines such as chemotherapy or steroids. - You are pregnant or breastfeeding. Your obstetrician or doctor will tell you when to get the vaccine. - You have a known allergy to any component (part) of the vaccine. - You have a history of allergies. What happens after I get the vaccine? - Your healthcare provider will monitor you for about 15 minutes. This will help your provider watch for any serious reaction to the vaccine. - You will be considered fully vaccinated after 2 weeks. This is how long your immune system needs to build a response strong enough to protect you. - You will need to keep your vaccination card. Make a copy of your vaccination card. Keep the original with you in case you need to show it. Keep the copy in a safe place. Bring the vaccination card with you each time you get a dose of the vaccine, including boosters. What are reasons I should not get the vaccine? - You had an allergic reaction to the first dose of the vaccine. Do not get a second dose. - You have a known allergy to any part of the vaccine. What are reasons I should wait to get the vaccine? - You currently have COVID-19. Your healthcare provider will tell you when to get the vaccine. - You had multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS). You should wait 90 days and have no symptoms before you get the vaccine. - You are sick or have a fever on the vaccine appointment day. - You took acetaminophen or ibuprofen on the vaccine appointment day. What are the risks of the vaccine? All side effects may not be known. The following are common effects that may develop after 1 or both doses: - An allergic reaction to the vaccine - Swelling in and around your heart - Mild symptoms, such as a fever, chills, headache, nausea, or muscle aches - Swollen, sore, or tender area where the shot was given (usually mild and goes away in a few hours) - Less effective vaccination if your immune system is weak What else do I need to know about the vaccine? - The vaccines do not contain the virus that causes COVID-19. This means you are not at risk for getting COVID-19 from a vaccine. Instead, the vaccines teach your immune system to recognize the virus and produce antibodies to fight it. - The vaccines do not cause reproductive problems. Your healthcare provider can give you more information about the safety of vaccines before or during pregnancy. - Your DNA will not be changed. The vaccine does not affect the part of cells that control DNA. - Your child may need to be fully vaccinated to attend school. Ask your child's school as soon as possible. Vaccine requirements may vary by area. - You may still get COVID-19 after you receive the vaccine. The vaccine may help prevent severe illness. Call your local emergency number (911 in the US) if: - You have signs of a severe allergic reaction, such as trouble breathing, hives, or wheezing. - Your mouth and throat are swollen. - You have chest pain or your heart is beating faster than normal for you. - Your face is red or swollen. - You have hives that spread over your body. When should I call my doctor? - You have a fever. - You have any other signs or symptoms that concern you or do not go away. - You have increased pain, redness, or swelling around the area where the shot was given. - You have questions or concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine.
