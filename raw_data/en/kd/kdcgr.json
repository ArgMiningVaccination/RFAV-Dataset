In to the Anthroposophical Medical As- socia tion 'sConference on 22 and 23 November 2003 in Kassel it said:\" Autoimmune disorders on the other hand reflect disruption in the human organism's self-recogni-tion and self-regulation. Internal organs become foreign elemen ts in the body .\"This w ould therefore also affect the immunotolerance which functions in health, i.e. the immune s ystem attacks tissue belonging to the organ and to the body as though it wereforeign. Quite naively one might ask: \"Has the organism gone (seeing thatitis senselessly destroying itself). Abasic law in anthroposophical medicine is that a large part of disorders are due to auto- rather than he-terogenic factors. These take effect in the wrong place,at the wrong time, or show excessive or inadequate in-tensity in the site where they normally take effect: (5) Disorders reflect bodily processes which take effect in the wrong place, at the wrong time and/or act with the wr ong in tensity (t oo powerful/too weak). Does this basic law also apply to autoimmune disor- ders? This is what we want to explore in what follows. Polarity of I and body Afirst area for our consideration derives from anot- her basic f actin anthroposophy. It is that the differentia-Anthroposophical basis for understanding autoimmune diseases Volker Fintelmann Translation MTA. Anthroposophical basis for understanding autoimmune diseases IAbstract In modern scientific medicine, questions concerning the aetio- logy of autoimmune diseases do not take us beyondestablishing a number of hypotheses with a theore- tical basis. Findings made in anthroposophical spiri- tual investigation by Rudolf Steiner can help us tosee autoimmune diseases as an attempt to make untransformed (not individualized) remnants of the inherited body one's own at a later time in the bio-graphy, i.e. create an individual body that accords with the I or self also in this organic site. Inflamma- tory and digestive processes to destroy matter andthen give a new configuration are pathophysiologi- cal in the case. Suppressing them with anti-inflam- matory drugs or immunosuppressants is counterpro-ductive, for the self is impeded in its efforts to heal itself. World substances such as Phosphorus, Quartzor mistletoe treat the causes by guiding and suppor- ting I-activity. Reconciliation with the world of theancestors from whom the body primarily comes is another element in causal treatment. IKeywords Aetiology Autoaggression Inherited body Individual body Remnants of inherited body ted body (\"organism\") is seen as the instrument or tool of the real human being who is wholly spiritual by na-ture. Rudolf Steiner called it the \"I\".With the help of hig-her (\"hierarchic\") spirits, this I creates instruments for it- self in soul and body so that the intentions it had in the spirit before birth (plan for life) may be brought to reali- zation in existence between conception, birth and death. The body must be seen as polar opposite to the I, withthe soul active between the opposite poles (matter andspirit), always mediating and maintaining balance. A special aspect is that the body is pre-formed and gene- tically determined by the parents, which makes it prima-rily foreign and not self. It only becomes self in long sta-ges of development taking 20 to 30 years.This will be an important aspect when it comes to understanding au- toimmune disorders. Let us first consider the opposite nature of body and I(spirit). Rudolf Steiner spoke of a fact which his investi- gations had shown and I want to quote him here.\"Whe- rever the spirit enters directly into physical matter we have a destructive process. A subtle death process co- ming from the senses thus spreads along the nerve tracts in the human organism.\"(6) This relates to the \"vi-sible\" human being, i.e. once again the body which throughout life has an invisible human being everywhe- re within it. Essentially all constructive processes origi- nate in this. The body o fphysical matter, also known as \"physical body\", is destroyed under the direct influence ofthe I, or subject to destructive processes.This leads to afirst hypothesis for a possible cause o fautoimmune disor ders: Autoimmune disor ders r eflec t an excessively power- ful, destructive influence of the I on the organism. (\"The spirit burns up the body.\") Anticipating slightly, let us note that this manifests in inflamma toryprocesses, above all those that result in purulence and liquefaction. Inflammation plays a major role in autoimmune disorders and also determines es- sential aspects of modern treatment. It is, however, scar- cely o fthe kind discussed above but rather involves chro- nic destruction of tissue. The image one might have ismore that of a smouldering fire. The organ which has turned foreign The second area for our consideration is that of an or- gan or tissue turning foreign. The most characteristic example ar eviral diseases wher eincorporation of the vi- ruses in cells of the organs will, in the sight of the immu- ne system, cause such alienation. The immune systemattacks the material affected by the viruses, often in aviolen t,acutely destructive way. A typical example is ful- minant hepatitis with hepatitis B virus infection, for- merly also known as acute hepa tic dy stroph y.Essential- ly, however, inflammatory changes with virus hepatiti- des reflect an immune reaction on the part of the organ-ism and therefore attempts to heal and not sickness. Fordecades ,acute virus hepa titis was treated ocorticoids. Later, whenthe immunological process was understood and one could see why such treatment was largely ineffectiveand did actually in many cases lead to protracted chro-nic evolutions. Autoimmune processes connected with virus-asso- ciated disorders continue to be seen, and for a time it was therefore also thought that autoimmune disorders might be viral in origin, with research taken in this di-rection.The second hypothesis for a possible cause of au- toimmune disorders therefore is the following. Autoimmune diseases indicate that an organ has been alienated under external influences. (\"The or-gan becomes outside world.\") This hypothesis is more likely to help us find an ans- wer to our question concerning the causes of autoim- mune disorders. Viruses or other pathogens clearly can- not be the only external factors to be considered. A vast field has to be opened up for research to investigate this and look for answers. There can be no question but that the human or ganism is today exposed to many different environmental pollutants in material form or also in form of different kinds of radiation. We need only thinkof the indeterminable number of food additives, pestici- de or heavy metal pollution, and both natural and artifi- cially produced radiation of many different kinds. From the poin tofview o fanthroposophy, where existence in soul and spirit is something very real, one must also con- sider if e xternal influences of a non-material kind may not also cause an or gan to bec ome f oreign. Think of the \"indig estible\"flood of images and information provided bythe media, but also the actions, feeling and thoughts of others and the effect these can have on us. Any kind ofchildhood abuse must also be mentioned as a prime example. Organic focus of destruction within us Athird area for our consideration is again created on the basis of Rudolf Steiner's investigations. He described how in every human organism there is an organic and ther efore unconscious area where an intensive form of destruction arises which is directed towards the organ-ism\"s physical matter: \"Matter is never completely de- stroyed in the outside world. In more recent times, phi- losophers and scientists for the external world have the- refore spoken of the conservation of matter. This law ofthe c onser vation of matter applies only in the outside world, how ever. In the inner human being, matter is completely transformed back into nothingness. Matter is there destroyed completely in its essence. Our humannature actually bases on the fact that we are able tothrow ma tter back into chaos, destroy matter complete- ly at a level deeper than the mirroring of memory.\"(7) He then r eferred to the way pupils were taught in ear- lier mystery centres, mainly in Ireland and the West alto- gether, though originating from the Orient: \"Beneaththe capacity for memory, you bear something in you as ahuman being which is out to destr oy; without this in- side y ou,you w ould not have been able to develop your2 Der Merkurstab | Fintelmann | understanding autoimmune diseases English Issue 2005ability to think, for you must develop your thinking in that powers of thought penetrate the ether body. Anether body filled with powers of thought will, however,have the effect on the physical body of throwing its mat- ter back into chaos, destroying it.\"(8) Later he introduced two further important concepts, speaking of a focus of destruction and a destructive frenzy. These spiritual facts are profound and may well awa- ken defensive or negative reactions in someone follo-wing the line of thought.The known facts of research in- to digestion show, however, that such powers do indeed exist in us. Destruction or degradation of matter in theprocess we call \"digestion\" involves powerful, aggressi-ve forces located in the different digestive organs, with corresponding digestive enzymes acting as mediators. Our organs of mastication, acid production in the sto- mach and bile acids also come under this heading.We al- so find this destructive frenzy in the rejection of organ transplants, a process with an immunological basis. Ma- ny readers may perhaps for the first time become awa- rehere of a situation which is experienced and described all over the world, a phenomenon of our time that al- most seems beyond comprehension. This is the enor-mous increase in a (seemingly?) incomprehensible de- structive frenzy as an expression of uncontrolled aggres- siveness which culminates in terrorism. Do we not beco- me a wareofaneed here for research in medicine as to how f ar such aggressiveness discharging itself in an out- ward direction does not also reflect digestive activity not adequa tely put to use, i.e.digestiv epowers \"stray- ing\" into the soul sphere? And should not our attention turn to causal phenomena in nutrition, fastfoods being but one form of expression? Reference must also be ma- de to the highly successful commercialized world of films which profit from showing such extreme forms of material destruction, their \"material\" also including the human being . These questions concerning the phenomena of our time will not, however, help us to understand autoim- mune disorders. Here the destructive frenzy woiuld ha- veto be directed towards parts of the organism itself, which is also an important aspect of self. Suddenly theearlier term \"autoaggression\" gains fresh new signifi- cance. Permit me to refer to an image from the world of folk tales. In Rumpelstiltskin we find an accurate pictu- re of autoaggression of the kind which at the level of or-gans w esee in the extreme situation of pancreatitis, for instance, asitua tion wher ean or gan digests itself. We are thus able to formulate a third hypothesis for under- standing the cause of autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune disorders reflect an (organ-related) de- struc tivefrenzy directed against oneself. (Rumpel- stiltskin type of autoaggression) Acute pancreatitis is not an autoimmune disorder, though the triggering factors do in many cases remainunknown. But it is striking how often extreme psycholo-gical str ess is seen in c onjunc tion with this disease, of- ten ha ving persisted f oralong time and finally findingan outlet.This is the field of psychosomatics, interaction between body and body-related soul. Scientists ack-nowledge that psychological factors can become soma- tic, connecting with it the idea of a pathophysiological process. This may well play much more of an aetiologi-cal and pathophysiological role in the development ofautoimmune disorders than modern scientists have realized so far. And no careful observer can fail to see how intensively the symptoms of autoimmune disor- ders also involve the psyche. Untransformed elements of the inherited body The fourth area to be considered takes us deep down into the true causes of autoimmune disorders. It presup- poses the situation mentioned earlier, which is that the individual human spirit, the I, can only incarnate if pa- rents create the necessary living body. In every case and with utter logic this is foreign to the I. Rudolf Steiner would frequently mention in his collected works that the time needed for human infancy and childhood deve-lopment until maturation is reached is extremely long compared to the whole animal world and can only be understood if we consider that the I needs this time totransf orm the inherited body ,also called a \"model\" ,into an individual body, which has to happen at all levels of physical matter, life, sentience and soul and ultimately also o fthe spirit .This happens in de velopmental stages of7years each. Initially the material consistency of the inherited body is transformed and replaced, as is clearly evident in the changing of the teeth, though it also ap-plies to all tissues and organs in the organism. More work is done on transforming physical matter inthe sec ond se ven-y ear period, but the emphasis is now on the sphere of life, most evident in all functional processes in the organism. These, too, must become highly individual to serve the unique (individual) natureof the I as ideal tools for future life. These individuationprocesses come from the above-mentioned invisible or supersensible human being who is not embodied but in- fluences the body by different routes.(9) It is always the next higher member of the supersesible organization which works on this individuation, always guided by theIwhich on its part has the help of spiritual (hierarchic) entities o fplanetar yorigin (Fig 1). After 3 times 7 years, i.e. around the 21st year of life, individuation of the body is complete, the individual has \"come o fage\".The I then works to develop the three soul elements (sentient, rational and spiritual soul) out of the body which also need to be giv en wholly individual char acter. In our time this reaches its culmination in about the 28th year, when ideally the human being is a true individual and takes personal r esponsibility concer- ning self and world.This is the ideal form of an indepen- dent individual nature. All kinds of problems, resistance and obstacles do ,of course, arise, so that the work will scarcely be wholly successful. \"Bodily residues\" left in- complete will persist, with hereditary body elements re-maining in them.Fintelmann | understanding autoimmune diseases | Der Merkurstab English Issue 2005 34 Der Merkurstab | Fintelmann | understanding autoimmune diseases English Issue 2005 Rudolf Steiner characterized two types of wrong de- velopment in this connection, calling them premature ordelayed development.10 He described the former as acase where transformation is too rapid, coming to a pre-mature and therefore incomplete conclusion whichleads to an \"inner determination\" of the individual thatmay be compulsive by nature, for instance. If individua-tion of the body is too slow, and also if it persists beyondthe 21st and 28th years, the body is determined in a wayto which R udolf Steiner did not give a name, but which comes to expression in addictions.The very brief descrip-tion given here may lead to my fourth hypothesis: Autoimmune diseases reflect a late attempt to indi- vidualize residues of the inherited body. This will of course again and again come upon organ- ic regions referred to as such residues. This is not to say thatthe I will on principle attempt to individualize them at a later time.The way I see it, this will be a relatively ra-re occurrence, otherwise the number of people with au-toimmune disorders would be much greater. Such resi-dues do ,how ever, persist through life, though they act as foreign elements in the body, and may thus be conside- red to be sources of all kinds of organic, functional andalso mental disorders. Perhaps we can in the light of this understand wh ycancer manif ests in a specific site, in an organ or as a systemic problem. Autoimmune disorders may, however, develop in people who do not allow the-se residues of the inherited body to persist but absolu- tely in tend to transf orm them, i.e. make them their own or individualize them. In m yopinion, this is where the real cause of these disor ders lies. We thus see them as diseases of our time and can also understand why they are on the increase. Individuation or the development of one\"s own indivi- dual na tureis something which mor eand mor epeople enter into at the present time. It is also evident from the abovewhy the typical time of onset is between the ages of 20 and 40. Earlier or later onset does not speak against the type but merely raises the question \"why\"for the in- dividual concerned. The noticeably ps ychosoma tic s ymptoma tology of autoimmune disorders, already mentioned in the above,merits fur ther consideration. The biography frequentlycontains elements that have not been \"dealt with\", di- gested or overcome, and this with reference to the adultworld around the developing individual, above all mo-ther, father and siblings, but also other close relations orfamily friends, teachers and clergy. Working throughsuch problem areas in talks and finally achieving recon-ciliation often proves to be the vital precondition for suc-cessful treatment. We must also learn to differentiate the times (seven- year periods )when transformation did not succeed, and the trend followed by premature developments. For itwill primarily be these which cause the developmental disorders and hence the \"residues\". At the very centre of all diagnostic questions and observations, indispensable preconditions for \"rational\"(causal) treatment, we must put the relationship between I and body, i.e. congruence between individual nature and physical body. It is per- fectly clear that this does not mean making the kind of diagnosis learned at medical school. One has to developempathic intuition, which results from \"the results of ob-servations made in the soul using the methods of mo-dern science\" (subtitle o fRudolf Steiner\" sPhilosophy of Spiritual Activity). Prospects of a rational therapy The pr ocesses c onnec ted with the first three hypo- theses are important if we are to understand autoim- mune disorders, though they are not of primary signifi-cance in understanding the causes. They reflect proces- ses which pla yan essen tial r ole in the pa thoph ysiology of the different autoimmune disorders and have been given as h ypotheses not for rhetorical reasons but be- cause they are genuine fields where work may be done to gain deep-reaching insight into these disorders, with the scientific findings of conventional medicine also ta- ken in to ac coun t. Manifestation in specific organs and aspects of treatment will be considered in detail in the lectures that follow. Before coming to a conclusion, ho- wever, let us look at some of the clinical requirements or consequences in the light of the above. The key point, I believe, is that inflammation must not be suppr essed or r educed but rather encouraged. It go- es without saying that this calls for great experience and sensitivity .

Secondly there is need tohelp the I to perceive both the inner and the outer boun- daries of the body and also achieve them, i.e. actively set boundaries. Quartz has causal activity in this respect. Finally spheres of life must be worked through in the biography that have created obstacles or trauma in the period of development and must be seen as connectedwith the disease. Reconciliation with these situations, and often also with oneself, is an important element in overcoming the disease or bring one's bodily develop-ment to a good conclusion. Prof. Us. tr. A.
