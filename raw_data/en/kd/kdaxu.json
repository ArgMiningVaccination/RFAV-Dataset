CLEANING & MAINTENANCE: Cleaning your diffuser is really simple, but also very important. To keep your diffuser looking and working like new, we recommend cleaning the plastic reservoir every 2 weeks or 7-10 uses. Remove the porcelain cover from the plastic and run the top ceramic piece under warm water. To clean the plastic reservoir, apply a pea-sized amount of dish soap and use a sponge to buff out any old oil residues. Rinse the diffuser reservoir cup until clean and set it aside to air dry. Please watch, that water is not getting into the electronic part of the device. Not washable in the dishwasher. WARRANTY: Diffusers can be returned within 14 days of purchase. At Raespira we believe that everything should have 3 components: functionality, durability, and beauty. That's why we offer a 1-year warranty on all our diffusers. If anything goes wrong with your diffuser within your first year, please reach out to us and we'll be happy to replace it. "}
