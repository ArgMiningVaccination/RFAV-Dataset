Email: sofeidodoo@kumc.edu Section: Original Research Publication: September 16, 2021 Introduction: This study was conducted to assess family physicians' perception of the FDA approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, their plans to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and their support for vaccination of patients and family members. Methods: The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey of 307 practicing family physicians, full-time faculty physicians, and resident physicians in Kansas from December 14, to December 31, 2020 . The study participants completed an anonymous, 20-item survey assessing family physicians' concerns about exposure to COVID-19, and their perceptions of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to control SARS-CoV-2. A mixed method approach was used to collect, analyze, and interpret the data. Results: There was a 51.1% response rate. The proportion of family physicians who reported their intentions to be vaccinated for COVID-19 was significantly higher than those who were hesitant to receive the mRNA vaccines (90.6% vs 9.4%; 2 [1, N=307] = 201.9.1; P <.0001). Among those who were willing to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, the main reasons were to prevent COVID-19 infection; protect self, family, and community; contribute to herd immunity; inspire confidence that the vaccines are safe; and end the pandemic and bring life back to normal. Conclusion: Our findings suggest a significantly positive association between a physician's concerns and their willingness to be vaccinated with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. With the authorization of two new mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, future studies should investigate the number of physicians in our study who went on to receive the vaccine. "}
