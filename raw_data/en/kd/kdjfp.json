Some expecting moms have mild queasiness in the morning while others have nausea and vomiting all day long. Changing your diet or wearing seasickness bands on your wrists may help. But, if they don't and you need something more, your doctor may order Diclegis. Here are the answers to your questions about taking Diclegis during pregnancy. Overview Diclegis is a prescription medication that is FDA-approved to treat nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy. It is a product of Duchesnay USA, a pharmaceutical company dedicated to women's health. A major focus of their mission is to develop medicines that are safe and effective to use during pregnancy. Diclegis is a combination of two drugs: Pyridoxine hydrochloride 10 mg. Pyridoxine is vitamin B6. Low levels of pyridoxine in the body can contribute to morning sickness, so supplementation of vitamin B6 can help reduce nausea and vomiting. Doxylamine succinate 10 mg. Doxylamine is an antihistamine and sedative. Antihistamines block a substance in the body called histamine, which helps to treat and prevent allergies. It also helps to decrease nausea and vomiting . Duchesnay USA also makes Bonjesta. Bonjesta is another prescription medication for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. It is a higher dose of the same medicines in Diclegis. Bonjesta's extended-release tablets contain pyridoxine 20mg. Use in Pregnancy Diclegis treats nausea and vomiting in pregnancy when other treatments do not work. If it's time to turn to medication, the combination of doxylamine and vitamin B6 is the treatment of choice. Treatment of nausea and vomiting with Diclegis can: Improve your nutritional status since you may eat more if you're less nauseous. Prevent dehydration and loss of fluids through vomiting. Prevent nausea and vomiting from getting worse and becoming severe. Prevent complications of severe nausea and vomiting. Prevent the need for other treatments. Prevent taking time off from work. Morning Sickness Morning sickness is nausea with or without vomiting. It is widespread, affecting approximately 70% of expecting mothers. It can be just nausea (about 25% of the time) or both nausea and vomiting (about 50% of the time). It may be called morning sickness, but that's misleading since it can come on at any time of day. Typical morning sickness begins early in the first trimester at about five to six weeks, and it often ends by 14 weeks. By 22 weeks, about 90% of women find relief. However, for some, the nausea and vomiting of pregnancy can last into the third trimester and even until delivery. Nausea and vomiting can be mild, moderate, or severe. Mild morning sickness does not usually interfere with daily activities. It can often be tolerated and controlled with some daily diet changes. Moderate morning sickness may cause some frustration and affect your daily life. Drug-free treatments may help, but you may something more. Diclegis may be an option for moderate nausea and vomiting. Severe nausea and vomiting can interfere with your day-to-day activities, and it can be harmful to you and your baby. A form of severe nausea and vomiting called hyperemesis gravidarum is not common and seen in only about 1% of women. Dangerous complications of nausea and vomiting are rare, especially when it is managed and treated right away. Treating mild to moderate nausea and vomiting can prevent it from becoming severe and leading to complications such as: Dehydration Hospitalization Jaundice Wernicke encephalopathy Esophageal rupture Premature delivery A baby with a low birth weight Maternal death (rare) What to Expect From Morning Sickness Is Diclegis Right for You?
