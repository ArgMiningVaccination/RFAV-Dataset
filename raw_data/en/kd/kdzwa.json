An important component of SAMHSA's work is focused on dissemination of evidence-based practices and providing training and technical assistance to healthcare practitioners on implementation of these best practices. The Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) series contributes to SAMHSA's mission by providing science-based, best-practice guidance to the behavioral health field. TIPs reflect careful consideration of all relevant clinical and health services research, demonstrated experience, and implementation requirements. Select nonfederal clinical researchers, service providers, program administrators, and patient advocates comprising each TIP's consensus panel discuss these factors, offering input on the TIP's specific topics in their areas of expertise to reach consensus on best practices. Field reviewers then assess draft content and the TIP is finalized. The talent, dedication, and hard work that TIP panelists and reviewers bring to this highly participatory process have helped bridge the gap between the promise of research and the needs of practicing clinicians and administrators to serve, in the most scientifically sound and effective ways, people in need of care and treatment of mental and substance use disorders. My sincere thanks to all who have contributed their time and expertise to the development of this TIP . It is my hope that clinicians will find it useful and informative to their work. Elinore F. McCance-Katz, M.D., Ph.D. Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration TIP 63 Update To ensure that the content of this TIP is as up to date and as useful to readers as possible, SAMHSA, in January 2020, revised certain areas of all five parts. These changes will help provide readers with the latest information needed to understand medications for opioid use disorder. These changes included the following: Updating statistics from SAMHSA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other health authorities on opioid-related deaths, overdoses, accidents, and hospitalizations. Updating the expanded list of other qualifying practitioners who are eligible to apply for a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine (i.e., clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives). Clarifying that buprenorphine is available in an extended-release injection formulation. Adding information about the use of subdermal formulations of buprenorphine (i.e., Probuphine and Sublocade). Adding information about possible clinical interactions between formulations of buprenorphine and naltrexone with various other medications and products. Improving the language to make clear the importance of testing for HIV and hepatitis C. Updating recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force on performing drug screening for adults in primary care settings.

These deaths represent a mere fraction of the total number of Americans harmed by opioid misuse and addiction. Many Americans now suffer daily from a chronic medical illness called \"opioid addiction\" or OUD (see the Glossary in Part 5 of this TIP for definitions). Healthcare professionals, treatment providers, and policymakers have a responsibility to expand access to evidence-based, effective care for people with OUD. An expert panel developed the TIP's content based on a review of the literature and on their extensive experience in the field of addiction treatment. Other professionals also generously contributed their time and commitment to this project.The TIP is divided into parts so that readers can easily find the material they need. Part 1 is a general introduction to providing medications for OUD and issues related to providing that treatment. Some readers may prefer to go directly to those parts most relevant to their areas of interest, but everyone is encouraged to read Part 1 to establish a shared understanding of key facts and issues covered in detail in this TIP . Following is a summary of the TIP's overall main points and brief summaries of each of the five TIP parts. Overall Key Messages Addiction is a chronic, treatable illness. Opioid addiction, which generally corresponds with moderate to severe forms of OUD, often requires continuing care for effective treatment rather than an episodic, acute-care treatment approach.Executive Summary The goal of treatment for opioid addiction or opioid use disorder (OUD) is remission of the disorder leading to lasting recovery. Recovery is a process of change through which individ - uals improve their health and wellness, live self-directed lives, and strive to reach their full potential.1 This Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) reviews the use of the three Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications used to treat OUD\u2014methadone, naltrexone, and buprenorphine\u2014and the other strategies and services needed to support recovery for people with OUD. An estimated 1.7M AMERICANS have OUD related to opioid painkillers; 526K have heroin- related OUD.3 Estimated cost of OPIOID EPIDEMIC was $504 BILLION in 2015.2ES-2Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 General principles of good care for chronic diseases can guide OUD treatment. Approaching OUD as a chronic illness can help providers deliver care that helps patients stabilize, achieve remission of symptoms, and establish and maintain recovery. Patient-centered care empowers patients with information that helps them make better treatment decisions with the healthcare professionals involved in their care. Patients should receive information from their healthcare team that will help them understand OUD and the options for treating it, including treatment with FDA-approved medication. Patients with OUD should have access to mental health services as needed, medical care, and addiction counseling, as well as recovery support services, to supplement treatment with medication. The words you use to describe OUD and an individual with OUD are powerful. This TIP defines, uses, and encourages providers to adopt terminology that will not reinforce prejudice, negative attitudes, or discrimination. There is no \"one size fits all\" approach to OUD treatment. Many people with OUD benefit from treatment with medication for varying lengths of time, including lifelong treatment. Ongoing outpatient medication treatment for OUD is linked to better retention and outcomes than treatment without medication. Even so, some people stop using opioids on their own; others recover through support groups or specialty treatment with or without medication. The science demonstrating the effectiveness of medication for OUD is strong. For example, methadone, extended-release injectable naltrex- one (XR-NTX), and buprenorphine were each found to be more effective in reducing illicit opioid use than no medication in randomized clinical trials, which are the gold standard for demonstrating efficacy in clinical medicine.6,7,8,9,10 Methadone and buprenorphine treatment have also been associated with reduced risk of overdose death.11,12,13,14,15 This doesn't mean that remission and recovery occur only through medication. Some people achieve remission without OUD medication, just as some people can manage type 2 diabetes with exercise and diet alone. But just as it is inadvisable to deny people with diabetes the medication they need to help manage their illness, it is also not sound medical practice to deny people with OUD access to FDA-approved medications for their illness. Medication for OUD should be successfully integrated with outpatient and residential treatment. Some patients may benefit from different levels of care at different points in their lives, such as outpatient counseling, intensive outpatient treatment, inpatient treatment, or long-term therapeutic communities. Patients treated in these settings should have access to OUD medications.Opioid overdose caused 46,800 DEATHS nationwide in 2018\u2014 this exceeded the # caused by motor vehicle crashes.4,5 2 MILLION people in the U.S., ages 12 and older, had OUD involving PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS, HEROIN, or both in 2018.16ES-3 TIP 63Executive Summary Patients treated with medications for OUD can benefit from individualized psychosocial supports. These can be offered by patients' healthcare providers in the form of medication management and supportive counseling and/or by other providers offering adjunctive addiction counseling, recovery coaching, mental health services, and other services that may be needed by particular patients. Expanding access to OUD medications is an important public health strategy. 17 The gap between the number of people needing opioid addiction treatment and the capacity to treat them with OUD medication is substantial. In 2012, the gap was estimated at nearly 1 million people, with about 80 percent of opioid treatment programs (OTPs) nationally operating at 80 percent capacity or greater. 18 Improving access to treatment with OUD medications is crucial to closing the wide gap between treatment need and treatment availability, given the strong evidence of effectiveness for such treatments. 19 Data indicate that medications for OUD are cost effective and cost beneficial. 20,21 Content Overview The TIP is divided into parts to make the material more accessible according to the reader's interests. Part 1: Introduction to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment This part lays the groundwork for understanding treatment concepts discussed later in this TIP . The intended audience includes: Healthcare professionals (physicians, nursepractitioners, physician assistants, and, untilOctober 1, 2023, clinical nurse specialists,certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives). Professionals who offer addiction counselingor mental health services.Peer support specialists. People needing treatment and their families. People in remission or recovery and their families. Hospital administrators. Policymakers. In Part 1, readers will learn that: Increasing opioid overdose deaths, illicit opioid use, and prescription opioid misuse constitute a public health crisis. OUD medications reduce illicit opioid use, retain people in treatment, and reduce risk of opioid overdose death better than treatment with placebo or no medication. Only physicians; nurse practitioners; physician assistants; and, until October 1, 2023, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives can prescribe buprenorphine for OUD. They must get a federal waiver to do so. Only federally certified, accredited OTPs candispense methadone to treat OUD. OTPs can administer and dispense buprenorphine without a federal waiver. Any prescriber can offer naltrexone. OUD medication can be taken on a short- or long-term basis, including as part of medically supervised withdrawal and as maintenance treatment. Patients taking medication for OUD areconsidered to be in recovery. Several barriers contribute to the underuse of medication for OUD.OPIOID-RELATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT visits more than doubled from 2005 to 2016.22,23ES-4Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Part 2: Addressing Opioid Use Disorder in General Medical Settings This part offers guidance on OUD screening, assessment, treatment, and referral. Part 2 is for healthcare professionals working in general medical settings with patients who have or are at risk for OUD. In Part 2, readers will learn that: All healthcare practices should screen for alcohol, tobacco, and other substance misuse (including opioid misuse). Validated screening tools, symptom surveys, and other resources are readily available; this part lists many of them. When patients screen positive for risk of harm from substance use, practitioners should assess them using tools that determine whether substance use meets diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder (SUD). Thorough assessment should address patients' medical, social, SUD, and family histories. Laboratory tests can inform treatment planning. Practitioners should develop treatment plans or referral strategies (if onsite SUD treatment is unavailable) for patients who need SUD treatment. Part 3: Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder This part offers information and tools for health - care professionals who prescribe, administer, or dispense OUD medications or treat other illnesses in patients who take these medications. It provides guidance on the use of buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone by healthcare professionals in: General medical settings, including hospitals. Office-based opioid treatment settings. Specialty addiction treatment programs, including OTPs. In Part 3, readers will learn that: OUD medications are safe and effective when used appropriately.EVERYONE AGES 15 TO 65 should be tested at least ONCE for HIV . Persons at HIGHER RISK , such as people who use DRUGS by injection, should be tested ANNUALL Y . Anyone who is injecting or has ever INJECTED DRUGS , even ONCE , no matter how long ago, should be TESTED for HEPATITIS C, regardless of their intention to seek TREATMENT for SUD .24,25HIV Hep C OPIOID-RELATED inpatient hospital stays INCREASED 117% nationally from 2005 to 2016.26,27ES-5 TIP 63Executive Summary OUD medications can help patients reduce or stop illicit opioid use and improve their health and functioning. Pharmacotherapy should be considered for all patients with OUD. Opioid pharmacothera - pies should be reserved for those with moder - ate-to-severe OUD with physical dependence. Patients with OUD should be informed of the risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy, treatment without medication, and no treatment. Patients should be advised on where and how to get treatment with OUD medication. Doses and schedules of pharmacotherapy must be individualized. Part 4: Partnering Addiction Treatment Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals This part recommends ways that addiction treatment counselors can collaborate with healthcare professionals to support client- centered, trauma-informed OUD treatment and recovery. It also serves as a quick guide to medications that can treat OUD and presents strategies for clear communication with pre - scribers, creation of supportive environments for clients who take OUD medication, and ways to address other common counseling concerns when working with this population. In Part 4, readers will learn that: Many patients taking OUD medication benefit from counseling as part of treatment. Counselors play the same role for clients with OUD who take medication as for clients with any other SUD. Counselors help clients recover by addressing the challenges and consequences of addiction. OUD is often a chronic illness requiring ongoing communication among patients and providers to ensure that patients fully benefit from both pharmacotherapy and psychosocial treatment and support. OUD medications are safe and effective when prescribed and taken appropriately. Medication is integral to recovery for many people with OUD. Medication usually produces better treatment outcomes than outpatient treatment without medication. Supportive counseling environments for clients who take OUD medication can promote treatment and help build recovery capital. Part 5: Resources Related to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder This part has a glossary and audience-segmented resource lists to help medical and behavioral health service providers better understand how to use OUD medications with their patients and to help patients better understand how OUD medications work. It is for all interested readers. In Part 5, readers will learn that: Practice guidelines and decision-making tools can help healthcare professionals with OUD screening, assessment, diagnosis, treatment planning, and referral. Patient- and family-oriented resources provide information about opioid addiction in general; the role of medication, behavioral and sup - portive services, and mutual-help groups in the treatment of OUD; how-tos for identifying recovery support services; and how-tos for locating medical and behavioral health service providers who specialize in treating OUD or other SUDs.OPIOID ADDICTION is linked with high rates of ILLEGAL ACTIVITY and INCARCERATION.28,29ES-6Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 EXHIBIT 1.2.

Several barriers contribute to the underuse of medication for OUD.Part 1: Introduction to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment For Healthcare and Addiction Professionals, Policymakers, Patients, and Families Part 1 of this Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) will help readers understand key facts and issues related to providing Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications used to treat opioid use disorder (OUD). MEDICATIONS FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER TIP 63 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration1-iii TIP 63MEDICATIONS FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER\u2014Part 1 of 5 Contents The DISORDER TIP 63The Approach to OUD Care According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse, addiction is a chronic, treatable illness. Opioid addiction, which generally corresponds with moderate to severe forms of OUD (Exhibit 1.1), often requires continuing care for effective treatment rather than an episodic, acute-care treatment approach. The World Health Organization's (WHO's) principles of good care for chronic diseases can guide OUD care:1 Develop a treatment partnership with patients. Focus on patients' concerns and priorities. Support patient self-management of illness. Use the five A's at every visit (assess, advise, agree, assist, and arrange). Organize proactive follow-up. Link patients to community resources/support. Work as a clinical team. Involve \"expert patients,\" peer educators, and support staff in the health facility. Ensure continuity of care. Chronic care management is effective for many long-term medical conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and it can offer Introduction to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TreatmentPART 1 of 5 similar benefits to patients with substance use disorders (SUDs); for example, it can help them stabilize, achieve remission of symptoms, and establish and maintain recovery. Good con - tinuing care also provides, and links to, other medical, behavioral health, and community and recovery support services. A noticeable theme in chronic disease management is patient-centered care. Patient-centered care empowers patients with information that helps them make better treatment decisions with the healthcare profes - sionals involved in their care. Patients should receive information from their healthcare team that will help them understand OUD and the options for treating it, including treatment with FDA-approved medications. Healthcare professionals should also make patients aware of available, appropriate recovery support and behavioral health services. Estimated cost of the OPIOID EPIDEMIC was $504 BILLION in 2015.2Part 1 of this TIP offers a general introduction to providing medications to address opioid use disorder (OUD). It is for all audiences. Part 1 will help readers understand key facts and issues related to providing FDA-approved medications used to treat OUD. TIP Parts 2 through 5 cover these issues in more detail.1-2Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 EXHIBIT 1.1. Key Terms Addiction: As defined by the American Society of Addiction Medicine, \"a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry.\"3 It is characterized by inability to consistently abstain, impairment in behavioral control, craving, diminished recognition of significant problems with one's behaviors and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response. Like other chronic diseases, addiction often involves cycles of relapse and remission. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition4 (DSM-5), does not use the term for diagnostic purposes, but it commonly describes the more severe forms of OUD. Medically supervised withdrawal (formerly called detoxification): Using an opioid agonist (or an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist if an opioid agonist is not available) in tapering doses or other medications to help a patient discontinue illicit or prescription opioids. Opioid misuse: The use of prescription opioids in any way other than as directed by a prescriber; the use of any opioid in a manner, situation, amount, or frequency that can cause harm to self or others.5 Opioid receptor agonist: A substance that has an affinity for and stimulates physiological activity at cell receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) that are normally stimulated by opioids. Mu-opioid receptor full agonists (e.g., methadone) bind to the mu-opioid receptor and produce actions similar to those produced by the endogenous opioid beta-endorphin. Increasing the dose increases the effect. Mu-opioid receptor partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine) bind to the mu-opioid receptor. Unlike with full agonists, increasing their dose may not produce additional effects once they have reached their maximal effect. At low doses, partial agonists may produce effects similar to those of full agonists. Opioid receptor antagonist: A substance that has affinity for opioid receptors in the CNS without producing the physiological effects of opioid agonists. Mu-opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., naltrexone) can block the effects of exogenously administered opioids. Opioids: All natural, synthetic, and semisynthetic substances that have effects similar to morphine. They can be used as medications having such effects (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine, oxycodone). Opioid treatment program (OTP): An accredited treatment program with SAMHSA certification and Drug Enforcement Administration registration to administer and dispense opioid agonist medications that are approved by FDA to treat opioid addiction. Currently, these include methadone and buprenorphine products. Other pharmacotherapies, such as naltrexone, may be provided but are not subject to these regulations. OTPs must provide adequate medical, counseling, vocational, educational, and other assessment and treatment services either onsite or by referral to an outside agency or practitioner through a formal agreement.6 Opioid use disorder (OUD): Per DSM-5, a disorder characterized by loss of control of opioid use, risky opioid use, impaired social functioning, tolerance, and withdrawal. Tolerance and withdrawal do not count toward the diagnosis in people experiencing these symptoms when using opioids under appropriate medical supervision. OUD covers a range of severity and replaces what DSM-IV termed \"opioid abuse\" and \"opioid dependence.\" An OUD diagnosis is applicable to a person who uses opioids and experiences at least 2 of the 11 symptoms in a 12-month period. (See Exhibit 2.13 in Part 2 for full DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for OUD.) Recovery: A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live self- directed lives, and strive to reach their full potential. Even individuals with severe and chronic SUDs can, with help, overcome their SUDs and regain health and social function. Although abstinence from all substance misuse is a cardinal feature of a recovery lifestyle, it is not the only healthy, prosocial feature. Patients taking FDA-approved medication to treat OUD can be considered in recovery. Relapse: A process in which a person with OUD who has been in remission experiences a return of symptoms or loss of remission. A relapse is different from a return to opioid use in that it involves more than a single incident of use. Relapses occur over a period of time and can be interrupted. Relapse need not be long lasting. The TIP uses relapse to describe relapse prevention, a common treatment modality. Remission: A medical term meaning a disappearance of signs and symptoms of the disease.7 DSM-5 defines remission as present in people who previously met OUD criteria but no longer meet any OUD criteria (with the possible exception of craving).8 Remission is an essential element of recovery. Return to opioid use: One or more instances of opioid misuse without a return of symptoms of OUD. A return to opioid use may lead to relapse.1-3 TIP 63Part 1 of 5\u2014Introduction to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Overview of Medications for OUD There is no \"one size fits all\" approach to OUD treatment. Many people with OUD benefit from treatment with medication for varying lengths of time, including lifelong treatment. Ongoing outpatient medication treatment for OUD is linked to better retention and outcomes than treatment without medication. Even so, some people stop using opioids on their own; others recover through support groups or specialty outpatient or residential treatment with or without medication. Still, FDA-approved medication should be considered and offered to patients with OUD as part of their treatment. Benefits The three FDA-approved medications used to treat OUD improve patients' health and wellness by: Reducing or eliminating withdrawal symptoms: methadone, buprenorphine. Blunting the effects of illicit opioids: methadone, naltrexone, buprenorphine. Reducing or eliminating cravings to use opioids: methadone, naltrexone, buprenorphine. See Exhibit 1.2 for further comparison between these medications. Effectiveness The science demonstrating the effectiveness of medication for OUD is strong. For example, methadone, extended-release injectable naltrex - one (XR-NTX), and buprenorphine were each found to be more effective in reducing illicit opioid use than no medication in randomized clinical trials,9,10,11,12 which are the gold standard for demonstrating efficacy in clinical medicine. Methadone and buprenorphine treatment have also been associated with reduced risk of overdose death.13,14,15,16,17As is true for patients undergoing treatment for any chronic medical condition, patients with OUD should have access to medical, mental health, addiction counseling, and recovery support services that they may need to supplement treatment with medication. Medical care should include preventive services and disease management. Patients with OUD who have mental disorders should have access to mental health services. Treatment and support services should reflect each patient's individual needs and preferences. Some patients, particularly those with co- occurring disorders, may require these treatments and services to achieve sustained remission and recovery. The words you use to describe both OUD and an individual with OUD are powerful and can reinforce prejudice, negative attitudes, and discrimination. Negative attitudes held by the public and healthcare professionals can deter people from seeking treatment, make patients leave treatment prematurely, and contribute to worse treatment outcomes. The TIP expert panel recommends that providers always use medical terms when discussing SUDs (e.g., positive or negative urine sample, not dirty or clean sample) and use person-first language (e.g., a person with an SUD, not a user, alcoholic, or addict). Exhibit 1.1 defines some key terms. A full glossary is in Part 5 of this TIP . RESOURCE ALERT Shared Decision Making SAMHSA's shared decision-making tool is helpful for educating patients and their families about OUD. The information this tool provides can help patients make informed decisions about their care ( https://mat-decisions-in-recovery.samhsa. gov/ ).1-4Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 EXHIBIT 1.2.

UBM Medica. 131265:0917SH1-5 TIP 63Part 1 of to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment This doesn't mean that remission and recovery occur only through medication. Some people achieve remission without OUD medication, just as some people can manage type 2 diabetes with exercise and diet alone. But just as it is inadvisable to deny people with diabetes the medication they need to help manage their illness, it is also not sound medical practice to deny people with OUD access to FDA-approved medications for their illness. Medication for OUD should be successfully integrated with outpatient and residential treatment. Some patients may benefit from different levels of care during the course of their lives. These different levels include outpatient counseling, intensive outpatient treatment, inpatient treatment, or long-term therapeutic communities. Patients receiving treatment in these settings should have access to FDA- approved medications for OUD. Patients treated with OUD medications can benefit from individualized psychosocial supports. These can be offered by patients' healthcare providers in the form of medication management and supportive counseling and/or by other providers offering adjunctive addiction counseling, contingency management, recovery coaching, mental health services, and other services (e.g., housing supports) that particular patients may need.Expanding access to FDA-approved medica - tions is an important public health strategy. 19 A substantial gap exists between the number of people needing OUD treatment and the capacity to treat those individuals with OUD medication. In 2012, the gap was estimated at nearly 1 million people, with approximately 80 percent of OTPs nationally operating at 80 percent capacity or greater.20 Blue Cross Blue Shield reported a 493 percent increase in members diagnosed with OUD from 2010 to 2016 but only a 65 percent increase in the use of medication for OUD.21 Improving access is crucial to closing the wide gap between the need for treatment with OUD medications and the availability of such treatment, given the strong evidence of OUD medications' effectiveness.22 Methadone Methadone retains patients in treatment and reduces illicit opioid use more effectively than placebo, medically supervised withdrawal, or no treatment, as numerous clinical trials and meta-analyses of studies conducted in many countries show.23,24,25 Higher methadone doses are associated with superior outcomes.26,27 Given the evidence of methadone's effectiveness, WHO lists it as an essential medication.28 Methadone treatment has by far the largest, oldest evidence base of all treatment ap - proaches to opioid addiction. Large multisite longitudinal studies from the world over support methadone maintenance's effectiveness.29,30,31 Longitudinal studies have also found that it is associated with:32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40 Reduced risk of overdose-related deaths. Reduced risk of HIV and hepatitis C infection. Lower rates of cellulitis. Lower rates of HIV risk behavior. Reduced criminal behavior.The TIP expert panel strongly recommends informing all patients with OUD about the risks and benefits of treatment of OUD with all FDA- approved medications. Alternatives to these treatments and their risks and benefits should be discussed. Patients should receive access to such medications if clinically appropriate and desired by the patients.1-6Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Naltrexone XR-NTX reduces illicit opioid use and retains patients in treatment more effectively than placebo and no medication, according to findings from randomized controlled trials.41,42,43 In a two-group random assignment study of adults who were opioid dependent and involved in the justice system, all participants received brief counseling and community treatment referrals. One group received no medication, and the other group received XR-NTX. During the 6-month follow-up period, compared with the no-medication group, the group that received the medication demonstrated:44 Longer time to return to substance use (10.5 weeks versus 5.0 weeks). A lower rate of return to use (43 percent versus 64 percent). A higher percentage of negative urine screens (74 percent versus 56 percent). There are two studies comparing XR-NTX to sublingual buprenorphine. A multisite random - ized trial assigned adult residential treatment patients with OUD to either XR-NTX or bu - prenorphine. Patients randomly assigned to buprenorphine had significantly lower relapse rates during 24 weeks of outpatient treatment than patients assigned to XR-NTX.45 This finding resulted from challenges in completing XR-NTX induction, such that a significant proportion of patients did not actually receive XR-NTX. However, when comparing only those partici - pants who started their assigned medication, no significant between-group differences in relapse rates were observed. Because dose induction was conducted with inpatients, findings may not be generalizable to dose induction in outpatient settings, where most patients initiate treatment. A 12-week trial among adults with opioid de - pendence in Norway who were opioid abstinent at the time of random assignment found that XR-NTX was as effective as buprenorphine in retaining patients in treatment and in reducing illicit opioid use.46Oral naltrexone is also available, but it has not been found to be superior to placebo or to no medication in clinical trials.47 Nonadherence limits its use. Buprenorphine Buprenorphine in its sublingual form retains patients in treatment and reduces illicit opioid use more effectively than placebo.48 It also reduces HIV risk behaviors.49,50 A multisite randomized trial with individuals addicted to prescription opioids showed that continued buprenorphine was superior to buprenorphine dose taper in reducing illicit opioid use.51 Another randomized trial showed that continued buprenorphine also improved treatment retention and reduced illicit prescription opioid use compared with buprenorphine dose taper.52 Long-term studies of buprenorphine show its effectiveness outside of clinical research protocols.53,54 Naloxone, a short-acting opioid antagonist, is also often included in the buprenor - phine formulation to help prevent diversion to injected misuse. Because of the evidence of buprenorphine's effectiveness, WHO lists it as an essential medication.55 Buprenorphine is available in \"transmucosal\" (i.e., sublingual or buccal) formulations. Buprenorphine implants can be effective in stable patients. FDA approved implants (Probuphine) after a clinical trial showed them to be as effective as relatively low-dose (i.e., 8 mg or less daily) sublingual buprenorphine (Suboxone equivalents) for patients who are already clinically stable.56 More research is needed to establish implants' effectiveness outside of research studies, but findings to date are promising.57,58 FDA approved buprenorphine extended- release injection (Sublocade) in November 2017 to treat patients with moderate or severe OUD who have first received treatment with transmucosal buprenorphine for at least 1 week. This buprenorphine formu - lation is a monthly subcutaneous injection. Exhibit 1.2 compares medications for OUD.1-7 TIP 63Part 1 of 5\u2014Introduction to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Cost Effectiveness and Cost Benefits Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses can further our understanding of OUD medications' effectiveness. Data indicate that medications for OUD are cost effective. Cost-effectiveness analyses compare the cost of different treatments with their associated outcomes (e.g., negative opioid urine tests). Such analyses have found that: Methadone and buprenorphine are more cost effective than OUD treatment without medication.59 Counseling plus buprenorphine leads to significantly lower healthcare costs than little or no treatment among commercially insured patients with OUD.60 Treatment with any of the three OUD medi - cations this TIP covers led to lower healthcare usage and costs than treatment without medication in a study conducted in a large health plan.61 Relatively few cost-benefit analyses have examined addiction treatment with medi - cation separately from addiction treatment in general.62 Cost-benefit studies compare a treatment's cost with its benefits. The treatment is cost beneficial if its benefits outweigh its cost. These benefits can include: Reduced expenditures because of decreased crime. Reduced expenditures related to decreases in the use of the justice system. Improved quality of life. Reduced healthcare spending. Greater earned income. Methadone treatment in OTPs can reduce justice system and healthcare costs.63,64 Requirements and Regulations Following is a summary of regulations and requirements that apply to the three OUD medications. Part 3 of this TIP discusses the pharmacology and dosing of these medications.Only federally certified and accredited OTPs can dispense methadone for the treatment of OUD. Methadone is typically given orally as a liquid.65 OTPs can dispense buprenorphine under OTP regulations without using a federal waiver. Individual healthcare practitioners can prescribe buprenorphine in any medical setting, as long as they apply for and receive waivers of the special registration requirements defined in the Controlled Substances Act. Several laws and regulations contain information about which healthcare practitioners are eligible to apply for a waiver and how to qualify (https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assist - ed-treatment/training-materials-resources/ apply-for-practitioner-waiver ). This information is summarized below. Eligible physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other qualifying practitioners (clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives) can apply for a waiver. At present, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives are only eligible to apply for a waiver until October 1, 2023. For the first year of waiver use, all providers can treat up to 30 patients at one time. However, providers who satisfy additional practice and reporting requirements, and physicians who are board certified in addiction psychiatry or addiction medicine, may request to treat up to 100 patients at a time in the first year of waiver use. Additionally, practitioners who provide MAT in \"qualified practice settings,\" as defined in title 42, section 8.615 of the Code of Federal Regulations, may also request to treat up to 100 patients within the first year. After the first year of waiver use, all providers may request to increase their patient limit to 100.1-8Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Physicians and other qualified providers who are board certified in addiction psychiatry or addiction medicine or who satisfy additional practice and reporting requirements may apply to increase their patient limit to 275 after a year at the 100-patient limit. Prescribing buprenorphine implants requires Probuphine REMS Program certification. Providers who wish to insert or remove implants must obtain live training and certifi-cation in the REMS Program. Healthcare settings and pharmacies must get Sublocade REMS Program certification to dispense this medication and can only dispense it directly to healthcare providers for subcutane-ous administration. Naltrexone has no regulations beyond those that apply to any prescription pharmaceuti - cal. Any healthcare provider with prescribing authority, including those practicing in OTPs, can prescribe its oral formulation and administer its long-acting injectable formulation. The Controlled Substances Act contains a few exceptions from the requirement to provide methadone through an OTP or buprenorphine through an OTP or a waivered practitioner. These include (1) administering (not prescribing) an opioid for no more than 3 days to a patient in acute opioid withdrawal while preparations are made for ongoing care and (2) administering opioid medications in a hospital to maintain or detoxify a patient as an \"incidental adjunct to medical or surgical treatment of conditions other than addiction.\" 66 Duration of Treatment With OUD Medication Patients can take medication for OUD on a short-term or long-term basis. However, patients who discontinue OUD medication generally return to illicit opioid use. Why is this so, even when discontinuation occurs slowly and carefully? Because the more severe form of OUD (i.e., addiction) is more than physical depen-dence. Addiction changes the reward circuitry of the brain, affecting cognition, emotions, and behavior. Providers and their patients should base decisions about discontinuing OUD medication on knowledge of the evidence base for the use of these medications, individualized assessments, and an individualized treatment plan they collaboratively develop and agree upon. Arbitrary time limits on the duration of treatment with OUD medication are inadvisable. Maintenance Treatment The best results occur when a patient receives medication for as long as it provides a benefit. This approach is often called \"maintenance treatment.\" 67,68 Once stabilized on OUD med- ication, many patients stop using illicit opioids completely. Others continue to use for some time, but less frequently and in smaller amounts, which reduces their risk of morbidity and overdose death. OUD medication gives people the time and ability to make necessary life changes associated with long-term remission and recovery (e.g., changing the people, places, and things connected with their drug use), and to do so more safely. Maintenance treatment also minimizes cravings and withdrawal symptoms. RESOURCE ALERT OUD Medication Treatment Limits and Reporting Requirements The following websites provide information about (1) the Department of Health and Human Services' final rule to increase patient access to medication for OUD and (2) associated reporting requirements: www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/07 to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment And it lets people better manage other aspects of their life, such as parenting, attending school, or working. Medication Taper After some time, patients may want to stop opioid agonist therapy for OUD through gradually tapering doses of the medication. Their outcomes will vary based on factors such as the length of their treatment, abstinence from illicit drugs, financial and social stability, and motivation to discontinue medication.69 Longitudinal studies show that most patients who try to stop methadone treatment relapse during or after completing the taper.70,71 For example, in a large, population-based retrospective study, only 13 percent of patients who tapered from methadone had successful outcomes (no treatment reentry, death, or opioid-related hospitalization within 18 months after taper).72 A clinical trial of XR-NTX versus treatment without medication also found increased risk of returning to illicit opioid use after discontinuing medication.73 Adding psychosocial treatments to taper regimens may not significantly improve outcomes compared with remaining on medication. One study randomly assigned participants to methadone maintenance or to 6 months of methadone treatment with a dose taper plus intensive psychosocial treatment. The maintenance group had more days in treatment and lower rates of heroin use and HIV risk behavior at 12-month follow-up.74 Patients wishing to taper their opioid agonist medication should be offered psychosocial and recovery support services. They should be monitored during and after dose taper, offered XR-NTX, and encouraged to resume treatment with medication quickly if they return to opioid use. Medically Supervised Withdrawal Medically supervised withdrawal is a process in which providers offer methadone or buprenor - phine on a short-term basis to reduce physical withdrawal signs and symptoms. Formerly called detoxification, this process gradually decreases the dose until the medication is discontinued, typically over a period of days or weeks. Studies show that most patients with OUD who undergo medically supervised withdrawal will start using opioids again and won't continue in recommend - ed care.75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83 Psychosocial treatment strategies, such as contingency management, can reduce dropout from medically supervised withdrawal, opioid use during withdrawal, and opioid use following completion of withdrawal.84 Medically supervised withdrawal is necessary for patients starting naltrexone, which requires at least 7 days without short-acting opioids and 10 to 14 days without long-acting opioids. Patients who complete medically supervised withdrawal are at risk of opioid overdose. Treatment Settings Almost all healthcare settings are appro - priate for screening and assessing for OUD and offering medication onsite or by referral. Settings that offer OUD treatment have expanded from specialty sites (certified OTPs, residential facilities, outpatient addiction treatment programs, and addiction specialist physicians' offices) to general primary care practices, health centers, emergency depart - ments, inpatient medical and psychiatric units, jails and prisons, and other settings.Primary care physicians are on the front lines of providing office-based treatment with medication for OUD. Sustained public health efforts are essential to address the urgent need for OUD treatment and the risk of related overdose, HIV, and hepatitis C virus epidemics. These efforts must remove barriers and increase access to OUD medication.1-10Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 OUD medications should be available to patients across all settings and at all levels of care\u2014as a tool for remission and recovery. Because of the strength of the science, a 2016 report from the Surgeon General85 urged adoption of medication for OUD along with recovery supports and other behavioral health services throughout the healthcare system. Challenges to Expanding Access to OUD Medication Despite the urgent need for treatment throughout the United States, only about 21.5 percent of people with OUD received treatment from 2009 to 2013.86 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists more than 200 U.S. counties as at risk for an HIV or a hepatitis C virus outbreak related to injection drug use.87Resources Patient success stories are inspirational. They highlight the power of OUD medication to help people achieve remission and recovery. See the \"Patient Success Stories\" section in Part 5 of this TIP . Part 5 of this TIP also contains community resources and advocacy resources. The community resources are for OTP , addiction treatment, and office-based providers. The advocacy resources can help patients and others advocate for OUD medication for themselves and in their communities.1-11 TIP 63Part 1 of 5\u2014Introduction to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Notes 1 World Health Organization.

Validated screening tools, symptomsurveys, and other resources are readilyavailable; this part lists many of them. When patients screen positive for risk ofharm from substance use, practitionersshould assess them using tools thatdetermine whether substance use meetsdiagnostic criteria for a substance usedisorder (SUD). Thorough assessment should addresspatients' medical, social, SUD, and familyhistories. Laboratory tests can inform treatmentplanning. Practitioners should develop treatmentplans or referral strategies (if onsite SUDtreatment is unavailable) for patientswho need SUD treatment. MEDICATIONS FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER TIP 63 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration2-iii TIP 63MEDICATIONS FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER\u2014 Part 2 of 5 Contents (DAST-10) DSM-5 Opioid Use Disorder Checklist TAPS Tool Part MEDICATIONS FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER TIP 63Scope of the Problem The number of patients presenting with OUD in medical clinics, community health centers, and private practices is increasing. Healthcare professionals in these general settings are in an important position to identify, assess, and treat OUD or to refer patients for treatment. Moreover, patients who are medically and mentally stable can benefit from receiving OUD medications in integrated care settings, where they often have already established therapeutic relationships with their healthcare providers. Exhibit 2.1 defines key terms in Part 2. For more definitions, see the glossary in Part 5 of this TIP . Screening Screening can identify patients who may have diseases or conditions related to their substance use. Health care in general medical settings routinely includes screening for common, treatable conditions such as cancer that are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Screening for SUDs is important, as misuse of alcohol, tobacco, and other substances is common among patients in medical settings (Exhibit 2.2).1Addressing Opioid Use Disorder in General Medical SettingsPART 2 of 5 *In this TIP , the term \"general medical setting\" includes medical clinics, community health centers, and private practices.Screening can identify substance misuse in patients who wouldn't otherwise discuss it or connect it with the negative consequences they're experiencing. Some patients may spontaneously reveal their substance use and ask for help. This is more likely when they're experiencing harmful consequences of substance use. However, screening may identify unhealthy substance use (e.g., binge drinking) and SUDs Part 2 of this TIP is for healthcare professionals who work in general medical settings* and care for patients who misuse opioids or have OUD. Healthcare professionals in such settings address most personal healthcare needs, develop sustained partnerships with patients, and practice in the context of family and community. Thus, they have a good basis from which to understand patients' needs related to OUD screening, assessment, and treatment (or referral to specialty treatment). The TIP expert panel recommends that healthcare professionals screen patients for alcohol, tobacco, prescription drug, and illicit drug use at least annually. An estimated 1.7M AMERICANS have OUD related to opioid painkillers; 526K have heroin- related OUD.22-2Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 EXHIBIT 2.1. Key Terms Addiction: As defined by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM),3 \"a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry.\" It is characterized by inability to consistently abstain, impairment in behavioral control, craving, diminished recognition of significant problems with one's behaviors and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response. Like other chronic diseases, addiction often involves cycles of relapse and remission. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition4 (DSM-5), does not use the term for diagnostic purposes, but it commonly describes the more severe forms of OUD. Healthcare professionals: Physicians, nurse practitioners (NPs), physician assistants (PAs), and other medical service professionals who are eligible to prescribe medications for and treat patients with OUD (i.e., until October 1, 2023, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse midwives). The term \"prescribers\" also refers to these healthcare professionals. Maintenance treatment: Providing medications to achieve and sustain clinical remission of signs and symptoms of OUD and support the individual process of recovery without a specific endpoint (as with the typical standard of care in medical and psychiatric treatment of other chronic illnesses). Medically supervised withdrawal (formerly called detoxification): Using an opioid agonist (or an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist if an opioid agonist is not available) in tapering doses or other medications to help a patient discontinue illicit or prescription opioids. Medical management: Process whereby healthcare professionals provide medication, basic brief supportive counseling, monitoring of drug use and medication adherence, and referrals, when necessary, to addiction counseling and other services to address the patient's medical, mental health, comorbid addiction, and psychosocial needs. Office-based opioid treatment (OBOT): Providing medication for OUD in outpatient settings other than certified opioid treatment programs (OTPs). Opioid misuse: The use of prescription opioids in any way other than as directed by a prescriber; the use of any opioid in a manner, situation, amount, or frequency that can cause harm to self or others.5 Opioid receptor agonist: A substance that has an affinity for and stimulates physiological activity at cell receptors in the central nervous system that are normally stimulated by opioids. Mu-opioid receptor full agonists (e.g., methadone) bind to the mu-opioid receptor and produce actions similar to those produced by the endogenous opioid beta-endorphin. Increasing the dose increases the effect. Mu-opioid receptor partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine) bind to the mu-opioid receptor. Unlike with full agonists, increasing their dose may not produce additional effects once they have reached their maximal effect. At low doses, partial agonists may produce effects similar to those of full agonists. Opioid receptor antagonist: A substance that has an affinity for opioid receptors in the central nervous system without producing the physiological effects of opioid agonists. Mu-opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., naltrexone) can block the effects of exogenously administered opioids. Opioid treatment program (OTP): An accredited treatment program with Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) certification and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration to administer and dispense opioid agonist medications that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat opioid addiction. Currently, these include methadone and buprenorphine products. Other pharmacotherapies, such as naltrexone, may be provided but are not subject to these regulations. OTPs must provide adequate medical, counseling, vocational, educational, and other assessment and treatment services either onsite or by referral to an outside agency or practitioner through a formal agreement.6 Continued on next page2-3 TIP 63Part 2 of 5\u2014Addressing Opioid Use Disorder in General Medical Settings The following sections summarize reliable screening tools. (See Part 5 for more resources.) Alcohol Screening Screening for alcohol misuse can identify patients at increased risk for opioid use. When screening patients for opioid misuse, providers should also screen for alcohol misuse and alcohol use disorder (AUD), which cause considerable morbidity and mortality.11 Providers should warn patients who use opioids that alcohol may increase opioid overdose risk.12 The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening adults for alcohol misuse, including risky drinking and AUD. USPSTF also recommends brief counseling for patients with risky drinking.13,14before patients connect their substance use with their presenting complaint. Screening is also helpful when patients feel ashamed or afraid to reveal their concerns spontaneously. Every medical practice should determine which screening tools to use and when, how, and by whom they will be administered. Each practice should also identify steps to take when a patient screens positive. One efficient workflow strategy is to have clinical assistants or nurses administer the screening instrument in an interview or provide patients with a paper or computer tablet version for self-administration. (Self-administration is generally as reliable as interviewer administration.)10 Providers should be nonjudgmental and rely on established rapport when discussing screening results with patients. EXHIBIT 2.1. Key Terms (continued) Opioid use disorder (OUD): Per DSM-5,7 a disorder characterized by loss of control of opioid use, risky opioid use, impaired social functioning, tolerance, and withdrawal. Tolerance and withdrawal do not count toward the diagnosis in people experiencing these symptoms when using opioids under appropriate medical supervision. OUD covers a range of severity and replaces what the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, termed \"opioid abuse\" and \"opioid dependence.\" An OUD diagnosis is applicable to a person who uses opioids and experiences at least 2 of the 11 symptoms in a 12-month period. (See Exhibit 2.13 and the Appendix in Part 2 for full DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for OUD.) Recovery: A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential. Even individuals with severe and chronic SUDs can, with help, overcome their SUDs and regain health and social function. Although abstinence from all substance misuse is a cardinal feature of a recovery lifestyle, it is not the only healthy, prosocial feature. Patients taking FDA-approved medication to treat OUD can be considered in recovery. Relapse: A process in which a person with OUD who has been in remission experiences a return of symptoms or loss of remission. A relapse is different from a return to opioid use in that it involves more than a single incident of use. Relapses occur over a period of time and can be interrupted. Relapse need not be long lasting. The TIP uses relapse to describe relapse prevention, a common treatment modality. Remission: A medical term meaning a disappearance of signs and symptoms of the disease.8 DSM-5 defines remission as present in people who previously met OUD criteria but no longer meet any OUD criteria (with the possible exception of craving).9 Remission is an essential element of recovery. Return to opioid use: One or more instances of opioid misuse without a return of symptoms of OUD. A return to opioid use may lead to relapse. Tolerance: Alteration of the body's responsiveness to alcohol or other drugs (including opioids) such that higher doses are required to produce the same effect achieved during initial use. See also medically supervised withdrawal.2-4Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 USPSTF recommends the following alcohol screeners: The single-item National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) Screener is the briefest tool available (Exhibit 2.3). It can help distinguish at-risk patients who require further screening from those not at risk for AUD. Encourage patients in the latter category to maintain healthy behavior. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)16 or its briefer version, the AUDIT-Consumption,17 can elicit more in - formation from patients who screen positive on the single-item screener. The full AUDIT tool (Exhibit 2.4) and its briefer version have demonstrated acceptable reliability in AUD screening.18 Assess patients with positive screens for AUD. Practitioners should consider pharmacothera - py and referral to counseling for people with AUD. The three FDA-approved medications to treat AUD\u2014acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrex - one (oral and extended-release injectable nal - trexone [XR-NTX])\u2014can be prescribed in general medical and specialty SUD treatment settings.

Patients who screen positive should have an assessment for AUD. Adapted with permission.20 Tobacco Screening More than 80 percent of patients who are opioid dependent smoke cigarettes.21 Understanding of the major health conse - quences and risks associated with tobacco use has grown significantly over the past 50 years. Among preventable causes of premature death, smoking remains most prevalent, with more than 480,000 deaths per year in the United States.22 In addition, more than 40 percent of all people who smoke are mentally ill or have SUDs.23,24 USPSTF recommends that primary care providers screen for tobacco use, advise patients to quit, and provide counseling and FDA-approved medications for tobacco cessation.25 The six-item Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence26 assesses cigarette use and nicotine dependence. The maximum score is 10; the higher the total score, the more severe the patient's nicotine dependence. The two-item Heaviness of Smoking Index (Exhibit 2.5) is also useful.27 Drug Screening Screening for illicit drug use and prescription medication misuse is clinically advantageous. USPSTF's position is that adults ages 18 and older (including those who are pregnant) should be routinely screened in primary care for illicit drug use and prescription medication misuse when services for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate care can be offered or referral can be provided.28 Identifying misuse of prescription or illegal drugs can prevent harmful drug interactions, lead to adjustments in prescribing practices, improve medical care adherence, and increase the odds of patients getting needed interventions or treatment.29 Brief screening instruments for drug use can determine which patients need further assessment. Providers should reinforce healthy behaviors among patients who report \"no use\" and direct those who report \"some use\" for further screening and assessment to obtain a diagnosis. Several brief screening instruments for drug use can help primary care practitioners identify patients who use drugs.30,31 For example, a single-item screen is available for the general public (Exhibit 2.6).32 A two-item valid screener is available for use with U.S. veterans (Exhibit 2.7).33 Brief drug screens don't indicate specific types of drugs used (nor does the longer Drug Abuse Screening Test; see the Part 2 Appendix).34 If providers use nonspecific screens, they need to assess further which substances patients use and to what degree. The TIP expert panel recommends universal OUD screening. Given the high prevalence of SUDs in patients visiting primary care settings and the effectiveness of medications to treat OUD specifically, the TIP expert panel recommends screening all patients for opioid misuse.2-6Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 EXHIBIT 2.4.

Adapted with permission.40The Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) screens patients for all categories of substance misuse, including alcohol and tobacco. This World Health Organization (WHO) screener also assesses substance-specific risk. The ASSIST's length and rather complex scoring system have hindered its adoption, but a computerized version and a briefer hard copy version (ASSIST- lite) make its use more efficient.37,38 (See the \"Screening, Assessment, and Drug Testing Resources\" section for a link to a modified version of the ASSIST.) Follow up any positive one-question screen with a brief assessment. An example of a two-step screening and brief assessment is the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription Medications, and Other Substance Use (TAPS Tool; see Part 2 Appendix), developed and tested in primary care settings.41 This tool is based on the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Quick Screen V1.042,43 and a modified WHO ASSIST-lite.44 The TAPS Tool screens for clinically relevant heroin and prescription opioid misuse (meeting one or more DSM-5 SUD criteria) and misuse of an array of other substances in primary care patients. However, it may also detect SUDs only for the most often-used substances (i.e., alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana). Patients with positive screens for heroin or prescription opioid misuse need more indepth assessment.45The TIP expert panel does not recommend routine universal drug testing with urine, blood, or oral fluids in primary care. Still, drug testing can confirm recent drug use in patients receiving diagnostic workups for changes in mental status, seizures, or other disorders. Conduct drug testing before patients start OUD medication and during treatment for monitoring.2-8Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Assessment Determine the Need for and Extent of Assessment Assess patients for OUD if: They screen positive for opioid misuse. They disclose opioid misuse. Signs or symptoms of opioid misuse are present. The extent of assessment depends on a provider's ability to treat patients directly. If a provider does not offer pharmacotherapy, the focus should be on medical assessment, making a diagnosis of OUD, and patient safety. This allows the provider to refer patients to the appropriate level of treatment. The provider can also conduct: Assessment and treatment for co-occurring medical conditions or mental disorders (including HIV and hepatitis C [anti-HCV]). Motivational brief interventions to promote safer behavior and foster effective treatment engagement. Overdose prevention education and provide a naloxone prescription. Education for patients who inject drugs on how to access sterile injecting equipment. An in-person follow-up, regardless of referral to specialty treatment. If the provider offers pharmacotherapy, the patient needs more comprehensive assess - ment, including: A review of the prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP). A history, including a review of systems. A targeted physical exam for signs of opioid withdrawal, intoxication, injection, and other medical consequences of misuse. Determination of OUD diagnosis and severity. Appropriate laboratory tests in addition to those recommended by the nontreating provider (e.g., urine or oral fluid drug tests, liver function tests, hepatitis B test).46A comprehensive assessment is intended to: Establish the diagnosis of OUD. Determine the severity of OUD. Identify contraindicated medications. Indicate other medical conditions to address during treatment. Identify mental and social issues to address. Set the Stage for Successful Assessment The medical setting should create a welcoming environment that is nonjudgmental, respect - ful, and empathetic. Many patients with OUD are reluctant to discuss their opioid use in EVERYONE AGES 15 TO 65 should be tested at least ONCE for HIV . Persons at HIGHER RISK , such as people who use DRUGS by injection, should be tested ANNUALL Y . Anyone who is injecting or has ever INJECTED DRUGS , even ONCE , no matter how long ago, should be TESTED for HEPATITIS C, regardless of their intention to seek TREATM E NT for SUD .47,48HIV Hep C2-9 TIP 63Part 2 of 5\u2014Addressing Opioid Use Disorder in General Medical Settings medical settings.49 A welcoming environment can help patients feel safe disclosing facts they may find embarrassing.50 Motivational interviewing strategies, such as asking open-ended questions, foster successful assessment.51 (Refer to TIP 34, Brief Interventions and Brief Therapies for Substance Abuse , for more specific examples of interview questions and responses.)52 Staff should explore patients' ambivalence and highlight problem areas to help them find motivations for change. Almost all patients have some ambivalence about their opioid use. They will find some aspects pleasant and beneficial, but others problematic, painful, or destructive. By exploring that ambivalence and highlighting problem areas, providers can help patients discover their own motivations for change. Motivational Interviewing: Helping People Change53 discusses specific applications of motivational interviewing in health care. Take a Complete History Staff should prioritize medical, mental health, substance use, and SUD treatment histories. When obtaining patient histories, staff should address these domains before starting Open-ended, thought-provoking questions encourage patients to explore their own experiences. Ask questions like \"In what ways has oxycodone affected your life?\" or \"What could you do to prevent infections like this in the future?\" Closed-ended questions with yes/no answers\u2014like \"Has oxycodone caused your family trouble?\"\u2014can seem judgmental to patients who already feel ashamed and defensive. Closed-ended questions don't help patients become aware of and express their own circumstances and motivations, nor do they encourage patients to identify what they see as the consequences of their substance use.treatment. As providers and staff build trust over future visits, they can get into more detailed elements of the assessment. Medical history Taking a complete medical history of patients with OUD is critical, as it is for patients with any other medical condition treatable with phar - macotherapy. Asking about patients' medical/ surgical history can: Reveal medical effects of substance use (e.g., endocarditis, soft tissue infection, hepatitis B or C, HIV infection) that may need treatment. Highlight consequences that motivate change. Identify medical issues (e.g., severe liver disease) that contraindicate or alter dosing approaches for OUD pharmacotherapies. Reveal chronic pain issues. Help providers consider interactions among various medications and other substances. Exhibit 2.8 lists medical problems associated with opioid misuse. Mental health history Assessing for comorbid mental illness is critical. Mental illness is prevalent among people with SUDs; it can complicate their treatment and worsen their prognosis. In one study, nearly 20 percent of primary care patients with OUD had major depression.54 SUDs can also mimic or induce depression and anxiety disorders. Although substance-induced depression and anxiety disorders may improve with abstinence, they may still require treatment in their own right after a period of careful observation.55 Take a history of the relationship between a patient's psychiatric symptoms and periods of substance use and abstinence. Treatment for mental disorders and SUDs can occur concurrently. Substance use history Substance use histories can help gauge OUD severity, inform treatment planning, clarify potential drug interactions, and highlight the negative consequences of patients' opioid use.2-10Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 EXHIBIT 2.8.

Routes of ingestion (e.g., injection). History of tolerance, withdrawal, drug mixing, and overdose.Histories should also explore current patterns of use,56 which inform treatment planning and include: Which drugs patients use. Comorbid alcohol and tobacco use. Frequency, recency, and intensity of use.2-11 TIP 63Part 2 of 5\u2014Addressing Opioid Use Disorder in General Medical Settings EXHIBIT 2.9. Signs of Opioid Intoxication Physical findings Drowsy but arousable Sleeping intermittently (\"nodding off\") Constricted pupils Mental status findings Slurred speech Impaired memory or concentration Normal to euphoric mood To diagnose an SUD, assess patients' negative consequences of use, which can affect: Physical health. Mental health. Family relationships. Work/career status. Legal involvement. Housing status. Buprenorphine and methadone can cause complications for patients who misuse or have SUDs involving alcohol or benzodiazepines. Providers should take specific histories on the use of these substances. SUD treatment history Information about a patient's past efforts to get treatment or quit independently can inform treatment planning. The same is true for details about the events and behaviors that led to a patient's return to substance use after periods of abstinence and remission of SUD. Similarly, identifying the features of successful quit attempts can help guide treatment plan decisions. Such features may involve: Specific treatment settings. Use of support groups. Previous responses to OUD medications. Social history Information about a patient's social environ - ments and relationships can aid treatment planning. Social factors that may influence treatment engagement and retention, guide treatment planning, and affect prognosis include: Transportation and child care needs. Adequacy and stability of housing. Criminal justice involvement. Employment status and quality of work environment. Close/ongoing relationships with people with SUDs. Details about drug use from people the patient lives or spends time with (obtained with patient's consent). Sexual orientation, identity, and history, including risk factors for HIV/sexually transmit - ted infections. Safety of the home environment. Substance misuse substantially increases the risk of intimate partner violence; screen all women presenting for treatment for domestic violence.58 Family history Learn the substance use histories of patients' parents, siblings, partners, and children. One of the strongest risk factors for developing SUDs is having a parent with an SUD. Genetic factors, exposure to substance use in the household during childhood, or both can contribute to the development of SUDs.59Understanding patients' motivations for change can be more useful than assessing \"readiness\" for change. Patients coerced into treatment\u2014such as through parole and probation or drug courts\u2014are as likely to succeed in treatment as patients engaging voluntarily. Readiness fluctuates and depends on context. Helping patients explore why they want to change their drug use can motivate them and prepare their providers to support them during assessment and treatment.2-12Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Conduct a Physical Examination Perform a physical exam as soon as possible if recent exam records aren't accessible. Assess for: Opioid intoxication or withdrawal. Physical signs of opioid use. Medical consequences of opioid use. Exhibit 2.9 provides an overview of physical and mental status findings for opioid intoxication. Opioid withdrawal Opioid withdrawal can be extremely uncom - fortable. Symptoms are similar to experiencing gastroenteritis, severe influenza, anxiety, and dysphoria concurrently. Severity of withdrawal can indicate a patient's level of physical dependence and can inform medication choices and dosing decisions. The duration of withdrawal depends on the specific opioid from which the patient is withdrawing and can last 1 to 4 weeks. After the initial withdrawal phase is complete, many patients experience a prolonged phase of dysphoria, craving, insomnia, and hyperalgesia that can last for weeks or months.PATIENT TESTIMONY Opioid Withdrawal \"Severe opioid withdrawal isn't something I'd wish on my worst enemy. The last time I went cold turkey, I was determined to come off all the way. The physical symptoms were just the tip of the iceberg. My mind was a nightmare that I thought I would never wake up from. There were times when I was almost convinced that dying would be better than what I was feeling. I did not experience a moment of ease for the first 3 months, and it was 6 months until I started to feel normal.\"EXHIBIT 2.10. Physical Signs of Opioid Withdrawal and Time to Onset STAGE GRADEPHYSICAL SIGNS/ SYMPTOMS Early withdrawal Short-acting opioids: 8-24 hours after last use Long-acting opioids: Up to 36 hours after last useGrade 1Lacrimation, rhinorrhea, or both Diaphoresis Yawning Restlessness Insomnia opioids: 8-24 hours after last use Long-acting opioids: Up to 36 hours after last useGrade 2Dilated pupils Piloerection Muscle twitching Myalgia Arthralgia Abdominal pain Fully developed withdrawal opioids: 1-3 days after last use after last useGrade 3Tachycardia Hypertension Tachypnea Fever Anorexia or nausea Extreme restlessness Fully developed withdrawal Short-acting opioids: 1-3 days after Long-acting opioids: 72-96 useGrade 4Diarrhea, vomiting, or Long-acting opioids: 14 days or more Assess opioid withdrawal in the physical exam by noting physical signs and symptoms (Exhibit 2.10). Structured measures (e.g., Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale [COWS]; Clinical Institute 2-13 TIP 63Part 2 of 5\u2014Addressing Opioid Use Disorder in General Medical Settings Narcotic Assessment Scale for Withdrawal Symptoms) can help standardize documentation of signs and symptoms to support diagnosis, initial management, and treatment planning. See the \"Resources\" section for links to standardized scales. Part 3 of this TIP covers withdrawal symptom documentation for pharmacotherapy initiation. The physical signs of opioid misuse vary depending on the route of ingestion: Patients who primarily smoke or sniff (\"snort\") opioids or take them orally often have few physical signs of use other than signs of intoxication and withdrawal. However, snorting can cause congestion and damage nasal mucosa. Patients who inject opioids may develop: Sclerosis or scarring of the veins and needle marks, or \"track marks,\" in the arms, legs, hands, neck, or feet (intravenous use). Edema in the foot, hand, or both (common in injection use, but may occur in oral use). Abscesses or cellulitis. Jaundice, caput medusa, palmar erythema, spider angiomata, or an enlarged or hardened liver secondary to liver disease. Heart murmur secondary to endocarditis. Obtain Appropriate Laboratory Tests Urine or oral fluid drug testing Urine or oral fluid drug testing is useful before initiating OUD pharmacotherapy. Testing establishes a baseline of substances the patient has used so that the provider can monitor the patient's response to treatment over time. Testing for a range of commonly used substances helps confirm patient histories, facilitates dis - cussion of recent drug use and symptoms, and aids in diagnosing and determining severity of SUDs. Drug testing is an important tool in the diagnosis and treatment of addiction. A national EXHIBIT 2.11. Patient-Provider Dialog: Talking About Drug Testing Frame drug testing in a clinical, nonpunitive way. For example, before obtaining a drug test, ask the patient, \"What do you think we'll find on this test?\" The patient's response is often quite informative and may make the patient less defensive than confrontation with a positive test result. SCENARIO: A provider discusses urine drug testing with a patient being assessed for OUD treatment with medication. Provider: When we assess patients for medication for opioid addiction, we always check urine samples for drugs. Patient: I'll tell you if I used. You don't need to test me. Provider: Thank you, I really appreciate that. The more we can talk about what's going on with you, the more I can help. I'm not checking the urine to catch you or because I don't trust you. I trust you. I can see how motivated you are. But I don't trust the addiction because I know how powerful addiction can be, too. To monitor your safety on medication and help determine what other services you may need, it's important for us to test you periodically and discuss the results. Does that sound okay? Patient: Yeah, that makes sense.During ongoing pharmacotherapy with buprenorphine or methadone, drug testing can confirm medication adherence.2-14Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Co-occurring SUDs require separate, specific treatment plans.

Barbiturates Barbiturates Up to 6 weeks N/A Benzodiazepines Benzodiazepines 1-3 days; up to 6 weeks with heavy use of long-acting benzodiazepinesImmunoassays may not be sensitive to therapeutic doses, and most immunoassays have low sensitivity to clonazepam and lorazepam. Check with your laboratory regarding sensitivity and cutoffs. False positives with sertraline or oxaprozin. *Detection time may vary depending on the cutoff. Continued on next pageguideline on the use of drug testing is available from ASAM.60 Exhibit 2.11 provides guidance on talking with patients about drug testing. To assess and manage patients with OUD properly, providers must know which tests to order and how to interpret results. There are many drug testing panels; cutoffs for positive results vary by laboratory. One widely used panel, the NIDA-5, tests for cannabinoids, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and phencycli - dine. Additional testing for benzodiazepines, the broader category of opioids, and specific drugs commonly used in the patient's locality may be warranted. The typical opioid immunoassay will only detect morphine, which is a metabolite of heroin, codeine, and some other opioids. The typical screen will not detect methadone, buprenorphine, or fentanyl and may not detect hydrocodone, hydromorphone, or oxycodone. Specific testing is needed to identify these substances.Testing for substances that can complicate OUD pharmacotherapy is essential. Testing for cocaine, benzodiazepines, and methamphet - amine is clinically important because these and other substances (and related SUDs, which may require treatment in their own right), especially benzodiazepines, can complicate pharmacother - apy for OUD. Benzodiazepine and other sedative misuse can increase the risk of overdose among patients treated with opioid agonists. When assessing benzodiazepine use, note that typical benzodiazepine urine immunoassays will detect diazepam but perhaps not lorazepam or clonaz - epam. Providers must specifically request testing for these two benzodiazepines. Exhibit 2.12 shows urine drug testing windows of detection.2-15 TIP 63Part 2 of 5\u2014Addressing Opioid Use Disorder in General Medical Settings EXHIBIT 2.12.

May not detect all fentanyl-like substances.63 Heroin Morphine, codeine1-2 days Will screen positive on opiate immunoassay. 6-monoacetylmorphine, a unique metabolite of heroin, is present in urine for about 6 hours. Can be tested for specifically to distinguish morphine from heroin, but this is rarely clinically useful. Hydrocodone Hydrocodone, hydromorphone2 days May screen negative on opiate immunoassay.

Ingestion of poppy plant/ seed may screen positive. Oxycodone Oxymorphone 1-1.5 days Typically screens negative on opiate immunoassay. Can be tested for specifically. *Detection time may vary depending on the cutoff.2-16Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Positive opioid tests can confirm recent use. Document recent use before starting patients on buprenorphine or methadone. Positive methadone or buprenorphine tests are expected for patients receiving these treatments. Positive opioid tests contraindicate starting naltrexone. Negative opioid test results require careful interpretation. A patient may test negative for opioids despite presenting with opioid withdrawal symptoms if he or she hasn't used opioids for several days. A negative opioid test in the absence of symptoms of opioid withdrawal likely indicates that the patient has little or no opioid tolerance, which is important information for assessment and treatment planning. Consider that the opioid the patient reports using may not be detected on the particular immunoassay. Screening tests are not definitive; false positive and false negative test results are possible. Confirmatory testing should follow all unexpected positive screens. Urine drug testing will detect metabolites from many prescription opioids but miss others, so it is easy to misinterpret results in patients taking these medications.64 False positives are also common in amphetamine testing.65 Point-of-service testing provides the opportu - nity to discuss results with patients immedi - ately. However, cutoffs for positive screens are not standardized across point-of-service tests. Know the specifications of the screens used.66 Other laboratory tests Patients with OUD, particularly those who inject drugs, are at risk for liver disease and blood-borne viral infections. Pregnancy is another important consideration in determining treatment course. Recommended laboratory tests for patients with OUD include: Pregnancy testing, which is important because: It is not advisable for patients to start naltrex - one during pregnancy. Pregnant women treated for active OUD typically receive buprenorphine or methadone. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and a recent SAMHSA- convened expert panel on the treatment of OUD in pregnancy67 recommend that pregnant women with OUD receive opioid receptor agonist pharmacotherapy.68 Providers should refer pregnant women to prenatal care or, if qualified, provide it themselves. Liver function tests (e.g., aspartate aminotransfer - ase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin), which can: Guide medication selection and dosing. Rule out severe liver disease, which may contraindicate OUD medication (see Part 3 of this TIP). Hepatitis B and C serology, which can indicate: Patients with positive tests (evaluate for hepatitis treatment). The need to administer hepatitis A and B and tetanus vaccines, if appropriate. HIV serology, which can help identify: Patients who are HIV positive (evaluate for antiretroviral treatment). Patients who are HIV negative (evaluate for preexposure prophylaxis and targeted education). Review the PDMP Before initiating OUD medication, providers should check their states' PDMPs to determine whether their patients receive prescriptions for controlled substances from other healthcare professionals. Using the PDMP improves the ability to manage the risks of controlled substances and to identify potentially harmful drug interactions.69 Although OTPs are not permitted to report methadone treatment to PDMPs, pharmacies that dispense buprenorphine and other controlled substances do report to PDMPs.

Opioids are often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period of time than was intended. 2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control opioid use. 3. A great deal of time is spent in activities to obtain the opioid, use the opioid, or recover from its effects. 4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use opioids. 5. Recurrent opioid use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home. 6. Continued opioid use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused by or exacerbated by the effects of opioids. 7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of opioid use. 8. Recurrent opioid use in situations in which it is physically hazardous. 9. Continued opioid use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that's likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance. 10. Tolerance,* as defined by either of the following: a. A need for markedly increased amounts of opioids to achieve intoxication or desired effect b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of an opioid 11. Withdrawal,* as manifested by either of the following: a. The characteristic opioid withdrawal syndrome b. The same\u2014or a closely related\u2014substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms *This criterion is not met for individuals taking opioids solely under appropriate medical supervision. Severity: mild = 2-3 symptoms; moderate = 4-5 symptoms; severe = 6 or more symptomsRESOURCE ALERT Shared Decision-Making Tool for Patients and Family Members SAMHSA's online shared decision-making tool for patients is a good information source for patients to review before their visit or in the office ( https://www.samhsa.gov/brss-tacs/ recovery-support-tools/shared-decision- making ). In addition, providers can suggest that family, friends, and other potential recovery supports (e.g., 12-Step program sponsors, employers, clergy) read educational material tailored for them. See Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Addiction: Facts for Families and Friends (https://mha.ohio.gov/ Portals/0/assets/HealthProfessionals/About%20 MH%20and%20Addiction%20Treatment/MAT/ SMA14-4443.pdf?ver=2018-11-26-113004-157 ).Determine Diagnosis and Severity of OUD Use DSM-5 criteria to make an OUD diagnosis (Exhibit 2.13).70 Patients who meet two or three criteria have mild OUD. Those meeting four or five criteria have moderate OUD, and those meeting six or more criteria have severe OUD.71 A printable checklist of DSM-572 criteria is available in the Part 2 Appendix. Treatment Planning or Referral Making Decisions About Treatment Start by sharing the diagnosis with patients and hearing their feedback. Patients with OUD need to make several important treatment decisions: Whether to begin medication to treat OUD. What type of OUD medication to take.2-18Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Where and how to access desired treatment. Whether to access potentially beneficial mental health, recovery support, and other ancillary services, whether or not they choose pharmacotherapy. Offer information to patients about the various treatments for OUD and collaborate with them to make decisions about treatment plans or referrals (Exhibit 2.14). Consider discussing: Indications, risks, and benefits of medications and alternatives to pharmacotherapy. Types of settings that deliver medications (including healthcare professionals' own practice locations, if applicable). Availability of and accessibility to treatment (i.e., transportation). Alternative treatments without medication (e.g., residential treatment, which often offers medically supervised opioid withdrawal). Costs of treatment with OUD medication, including insurance coverage and affordability. Give patients' expressed preferences signif - icant weight when making decisions. Patient characteristics can't reliably predict greater likeli - hood of success with one approved medication or another. For detailed information on medications to treat OUD, refer to Part 3 of this TIP . Strategies to engage patients in shared decision making include: Indicating to patients a desire to collaborate with them to find the best medication and treatment setting for them. Including family members in the treatment planning process, if possible (and only with patients' consent). Exploring what patients already know about treatment options and dispelling misconceptions. Offering information on medications and their side effects, benefits, and risks (Exhibit 2.14; Part 3). Informing patients of the requirements of the various treatment options (e.g., admission criteria to an OTP; frequency of visits to an OBOT or OTP). Offering options, giving recommendations after deliberation, and supporting patients' informed decisions. Understanding Treatment Settings and Services Support patient preferences for treatment settings and services. Some patients prefer to receive OUD medication via physicians' offices. Others choose outpatient treatment programs that provide opioid receptor agonist treatment for medically supervised withdrawal (with or without naltrexone) or for ongoing opioid receptor agonist maintenance treatment. Still others may want OUD treatment in a residential program with or without pharmacotherapy (Exhibit 2.15). Many patients initially form a preference for a certain treatment without knowing all the risks, benefits, and alternatives. Providers should ensure that patients understand the risks and benefits of all options. Without this understand - ing, patients can't give truly informed consent. Outpatient OUD Treatment Settings Refer patients who prefer treatment with methadone or buprenorphine via an OTP and explain that: They will have to visit the program from 6 to 7 times per week at first. Additional methadone take-home doses are possible at every 90 days of demonstrated progress in treatment. Buprenorphine take-home doses are not bound by the same limits as methadone.Part 1 of this TIP gives an overview of the three FDA-approved medications used to treat OUD. Part 3 covers the details of their use. 2-19 TIP 63Part 2 of 5\u2014Addressing Opioid Use Disorder in General Medical Settings EXHIBIT 2.14.

Treatment Setting Based on Patient's Choice of OUD Medication MEDICATIONPOSSIBLE TREATMENT SETTING Buprenorphine Office-based treatment, outpatient or residential SUD treatment programs (prescriber must have a federal waiver), OTP. REMS program participation is required for use of depot formulations. Methadone OTP Naltrexone Office-based treatment, outpatient or residential SUD treatment programs, OTP Counseling and drug testing are required parts of OTP treatment. Some programs also offer case management, peer support, medical services, mental disorder treatment, and other services. Try to arrange OTP intake appointments for patients before they leave the office. If no immediate openings are available, consider starting buprenorphine as a bridge or alternative to the OTP . Gauge the appropriate intensity level for patients seeking non-OTP outpatient treatment for OUD. These programs range from low intensity (individual or group counseling once to a few times a week) to high intensity (2 or more hours a day of individual and group counseling several days a week). Appropriate treatment intensity depends on each patient's:79 Social circumstances. Severity of addiction. Personal preferences. Psychiatric/psychological needs. Ability to afford treatment at a given intensity. Outpatient medical settings Healthcare professionals cannot provide methadone in their clinics. Only those with a buprenorphine waiver can provide buprenor - phine. Any healthcare professional with a pre - scribing authority can provide naltrexone. Once providers obtain the necessary waiver, they should offer buprenorphine treatment to all patients who present with OUD if such treatment is available and appropriate. Referring them to treatment elsewhere will likely result in delay or lack of patient access to care. Develop a treatment plan to determine where patients will receive continuing care (see the \"Treatment Planning\" section). Continue to provide nal - trexone for patients who were already receiving it from some other setting (e.g., a prison, a specialty addiction treatment program) or for patients who meet opioid abstinence require - ments and wish to take a medication for relapse prevention. Residential drug treatment settings Patients who have OUD, concurrent other substance use problems, unstable living situations, or a combination of the three may be appropriate candidates for residential treatment, which can last from a week to several weeks or more. Inform patients about the services and requirements typical of this treatment setting. Some patients taking buprenorphine (or methadone) who have other SUDs, such as AUD or cocaine use disorder, can benefit from residential treatment. If such treatment is indicated, determine whether the residential program allows patients to continue their opioid receptor agonist medication while in treatment. Some residential programs require patients to discontinue these medications to receive residential treatment, which could destabilize patients and result in opioid overdose.2-22Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Residential treatment programs typically provide: Room and board. Recovery support. Counseling. Case management. Medically supervised withdrawal (in some programs). Starting buprenorphine or naltrexone (in some programs). Onsite mental health services (in some cases). Buprenorphine or methadone continuation for patients already enrolled in treatment prior to admission if their healthcare professionals have waivers or their OTP permits. Transitioning out of residential settings requires careful planning. During a patient's stay in residential treatment, plan for his or her transition out of the program. A good transition plan maximizes the likelihood of continuity of care after discharge. Plans should also address overdose risk. Patients who are no longer opioid tolerant are at heightened risk of opioid overdose if they don't get OUD medication at discharge. Providing XR-NTX, buprenorphine, or methadone during treatment and continuing the medication after discharge can help prevent return to opioid use after discharge. Providing a naloxone prescription and overdose prevention information is appropriate. RESOURCE ALERT Maintaining Confidentiality Providers who treat patients with addiction must know substance use-related disclosure rules and confidentiality requirements. SAMHSA's webpage lists frequently asked questions on substance use confidentiality and summarizes federal regulations about disclosure and patient records that federal programs maintain on addiction treatment (https://www.samhsa.gov /about-us/who-we-are/laws-regulations/confiden tiality-regulations-faqs ). Key points include: Confidentiality regulations prohibit specialty SUD treatment programs from sharing information with healthcare professionals about patients' SUD treatment without specific consent from patients. Referrals to other behavioral health services require consent for sharing information on treatment progress. Healthcare professionals should discuss confidentiality and consent with patients during the referral process. OUD pharmacotherapy prescribers may consider requiring patient consent for communicating with treatment programs as a condition of receiving OUD treatment. Treatment program staff members can help identify returns to substance use, or risk of such, before the prescriber and can work with the prescriber to stabilize patients.RESOURCE ALERT Treatment and Provider Locator SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator ( https://findtreatment.samhsa .gov ) provides information on drug and alcohol treatment programs across states. Another SAMHSA tool identifies the locations of buprenorphine providers 5\u2014Addressing Opioid Use Disorder in General Medical Settings Determining OUD Service Intensity and Ensuring Follow-Through Use ASAM placement criteria for guidance on selecting the right level of OUD treatment. ASAM criteria define the level of care and key features that may make a given level (e.g., residential, intensive outpatient, standard outpatient) appropriate for a patient80 (see the \"Treatment Planning\" section). To help patients select programs, note that some focus on specific populations (e.g., gender-specific programs; parents with children; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning populations). Make an appointment with the referral program during the patient's visit rather than giving the patient a phone number to call. Follow up with the patient later to determine whether he or she kept the appointment. Doing so increases the chances of a successful referral. Referring patients to behavioral health and support services Discuss patients' potential need for behavioral health, peer support, and other ancillary services, like: Drug and alcohol counseling. Mental health services. Case management. Mutual-help groups. Peer recovery support services. Offer referrals to counseling and tailored psychosocial support to patients receiving OUD medication (Exhibit 2.16). Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 legislation requires that buprenorphine pre - scribers be able to refer patients to counseling, but making referrals is not mandatory.81 Many patients benefit from referral to mental health services or specialized addiction counseling and recovery support services. However, four randomized trials found no extra benefit to adding adjunctive counseling to well-conducted medical management visits delivered by the buprenorphine prescriber. There is evidence of benefits to adding contingency management to pharmacotherapy.82,83,84,85,86 Make referrals to mutual-help groups. Patients may wish to participate in mutual- help groups (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Methadone Anonymous, Medication-Assisted Recovery Services, SMART Recovery) in addition to or instead of specialized treatment. These programs can be highly supportive, but they may pressure patients to stop taking OUD medication. If possible, refer patients to groups that welcome patients who take OUD medication. Make referrals to medical and mental health services. Respectful, consistent medical care can support patients' efforts to recover from OUD and all other SUDs. As for any patient, providers should make appropriate referrals for patients with OUD to receive medical or mental health services beyond the providers' own scope of practice. Patients with depression, anxiety disorders, and other mental disorders may be more likely to succeed in addiction treatment if those condi - tions are managed.87 If the severity or type of a patient's psychiatric comorbidity is beyond a provider's scope of practice, the provider should refer the patient to mental health services as appropriate.RESOURCE ALERT Mutual-Support Groups For an introduction to mutual-support groups, see SAMHSA's Substance Abuse in Brief, \"An Introduction to Mutual Support Groups for Alcohol and ( http://www. williamwhitepapers.com/pr/CSAT%20 Mutual%20Support%20Groups%202008.pdf ). 2-24Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 EXHIBIT 2.16.

Integrated medical and behavioral healthcare delivery can effectively provide patient-focused, comprehensive treat - ments that address the full range of symptoms and service needs patients with OUD often have.88 The key components of integration should be in place to make sure that SUD treatment in a primary care setting works. For more information about how to provide integrated services for individuals taking medication for OUD, see: The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's report Medication-Assisted Treatment Models of Care for Opioid Use Disorder in Primary Care Settings. (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK402352). The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Academy for Integrating Behavioral Mental Health and Primary Care. (https:// integrationacademy.ahrq.gov ).2-25 TIP 63Part 2 of 5\u2014Addressing Opioid Use Disorder in General Medical Settings Helping patients who are not ready to engage in OUD treatment Help reluctant patients be safer and approach readiness. Patients may seem unwilling to discuss their drug use if they're ashamed or fear being judged. Accepting, nonjudgmental attitudes help patients overcome shame and discuss concerns honestly while also instilling hope. Every visit is a chance to help patients begin healthy changes and move toward treatment and recovery. Patients may not be ready to change right away. Successfully quitting drug use Make referrals to ancillary services. Besides medical care and mental health services, OUD patients, like patients with other illnesses, may need more support in some areas, including ancillary services such as: Case management. Food access. Vocational training. Housing. Transportation. Legal assistance.OPPORTUNITY ALERT Becoming an OUD Medication Treatment Provider SAMHSA strongly urges physicians, NPs, PAs, and, until October 1, 2023, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives to obtain waivers that will qualify them to offer buprenorphine pharmacotherapy. They can become qualified to use buprenorphine to taper appropriate patients with OUD off illicit or prescription opioids or to provide long-term OUD treatment. Only healthcare professionals with a federal waiver may prescribe buprenorphine for the treatment of OUD. To get waivers, providers must meet set criteria, complete buprenorphine training (online or in person), and apply for a waiver from SAMHSA. Waivered prescribers are assigned an additional DEA registration number (usually their existing number with an added \"X\"). NPs, PAs, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives need to meet additional criteria for waivers.89 Check with the state licensing board about restrictions and requirements at the state level before applying for a waiver. Wavier training: ASAM, the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Osteopathic Academy of Addiction Medicine all provide the waiver training courses for physicians. Providers' Clinical Support System for Medication Assisted Treatment (PCSS- MAT) provides the required 8-hour OUD medication waiver course for physicians and 24- hour waiver course for NPs, PAs, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives for free ( https:// pcssnow.org/medication- assisted-treatment/ ). Other providers also provide NP, PA, clinical nurse specialist, certified registered nurse anesthetist, and certified nurse midwife courses. New prescribers can benefit from mentorship from experienced providers in their practice or community. Mentorship is available for free from PCSS-MAT ( http://pcssmat .org/mentoring ). For detailed information on prescribing OUD medications, review Part 3 of this TIP. 2-26Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 can take many attempts. Returns to substance use, even after periods of remission, are expected parts of the recovery process. Patients with OUD are much more likely to die than their peers,90,91 and HIV, hepatitis C, and skin and soft tissue infections are common among this population. Help reduce these OUD- related risks by testing patients for HIV and hepatitis and by educating patients about: Using new syringes. Avoiding syringe sharing. Avoiding sharing other supplies during the injection process. Preventing opioid overdose (see the \"Preventing Opioid-Related Overdose\" section). SMA18-4742 ]). Obtaining and instructions for its use. Refer patients to syringe exchange sites. The North American Syringe Exchange Network provides options (see the \"Syringe Exchange\" section). Preventing Opioid-Related Overdose Every patient who misuses opioids or has OUD should receive opioid overdose EXHIBIT 2.17. Opioid Overdose: Risk, Prevention, Identification, and Response Overdose risk Using heroin (possibly mixed with illicitly manufactured fentanyl or fentanyl analogs) Using prescription opioids that were not prescribed Using prescription opioids more frequently or at higher doses than prescribed Using opioids after a period of abstinence or reduced use (e.g., after medically supervised withdrawal or incarceration) Using opioids with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or both Overdose prevention Don't use opioids that were not prescribed. Take medications only as prescribed. Don't use drugs when you are alone. Don't use multiple substances at once. Have naloxone available and make sure others know where it is and how to use it. Use a small \"test dose\" if returning to opioid use after a period of abstinence, if the substance appears altered, or if it has been acquired from an unfamiliar source. Beware: This doesn't guarantee safety; illicitly manufactured fentanyl or other substances may be present in the drug, and any use may be fatal.Overdose identification Fingernails or lips are blue or purple. Breathing or heartbeat is slow or stopped. The person is vomiting or making gurgling noises. The person can't be awakened or is unable to speak. Overdose response Call 9-1-1. Administer naloxone (more than one dose may be needed to restore adequate spontaneous breathing). Perform rescue breathing. If certified to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation, perform chest compressions if there is no pulse. Put the person in the \"recovery position,\" on his or her side and with the mouth facing to the side to prevent aspiration of vomit, if he or she is breathing independently. Stay with the person until emergency services arrive. Naloxone's duration of action is 30-90 minutes. The person should be observed after this time for a return of opioid overdose symptoms. Adapted from material in the public domain.932-27 TIP 63Part 2 of 5\u2014Addressing Opioid Use Disorder in General Medical Settings The United States is experiencing a death epidemic related to opioid overdose. Opioids (including prescription opioids and heroin) killed 47,600 people in 2017, more than in any prior year. In 2018, the number of all opioid overdose deaths was 46,800. Less than one-third of overdose deaths involved prescription opioids. From 2010 to 2018, heroin-related overdose deaths rose about fivefold.94,95 Overdose deaths from illicit fentanyl have also risen sharply.96prevention education and a naloxone prescrip- tion.92 Healthcare professionals should educate patients and their families about overdose risk, prevention, identification, and response (Exhibit 2.17). FDA has approved an autoinjectable naloxone device (Evzio) and a naloxone nasal spray (Narcan) for use by patients and others. For information about all forms of naloxone, prescribing, and patient and community education, substantial decreases in opioid overdose death rates.97,98 Many syringe exchange programs also dispense naloxone.

The AUDIT-C is a modified version of the 10 question AUDIT instrument. Clinical Utility The AUDIT-C is a brief alcohol screen that reliably identifies patients who are hazardous drinkers or have active alcohol use disorders. Scoring The AUDIT-C is scored on a scale of 0-12. Each AUDIT-C question has 5 answer choices. Points allotted are: a = 0 points, b = 1 point, c = 2 points, d = 3 points, e = 4 points In men, a score of 4 or more is considered positive, optimal for identifying hazardous drinking or active alcohol use disorders. In women, a score of 3 or more is considered positive (same as above). However, when the points are all from Question #1 alone (#2 & #3 are zero), it can be assumed that the patient is drinking below recommended limits and it is suggested that the provider review the patient's alcohol intake over the past few months to confirm accuracy.3 Generally, the higher the score, the more likely it is that the patient's drinking is affecting his or her safety.

TIP Navigation Executive Summary For healthcare and addiction professionals, policymakers, patients, and families Part 1: Introduction to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment For healthcare and addiction professionals, policymakers, patients, and families Part 2: Addressing Opioid Use Disorder in General Medical Settings For healthcare professionals Part 3: Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder For healthcare professionals Part 4: Partnering Addiction Treatment Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals For healthcare and addiction professionals Part 5: Resources Related to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder For healthcare and addiction professionals, policymakers, patients, and familiesKEY MESSAGES OUD medications are safe and effective when used appropriately. OUD medications can help patients reduce or stop illicit opioid use and improve their health and functioning. Pharmacotherapy should be considered for all patients with OUD. Reserve opioid pharmacotherapies for those with moderate-to-severe OUD with physical dependence. Patients with OUD should be informed of the risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy, treatment without medication, and no treatment. Patients should be advised on where and how to get treatment with OUD medication. Doses and schedules of pharmacotherapy must be individualized.

OUD is a set of cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms marked by an inability to stop opioid use despite negative consequenc- es.3 When severe, it can present as a chronic, recurring condition with compulsive opioid use that is often termed \"addiction.\" It can cause serious physical and mental health, employment, legal, and family problems. Each FDA-approved medication used to treat OUD can help patients achieve remission and begin or maintain recovery. Pharmacotherapy Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use DisorderPART 3 of 5 for OUD should be accompanied by individually tailored medical management and psychosocial and recovery support services as needed and wanted by patients to support their remission and recovery. Medication supports the efforts of the individual to achieve lasting recovery. Exhibit 3.1 defines key terms in Part 3. For more definitions, see the glossary in Part 5 of this TIP . NOTE TO HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS This TIP cannot replace sound clinical judgment and shared decision making based on careful patient assessment. Providers should familiarize themselves with FDA labeling of all OUD medications and current practices standards described here and in other resources such as the Providers' Clinical Support System (https://pcssnow.org/resources/ resource-category/clinical-resources/ ).Part 3 of this TIP describes general principles of OUD pharmacotherapy and discusses medication formulations, indications, and dosing for the three Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications used to treat OUD\u2014methadone, naltrexone, and buprenorphine. Part 3 also discusses patient management and monitoring in outpatient settings other than opioid treatment programs (OTPs) as well as medical management of patients with OUD in hospital settings. OPIOID-RELATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT visits more than doubled from 2005 to 2016.4,53-2Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 EXHIBIT 3.1. Key Terms Addiction: As defined by the American Society of Addiction Medicine,6 \"a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry.\" It is characterized by inability to consistently abstain, impairment in behavioral control, craving, diminished recognition of significant problems with one's behaviors and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response. Like other chronic diseases, addiction often involves cycles of relapse and remission. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition,7 does not use the term for diagnostic purposes, but it commonly describes the more severe forms of OUD. Induction: Process of initial dosing with medication for OUD treatment until the patient reaches a state of stability; also called initiation. Maintenance treatment: Providing medications to achieve and sustain clinical remission of signs and symptoms of OUD and support the individual process of recovery without a specific endpoint (as is the typical standard of care in medical and psychiatric treatment of other chronic illnesses). Medically supervised withdrawal (formerly called detoxification): Using an opioid agonist (or an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist if opioid agonist is not available) in tapering doses or other medications to help a patient discontinue illicit or prescription opioids. Medical management: Process whereby healthcare professionals provide medication, basic brief supportive counseling, monitoring of drug use and medication adherence, and referrals, when necessary, to addiction counseling and other services to address the patient's medical, mental health, comorbid addiction, and psychosocial needs. Office-based opioid treatment: Providing medication for OUD in outpatient settings other than certified OTPs. Opioid treatment program (OTP): An accredited treatment program with Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration certification and Drug Enforcement Administration registration to administer and dispense opioid agonist medications that are approved by FDA to treat opioid addiction. Currently, these include methadone and buprenorphine products. Other pharmacotherapies, such as naltrexone, may be provided but are not subject to these regulations. OTPs must provide adequate medical, counseling, vocational, educational, and other assessment and treatment services either onsite or by referral to an outside agency or practitioner through a formal agreement.8 Key Terms Related to OUD Medication Pharmacology Abuse liability: The likelihood that a medication with central nervous system activity will cause desirable psychological effects, such as euphoria or mood changes, that promote the medication's misuse. Bioavailability: Proportion of medication administered that reaches the bloodstream. Cross-tolerance: Potential for people tolerant to one opioid (e.g., heroin) to be tolerant to another (e.g., methadone). Dissociation: Rate at which a drug uncouples from the receptor. A drug with a longer dissociation rate will have a longer duration of action than a drug with a shorter dissociation rate. Half-life: Rate of removal of a drug from the body. One half-life removes 50 percent from the plasma. After a drug is stopped, it takes five half-lives to remove about 95 percent from the plasma. If a drug is continued at the same dose, its plasma level will continue to rise until it reaches steady-state concentrations after about five half-lives.3-3 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder EXHIBIT 3.1. Key Terms (continued) Intrinsic activity: The degree of receptor activation attributable to drug binding. Full agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist are terms that describe the intrinsic activity of a drug. Opiates: A subclass of opioids blockade: or effects of an opioid through opioid receptor occupancy by antagonist (e.g., naltrexone). Opioid receptor agonist: A substance that has an affinity for and stimulates physiological activity at cell receptors in the nervous system that are normally stimulated by opioids. Mu-opioid receptor full agonists (e.g., methadone) bind to the mu-opioid receptor and produce actions similar to those produced by the endogenous opioid beta-endorphin. Increasing the dose increases the effect. Mu-opioid receptor partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine) bind to the mu-opioid receptor. Unlike with full agonists, increasing their dose in an opioid-tolerant individual may not produce additional effects once they have reached their maximal effect. At low doses, partial agonists may produce effects similar to those of full agonists. Methadone and buprenorphine can blunt or block the effects of exogenously administered opioids. Opioid receptor antagonist: A substance that has an affinity for opioid receptors in the central nervous system without producing the physiological effects of opioid agonists. Mu-opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., naltrexone) can block the effects of exogenously administered opioids. Opioids: All natural, synthetic, and semisynthetic substances that have effects similar to morphine. They can be used as medications having such effects (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine, oxycodone). Receptor affinity: Strength of the bond between a medication and its receptor. A medication with high mu-opioid receptor affinity requires lower concentrations to occupy the same number of mu-opioid receptors as a drug with lower mu-opioid receptor affinity. Drugs with high mu-opioid receptor affinity may displace drugs with lower affinity.This page intentionally left blank.3-5 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Chapter 3A: Overview of Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Chapter 3A describes general principles of OUD pharmacotherapy and summarizes formulations, indications, and dosing for the three FDA-approved OUD medications. There are three FDA-approved medications used to treat OUD, including the mu-opioid receptor partial agonist buprenorphine, the mu-opioid is FDA approved to prevent relapse in patients who have remained opioid abstinent for sufficient time. Discussing medications that can treat OUD with patients who have this disorder is the clinical standard of care and should cover at least: The proven effectiveness of methadone, naltrexone, and buprenorphine compared with placebo and with outpatient counseling without medication. Risks and benefits of pharmacotherapy with all three types of medication, treatment without medication, and no treatment. Safety and effectiveness of the medications when used appropriately. Pharmacologic properties, routes of ad- ministration, and where and how to access treatment with each medication (Exhibit 3A.1).3-6Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 EXHIBIT CATEGORY BUPRENORPHINE* METHADONE XR-NTX** TRANSMUCOSAL Appropriate patientsTypically for patients with OUD who are physiologically dependent on opioids.Typically for patients for whom diversion or safe medication storage are concerns or for patients who must travel large distances to the prescriber.Typically for patients with OUD who are physiologically dependent on opioids and who meet federal criteria for OTP admission.Typically for patients with OUD who have abstained from short-acting opioids for at least 7-10 days and long- acting opioids for at least 10-14 days. Pharmacology Opioid receptor partial Reduces opioid craving; or blocks euphoric effects of self- administered illicit opioids through cross- tolerance and opioid receptor receptor partial Reduces opioid withdrawal and blunts blocks euphoric of self-administered illicit opioids through cross- tolerance and opioid receptor occupancy.

Causes no opioid effects. Patient educationTell patients: That they will need to be in opioid withdrawal to receive their first dose to avoid buprenorphine- precipitated opioid withdrawal. About the risk of overdose with concurrent benzodiazepine or alcohol use, with injecting buprenorphine, and after stopping the medication.Tell patients: For implantable rods (Probuphine\u00ae), they will need to be stable on no more than 8 mg of transmucosal Suboxone or generic equivalents. For subcutaneous injection (Sublocade\u00ae), they must first be on a transmucosal form of buprenorphine for at least 7 days at a dose equivalent to 8 to 24 mg of buprenorphine.Tell patients: That their dose will start low and build up slowly to avoid oversedation; it takes several days for a given dose to have its full effect. About overdose risk in the first 2 weeks of treatment, especially with concurrent benzodiazepine or alcohol use, and after stopping the medication.Tell patients: That they will need to be opioid free for at least 7-10 days for short-acting opioids and at least 10-14 days for long-acting opioids before their first dose to avoid XR-NTX- precipitated opioid withdrawal (which may require hospitalization).

Prescribing Physicians, nurse practitioners (NPs), and physician assistants (PAs) need a waiver to prescribe. Until October 1, 2023, qualified clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives also can obtain a waiver to prescribe. Any pharmacy can fill a prescription for sublingual or buccal formulations. OTPs can administer/ dispense by OTP physician order without a waiver. Prescribers must have a waiver (as for transmucosal buprenorphine) and complete the product's REMS program. Providers of the implantable rods must complete additional training in their insertion and removal. Both the implantable rods and subdermal injections are available via restricted distribution programs and are not available in retail pharmacies. OTPs can be providers of depot formulations of buprenorphine, provided the above criteria are satisfied.SAMHSA-certified OTPs can provide methadone for daily onsite administration or at-home self- administration for stable patients.Physicians, NPs, PAs, and, until October 1, 2023, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives can prescribe or order administration by qualified healthcare professionals. *Long-acting buprenorphine implants (every 6 months) for patients on a stable dose of buprenorphine are also available through implanters and prescribers with additional training and certification through the Probuphine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Extended-release buprenorphine monthly subcutaneous injections are available only through prescribers and pharmacies registered with the Sublocade REMS Program. **Naltrexone hydrochloride tablets (50 mg each) are also available for daily oral dosing but have not been shown to be more effective than treatment without medication or placebo because of poor patient adherence.3-8Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Introduction to Medications That Address OUD Methadone Methadone is the most used and most studied OUD medication in the world.11,12 The World Health Organization (WHO) considers it an essential medication.13 Many clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that it effectively reduces illicit opioid use, treats OUD, and retains patients in treatment better than placebo or no medication.14,15,16 (Part 1 of this Treatment Improvement Protocol [TIP] further covers methadone's efficacy.) In the United States, roughly 1,500 federally certified opioid treatment programs (OTPs) offer methadone for OUD. Increasingly, they also offer buprenorphine, and some provide XR-NTX. Core OTP services include medical oversight of treatment, direct observation of dose administra- tion, take-home dose dispensing under certain conditions, counseling, and drug testing. Some OTPs provide other services, including mental health and primary care, HIV and hepatitis C virus care, and recovery support. Even so, significant demand remains for better integration and coordination of care among OTPs, primary care services, and mental health services to treat the range of needs common in people with OUD.17 Coordination is especially important for people with co-occurring medical, mental, and substance use disorders, who need multiple services and face challenges in treatment access and adherence.Naltrexone XR-NTX has demonstrated efficacy in reducing return to illicit opioid use, increasing treatment retention, and reducing opioid craving compared with placebo or no medica- tion in randomized controlled trials.18,19,20 (See Part 1 for more information on naltrexone's efficacy in OUD treatment.) Because the inject- able form was approved more recently by FDA than methadone and buprenorphine, XR-NTX has been less studied than those medications. Physicians, NPs, and, PAs, and, until October 1, 2023, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives may prescribe or order XR-NTX for administration by qualified staff members without additional waiver requirements. XR-NTX initiated prior to release from controlled environments (e.g., jails, prisons, residential rehabilitation programs) may be useful in preventing return to opioid use after release.21 These settings are typically associated with extended periods of opioid abstinence, so maintaining abstinence for sufficient time to start naltrexone is less challenging than initiating it among outpatients in the community. Short-term pilot studies show that offering naltrexone under these circumstances can increase treatment engagement after release.22,23 The oral formulation of naltrexone is not widely used to treat OUD because of low rates of patient acceptance and high rates of RESOURCE ALERT Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Federal Guidelines for OTPs Federal Guidelines for Opioid Treatment Programs offers guidance on how to satisfy federal OTP regulations ((https://store.samhsa. gov/product/Federal-Guidelines-for-Opioid- Treatment-Programs/PEP15-FEDGUIDEOTP ). Although only OTPs can administer or dispense methadone for OUD, all healthcare professionals and addiction and mental health counselors should be familiar with methadone. Their patients may be enrolled in or need referral to OTPs.3-9 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Transmucosal buprenorphine is available by prescription through pharmacies, because the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA 2000) created an exception to the Controlled Substances Act to permit FDA schedule III, IV, and V medications approved to treat opioid dependence to be prescribed for that purpose outside OTPs. Buprenorphine, in various formu- lations, is the only medication to which DATA 2000 currently applies. Qualifying physicians, NPs, and PAs can prescribe buprenorphine if they receive special training, obtain a SAMHSA waiver under DATA 2000, and get a unique Drug Enforcement Administration registration number. Until October 1, 2023, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthe- tists, and certified nurse midwives also are waiver-eligible to prescribe buprenorphine. This has greatly increased the number and type of settings where medication for OUD is available and the number of patients in treatment. New settings include non-OTP outpatient addiction treatment programs, as well as general medical and mental health practices or clinics (office-based opioid treatment). OTPs can also provide buprenorphine. In 2016, FDA approved buprenorphine implants (Probuphine) that last about 6 months for patients stabilized on sublingual or buccal for - mulations. Implants have been found to be more effective than placebo in reducing illicit opioid use among opioid-dependent patients receiving counseling.28 Implants are available in the same settings as other buprenorphine formulations but require waivered providers to receive specific training from the manufacturer on insertion and removal per the FDA-approved REMS (www .accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/rems/index .cfm?event=IndvRemsDetails.page&REMS=356).non adherence leading to a lack of efficacy.24 However, consideration should be given to its use in situations where adherence can be ensured, such as with observed daily dosing. Naltrexone is also FDA approved for the treatment of alcohol use disorder and therefore may be useful for patients with both OUD and alcohol use disorder. Buprenorphine Buprenorphine is effective in retaining patients in treatment and reducing illicit opioid use, as demonstrated by many clinical trials comparing buprenorphine with placebo or no medication.25 Buprenorphine treatment is available throughout the world. WHO includes it in its list of essential medicines.26 (See Part 1 for more information on buprenorphine's efficacy in OUD treatment.) Buprenorphine is a partial agonist with a ceiling effect on opioid activity. Hence, it is less likely than methadone and other full agonists to cause respiratory depression in an accidental overdose. This property contributed to the decision permitting buprenorphine to be prescribed to treat opioid dependence outside OTPs.27 That being said, lethal overdose with buprenorphine is possible in opioid-na\u00efve individuals or when it is taken in combination with central nervous system depressants such as benzodiazepines or alcohol.RESOURCE ALERT SAMHSA Brief Guide on the Use of XR-NTX SAMHSA's Clinical Use of Extended-Release Injectable Naltrexone in the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder: A Brief Guide offers guidance on the use of XR-NTX and is available online (https://store.samhsa.gov/product /Clinical-Use-of-Extended-Release-Injectable -Naltrexone-in-the-Treatment-of-Opioid-Use -Disorder-A-Brief-Guide/SMA14-4892R). DATA 2000 restrictions currently apply only to buprenorphine used to treat OUD. They do not apply to pain treatment using buprenorphine formulations approved to treat pain.3-10Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 In 2017, FDA approved a monthly extended- release buprenorphine injectable formulation (Sublocade) for patients with moderate-to- severe OUD who had been initiated and treated with transmucosal buprenorphine for at least 7 days. The medication is for subcutaneous abdominal injection by a healthcare provider and is intended to be available for ordering and dispensing (not by prescription to patients) in healthcare settings that receive special certifica- tion, pursuant to the FDA-approved REMS (www .accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/rems/index .cfm?event=IndvRemsDetails.page&REMS=376).Choosing an OUD Medication Currently, no empirical data indicate which patients will respond better to which OUD medications. All patients considering treatment should be educated about the effectiveness, risks, and benefits of each of the three OUD medications, treatment without medication, and no treatment. Emphasize that OUD medications are safe and effective when used appropriately, and point out that these medications can help patients reduce or stop illicit opioid use and improve their health and functioning. Tailor decisions to patients' medical, psychiatric, and substance use histories; to their pref- erences; and to treatment availability when deciding which medication and treatment to provide. Consider: Patients' prior response to a medication. The medication's side effect profile. The strength of the published data on safety and effectiveness. Patients' use of other substances (e.g., naltrexone is also approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence). Patients' occupation. For patients in safety- sensitive occupations, consider naltrexone. Patients' pregnancy status.* Patients' physical dependence on opioids. Patients not currently physically dependent on opioids who are returning to the community from a residential treatment program or incar - ceration should have the option of XR-NTX,29 methadone, or buprenorphine based on which best suits their needs and circumstances (see below for special safety dosing considerations for methadone and buprenorphine in nontol- erant patients).30,31,32,33RESOURCE ALERT How To Obtain a Waiver To Prescribe Buprenorphine Learn how to qualify for a DATA 2000 physician waiver: www.samhsa.gov/medication -assisted-treatment/buprenorphine-waiver -management/qualify-for-physician-waiver Learn how to qualify for an NP, PA, clinical nurse specialist, certified registered nurse anesthetist, or certified nurse midwife waiver: https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted- treatment/training-materials-resources/apply- for-practitioner-waiver Learn how waivered physicians can increase their patient limit from 30 to 100, and then to 275 patients: www.samhsa.gov/sites/default /files/programs_campaigns/medication _assisted/understanding-patient-limit275.pdf *Methadone or buprenorphine maintenance is recommended for OUD treatment during pregnancy,34 as these medications have better maternal and infant outcomes than no treatment or medically supervised withdrawal.35,36,37 Methadone and buprenorphine are not associated with birth defects and have minimal long-term neurodevelopmental impact on infants.38 However, neonatal abstinence syndrome can occur, which requires hospitalization.39 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists notes that limited data exist on the safety and effectiveness of naltrexone in pregnancy.40 Starting naltrexone rather than opioid agonist treatment in pregnancy is not recommended, given the risk of precipitated withdrawal. An expert panel did not agree on whether women already receiving treatment with naltrexone at the onset of pregnancy should remain on that medication during pregnancy.41 Patients who were taking naltrexone before their pregnancy should weigh with their providers the risks regarding unknown potential harm to the developing fetus versus the potential benefits of continuing this medication during pregnancy.42 Pregnant patients who discontinue naltrexone and return to opioid use should be considered for methadone or buprenorphine treatment.433-11 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder The TIP expert panel recommends offering maintenance therapy with medication, not short-term medically supervised withdrawal. The TIP expert panel also supports maintaining patients on OUD medication for years, decades, and even a lifetime if patients are benefiting. withdrawal.47,48,49 Continued treatment with XR-NTX is associated with better outcomes than discontinuing XR-NTX.50 Patients should be informed of the risks and benefits of discontin- uing medication. Buprenorphine or methadone can be used for medically supervised withdrawal over a period of days to weeks (Exhibit 3A.2) for patients who prefer it to ongoing opioid agonist treatment. When alpha2-adrenergic agonist clonidine can relieve some withdrawal symptoms, although clinical trials found it less effective.51 Pair medically supervised withdrawal with the chance to begin XR-NTX. Discontinuing medication increases risk of return to substance use and overdose death.52 Stable patients can continue on their selected OUD medication indefinitely as long as it is beneficial.53,54,55,56 During medically supervised withdrawal, ancillary medications can treat some of the withdrawal symptoms (Exhibit 3A.3). Principles of OUD Pharmacotherapy Basic Function Several factors underlie the development of addiction involving opioids and the difficulty people have in achieving and maintaining absti- nence from them. These factors include:57,58 Short-term direct and indirect mu-opioid receptor agonist effects. Neuroplastic changes in the brain. Genetic, developmental, and environmental factors (e.g., exposure to high-risk environ- ments, effect of stress on the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis). Patients' preferences. Respect patients' preferences for agonist versus antagonist medication. (See Part 2 of this TIP for an indepth discussion of treatment planning.) Comparative Effectiveness A Cochrane review of 5 randomized clinical trials with 788 participants found that, when provided at flexible doses on an outpatient basis, methadone retained patients in treatment longer than buprenorphine.44 That same review found that methadone and buprenorphine equally reduced illicit opioid use based on 8 studies with urine drug testing data from 1,027 participants and 4 studies with self-reported drug use from 501 participants. There is not yet a Cochrane review on the comparative effectiveness of XR-NTX and bu- prenorphine. However, in 2017, two randomized trials comparing buprenorphine to XR-NTX were published. A multisite study with 570 partici- pants in the United States compared initiating buprenorphine versus XR-NTX at 8 inpatient treatment programs.45 That study found that patients randomly assigned to start buprenor - phine had significantly lower return-to-use rates during 24 weeks of outpatient treatment compared with those patients assigned to start XR-NTX. This finding was due to the known difficulty in successfully completing induction in the XR-NTX group. However, comparing only the subgroups of those participants who did start their assigned medication, there were no significant between-group differences in return- to-use rates. In a 12-week trial in Norway with 159 participants who were opioid abstinent at the time of random assignment, XR-NTX was found to be noninferior to buprenorphine in terms of treatment retention and illicit opioid use.46 There is no extant literature evaluating the comparative effectiveness of methadone, XR-NTX, buprenor - phine implant, or extended-release buprenor - phine injection to one another. Duration of Medication Continued treatment with buprenorphine or methadone is associated with better outcomes than medically supervised 3-12Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 EXHIBIT 3A.3. Medications for Management of Opioid Withdrawal Symptoms SYMPTOM MEDICATION Nausea Ondansetron, metoclopramide (avoid or Methadone Medically supervised withdrawal using buprenorphine or methadone is appropriate when patients: Prefer it to treatment without medications, after they have been told the risks and benefits of this approach compared with treatment with medications. Wish to start XR-NTX, which is also FDA approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Are entering a controlled environment or workplace that disallows opioid agonists. Data conflict on the ideal duration of medically supervised withdrawal.59,60,61 Even so, shorter term dose reductions alone (formerly, \"detoxification\") are rarely effective.62,63,64 If withdrawal is appropriate for the patient, the TIP expert panel recommends the following strategies: Individualize supervised withdrawal duration per patient preference and response to lower medication doses. Note that patients may benefit from nonopioid medication (e.g., clonidine, ondansetron, loperamide) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to manage withdrawal symptoms near the end of the taper. Consider discontinuing dose reduction and increasing the dose if the patient begins to use illicit opioids. Encourage patients to continue receiving counseling, monitoring, and other psychosocial support after medication discontinuation. Urge patients to reenter treatment promptly if they return or think they may return to illicit opioid use.The TIP expert panel does not recommend short-term medically supervised withdrawal alone because of its high rates of return to illicit opioid use.65,66,67 If patients prefer this approach, it should be provided with psychosocial treatment.68 XR-NTX treatment should always be considered to reduce the likelihood of return to use after medically supervised withdrawal is completed and an adequate period of abstinence achieved,69 as well as to reduce the likelihood of overdose death upon a return to opioid use.3-13 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder EXHIBIT 3A.4.

In the brain, these receptors mediate opioids' analgesic and other effects (e.g., euphoria, respiratory depression, meiosis).70,71,72 Through modulation of mu-opioid receptor activity in the brain, these medications exert therapeutic efficacy in treating OUD. Intrinsic Activity Intrinsic activity at the mu-opioid receptor varies based on whether the medication is a full agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist (Exhibit 3A.4). The amount of intrinsic activity corre- sponds to the amount of opioid receptor agonist effects. A full agonist exerts maximal effects at increasing doses. A partial agonist has a ceiling effect. Its opioid effects increase as the dose increases, but only up to a certain point. An antagonist binds to the opioid receptor but does not stimulate the receptor at all. Thus, it has no intrinsic activity regardless of its dose. Overview of Medication Indications and Dosing Healthcare professionals should consider pharma- cotherapy for all patients with OUD. Prescribers must read FDA labels (i.e., package inserts) for the medications they prescribe. They must also evaluate patients clinically to determine the safety and effectiveness of the medication and dose. 3-14Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Exhibit 3A.5 summarizes OUD medication formu- lations, indications, and dosing.

Methadone is the most studied pharmacother - apy for opioid use disorder (OUD). Of all OUD pharmacotherapies, it is used to treat the most people throughout the world and has by far the longest track record (nearly 50 years).76,77 Numerous clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that methadone treatment is associated with significantly higher rates of treatment retention and lower rates of illicit opioid use compared with placebo and with no treatment.78 Other research associates methadone treatment with reduced mortality, criminal behavior, and HIV seroconversion.79,80,81 A Cochrane meta- analysis found that, at flexible doses, methadone compared with buprenorphine retains patients in treatment significantly longer and equally reduces illicit opioid use.82 In the United States, OTPs can offer methadone to treat OUD, but all providers who may care for patients with OUD should be familiar with this treatment. Formulations There are several formulations of methadone: Liquid concentrate, which is the formulation most commonly used in treatment programs. Powder, which is dissolved in water and administered as a liquid. Dispersible tablets, which are scored tablets that are dissolved in water. Tablets, which are most commonly used outside of OTPs for analgesia.Pharmacology Methadone, a long-acting mu-opioid receptor full agonist, is a schedule II controlled medica- tion. It is highly plasma-protein bound and binds to proteins within tissues throughout the body.83 Through mu-opioid receptor binding and opioid cross-tolerance to other mu-opioid agonists, at adequate doses, methadone reduces opioid craving and withdrawal and blunts or blocks the effects of illicit opioids. There is wide individual variability in methadone pharmacokinetics. The half-life of methadone can vary from 8 to 59 hours84 depending on the patient. The average is 24 hours.85 Methadone has no ceiling effect. As a full agonist, increasing doses of methadone produce maximal physiological effects at the opioid receptors. Plasma levels reach steady state in about 5 days (i.e., five half-lives). Before achievement of steady state, release from tissue reservoirs can lead to increasing serum plasma levels and toxicity, even if the daily methadone dose is not changed. Methadone induction, thus, should begin at a low dose and increase gradually with daily monitoring over days or weeks. At stable daily doses, serum levels peak 2 to 4 hours after dosing, then slowly decrease, providing 24 hours without overmedication or withdrawal.863-18Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Bioavailability Methadone is approximately 70 to 80 percent bioavailable when patients take it orally for OUD. There is notable individual variability in bioavailability, ranging from 36 to 100 percent.87,88 The CYP450 enzyme CYP2B6 and CYP2D6 enzymes are also involved.90 At the start of methadone treatment, methadone can increase CYP3A4 activity and accelerate its own metabolism in some individuals.91 Dosing must be individualized because methadone's bioavailability, clearance, and half-life can vary considerably among patients. Providers should check for potential drug-drug interactions and monitor patients receiving con- comitant medications. Some medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, antibiotics, antiretroviral agents, some antidepressants) can induce or inhibit CYP450 enzymes, resulting in potential changes in methadone serum concentration, effectiveness, and side effect profile. Dosing Considerations Methadone is indicated for people meeting OTP admission criteria, which for people 18 and older are: Being currently \"opioid-addicted\"\u2014the term the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) OTP regulations use (e.g., meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition,92 criteria for OUD). Not all patients meeting OUD criteria, particularly those with mild OUD, are appropriate candidates for methadone. This is discussed in detail in Part 2 of this Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP). Having a history of at least 1 year of opioid addiction before admission. Providing voluntary, written informed consent.OTP physicians can waive the history require- ment per Code of Federal Regulations (42 CFR 8.12)93 for: Women who are pregnant. Former patients (up to 2 years after discharge). Patients within 6 months of release from incarceration. For patients younger than 18, admission criteria are different. They include two documented, unsuccessful, medically supervised withdrawals or treatments without OUD medica- tion (e.g., methadone) in a 12-month period. The parent or legal guardian must provide written informed consent. Contraindications Contraindications to treatment with methadone include an allergy to methadone and other instances in which opioids are contraindicated, such as acute asthma, in patients with abnormal- ly high carbon dioxide blood levels (e.g., from pulmonary disease or sleep apnea), or paralytic ileus. Precautions and Warnings Respiratory depression Methadone can cause respiratory depression, particularly during initial dosing and dose titration. The goal of methadone dosing in the first weeks of treatment (i.e., induction) is to relieve withdrawal but avoid oversedation and respiratory depression. Patients who are older or cachectic or who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are more susceptible to respiratory depression and should be treated cautiously with lower doses. A standard formula for dose induction for all patients, without careful monitoring of response to treatment, and individualized dose adjustment is inadvisable. This can lead to methadone intoxication and overdose death.3-19 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Individualize dosing decisions through daily monitoring of patients' responses to treatment. Opioid tolerance cannot be accurately gauged based on patient self-reports of the type, amount, or purity of the opioids they've used or of the severity of their opioid withdrawal symptoms. The best approach to dosing is to start low and go slow. Methadone has a relatively long half-life (24-36 hours or longer). Steady-state serum levels are generally not reached until about five half-lives. This means that patients will not feel the full effect of the initial dose for 4 or more days even if the daily dose is the same. Slow release of methadone from tissues causes serum levels to continue to increase until reaching steady state. Initially a dose may seem appropriate, but the third or fourth day of the same dose can lead to oversedation and even respiratory depression and death.94 Use a lower-than-usual starting dose in individuals with no or low opioid tolerance (5 mg to 10 mg). Increase doses slowly and with careful monitoring for patients who: Have not used opioids for 5 or more days (e.g., after leaving a controlled environment). Do not use opioids daily. Use weaker opioids (e.g., codeine). Do not determine doses by analgesic equivalence dose conversion tables for patients using high doses of prescription opioids, whether by prescription or illicitly. This can lead to death owing to incomplete cross-tolerance95 and the unique pharmacology of methadone. Concurrent substance use disorders (SUDs) involving benzodiazepines or alcohol Concurrent misuse of alcohol or benzodiaz- epines with methadone (or buprenorphine) increases respiratory depression risk. Use of alcohol and benzodiazepines (illicit and prescription) is common in patients with OUD. Managing OUD with methadone for patients with alcohol or benzodiazepine use disorders is challenging and should be undertaken with care. A 2017 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Drug Safety Communication noted that although concomitant use of buprenorphine or methadone with benzodiazepines increases the risk of an adverse reaction, including overdose death, opioid agonist treatment should not be denied to patients solely on the basis of their taking benzodiazepines, because untreated OUD can pose a greater risk of morbidity and mortality.96 FDA advises that careful medication management by healthcare professionals can reduce risk (see www.fda.gov/downloads /Drugs/DrugSafety/UCM576377.pdf for more information). Strategies to manage patients with concurrent alcohol or benzodiazepine use disorders include the following (see also Exhibit 3B.1): Obtain permission to communicate with the benzodiazepine prescriber to confirm the reason for use, adherence to treatment, and prescriber awareness of the patient's OUD. It can also help to speak (with permission) with close family members or friends to assess the extent and impact of any alcohol or benzodi- azepine misuse. Ensure that patients understand the risk of potential respiratory depression and un- intentional overdose death when combining methadone with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. Determine whether patients require medically supervised withdrawal or tapering from alcohol or benzodiazepines. Patients at risk for serious alcohol or benzo- diazepine withdrawal syndrome (including seizures and delirium tremens) may need inpatient medically supervised withdrawal. Attempt gradual outpatient medically supervised withdrawal for benzodiaze- pines when indicated. Some OTPs have the staffing and capacity to provide a supervised 3-20Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 outpatient taper from benzodiazepines. This usually requires use of a long-acting benzodiazepine, management of anxiety and sleeplessness, and careful monitoring with observed dosing and toxicology screening. It may also require lower-than-usual methadone doses. Engage in outpatient medically super - vised withdrawal only with patients who are physically dependent on benzodiazepines but do not inject or binge. This may only be successful in a minority of patients. Attempt the taper while continuing treatment with methadone, subject to certain conditions that promote safety and reduce risk. Consider increasing counseling frequency as appropriate.For more information on managing benzodiaze- pine use, see Management Benzodiazepines in Medication-Assisted Methadone treatment has been associated with QTc prolongation, which often occurs without clinical consequences.98,99 Since 2006, methadone has had an FDA black box warning on QTc prolongation and Torsades de Pointes. QTc intervals above 500 milliseconds can increase risk for this rare ventricular arrhythmia, which can be lethal.100,101 The prevalence of QTc prolongation among methadone patients is EXHIBIT 3B.1. Strategies for Managing Benzodiazepine Use by Patients in OUD Treatment Carefully assess the patient's benzodiazepine use, including: -Intent of use. -Source (check the state's prescription drug monitoring program [PDMP]). -Amount and route of use. -Binge use. -Prior overdoses. -Harms (e.g., car crashes, criminal acts, sleep trouble). -Co-use with other substances that further increase risk for respiratory depression and overdose. -Withdrawal history (e.g., seizures, delirium). Also assess for: -Psychiatric and medical comorbidity. -Motivation for change. -Psychosocial support system (obtain history from a significant other if the patient permits). Gauge level of care and setting needed (e.g., residential, outpatient). Inpatient treatment may be best for patients with poor motivation, limited psychosocial support, serious or complicated comorbidity, or injection or binge use. Coordinate with other prescribers. Some patients may have taken appropriately prescribed benzodiazepines for years with limited or no evidence of misuse. For such patients, tapering benzodiazepines may be contraindicated and unrealistic. Address comorbid mental disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression) with other medications or psychosocial treatments, when feasible. Provide medically supervised withdrawal from benzodiazepines or refer to specialty care for same. Create a treatment plan with built-in conditions (e.g., urine testing, more frequent visits, short medication supply). Frequently review patient progress and objective outcomes, such as: -Urine drug testing. -PDMP reports. -Psychosocial functioning. -Reports from significant others. Revise treatment plans as needed, and document the rationale for treatment decisions. Adapted with permission.973-21 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder not known with certainty. It has been estimated that about 2 percent of patients in methadone treatment have QTc intervals greater than 500 milliseconds.104 According to methadone's FDA label, most Torsades de Pointes cases occur in patients receiving methadone for pain treatment, although some cases have occurred among those in methadone maintenance.105 High methadone doses may be associated with prolonged QTc intervals.106 Other risk factors include:107 Some medications antifungals). Congenital prolonged QTc interval. Hypokalemia. Bradycardia. There is considerable controversy about how best to screen for QTc prolongation without creating barriers to methadone treatment entry.108 Indeed, a Cochrane review of the liter - ature was unable to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of QTc screening strategies in preventing cardiac morbidity or mortality among methadone patients.109 Notwithstanding the uncertainty about the best approach, OTPs can take steps to identify patients who may be at risk for cardiac arrhythmia. The TIP expert panel concurs with the recommendations of other expert panels (which included cardiologists) that OTPs develop a cardiac risk management plan,110,111 to the extent possible. OTPs should consider the following elements in crafting a cardiac risk management plan: An intake assessment of risk factors, which can include: Family history of sudden cardiac death, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, heart failure, prolonged QTc history of prolonged QTc interval, unexplained syncope, palpitations, or seizures. Current use of medications that may increase QTc interval (for a complete list, see https://crediblemeds.org/pdftemp/ pdf/CombinedList.pdf; register for free for the most current list). Patient history of use of cocaine and methamphetamines (which can prolong the QTc interval). Electrolyte assessment (for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia). A risk stratification plan, which can include the following: Conduct an ECG for patients with sig- nificant risk factors at admission; repeat within 30 days. Repeat once a year and if the patient is treated with more than 120 mg of methadone per day. Discuss risks and benefits of methadone with patients with QTc intervals between 450 and 500 milliseconds. Adjust modifi- able risk factors to reduce their risk. Do not start methadone treatment for patients with known QTc intervals above 500 milliseconds. If such an interval is discovered during treatment, have a risk/ benefit discussion. Strongly consider lowering the methadone dose, changing concurrent medications that prolong the QTc prolongation is an abnormally long time in electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing between the start of a Q wave and the end of a T wave. Various cutoffs define prolonged QTc interval, including greater than 450 milliseconds for men, greater than 460 to 470 milliseconds for women, or greater than 450 milliseconds for either gender.102 However, the faster the heart rate, the shorter the QTc interval. Hence, correct the QTc interval for heart rate; divide the QTc interval in milliseconds by the square root of the R-R interval in seconds.1033-22Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 QTc interval, eliminating other risk factors, and, if necessary, switching to buprenor - phine. Include follow-up ECG monitoring. Consider providing routine universal ECG screening if feasible, although there is in- sufficient evidence to formally recommend doing so.112 Accidental ingestion Inform patients that accidental ingestion can be fatal for opioid-na\u00efve individuals, particularly children. Patients should safeguard take-home methadone in a lockbox out of the reach of children. Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) Ensure awareness among pregnant patients or patients who may become pregnant that NAS can occur in newborns of mothers treated with methadone. Women receiving methadone treatment while pregnant should talk with their healthcare provider about NAS and how to reduce it. Research has shown that the dose of opioid agonist medication is not reliably related to the severity of NAS.113,114,115 Thus, each woman should receive the dose of medication that best manages her illness. Misuse and diversion Alert patients to the potential for misuse and diversion of methadone. Physical dependence Inform patients that they will develop physical dependence on methadone and will experience opioid withdrawal if they stop taking it. Sedation Caution patients that methadone may affect cognition and psychomotor performance and can have sedating effects. Urge patients to be cautious in using heavy machinery and driving until they are sure that their abilities are not compromised.Adrenal insufficiency Adrenal insufficiency has been reported in patients treated with opioids. Ask patients to alert healthcare providers of nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, or low blood pressure.116 Drug Interactions Methadone has more clinically significant drug-drug interaction than buprenorphine.117 Carefully monitor each patient's response to treatment if they are prescribed or stop taking a CYP450 34A inducer or inhibitor. Methadone dosages may need to be adjusted up or down depending on the medication and whether treatment is starting or stopping. Exhibit 3B.2 lists common interactions between methadone and other medications. Medications that induce CYP450 activity can increase methadone metabolism. Patients may experience craving or opioid withdrawal symptoms between doses if they begin these medications or become sedated if they discon- tinue inhibit CYP450 activity and decrease methadone metabolism, causing symptoms of overmedication (e.g., sedation) when the medication is started and possibly withdrawal or cravings when it is stopped. Among such medications are:118 Some the metabolism of other medications.

(See Part 2 of this TIP for detailed discussion of screening and assess - ment.) Before ordering methadone: Check the state PDMP for opioid or benzo - diazepine prescriptions from other providers (see www.nascsa.org/stateprofiles.htm for links to state PDMPs). Note that methadone for OUD treatment will not appear in the PDMP because of confidentiality regulations regarding substance use treatment records. Obtain the patient's consent to release infor - mation and speak with treating providers to coordinate care for patient safety. Take the patient's history. Conduct a medical, psychiatric, substance use, and substance use treatment history.3-26Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 RESOURCE ALERT Opioid Withdrawal Scales The COWS and other opioid withdrawal scales from Annex 10 of the World Health Organization's Guidelines for the Psychosocially Assisted Pharmacological Treatment of Opioid Dependence can be downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books /NBK143183). The CINA Scale for Withdrawal Symptoms also is available online (https://ncpoep.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/02/Appendix_7_Clinical_ Institute_Narcotic_Assessment_CINA_Scale_ for_Withdrawal_Symptoms.pdf ). Obtain laboratory tests. Conduct drug and alcohol tests. Use reliable urine tests for drugs, including opioids (e.g., morphine, methadone, buprenorphine, oxycodone), benzodiaze- pines, cocaine, and other drugs that may be commonly used in the area (e.g., meth- amphetamine). Obtain an opioid urine or oral fluid test before initiating treatment. A negative opioid test in the absence of clear opioid withdrawal symptoms indicates that the patient is likely no longer opioid tolerant; diagnosis should be reconfirmed. If such patients are to start taking methadone (rather than naltrexone for relapse prevention), use caution in initiating treatment (see the subsection \"First dose for patients without current opioid tolerance\" in the section \"Initiating Methadone Treatment\"). Use an alcohol breathalyzer to estimate the patient's blood alcohol content. Do not provide methadone until the alcohol reading is considerably below the legal level of alcohol intoxication. Assess recent opioid use, including frequency, quantity, type, route, and recency (last day of use and use in the past 30 days). Establish OUD diagnosis. Assess for other SUDs, including those that involve alcohol, benzodiazepines, or stimulants. Conduct a physical exam. Assess for signs and symptoms of intoxication. Do not give patients who are sedated or intoxicated their first dose. Instead, assess and treat them appropriately: Identify causes of sedation or intoxication. Ensure the patient's immediate safety. Reassess methadone induction appropriateness. Develop a plan to reattempt induction or follow a different course of treatment as appropriate. Assess for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and physiological depen- dence. One approach to documenting withdrawal symptoms is to use a scale such as the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) or the Clinical Institute Narcotic Assessment (CINA) Scale for Withdrawal Symptoms (see \"Resource Alert: Opioid Withdrawal Scales\"). Before the first dose of methadone, confirm signs of opioid withdrawal to provide some confidence that the patient is opioid tolerant and can begin dose induction. The Naloxone Challenge should not be routinely used to determine physiologic withdrawal because withdrawal symptoms will be visible, if present, on physical exam if enough time has passed since last opioid use.1213-27 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Conduct a pregnancy test. Pregnant patients with OUD should be treated with methadone or transmucosal buprenor - phine.122,123 Discuss risks and benefits of treatment with methadone and alternative approaches for each patient and fetus versus the risks of continued illicit opioid use. Refer pregnant patients to prenatal care. Women should be advised that their menstrual cycle may return to normal once they are stabilized on medication, and hence they should use birth control if they wish to avoid pregnancy. Conduct liver function tests. If possible, assess liver function tests. It is not necessary to wait for the results of these tests to begin treatment, because the risk of not starting methadone outweighs the benefits of having the test results. Patients with suspected cirrhosis based on history and clinical exam should be started at a lower methadone dose than typical patients, with more cautious titration. Patients who have chronic hepatitis can be treated with methadone. Have a risk/ benefit discussion with patients whose liver enzymes are at or greater than five times the normal level and monitor their liver function during treatment. Conduct hepatitis and HIV testing. Hepatitis B and C are common among patients who enter methadone treatment. HIV infection is also prevalent. Everyone ages 15 to 65 should be tested at least once for HIV. Persons at higher risk, such as people who use drugs by injection, should be tested annually.124 Anyone who is injecting or has ever injected drugs, even once, no matter how long ago, should be tested for hepatitis C, regardless of their intention to seek treatment for SUD.125 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hepatitis B vaccination for people seeking treatment for SUDs.126Patient Selection No evidence clearly predicts which patients will respond best to methadone treatment versus alternative pharmacotherapies. Inform patients of all options and the settings in which they're available, as appropriate. (See \"Treatment Planning or Referral\" in Part 2 of this TIP for more on shared decision making.) Patients who responded well to methadone in the past should be considered for this treatment. Unsuccessful treatment experiences with methadone in the past do not necessarily indicate that methadone will be ineffective again. Motivation and circumstances change over time. Also, treatment varies by OTP , as it does for other medical illnesses. Records from previous providers can contextualize the extent of past treatment. Pregnant women should be considered for methadone treatment. Methadone (or buprenorphine) treatment through OTPs may be best for patients who need a higher level of outpatient structure or supervision of medication adherence. Tailor medication decisions to patients' medical and substance use histories, patient preferences, and treatment availability. Informed Consent Inform all patients of: Their OUD diagnosis and the nature of the disorder. Risks and benefits of methadone and other OUD medications. Risks and benefits of nonmedication treatments. Use language and written materials appropriate to each patient's comprehension level to ensure that he or she understands the options and can make informed decisions.3-28Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Patients should sign consent forms before starting treatment. The Chapter 3B Appendix provides a sample consent form for treatment in an OTP . Educate patients about what to expect when receiving methadone treatment (Exhibit 3B.3). Caution them against using alcohol and drugs during methadone treatment. Warn them of the increased risk of overdose during the first 2 weeks of treatment. Also warn them that discon- tinuing treatment and returning to opioid use will increase their risk of overdose. Document patient education in the medical record. Educate patients about the importance of safe storage of take-home methadone doses. Discuss with patients where they will store their take-home medication. Advise them against storing medication in common areas of the home EXHIBIT 3B.3. Key Points of Patient Education for Methadone Before starting OUD treatment with methadone, patients should: Be told that the methadone dose is started low and increased slowly over days and weeks with monitoring, because it takes 4 or more days for the body to adjust to a dose change. This is necessary to avoid the risk of overdose. Understand that the goal of the first weeks of treatment is to improve withdrawal symptoms without oversedation. Patients should inform providers if they feel sedated or \"high\" within the first 4 hours after their dose. Learn the symptoms of methadone intoxication and how to seek emergency care. The first 2 weeks of treatment have the highest risk of overdose. Be aware that rescue naloxone does not last very long, so they should remain in emergency care for observation if they are treated for opioid overdose. Know that concurrent alcohol, benzodiazepine, or other sedative use with methadone increases the risk of overdose and death. Inform OTP nursing/medical staff about prescribed and over-the-counter medications and herbs (e.g., St. John's wort) they are taking, stopping, or changing doses of to allow assessment of potential drug-drug interactions. Inform other treating healthcare professionals that they are receiving methadone treatment. Plan to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until their dose is stabilized. Learn about other possible side effects of methadone, including dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, constipation, edema, and sexual dysfunction. Agree to keep take-home doses locked up and out of the reach of others. Understand that giving methadone, even small amounts, to others may be fatal. Inform providers if they become pregnant. Understand that stopping methadone increases their risk of overdose death if they return to illicit opioid use. RESOURCE ALERT Patient and Family Member Educational Resources Decisions in Recovery: Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder offers information for patients on the use of medications for OUD (https://store .samhsa.gov/product/SMA16-4993) Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Addiction: Facts for Families and Friends offers information for family members and friends (https://portal.ct.gov/DMHAS/Programs- and-Services/Opioid-Treatment/Medication- Assisted-Treatment)3-29 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder where visitors or children would have access, such as kitchens and bathrooms. Take-home doses should be kept in their original childproof packaging in a lockbox. The key should not be left in the box. Inform patients that any portion of a dose taken by another person, a child, or pet can be deadly. If this occurs, call 9-1-1 immediately. Initiating Methadone Treatment Observing patients directly when they take doses early in treatment is not just required; it's beneficial. It maximizes adherence, provides a daily opportunity to assess response to the medication, and minimizes the likelihood of med- ication diversion. Federal OTP regulations permit patients to receive one take-home dose per week, given routine clinic closure on weekends. Patients who demonstrate progress can earn one additional take-home dose per week for the first 90 days of treatment at the OTP medical director's discretion. All other doses are directly observed at the clinic in the first 90 days. The goal of initiating methadone treatment is to increase the patient's methadone dose gradually and safely, stabilizing the patient and reducing his or her opioid use while recognizing that the risk of dropout or overdose from illicit opioid use may increase if induction is too slow. Day 1 The first dose should reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms. Perform induction cautiously; it's impossible to judge a patient's level of tolerance with certainty. For patients addicted to prescrip- tion opioids, opioid conversion tables should not be relied on to determine methadone dosage. First dose for patients with opioid tolerance The first dose for patients tolerant to opioids is generally between 10 mg and 30 mg (30 mg is the maximum first dose per federal OTP regulations). After the first dose, patients should remain for observation for 2 to 4 hours if possible to see whether the dose is sedating or relieves withdrawal signs. If withdrawal symptoms lessen, the patient should return the next day to be reassessed and to continue the dose induction process. If sedation or intoxication occurs after the first dose, the patient should stay under observa- tion at the clinic until symptoms resolve. In this case, the patient should be reassessed the following day, and the subsequent day's dose should be substantially reduced. Extremely rarely, the patient will need to be treated for overdose with naloxone. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and call 9-1-1. If the patient shows neither sedation nor reduction of objective signs of opioid with- drawal during the 2- to 4-hour waiting period, administer another 5 mg dose. A final 5 mg dose after another waiting period of 2 to 4 hours can be administered if necessary. The maximum total methadone dose on the first day of treatment should not exceed 40 mg.127 However, caution dictates against exceeding a total first day's dose of 30 mg except in rare cases. In such cases, the patient should be carefully monitored on subsequent days to rule out oversedation. Patients transferring from another OTP whose methadone dose and last date of medication administration can be confirmed by the medical staff and documented in the medical record can be continued on the same methadone dose administered in the original OTP , even if the dose exceeds the maximum permitted 40 mg. For some patients, the lower range of initial doses is best. Dose with 10 mg to 20 mg in patients who: Are ages 60 and older. May have lower levels of opioid tolerance based on their recent history. Use sedating medications, such as benzodiaz- epines, antipsychotics, or antidepressants. Engage in problem drinking or have alcohol use disorder. Take medications that can increase methadone serum levels or are stopping medications that decrease methadone serum levels.1283-30Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Have medical disorders that may cause hypoxia, hypercapnia, or cardiac arrhythmias. These include: Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and kyphoscoliosis. Obesity. Sleep apnea. QTc prolongation. A family history of cardiac arrhythmias, fainting or dizziness, or sudden death. Cor pulmonale. Electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypoka- lemia or hypomagnesemia. First dose for patients without current opioid dependence In some circumstances, patients who are not currently dependent on opioids may be admitted to an OTP (e.g., individuals with a history of OUD who are returning from controlled environments).129 In these instances, consider treatment with extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) to avoid establishing new physiological opioid dependence. Instead of starting methadone, consider starting with a low dose of buprenorphine because of buprenor - phine's superior safety threshold.130 In one such study, 1 mg of buprenorphine was the starting dose, which was increased slowly131 (see Chapter 3D of this TIP). If XR-NTX and buprenorphine are not available, or the patient prefers methadone treatment, consider starting methadone at a 5 mg daily dose (as was done in one study132) after discussing risks and benefits with the patient. Titrate the dose much more slowly than for patients who are opioid tolerant. Increase initially by 5 mg about every week, based on patient response. Doses can be increased somewhat more rapidly after careful assessment of response if the patient begins to use illicit opioids. As with other methadone dosing, induction in these cases should not be based on a standing order.Dose Titration (Weeks 1 to 2) The goals of early dose titration for patients with current opioid dependence starting on Day 2 of the first week of treatment through stabilization are to avoid sedation at peak serum levels and to gradually extend time without opioid withdrawal symptoms and craving. When patients attend the program, before dose administration, nursing and/or medical staff members should ask patients whether they felt sedation, opioid intoxication effects, or opioid withdrawal symptoms 2 to 4 hours after their methadone administration the prior day (Exhibit 3B.4). Doses should be decreased for reports of symptoms of opioid intoxication or oversedation. Dosing must be individualized based on careful patient assess- ment and generally should not be increased every day, because plasma methadone levels do not reach steady state until about five methadone half-lives (Exhibit 3B.5). Even when holding the methadone dose constant over several days, the patient's methadone serum level will rise each day until it reaches steady state (Exhibit 3B.5). For example, if the patient remains on 20 mg per day for the first few days of induction, the serum level on Day 2 would reflect the 20 mg second day's dose plus 10 mg that remained in the body from the first day's dose (for the equivalent single dose total of 30 mg). The third day would reflect the 20 mg third day's dose, plus 10 mg remaining in the body from the second day's dose, and 5 mg remaining from the first day's dose (for the equivalent single dose total of 35 mg), and so on. Patients who report relief from withdrawal 4 to 12 hours after their last dose may benefit from staying at that same dose for a few days so that their serum level can stabilize.133 An American Society of Addiction Medicine expert panel recommended increasing the methadone dose in this phase by 5 mg or less every 5 or more days.134 Other expert recom- mendations suggest somewhat faster dose increases,135 including increases of 5 mg to 10 mg no sooner than every 3 to 4 days.136,137 The 3-31 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder EXHIBIT 3B.4.

Dose Titration (Weeks 3 to 4) Methadone doses can be increased further in 5 mg increments about every 3 to 5 days based on the patient's symptoms of opioid withdrawal or sedation.141 Patients who miss more than four doses must be reassessed. Their next methadone dose should be decreased substantially and built back up gradually. It may be necessary to restart the dose induction process from Day 1. Be aware of any specific state requirements regarding missed doses. Serum Levels Dosing must be individualized because meth- adone's bioavailability, clearance, and half-life vary among patients, affecting their clinical EXHIBIT 3B.5.

Many factors can affect serum levels and clinical responses to treatment. Along with age and diet, these factors include: Other medications and herbs (e.g., St. John's wort). Genetic differences in metabolizing enzymes. Pregnancy. Changes in urinary pH.142 Consider measuring serum methadone levels in patients who, after being on a stable methadone dose, report feeling drowsy 2 to 4 hours after dose administration but develop craving or withdrawal symptoms before the next dose is due to be administered. This may occur in the third trimester of pregnancy, when concomitant medications interact with methadone, or when patients rapidly metabolize opioids. In such cases, consider dividing the daily methadone dose into twice-daily dosing.143 To assess serum methadone levels, draw peak and trough blood specimens at about 3 hours and 24 hours, respectively, after dose administra- tion. Serum methadone levels generally correlate with methadone dose,144 but there is no defined therapeutic window based on serum methadone level because response varies widely among patients. Minimum trough methadone levels of 300 ng/mL to 400 ng/mL may be associated with reduced likelihood of heroin use,145 but deter - mining the therapeutic dose should depend on the overall patient response, not the serum plasma levels. Peak:trough ratios above 2:1 may indicate rapid metabolism.146 Dose Stabilization (Week 5 and Beyond) Once the patient achieves an adequate dose, extended continuation is possible without dose adjustment. Continuing treatment goals are to avoid sedation, eliminate withdrawal and craving, and blunt or block euphoric effects of illicit opioids.There may be reasons to further adjust the dose, including: Changes in health that can affect medica- tions (e.g., acute hepatitis, exacerbation of pulmonary disease, sleep apnea). Changes in patient medications. Pregnancy. Increased metabolism in the last trimester may warrant dose increase or split dosing.147,148 This may require a SAMHSA exception for daily take-home half-doses via an SMA-168 Exception Request (www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted -treatment/opioid-treatment-programs /submit-exception-request). Concurrent illicit opioid or other drug or alcohol use. As illicit opioid use stops and stabilization is achieved, the patient may wish to lower the dose to reduce any unpleasant side effects. Typical stabilization doses of at least 60 mg are associated with greater treatment retention; 80 mg to 120 mg149 is the typical daily range.150 However, there is wide variation, and some patients benefit from higher daily doses. Take-Home Medication OTPs can provide gradually increasing numbers of take-home doses to patients who discontinue illicit drug use and begin achieving treatment goals, commensurate with their tenure in the program. This provides a powerful incentive for patients to achieve treatment goals.151 It also furthers patients' recovery goals by allowing them to attend work, school, or other activities without daily OTP visits. Federal OTP regulations describe the conditions under which take-home doses are permitted. Some states have additional regulations. OTPs should be familiar with these regulations and have written procedures to address take-home dosing.3-33 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder The benefits of take-home doses must outweigh the risks and further patients' rehabilitation goals. When deciding whether patients can handle the responsibility of take-home doses of methadone or buprenor - phine, OTP medical directors should consider whether patients demonstrate: No recent misuse of substances. Regular clinic attendance. No serious behavioral problems at the clinic. No recent criminal activity (e.g., selling drugs). Stability at home and in social relationships. Sufficient time in treatment. Ability and intent to store take-home medication safely. Rehabilitative benefits from decreasing the frequency of clinic attendance that outweigh the potential risks of diversion. Federal regulations based on patients' time in treatment determine eligibility to be considered for receiving take-home doses of methadone (but buprenorphine is not bound by these limits): One earned dose/week (beyond a weekly clinic closure day or federal holiday, when clinics typically close) in the first 90 days of treatment Two doses during the second 90 days Three doses during the third 90 days Up to 6 doses during the last 90 days Up to 2 weeks of doses after 1 year Up to 1 month of doses after 2 years Assessing responsible handling of take-home doses Methadone diversion is a risk. People with OUD who are not in treatment more frequently use illicit methadone to self-medicate withdrawal symptoms than to achieve euphoria.152,153 Still, diversion is a public health risk; people who self-medicate may not know what dose they are taking. Moreover, opioid-na\u00efve people (including children) who ingest methadone can die of methadone intoxication.OTPs must assess patients' adherence to responsible take-home-dose handling and have a diversion control plan. The plan may require that the OTP: Remain open 7 days per week or arrange dosing at another clinic on days the clinic is closed for certain patients to avoid providing take-home doses to new or unstable patients. Contact patients randomly and request that they return their take-home containers within a day or two to see whether they still have the medication in their possession or have altered the medication in any way. Establish an appropriate drug testing program with policies to prevent falsification of specimens and to respond to tests that are negative for methadone. Require patients to store their take-home medication in a lockbox to prevent theft or accidental use by children or others. Duration of Methadone Treatment Longer lengths of stay in methadone treatment are associated with superior treatment outcomes.154 Leaving methadone treatment is associated with increased risk of death from overdose and other causes.155,156 Patients should continue as long as they benefit, want to, and develop no contraindications. RESOURCE ALERT Guidance on Federal Take-Home Methadone Dose Regulations For more information on federal take-home dose regulations for OTPs, see SAMHSA's Federal Guidelines Treatment Programs (https://store.samhsa.gov/product/ Federal-Guidelines-for-Opioid-Treatment- Programs/PEP15-FEDGUIDEOTP ).3-34Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Dose Tapering and Methadone Discontinuation Discuss risks and benefits with patients who wish to discontinue treatment. Explore their reasons for wanting to discontinue and solutions for potential barriers to treatment, which may include: Logistics (e.g., travel, scheduling). Transportation services, including publicly funded ride services, ride sharing, or peer support workers, may be available. If not, transferring patients to a closer OTP or to one with more suitable hours of operation may resolve the problem. Costs. Providers can help patients explore publicly supported treatment options or apply for insurance. Side effects. Changing the dose or treating side effects may resolve the problem. Opinions of friends or family. When external pressure from family or friends drives the decision, a discussion with the patient and those individuals may help. A desire to switch to buprenorphine or XR-NTX treatment. These options should be discussed. Caution patients who are not yet stable against discontinuing treatment, because of high rates of return to illicit opioid use and increased chance of overdose death.157 Discuss the alternative of switching to a different OUD medication. Give patients who stop treatment information about overdose prevention and encourage them to return to treatment. Prescribe naloxone to use in case of overdose.Create a plan collaboratively with stable patients who wish to discontinue treatment that addresses: Gradually tapering their dose. Increasing psychosocial and recovery supports. Discontinuing dose reduction if necessary. Returning to medication treatment after discontinuation if they return to illicit opioid use. Increasing dosage if destabilization occurs. Individualize the pace of methadone dose reduction to the patient's response. One approach is to decrease the methadone dose gradually by 5 to 10 percent every 1 to 2 weeks. Once patients reach a relatively low dose, often between 20 mg and 40 mg, they may begin to feel more craving. Some patients may choose to switch to buprenorphine for a period to complete the dose reduction. They may also wish to begin XR-NTX after an appropriate period of opioid abstinence. Encourage patients to use techniques for preventing return to use, such as participating in recovery support groups and gaining support from counseling and family. Doing so can help patients succeed in tapering off their medication. RESOURCE ALERT Guidance on Opioid Overdose Prevention For more information on preventing SMA18-4742). The TIP expert panel considers arbitrary time limits on OUD treatment with methadone to be medically unwarranted and inappropriate. They pose a risk to patients and the public.3-35 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Methadone Dosing Summary The initial goal is to reduce opioid withdrawal and craving safely. Use the \"start low and go slow\" approach but increase dose at a rate that minimizes chances of continued illicit drug use, while monitoring for side effects. Increase doses gradually over several weeks. Assess for sedation at peak serum concentra- tion (2-4 hours after the dose). The eventual target is an adequate dose that: Stops withdrawal symptoms for 24 hours. Reduces or eliminates craving. Blunts or blocks euphoria from self- administered illicit opioids. In general, after induction is complete, higher doses are more effective than lower doses. Enhancing Access to OUD Medication in OTPs Individuals on waiting lists for OTPs should receive interim methadone maintenance treatment. People on waiting lists typically continue to use illicit opioids. Many never gain admission through the waiting list process. Federal OTP regulations permit use of interim methadone maintenance to address this problem by providing methadone treatment for up to 120 days to someone on an OTP waiting list. Routine counseling and treatment planning are not required during this period.Interim methadone maintenance has been shown to be more effective than a waiting list to facilitate entry into com- prehensive methadone treatment and to reduce illicit opioid use, according to two randomized trials.158,159 Interim methadone requires approval by SAMHSA and the state opioid treatment authority. For more detailed information on interim methadone maintenance, see SAMHSA's Federal Guidelines for Opioid Treatment Programs (https://store.samhsa.gov/product/Federal- Guidelines-for-Opioid-Treatment-Programs/ PEP15-FEDGUIDEOTP). OTPs can overcome geographic barriers by opening a medication unit of the parent OTP site. Under the aegis of a certified OTP , a medication unit may provide methadone or buprenorphine administration, dispensing capacity, and urine drug testing, but not coun- seling. The parent clinic must provide counseling and other required services. Such arrangements can lessen the amount of time required to drive to a parent OTP location in large states with rural populations. SAMHSA's Federal Guidelines for Opioid Treatment Programs offers more information on medication units and other OTP regulations (https://store.samhsa.gov/product/Federal- Guidelines-for-Opioid-Treatment-Programs/ PEP15-FEDGUIDEOTP)3-36Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Chapter 3B Appendix Sample Standard Consent to Opioid Maintenance Treatment Form for OTPs CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE OR BUPRENORPHINE TREATMENT Patient's Name: _____________________________________________________ Date: voluntary consent to _________________________________ [insert name of program] to dispense and administer medications\u2014including methadone or buprenorphine\u2014to treat my opioid use disorder. Treatment procedures have been explained to me, and I understand that I should take my medication at the schedule determined by the program physician, or his/her designee, in accordance with federal and state regulations. I understand that, like all other medications, methadone or buprenorphine can be harmful if not taken as prescribed. It has been explained to me that I must safeguard these medications and not share them with anyone because they can be fatal to children and adults if taken without medical supervision. I also understand that methadone and buprenorphine produce physical opioid dependence. Like all medications, they may have side effects. Possible side effects, as well as alternative treatments and their risks and benefits, have been explained to me. I understand that it is important for me to inform any medical and psychiatric provider who may treat me that I am enrolled in an opioid treatment program. In this way, the provider will be aware of all the medications I am taking, can provide the best possible care, and can avoid prescribing medications that might affect my treatment with methadone or buprenorphine or my recovery. I understand that I may withdraw voluntarily from this treatment program and discontinue the use of these medications at any time. If I choose this option, I understand I will be offered medically supervised withdrawal. For women of childbearing age: Pregnant women treated with methadone or sublingual or buccal buprenorphine have better outcomes than pregnant women not in treatment who continue to use opioid drugs. Newborns of mothers who are receiving methadone or buprenorphine treatment may have opioid withdrawal symptoms (i.e., neonatal abstinence syndrome). The delivery hospital may require babies who are exposed to opioids before birth to spend a number of days in the hospital for monitoring of withdrawal symptoms. Some babies may also need medication to stop withdrawal. If I am or become pregnant, I understand that I should tell the medical staff of the OTP right away so I can receive or be referred to prenatal care. I understand that there are ways to maximize the healthy course of my pregnancy while I am taking methadone or buprenorphine. Signature domain1603-37 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid 3C: Naltrexone The opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone was synthesized in the 1960s to block the euphoric effects of morphine.161 Oral naltrexone was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1984 for the blockade of the effects of exogenously administered opioids. Long-acting, sustained-release opioid agonist preparations have been investigated since the 1970s to improve adherence over oral medications. In 2010, FDA approved injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) for preventing return to opioid dependence after medically supervised withdrawal. Despite its potential advantages (e.g., no abuse liability, no special regulatory requirements), oral naltrexone is not widely used to treat opioid use disorder (OUD) because of low rates of patient acceptance, difficulty in achieving abstinence for the necessary time before initiation of treatment, and high rates of medication nonadherence.162 Before initiating either formulation of naltrex- one, patients must be opioid abstinent for an adequate period of time after completing opioid withdrawal. Medically supervised opioid withdrawal can be conducted on an outpatient or inpatient basis. The latter is often reserved for patients with co-occurring substance use disorders (SUDs) or medical or psychiatric illness. There are several pharmacological approaches to medically supervised withdrawal. Methadone can be used for this purpose in opioid treatment programs (OTPs) and hospital settings. Patients in opioid withdrawal typically receive an indi- vidualized dose between 20 mg and 30 mg per day, gradually reduced over 6 days or more. Buprenorphine can be used in an adequate dose to lessen withdrawal symptoms and then reduced gradually over several days or more. If an opioid agonist is used for medically supervised withdrawal, an adequate interval of time following the last dose must occur before naltrexone induction. When it is not possible to use opioid agonists, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists such as clonidine can be used off label at doses from 0.1 mg to 0.3 mg every 6 to 8 hours to treat symptoms.163 Formulations Oral: Oral naltrexone is a 50 mg tablet of naltrexone hydrochloride. It was approved by FDA in 1984 for blockade of the effects of exogenously administered opioids and in 1994 for alcohol dependence treatment. A Cochrane review examined 13 randomized trials among 1,158 patients who were opioid dependent and provided counseling. They were treated with or without oral naltrexone. The review concluded that oral naltrexone was not superior to placebo or to no medication in treatment retention or illicit opioid use reduction.164 XR-NTX: In 2006, FDA approved XR-NTX as an intramuscular (IM) injection every 4 weeks or once a month for the treatment of alcohol dependence. In 2010, FDA approved XR-NTX for the prevention of return to opioid dependence following medically supervised withdrawal. XR-NTX is a suspension of 380 mg naltrexone embedded in microspheres made from a biode- gradable copolymer that undergoes hydrolysis as it absorbs water. XR-NTX requires refrigeration and is supplied as a vial of dry powder along with a separate vial of an aqueous diluent, which providers combine just before use.165Chapter 3C gives an overview of naltrexone pharmacology and specific guidance on dosing for oral and injectable naltrexone.3-38Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 XR-NTX is more effective than placebo166 or no medication167 in reducing risk of return to opioid use.168 A multisite randomized trial in the United States started in residential treatment programs found that buprenorphine treatment was associated with lower rates of return to use during 24 weeks of postdischarge outpatient treatment compared with XR-NTX,169 given the significant proportion of patients who did not actually receive XR-NTX because of challenges related to XR-NTX induction. The same study found no significant between-group differences in rates of return to use when data were analyzed based solely on patients who did begin assigned medications. Study findings may not generalize to outpatient settings, where naltrexone induction may be more difficult than in residential treatment settings. One additional study merits mention. A 12-week trial was conducted in Norway with 159 partic- ipants who, at the time of random assignment to XR-NTX or buprenorphine, had completed medically supervised withdrawal or were already opioid abstinent. XR-NTX was found to be nonin- ferior to buprenorphine in terms of treatment retention or reduction in illicit opioid use.170 Pharmacology Naltrexone is a competitive mu-opioid receptor antagonist with strong receptor affinity. Naltrexone does not activate the mu-opioid receptor and exerts no opioid effects. Unlike opioid agonists, naltrexone will not alleviate withdrawal symptoms, will not cause withdrawal when stopped, and cannot be diverted. If patients maintained on naltrexone use opioid agonists, naltrexone can block their effects\u2014a key feature of its therapeutic efficacy. However, because the interaction at the receptor is competitive, the blockade can potentially be overridden with high doses of opioids. Taking naltrexone after recent use of opioids can precipitate opioid withdrawal. Given its strong affinity, naltrexone can displace other opioids from the receptor. Patients must typically wait 7 to 10 days after their last use of short- acting opioids and 10 to 14 days after their last use of long-acting opioids before taking their first dose of naltrexone. Bioavailability Oral: The gastrointestinal tract readily absorbs oral naltrexone. Peak concentrations occur in 1 to 2 hours.171 XR-NTX: IM injection causes a transient peak blood concentration 2 hours after injection and another at 2 to 3 days after injection.172 About 14 days after injection, concentrations gradually diminish, with measurable blood levels for more than 1 month. Both formulations are extensively metabolized by the kidneys and liver, but without CYP450 enzyme system involvement. Unlike methadone and buprenorphine, naltrexone potential drug-drug interactions. Its metabolite, 6-beta naltrexol, is also a mu-opioid receptor antagonist. It is eliminated primarily by the kidneys in the urine.173 Orally administered naltrexone has a half-life of approximately 4 hours. Its primary me- tabolite, 6-beta-naltrexol, is a weak mu-opioid receptor biodegradable microspheres. It provides opioid blockade by delivering steady naltrexone concentrations for about 1 month.175 Elimination half-life is 5 to 10 days. Repeated administration causes no accumulation of naltrexone or its metabolites. Dosing Considerations XR-NTX XR-NTX is indicated for the prevention of return to opioid dependence following medically supervised opioid withdrawal. Appropriate patients should have an adequate period of abstinence with no signs of opioid withdrawal before XR-NTX administration. Patients must be willing to receive monthly IM injections. Become 3-39 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder acquainted with the FDA label for XR-NTX, which is available online Contraindications well as to receiving oral naltrexone, with the exception of hypersensitivity to the XR-NTX suspension and diluent) include:176 Current pain treatment with opioid analgesics. Current physiological dependence. Current acute opioid withdrawal. hepatic impairment. Naloxone challenge (Exhibit 3C.1) or oral naltrexone dose causing opioid withdrawal symptoms. opioid morphine, naltrexone, polylactide-co-glycolide, carboxymethylcellu - lose, or any other components of the diluent. Precautions and warnings Discuss the risks and benefits of continuing naltrexone with patients who become pregnant while receiving naltrexone treatment and whose OUD is in remission. Unlike methadone and buprenorphine, nal - trexone has been little researched in pregnant populations.177,178 Patients are vulnerable to opioid overdose death after completing the every-4-weeks or once-monthly dosing period, missing a dose, or stopping treatment. Trying to override opioid blockade with high opioid doses may cause overdose. Patients may experience injection site reactions including pain, tenderness, indura - tion, swelling, erythema, bruising, or pruritus. Severe injection site reactions may occur (e.g., cellulitis, hematoma, abscess, sterile abscess, necrosis). Some cases may require surgical intervention and may result in significant scarring. (See the Chapter 3C Appendix for techniques to reduce injection site reactions.) As with any IM injection, use caution in patients with thrombocytopenia or a coagula - tion disorder. Precipitated opioid withdrawal can occur in patients who used illicit opioids recently or switched from an opioid agonist med - ication. Symptoms may be severe enough for hospitalization. To avoid precipitated withdrawal from either formulation, patients should typically stop use of short-acting opioid agonists for 7 to 10 days and long- acting agonists for 10 to 14 days.179 There is active research on approaches to initiate XR-NTX more quickly for patients physically dependent on opioid agonists.180 Hepatitis has been associated with XR-NTX, often in the presence of other potential causes of hepatic toxicity (e.g., alcohol liver disease, viral hepatitis). Monitor liver function tests during treatment. Stop naltrexone in the presence of acute hepatitis and severe liver disease.181 Initiate or refer patients to treatment for hepatitis. Use cautiously in patients with moderate- to-severe renal impairment, because the medication is eliminated primarily through the kidneys. Hypersensitivity reactions can occur, including rash, urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis. Monitor patients with OUD for depres - sion and suicidal ideation. Naltrexone use has been occasionally associated with dysphoria,182 although it's unclear whether this is a side effect of the medication or a manifes - tation of underlying depression or depressed mood related to OUD.183 Monitor patients for depression, which is common with OUD. If a patient needs emergency pain treatment, regional anesthesia or nonopioid analgesics are alternatives to opioid analge - sics. A patient who must have opioids for pain treatment or anesthesia requires continuous monitoring in an anesthesia care setting.3-40Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 EXHIBIT 3C.1. Naloxone Challenge Use the naloxone challenge to assess lack of physical opioid dependence. Naloxone can be administered via intravenous, subcutaneous, or IM routes to patients who report an adequate period of opioid abstinence and have a negative opioid urine test (including morphine, methadone, buprenorphine, and oxycodone). A negative naloxone challenge does not guarantee that the patient will not experience precipitated opioid withdrawal upon naltrexone administration.184 Intravenous Administration 1. Draw 0.8 mg naloxone into a sterile syringe. 2. Inject 0.2 mg naloxone intravenously. 3. Wait 30 seconds for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If withdrawal signs/symptoms are present, stop the naloxone challenge and treat symptomatically. 4. If no withdrawal signs and symptoms are present and vital signs are stable, inject remaining naloxone (0.6 mg) and observe for 20 minutes. Check the patient's vital signs and monitor for withdrawal. 5. If withdrawal signs and symptoms are present, stop the naloxone challenge and treat symptomatically. The test can be repeated in 24 hours or the patient can be considered for opioid agonist treatment. 6. If no withdrawal signs and symptoms are present* and oral naltrexone is the desired treatment course, give the patient two tablets of 25 mg naltrexone (take one tablet on each of the next 2 days) and a sufficient number of 50 mg naltrexone tablets (take one 50 mg tablet daily starting on the third day) until they are able to fill their prescription for oral naltrexone. Skip to Step 8. 7. If no withdrawal signs and symptoms are present** and XR-NTX is the desired treatment course, administer XR-NTX in the upper outer quadrant of the buttock, following package insert directions (summarized below). 8. Instruct the patient about the risk of overdose and death if they use opioids to override the blockade. Subcutaneous Administration 1. Inject 0.8 mg naloxone subcutaneously. 2. Wait 20 minutes while checking vital signs and observing for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. 3. If withdrawal signs and symptom are present, stop the naloxone challenge and treat symptomatically. The test can be repeated in 24 hours or the patient can be considered for opioid agonist treatment. 4. If no withdrawal signs and symptoms are present, follow Step 6 (for oral naltrexone treatment) or Step 7 (for XR-NTX treatment) above. * Optional: If withdrawal signs and symptoms are absent, administer 25 mg oral naltrexone and observe for 2 hours. If the patient develops opioid withdrawal, treat symptomatically. If no withdrawal signs or symptoms are present following the 25 mg naltrexone dose and oral naltrexone is the desired treatment course, give the patient one tablet of 25 mg naltrexone to take the next day and 50 mg naltrexone tablets to take daily starting the day after. ** Optional: If withdrawal signs and symptoms are absent, administer 25 mg oral naltrexone and observe for 2 hours. If the patient develops opioid withdrawal, treat symptomatically and do not administer XR-NTX. This step is recommended to minimize the likelihood of longer lasting precipitated withdrawal in patients given XR-NTX who took buprenorphine recently (naloxone may not displace it from opioid receptors). This step can help identify a naltrexone allergy before providing XR-NTX. If no withdrawal symptoms are present following the 25 mg naltrexone dose and XR-NTX is the desired course, administer XR-NTX as described above.

Injection site pain. Hepatic enzyme abnormalities. Nasopharyngitis. Assessment Thorough assessment helps determine whether naltrexone treatment is appropriate for a patient. (Part 2 of this Treatment Improvement Protocol [TIP] covers screening and assessment in more detail.) Patients who have been abstinent from short-acting opioids (including tramadol) for 7 to 10 days or long-acting opioids (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine) for 10 to 14 days can initiate naltrexone following assessment that includes: Checking the state prescription drug moni- toring program database. Taking the patient's history. Conduct a medical, psychiatric, substance use, and substance use treatment history. Assess recent opioid use, including frequency, quantity, type, route, and last day of use. Confirm an adequate opioid abstinence period. Establish OUD diagnosis. Assess for other SUDs, including those that involve alcohol, benzodiazepines, or stimulants. Conducting a physical exam. Assess for signs and symptoms of intoxi- cation. Do not give a first dose to a patient who is sedated or intoxicated. Assess and treat him or her appropriately. Assess for evidence of opioid withdrawal and physiological dependence. The Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) or the Clinical Institute Narcotic Assessment (CINA) Scale for Withdrawal Symptoms can be used to assess with- drawal signs (see \"Resource Alert: Opioid Withdrawal Scales\"). The patient should not exhibit any signs of opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of naltrexone, to avoid precipitated withdrawal. Obtaining laboratory tests. Conduct drug and alcohol tests. Use reliable urine tests for opioids (including morphine, methadone, buprenorphine, and oxycodone), benzodiazepines, cocaine, and other drugs commonly used in the area. Use a breathalyzer to estimate the patient's blood alcohol content. Conduct a pregnancy test. Naltrexone is not recommended for OUD treatment in pregnancy. Refer pregnant patients to prenatal care.187 Assess liver function. Obtain liver function tests followed by periodic monitoring at 6- or 12-month intervals during treatment.188 Obtain kidney function tests (e.g., creati- nine) for people who inject drugs. RESOURCE ALERT Opioid Withdrawal Scales The COWS and other opioid withdrawal scales from Annex 10 of the World Health Organization's Guidelines for the Psychosocially Assisted Pharmacological Treatment of Opioid Dependence can be downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books /NBK143183). The CINA Scale for Withdrawal Symptoms is online (www.ncpoep.org/wp -content/uploads/2015/02/Appendix_7_Clinical _Institute_Narcotic_Assessment_CINA_Scale _for_Withdrawal_Symptoms.pdf ).3-42Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Conduct hepatitis and HIV tests. Hepatitis B and C are common among patients entering naltrexone treatment. HIV infection is also prevalent. Everyone ages 15 to 65 should be tested at least once for HIV. Persons at higher risk, such as people who use drugs by injection, should be tested annually.189 Anyone who is injecting or has ever injected drugs, even once, no matter how long ago, should be tested for hepatitis C, regardless of their intention to seek treatment for SUD.190 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hepatitis B vaccine for indi - viduals seeking treatment for SUDs.191 During assessment, discuss with patients the risks and benefits of naltrexone and alterna - tive treatment approaches. Explore patients' motivation to initiate medication treatment and to adhere to the dosing regimen. Start naltrexone if the patient: Meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, criteria for OUD. Understands risks and benefits. Reports opioid abstinence for 7 to 10 days (short acting) or 10 to 14 days (long acting). Reports no allergies to naltrexone or the components of the XR-NTX preparation. Does not have a coagulation disorder. Will not soon require opioid analgesia. Has a negative pregnancy test. Has a negative urine opioid screen for morphine, methadone, buprenorphine, oxycodone, and other opioids. Is free of current opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms (Exhibit 3C.2). Has liver function test results that do not indicate acute hepatitis or liver failure. Has a negative naloxone challenge result (Exhibit 3C.1). Patient selection No evidence clearly predicts which patients are best treated with XR-NTX versus other OUD medications. A secondary analysis of the data from a randomized trial of XR-NTX versus placebo conducted in Russia found no significant baseline predictors of successes among the 25 variables examined, including demographics, clinical severity, level of functioning, craving, and HIV serostatus.192 Inform patients of all their treatment options and the settings in which they are available. OTPs may be best for patients needing more structure. Tailor decisions about which medica - tion to use to patients' medical and substance use histories, patient preferences, and treatment availability. Pregnant women are not appropriate candidates for XR-NTX treatment. Consider for XR-NTX treatment patients who:193 Do not wish to take opioid agonists. Have been opioid abstinent for at least 1 week, have recently been or will soon be released from controlled environments (e.g., incarceration, residential addiction treatment), and do not wish to initiate (or are not able to access) opioid agonist treatment. For patients requesting opioid agonist treatment, methadone or buprenorphine must be started at much lower doses and increased much more slowly than for opioid-tolerant patients (see sections on methadone and buprenor - phine dosing). EXHIBIT 3C.2. Signs and Symptoms of Opioid Withdrawal Signs Runny nose Tearing Yawning Sweating Tremor Vomiting Piloerection Pupillary dilationSymptoms Skin crawling Abdominal cramps Temperature changes Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Bone or muscle pain Dysphoria Craving for opioids3-43 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Have not responded well to prior adequate treatment with opioid agonist therapy.194 Are part of an overall program with external monitoring and significant, immediate external consequences for lack of adherence. These patients (e.g., healthcare professionals, pilots, probationers, parolees) may show higher rates of retention with XR-NTX because of required external monitoring.195 Have home locations or work schedules making daily or almost-daily OTP visits impossible or risky (e.g., job loss). Informed consent Inform all patients of the following basic information: Their OUD diagnosis and the nature of the disorder Risks and benefits of XR-NTX and other OUD medications Risks and benefits of nonmedication treatments Consider asking patients to sign a treatment agreement form before starting treatment. (See Appendix 3C for a sample treatment agreement.) Document informed consent discus- sions in the medical record. Educate patients and their families about what to expect from naltrexone treatment (Exhibit 3C.3). A naltrexone medication guide should be dispensed to patients with each injection. Caution them about increased risk of overdose if they stop treatment and return to illicit opioid use or attempt to override the receptor blockade of XR-NTX. Document education in the medical record. Chapter 3C Appendix has a patient education counseling tool for XR-NTX.Initiating XR-NTX treatment Storage and preparation A pharmacy will send XR-NTX and its diluent in a refrigerated package with two sets of administra- tion needles (1.5 and 2 inches), a 1-inch prepara- tion needle, and a needle protection device. The XR-NTX microspheres are temperature sensitive. When the carton arrives from the pharmacy, store it in a refrigerator at 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 8 degrees Celsius). The refrigerator should have a working thermometer; check the temperature regularly. Do not freeze the carton or expose it to tem- peratures above 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius). XR-NTX can be stored unrefrig- erated for up to 7 days before administration. Before preparing XR-NTX for administration, keep it at room temperature for about 45 minutes. Examine the microspheres and diluent to ensure that no particulate matter or discolor - ation are present. Mix following FDA-approved package insert directions, using the 1-inch preparation needle. Resulting suspension should be milky white, without clumps, and able to move freely down the wall of the vial. Two sets of needles of two different lengths are shipped with the medication in case the first needle clogs before injection. Use the 1.5-inch needle for lean patients and the 2-inch needle for patients with more subcutaneous tissue overlying the gluteal muscle. The longer needle helps ensure that the injection reaches the muscle. Inject patients with average body habitus with either needle. Administration Administer XR-NTX every 4 weeks or once a month as a 380 mg IM gluteal injection. Alternate buttocks for each 4-week injection. Given the risk of severe injection site reactions, FDA requires a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (www.vivitrolrems.com) for XR-NTX including a patient counseling tool, a patient medication guide, and a visual aid to reinforce proper XR-NTX injection technique.Use language and written materials appropriate to each patient's comprehension level to ensure that he or she understands the options and can make informed decisions.3-44Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 EXHIBIT 3C.3. Key Points of Patient Education for Naltrexone Do not use any opioids in the 7 to 10 days (for short acting) or 10 to 14 days (for long acting) before starting XR-NTX, to avoid potentially serious opioid contain codeine or other opioids. -Methadone. -Buprenorphine. Seek immediate medical help if symptoms of allergic reaction or anaphylaxis occur, such as: -Itching. -Swelling. -Hives. -Shortness of breath. -Throat tightness. Do not try to override the opioid blockade with large amounts of opioids, which could result in overdose. Understand the risk of overdose from using opioids near the time of the next injection, after missing a dose, or after stopping medications. Report injection site reactions including: -Pain. -Hardening. -Lumps. -Blisters. -Blackening. -Scabs. -An open wound. Some of these reactions could require surgery to repair (rarely). Report signs and symptoms of hepatitis (e.g., fatigue, abdominal pain, yellowing skin or eyes, dark urine). Report depression or suicidal thoughts. Seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms appear. Seek medical help if symptoms of pneumonia appear (e.g., shortness of breath, fever). Inform providers of naltrexone treatment, as treatment differs for various types of pneumonia. Inform all healthcare professionals of XR-NTX treatment. Report pregnancy. Inform providers of any upcoming medical procedures that may require pain medication. Understand that taking naltrexone may result in difficulty achieving adequate pain control if acute medical illness or trauma causes severe acute pain. Wear medical alert jewelry and carry a medical alert card indicating you are taking XR-NTX. A patient wallet card or medical alert bracelet can be ordered at 1-800-848-4876. Follow-up care after first dose Examine patients within a week of administer - ing their first XR-NTX dose. It can be clinically beneficial to maintain weekly contact in the first month to: Provide supportive counseling. Assess ongoing drug or alcohol use. Monitor side effects. Obtain drug testing. Follow up on status of referrals to counseling or other services.Patients who test the opioid blockade of XR-NTX may discontinue use because of the blocking of the euphoric effects of illicit opioids.196 Patients who miss a dose can restart medication (use procedures outlined earlier in this section) after an adequate period of opioid abstinence (7 to 14 days). The TIP expert panel cautions that, based on current data, arbitrary time limits on XR-NTX are inappropriate.3-45 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder See Chapter 3E for information on the manage- ment of patients taking naltrexone in office- based treatment settings. Duration of treatment Barring contraindications, patients should continue taking XR-NTX as long as they benefit from it and want to continue. Data are limited on the long-term effectiveness of XR-NTX compared with methadone or buprenorphine. Treatment discontinuation When patients wish to discontinue naltrexone, engage in shared decision making and explore: Their reasons for wanting to discontinue. The risks and benefits of discontinuing. Problem-solving strategies that can help them make an informed choice. Their appropriateness for buprenorphine or methadone treatment. Discourage patients who are not yet stable from discontinuing treatment, because of the high rate of return to illicit opioid use and the increased chance of overdose death. Signs that a patient may be ready to discontinue medication include:197 Sustaining illicit drug abstinence over time. Having stable housing and income. Having no legal problems. Having substantially reduced craving. Attending counseling or mutual-help groups. Patients who discontinue should have a recovery plan that may include monitoring as well as adjunctive counseling and recovery support. If they return to opioid use, encourage them to return for assessment and reentry into treatment. Given the high risk of return to illicit opioid use, offer patients information about opioid overdose prevention and a naloxone pre- scription they can use in case of overdose. When patients stop using naltrexone, they will have no tolerance for opioids. Their risk of overdose is very high if they use again. For more information, see the SAMHSA with OUD need to discontinue opioids and wait 7 to 14 days after last opioid use (including any given for with- drawal treatment) before receiving XR-NTX. As described above, they can do so through medically supervised withdrawal in a controlled environment, such as an inpatient unit, residen- tial addiction treatment program, correctional facility, or hospital, or on an outpatient basis. Financial issues and managed care constraints may influence patients' access to controlled treatment environments. The alternative\u2014 abstaining long enough after outpatient medically supervised withdrawal\u2014is challeng- ing. Thus, various approaches to rapid naltrexone induction have been developed198 and more recently refined in research settings.199,200,201 Consider rapid induction in specialty addiction treatment programs, not general medical settings. It may be hard for providers in general medical settings to start XR-NTX successfully with patients who need medically supervised opioid withdrawal. Rapid induction approaches are likely beyond the scope of general outpatient RESOURCE ALERT Patient and Family Educational Resources Decisions in Recovery: Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder offers information for patients on the use of medications for OUD (https://store .samhsa.gov/product/SMA16-4993) Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Addiction: Facts for Families and Friends offers information for family and friends (https:// portal.ct.gov/DMHAS/Programs-and-Services/ Opioid-Treatment/Medication-Assisted- Treatment)3-46Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 settings. However, patients can successfully initiate XR-NTX in a general outpatient medical setting if they: Have been abstinent for sufficient time and pass the naloxone challenge. Started taking XR-NTX elsewhere and are due for the next injection. One randomized trial compared two approaches to starting XR-NTX on an outpatient basis. This study assigned adults dependent on opioids to either a standard 14-day buprenorphine- assisted opioid more rapid 7-day oral naltrexone-assisted opioid withdrawal.202 Naltrexone-assisted withdrawal was conducted over 7 days. It included 1 day of buprenorphine administration; 1 day with ancillary medications including clonidine and clonazepam but no buprenorphine; followed by 4 days of ancillary medications and increasing daily doses of oral naltrexone (starting with 1 mg, 3 mg, 12 mg, and 25 mg); and concluding on day 7 with XR-NTX administration. Buprenorphine-assisted withdrawal consisted of a 7-day buprenorphine taper followed by the recommended 7 days without opioids. The naltrexone-assisted withdrawal group was significantly more likely to begin XR-NTX compared with the buprenorphine-assisted withdrawal group (56.1 percent versus 32.7 percent, respectively). This type of approach, which must be conducted with careful daily monitoring, is used in some residential programs and may prove to be a useful approach to outpatient XR-NTX induction in specialty programs. More discussion on rapid induction approaches is available in Implementing Antagonist-Based Relapse Prevention Treatment Buprenorphine-Treated Individuals,203 available online -Antagonist-with-Case.Bisaga.CME_.pdf). Oral Naltrexone The effectiveness of oral naltrexone is limited, given poor adherence and the requirement of 7 to 14 days of opioid abstinence before initiation. During this waiting period, patients may drop out of care. One study found significantly lower patient retention in treatment after incarcera- tion for patients treated with oral naltrexone compared with methadone.204 Oral naltrexone blocks opioid-induced euphoria for only a day or two. When patients stop taking it, risks of return to opioid use and overdose increase. The TIP expert panel doesn't recommend using oral naltrexone except in the limited circumstances described in the following sections. This view is in keeping with expert reviews for the United Kingdom's National Health Service,205 a clinical practice guideline published by the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense,206 and a Cochrane review.207 Indications and contraindications, precautions and warnings, side effects, and assessment. All are similar to those for XR-NTX, save issues specific to suspension/diluent contents and the injection itself. Patient Selection In limited circumstances, oral naltrexone may be considered after the risks and benefits, as well as alternative treatments, are discussed with the patient. Examples include: Patients who cannot afford XR-NTX but wish to take an opioid receptor antagonist. Patients with high levels of monitoring and negative consequences for nonadherence, such as healthcare professionals who may not be permitted to have opioid agonist treatment.208,209 The TIP expert panel does not recommend that payers require patients to fail oral naltrexone before providing access to XR-NTX, given the risk of unintentional overdose death if the patient returns to illicit opioid use.3-47 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Patients leaving controlled environments (e.g., prisons, hospitals, inpatient addiction re- habilitation) who may benefit from medication to prevent return to illicit drug use but cannot or will not take XR-NTX and do not wish to be treated with (or do not have access to) opioid agonists. Patients who have taken methadone or ex- tensively used heroin are especially poor oral naltrexone candidates.210 Dosing Following a negative naloxone challenge, the first oral dose of naltrexone can be 25 mg (half of the usual daily naltrexone maintenance dose). This reduces risk of a more severe precipitated opioid withdrawal than could occur with a full 50 mg dose. This lower dose may also reduce nausea associated with the first naltrexone dose. The dose can be increased to 50 mg daily on the second day. To increase adherence, arrange for directly observed administration of oral naltrexone. This is more feasible if patients who tolerate a daily dose of 50 mg are switched to a 3-days- per-week regimen for a total weekly dose of 350 mg (e.g., administer 100 mg on Monday and Wednesday and 150 mg on Friday). A member of the patient's social network (e.g., spouse) may also directly observe therapy. Duration of treatment The optimal length of treatment with oral naltrexone is not known. In general, the longer patients take an effective medication, the better their outcomes. Use of illicit opioids during treatment with oral naltrexone is a cause of concern and may be a precursor to treatment discontinuation.211 Some patients will initially test the opioid blockade with illicit opioids and then discontinue opioid use. However, others will continue using illicit opioids.212If patients continue to test the blockade, immediately discuss alternative treatment plans that include: Increased counseling. Switching to XR-NTX. Closer monitoring. Directly observed oral naltrexone therapy. Residential treatment. Assessment for the appropriateness of buprenorphine or methadone. Naltrexone Dosing Summary XR-NTX Before administering XR-NTX, keep it at room temperature for about 45 minutes. Use the correct needle length to ensure the injection is in the gluteal muscle. Use the 2-inch needle for patients with more subcutaneous tissue and the 1.5-inch needle for patients with less adipose tissue. Use either length in patients with normal body habitus. Use proper aseptic technique. Use proper gluteal IM injection technique. Never inject intravenously or subcutaneously. Repeat the injection every 4 weeks or once per month. Oral Naltrexone Use in limited circumstances after discussing risks and benefits, as well as alternative treatment options, with the patient. Do the naloxone challenge. The first oral naltrexone dose should be 25 mg. The dose can be increased on the second day to 50 mg daily if necessary. If desired, switch patients who tolerate a daily dose of 50 mg to a 3-days-per-week regimen for a total weekly dose of 350 mg.3-48Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Chapter 3C Appendix Sample XR-NTX Treatment Agreement This form is for educational/informational purposes only.

TREATMENT AGREEMENT I agree to accept the following treatment agreement for extended-release injectable naltrexone office-based opioid use disorder and benefits of extended-release injectable naltrexone treatment have been explained to me. 2. The risks and benefits of other treatment for opioid use disorder (including methadone, buprenorphine, and nonmedication treatments) have been explained to me. 3. I will be on time to my appointments and respectful to the office staff and other patients. 4. I will keep my healthcare provider informed of all my medications (including herbs and vitamins) and medical problems. 5. I agree not to obtain or take prescription opioid medications prescribed by any other healthcare provider without consultation from my naltrexone prescriber. 6. If I am going to have a medical procedure that will cause pain, I will let my healthcare provider know in advance so that my pain will be adequately treated. 7. If I miss a scheduled appointment for my next extended-release naltrexone injection, I understand that I should reschedule the appointment as soon as possible because it is important to receive the medication on time to reduce the risk of opioid overdose should I return to use. 8. If I come to the office intoxicated, I understand that my healthcare provider will not see me. 9. Violence, threatening language or behavior, or participation in any illegal activity at the office will result in treatment termination from the clinic. 10. I understand that random urine drug testing is a treatment requirement. If I do not provide a urine sample, it will count as a positive drug test. 11. I understand that initially I will have weekly office visits until my condition is stable. 12. I can be seen every 2 weeks in the office starting the second month of treatment if I have two negative urine drug tests in a row. 13. I may be seen less than every 2 weeks based on goals made by my healthcare provider and me. 14. I understand that people have died trying to overcome the naltrexone opioid blockade by taking large amounts of opioids. 15. I understand that treatment of opioid use disorder involves more than just taking medication. I agree to follow my healthcare provider's recommendations for additional counseling and/or for help with other problems. 16. I understand that there is no fixed time for being on naltrexone and that the goal of treatment is for me to stop using all illicit drugs and become successful in all aspects of my life. 17.

Risk of opioid overdose Patients may be more sensitive to the effects of lower amounts of opioids: Patients should tell their family and people close to them about the increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose even when using lower doses of opioids or amounts that they used before treatment. Using large amounts of opioids, such as prescription pain pills or heroin, to overcome effects of VIVITROL can lead to serious injury, coma, and death. Risk of severe reactions at the injection site Remind patients of these possible symptoms at the injection site: Some of these injection site reactions have required surgery. Tell your patients to contact a healthcare provider if they have any reactions at the injection site. Risk of liver injury, including liver damage or hepatitis Remind patients of the possible symptoms of liver damage or hepatitis. Patients may not feel the therapeutic effects of opioid-containing medicines for pain, cough or cold, or diarrhea while taking VIVITROL. Patients should carry written information with them at all times to alert healthcare providers that they are taking VIVITROL, so they can be treated properly in an emergency.

Use the 2-inch needle for patients who have more subcuta- neous adipose tissue. Use the 1.5-inch needle for patients with less subcutaneous adipose tissue. Either needle is appropriate for use with patients who have average amounts of subcutaneous adipose tissue. Use aseptic technique when administering intramuscularly. Using a circular motion, clean the injection site with an alcohol swab. Let the area dry before administering the injection. Do not touch this area again before administration. Use proper deep intramuscular injection technique into the gluteal muscle. XR-NTX must not be injected intravenously, subcutaneously, or into adipose tissue. Accidental subcutaneous injection may increase the risk of severe injection site reactions. Administer the suspension by deep intramuscular injection into the upper outer quadrant of gluteal muscle, alternating buttocks per monthly injection. Remember to aspirate for blood before injection. If blood aspirates or the needle clogs, do not inject. Change to the spare needle provided in the package and administer into an adjacent site in the same gluteal region, again aspirating for blood before injection. Inject the suspension in a smooth, continuous motion. A patient counseling tool is available to help you counsel your patients before administration about the serious risks associated with XR-NTX. The above information is a selection of key safety information about the XR-NTX injection. For complete safety information, refer to the directions for use and the prescribing information provided in the medication kit.

Buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone formulations are effective treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD). Numerous clinical studies and randomized clinical trials have demonstrated buprenorphine's efficacy in retaining patients in treatment and reducing illicit opioid use compared with treatment without medication and medically supervised withdrawal.216,217,218 Other research has associated it with reduction in HIV risk behavior and risk of overdose death, and its effectiveness has been shown in primary care settings.219,220,221,222,223 Buprenorphine is on the World Health Organization (WHO) list of essential medications.224 The Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) expert panel recommends offering the option of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved buprenorphine formulations to appropriate patients with OUD, considering patient preferences for and experience with other medications or no medication. These recommendations align with recent Department of Veterans Affairs guidelines.225 Formulations History of Approvals FDA originally approved buprenorphine for analgesia. Formulations for OUD treatment facturer discontinued the tablet formulations of both from the U.S. market after the film's approval, but generic tablet formulations are still available (Exhibit Chapter generic buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone formulations based on evidence that they produce similar (within 90 percent confidence intervals) bioequivalence on pharmacokinetic measures, such as peak serum concentration, compared with the original sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone product. The 2013 and 2014 branded formulations have greater bioavailability than Suboxone, meaning they deliver more buprenorphine to the bloodstream, thus achieving the same effect as the original product with lower doses. For example, 5.7 mg/1.4 mg of Zubsolv and 4.2 mg/0.7 mg of Bunavail provide the same buprenorphine exposure as 8 mg/2 mg of Suboxone. Opioid treatment programs (OTPs) may administer or dispense buprenorphine, but only providers with Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) waivers can prescribe buprenorphine for OUD. See \"Resource Alert: How To Obtain a Waiver To Prescribe Buprenorphine\" in Chapter 3A of this TIP.3-52Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Exhibit 3D.1 lists product strengths and recom- mended once-daily maintenance doses. For simplicity, dosing information here refers to sublingual Suboxone or generic equivalents. An 8 mg/2 mg dosage of sublingual Suboxone is equivalent to 5.7 mg/1.4 mg of sublingual Zubsolv and 4.2 mg/0.7 mg of buccal Bunavail. Patients who switch formulations may experience clinically significant plasma concentration changes that may require dose adjustments; bioavail- ability is similar, but not identical, between formulations.Implants In 2016, FDA approved buprenorphine implants for OUD maintenance treatment in patients who have achieved sustained clinical stability (e.g., periods of abstinence, minimal or no desire to use illicit opioids, stable housing, social support) while taking no more than 8 mg of Suboxone or generic equivalents. The implants are a set of four rods, each 2.5 mm in diameter and 26 mm in length. Each rod contains the equivalent of 80 mg of buprenor - phine hydrochloride. The implants are for EXHIBIT 3D.1.

The implants must be removed after 6 months. Peak buprenorphine plasma concentrations occur 12 hours after implant insertion, slowly decrease, and reach steady-state concentrations in about 4 weeks. Steady-state concentrations are comparable to trough buprenorphine plasma levels produced by daily sublingual buprenor - phine doses of 8 mg or less. Implant effective- ness lasts up to 6 months. Injectables In November 2017, FDA approved extended- release (monthly) subcutaneous injectable buprenorphine for moderate-to-severe OUD treatment among patients who initiated treatment with transmucosal buprenorphine, followed by at least 7 days of dose adjustment. It is available in two doses, 300 mg/1.5 mL and 100 mg/0.5 mL. Both are stored refrigerated in prefilled syringes with safety needles and administered by subcutaneous injection in the abdomen. The first two monthly doses recom- mended are 300 mg each followed by a 100 mg monthly maintenance dose. Peak buprenorphine concentrations occur about 24 hours after the injection. Steady state is achieved after 4 to 6 months. After discontinuation, patients may have detectable plasma levels of buprenorphine for 12 months or longer. Duration of detection in urine is not known.240 Pharmacology Buprenorphine, an opioid receptor partial agonist, is a schedule III controlled medication derived from the opium alkaloid thebaine. Through cross-tolerance and mu-opioid receptor occupancy, at adequate doses, buprenorphine reduces opioid withdrawal and craving and blunts the effects of illicit opioids. Buprenorphine binds tightly to the mu-opioid receptor because of its particularly high receptor affinity. This prevents other opioids with lower affinity (e.g., heroin) from binding. The net result is a blunting or blocking of the euphoria, respiratory depression, and other effects of these opioids. Buprenorphine has less potential to cause respiratory depression, given its ceiling effect. As a partial agonist, buprenorphine's maximum effect on respiratory depression is more limited than full agonists. Once reaching a moderate dose, its effects no longer increase if the dose is increased.241,242,243 There is wide individual variability in bu- prenorphine pharmacokinetics. For example, the mean time to maximum plasma buprenor - phine concentration after a single sublingual dose ranges from 40 minutes to 3.5 hours.244 Thus, after providing the first dose of buprenor - phine, wait at least 2 hours to decide whether a second dose is necessary. Buprenorphine has a long elimination half-life, which varies from 24 to 69 hours245 with a mean half-life of 24 to 42 hours.246 It dissociates slowly from the receptor. Buprenorphine can be safely dosed (even at double the stabilized dose) less than daily.247 For example, a patient stabilized on 12 mg of buprenorphine/naloxone daily can be treated with 24 mg every other day or 24 mg on Monday/Wednesday and 36 mg on Friday. Such schedules reduce travel burden for patients who need or want supervised dosing at an OTP or a clinic. Such schedules may also be useful for patients who must spend weekends in jails that disallow buprenorphine dosing. Bioavailability Buprenorphine has bioavailability. Naloxone, oral, sublingual, and buccal bioavailability but is absorbed when injected or snorted. The addition of naloxone decreases buprenorphine's potential for misuse. In the Suboxone formu- lation of buprenorphine/naloxone, the ratio of 3-54Medications for Use Disorder TIP 63 buprenorphine to naloxone is 4:1. The ratio of buprenorphine to naloxone varies across products, as the absorption of both active ingre- dients is different for buccal versus sublingual films versus tablets. Buprenorphine/naloxone transmucosal products are abuse-deterrent formulations, although they can still be misused. When a patient takes these formulations as prescribed, he or she absorbs buprenorphine but only a biologically negligible amount of naloxone. But if crushed or dissolved for intranasal or intravenous (IV) misuse, both medications are bioavailable. Naloxone then blunts the immediate opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine. It also induces opioid withdrawal in people who are physically dependent on opioids. This reduces misuse liability compared with transmucosal formulations with buprenorphine alone.248,249 Subdermal buprenorphine implants release bu- prenorphine in steady concentrations over 6 months. These concentrations are approximately equivalent to 8 mg or less of the buprenorphine sublingual formulations. Once implanted, these rods are unlikely to be diverted. Extended-release buprenorphine for subcuta- neous injection releases buprenorphine over at least a 1-month period. After injection, an initial buprenorphine plasma level peaks around 24 hours and then slowly declines to a plateau. With monthly injections, steady state is reached at 4 to 6 months.250 Metabolism and Excretion Buprenorphine:251,252 Is highly plasma bound. Crosses the blood-brain barrier readily because of its high lipid solubility. Is excreted in urine and feces. Has only one known pharmacologically active metabolite: norbuprenorphine.Be aware of potential CYP450 3A4 inducers,253 substrates, and inhibitors while monitoring for potential drug-drug interactions (see the \"Drug Interactions\" section below). Buprenorphine undergoes metabolism in the liver primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 3A4 enzymes. Coadministration of other medications metabolized along this pathway can affect the rate of buprenorphine metabolism. Buprenorphine has fewer clinically relevant drug interactions than methadone in general. For detailed explanations of metabolism and excretion, see the package inserts for each buprenorphine product. Dosing Considerations Buprenorphine is used for the treatment of OUD. Formulations are available as sublingual tablets and film, buccal film, implants, and extended- release injection (Exhibit 3A.5 in Chapter 3A of this TIP). Contraindications Buprenorphine is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to it. Patients with true allergic reactions to naloxone should not be treated with the combination buprenorphine/naloxone product. Allergy to naloxone is infrequent. Some patients may falsely or mistakenly claim an allergy to naloxone and request buprenorphine monoproduct. Carefully assess such claims and explain the differences between an allergic reaction and symptoms of opioid withdrawal precipitated by buprenorphine or naloxone; the monoproduct has more abuse liability than buprenorphine/naloxone.254 Precautions and Warnings Respiratory depression and overdoses are uncommon in adults, but they do happen.255 Most fatal overdoses involve IV buprenorphine misuse or concurrent central nervous system depressant use, including high doses of benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other 3-55 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder EXHIBIT 3D.2. Medication Management for Patients With Respiratory or Hepatic Impairment CONTRAINDICATION/CAUTION MANAGEMENT Compromised respiratory function For example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia (abnormally elevated blood levels of carbon dioxide), preexisting respiratory depression. Prescribe with caution; monitor closely. Warn patients about the risk of using benzodiazepines or other depressants while taking buprenorphine.263 Support patients in their attempts to discontinue tobacco use. Hepatic impairment Buprenorphine and naloxone are extensively metabolized by the liver. Moderate-to-severe impairment results in decreased clearance, increased overall exposure to both medications, and higher risk of buprenorphine toxicity and precipitated withdrawal from naloxone. These effects have not been observed in patients with mild hepatic impairment.261,262 Mild impairment (Child-Pugh score of 5-6):264 No dose adjustment needed. Moderate impairment (Child-Pugh score of 7-9):265 Combination products are not recommended; they may precipitate withdrawal. *Use combination products cautiously for maintenance treatment in patients who've been inducted with a monoproduct;266,267 monitor for signs and symptoms of buprenorphine toxicity or overdose.268 Naloxone may interfere with buprenorphine's efficacy.269,270 Severe impairment (Child-Pugh score of 10-15):271 Do not use the combination product.272 For monoproduct, consider halving the starting and titration doses used in patients with normal liver function; monitor for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased buprenorphine levels.273 *Moderate-to-severe impairment results in much more reduced clearance of naloxone than of buprenorphine. Nasser et al.274 found that moderate impairment doubled or tripled exposure (compared with subjects with no or mild impairment) for both medications. In subjects with severe impairment, buprenorphine exposure was also two to three times higher; naloxone exposure increased more than tenfold. Adapted from material in the public domain.275sedatives.256,257 However, fatal overdoses have been reported in opioid-na\u00efve patients treated with 2 mg buprenorphine for pain.258 Exhibit 3D.2 summarizes the management of patients with preexisting respiratory impairment. Unintentional pediatric exposure can be life threatening or fatal.259 Thus, emphasize safe storage of medication, and teach patients to remove any buprenorphine found in a child's mouth immediately (even if it was only a partial tablet or film). Call 9-1-1 so the child can go to the nearest emergency department for immediate medical attention. Cases of hepatitis and liver failure exist but often involve predisposing hepatic risk factors, such as preexisting liver enzyme abnormalities, hepatitis B or C infections, and use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs or IV drugs. A multisite randomized trial of hepatic effects in patients taking methadone or buprenorphine found no evidence of liver damage in the first 6 months of treatment. The authors concluded that prescribing these medications should not cause major concern for liver injury.260 Exhibit 3D.2 summarizes man - agement of patients with hepatic impairment.3-56Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Potential for misuse and diversion exists. People can misuse buprenorphine via intra- nasal or IV routes or divert it for others to misuse. Do not give early or multiple refills without careful assessment and monitoring suited to the patient's level of stability.276,277 Discourage misuse and diversion by: Requiring frequent office visits until patients are stable. Testing urine for buprenorphine and norbu- prenorphine or buprenorphine glucuronide (both metabolites of buprenorphine). Using other methods to ensure adequate adherence to the medication as pre- scribed, such as developing and adopting a diversion control plan (see Chapter 3E: Medical Management Strategies). Adrenal insufficiency has been reported with opioid use, most often after more than 1 month of buprenorphine maintenance.278 Patients will develop physical dependence on buprenorphine. Alert patients that they'll experience opioid withdrawal if they stop buprenorphine. Buprenorphine may affect cognition and psychomotor performance and can have sedating effects in some people (particularly those who've lost tolerance after a period of abstinence from opioids). Concurrent use of illicit drugs, other prescribed medications, or medical or psychiatric comorbidity can affect cognition and psychomotor performance. Urge patients to exercise caution in using heavy machinery and driving until they're sure that their abilities are not compromised.279 Allergic reactions have occurred in patients treated with buprenorphine, including rash, urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis. Buprenorphine can cause precipitated opioid withdrawal. It has weaker opioid agonist effects and stronger receptor affinity than full agonists (e.g., heroin, methadone). It can displace full agonists from receptors, precipitating opioid withdrawal.280 Factors affecting this possibility include: Current level of opioid physical depen- dence. The higher the level of physical dependence, the higher the likelihood of precipitating withdrawal.281 Ensuring that patients are in opioid withdrawal when initiating buprenorphine decreases this risk. Time since the last mu-opioid receptor full agonist dose. The longer the time since the last dose, the lower the likelihood of precipitated withdrawal.282 Dose of buprenorphine administered. The smaller the dose of buprenorphine, the less likely it is to precipitate withdrawal.283,284 Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) may occur in newborns of pregnant women who take buprenorphine. Women receiving opioid agonist therapy while pregnant should talk with their healthcare provider about NAS and how to reduce it. Not all babies born to women treated with opioid agonists require treatment for NAS. Research has shown that the dose of opioid agonist medication is not reliably related to the severity of NAS.285,286,287 Thus, each woman should receive the dose of medication that best manages her illness. REDUCING NAS SEVERITY Offer the following advice to pregnant women receiving treatment with an opioid agonist: Avoid smoking during pregnancy. Avoid benzodiazepines. Meet with the neonatologist and/or pediatrician to learn how the hospital assesses and treats NAS and what they suggest you can do as a parent to help soothe a baby with NAS. Request rooming-in with the child. Talk with the healthcare professional providing obstetric care about breastfeeding, as this may help make NAS less severe. In the first week after birth, keeping lights low, speaking softly, avoiding too much stimulation, and providing frequent skin-to-skin contact can help prevent or limit symptoms of NAS.3-57 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Drug Interactions Buprenorphine has fewer documented clinically significant drug interactions than methadone.288 Monitoring is still needed for patients who are starting or stopping medi- cations that are CYP450 3A4 enzyme inhibitors or inducers or that compete with buprenorphine for this enzyme. A previously therapeutic and stable dose of either buprenorphine or the coadministered medication may be altered when one of these medications is started or stopped. In the case of buprenorphine, oversedation or withdrawal symptoms may result. In the case of altered levels of other pharmacotherapies, the patient may experience a lack of therapeutic benefit or toxic side effects of that drug. Special attention should be paid to patients using or starting depot formulations of buprenorphine. Prior to initiating a depot formulation, talk with the patient about waiting until any time-limited therapy with a potential inhibitor, inducer, or substrate of CYP450 3A4 is complete, and ensure that adherence to any such medications needed chronically is good. Make sure the patient fully understands the possible risk of fluc- tuations in buprenorphine serum levels resulting in sedation or withdrawal symptoms and if com- pliance with an inhibitor, inducer, or substrate of CYP450 3A4 is erratic. If an inhibitor, inducer, or substrate of CYP450 3A4 is to be started or stopped for a patient stable on a depot formu- lation of buprenorphine, the patient should be monitored closely for oversedation or signs of withdrawal. Remember, signs and symptoms may not appear until the new medication approaches a therapeutic blood level. Signs of withdrawal may be relieved, if necessary, with the short-term use of additional low doses of transmucosal buprenorphine. Patients who experience sedation may need to take safety precautions with some activities. In severe cases, removal of the depot formulation, if possible, may need to be considered.

More information on drug-drug interactions is available online (www.drugs.com /drug-interactions/buprenorphine-index.html ?filter=3&generic_only=). Monitor responses to buprenorphine in patients taking nonnucleoside reverse tran- scriptase inhibitors. Changes in buprenorphine concentrations can be clinically significant.290 Combination antiretroviral therapy (atazana- vir/ritonavir) increases buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine serum concentrations.291 Case demonstrated signs of buprenorphine excess (sedation). Decreasing buprenorphine can improve this symptom.292 Other research has demonstrated no need to adjust the buprenorphine dose among patients taking atazanavir.293 For tuberculosis treatment, rifampin but not rifabutin may decrease buprenorphine concen- trations. Rifampin produced opioid withdrawal in 50 percent of research volunteers with opioid dependence.294 FDA warns of increased serotonin syndrome risk with prescription opioids, including bu- prenorphine. Serotonin syndrome can include: Changes in mental status. Fever. Tremor. Sweating. Dilated pupils. EXHIBIT 3D.4.

There are only a few case reports of serotonin syndrome with buprenorphine,310 but be aware of this possibility given the frequent treatment of mood disorders in patients with OUD. Side Effects Buprenorphine's side effects may be less intense than those of full agonists. Otherwise, they resemble those of other mu-opioid agonists. Possible side effects include the following (buprenorphine FDA labels list all potential side effects https://dailymed.nlm.nih .gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8a5edcf9 -828c-4f97-b671-268ab13a8ecd): Oral hypoesthesia (oral numbness) Constipation Glossodynia (tongue Oral mucosal erythema Vomiting Intoxication Disturbance in attention Palpitations Insomnia Opioid withdrawal syndrome Excessive sweating Blurred vision Serious implant-related adverse events are uncommon but possible according to the FDA label (www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs /label/2016/204442Orig1s000lbl.pdf). Still, more than 10 percent of patients experience implant site pain, itching, or swelling. Migration beyond the local insertion site is rare but possible, as is nerve damage. Buprenorphine may be extruded from implants for potential misuse. Insert implants only in stable patients, for whom FDA has approved this formulation. Implants may extrude and potentially come out (e.g., from incomplete insertion or infection). Tell patients to call the implanting physician if an implant looks like it is extruding or comes out. If the implant comes out, patients should safely store and dispose of it (following local and federal regulations) to protect others from unintended exposure. Serious injection site adverse events for the extended-release formulation are uncommon but possible. The most common injection site adverse reactions were pain (7.2 percent), pruritus (6.6 percent), and erythema (4.7 percent) in phase three trials. Two cases of surgical removal of the monthly depot were reported in premarketing clinical studies. Surgical excision under local anesthesia within 14 days of injection is possible. It is recommended that, before treatment, baseline liver function tests be assessed with monthly monitoring during treatment, particularly with the 300 mg dose. There are limited data regarding use of the extended-release injection formulation in pregnant women with OUD. In animal repro- ductive studies with Sublocade's excipient, N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone, there were reported fetal adverse reactions. Women should be advised that the use of Sublocade during pregnancy should be considered only if the benefits outweigh the risks (see FDA package insert for full details www.accessdata.fda.gov /drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/209819s000lbl.pdf). Assessment No evidence clearly predicts which patients are best matched to buprenorphine versus other OUD medications. Thorough assess- ment helps determine whether buprenorphine treatment is appropriate for a patient. (Part 2 of this TIP covers screening and assessment in more detail.) Before prescribing buprenorphine: Check the state prescription drug monitoring program database. Assess the patient's history. Conduct a medical, psychiatric, substance use, and substance use treatment history. Assess recent opioid use, including frequency, quantity, type, route, and last day of use.3-61 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Establish OUD diagnosis. Assess for other substance use disorders (SUDs), including those involving alcohol, benzodiazepines, or stimulants. Conduct a focused physical examination, refer for a physical exam, or get a record of a recent one. Assess for signs and symptoms of intoxi- cation. Do not give a first dose to a patient who is sedated or intoxicated. Assess and treat him or her appropriately. Assess for evidence of opioid with- drawal and physiological dependence. The Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) or the Clinical Institute Narcotic Assessment (CINA) Scale for Withdrawal Symptoms can be used to assess withdrawal signs (see \"Resource Alert: Opioid Withdrawal Scales\"). The patient should exhibit signs of opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of buprenor - phine to avoid precipitated withdrawal. For example, the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for buprenor - phine indicates that a COWS score of 12 or higher is typically adequate for a first dose. Confirming opioid withdrawal suggests that the patient is physically dependent on opioids and can begin induction with a typical 2 mg/0.5 mg or 4 mg/1 mg bu- prenorphine/naloxone dose. Obtain laboratory tests. Conduct drug and alcohol tests. Use reliable urine tests for opioids (including morphine, methadone, buprenorphine, and oxycodone), benzodiazepines, cocaine, and other drugs commonly used in the area. Use a breathalyzer to estimate the patient's blood alcohol content. Do not provide buprenorphine until the alcohol reading is considerably below the legal level of alcohol intoxication. Conduct a pregnancy test. Transmucosal buprenorphine or methadone maintenance treatment is recommended for OUD in pregnancy.311 There are limited data regarding use in pregnant women with OUD with the buprenorphine implants and with the extended-release injection for - mulation. If buprenorphine is used during pregnancy, it should generally be trans- mucosal monoproduct.312 Refer pregnant patients to prenatal care. Assess liver function. If possible, obtain liver function tests, but do not wait for results before starting transmucosal buprenorphine treatment. A patient with chronic hepatitis can receive OUD treatment with buprenorphine. Discuss risks and benefits if the patient's liver enzymes are at or above five times the normal level and monitor liver function during treatment. Patients with transam- inase levels less than five times normal levels, including patients with hepatitis C virus, appear to tolerate buprenor - phine well.313,314 Exhibit 3D.2 gives more information about hepatic impairment and buprenorphine. Liver function tests should be obtained and reviewed before initiating buprenorphine implants or extended-release buprenorphine because these formulations are long acting. RESOURCE ALERT Opioid Withdrawal Scales The COWS and other opioid withdrawal scales can be downloaded from Annex 10 of WHO's Guidelines for the Psychosocially Assisted Pharmacological Treatment of Opioid Dependence from the National Center for Biotechnology Information website (www.ncbi .nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143183). The CINA Scale for Withdrawal Symptoms is online (www.ncpoep.org/wp -content/uploads/2015/02/Appendix_7_Clinical _Institute_Narcotic_Assessment_CINA_Scale _for_Withdrawal_Symptoms.pdf ).3-62Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Use language and written materials appropriate to each patient's comprehension level to ensure that he or she understands the options and can make informed decisions. Conduct hepatitis and HIV tests. Hepatitis B and C are common among patients entering buprenorphine treatment. HIV infection is also prevalent. Everyone ages 15 to 65 should be tested at least once for HIV. Persons at higher risk, such as people who use drugs by injection, should be tested annually.315 Anyone who is injecting or has ever injected drugs, even once, no matter how long ago, should be tested for hepatitis C, regardless of their intention to seek treatment for SUD.316 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hepatitis B vaccination for individuals seeking treatment for SUDs.317 Patient Selection No evidence clearly predicts which patients are best treated with buprenorphine versus other OUD medications. Inform all patients with OUD about treatment with transmucosal buprenorphine and where it's available. (See \"Treatment Planning or Referral\" in Part 2 of this TIP for more on shared decision making.) Patients who responded well to buprenorphine in the past should be considered for this treatment. Prior use of diverted buprenorphine doesn't rule out OUD treatment with buprenorphine. Diverted buprenorphine is often associated with an inability to access treatment,318 and it's often used to self-treat opioid withdrawal rather than to \"get high.\"319,320 Unsuccessful treatment experiences with buprenorphine in the past do not necessarily indicate that buprenorphine will be ineffective again. Motivation and circumstances change over time. Also, treatment varies by provider, clinic, and setting, as it does for other medical illnesses. Records from previous providers can contextualize the extent of past treatment. Pregnant women should be considered for transmucosal buprenorphine treatment.Stable patients are the best candidates for buprenorphine implants. Implants are indicated for patients who have already achieved illicit opioid abstinence and clinical stability while taking transmucosal buprenorphine for at least 90 days. Their current dose should be 8 mg/ day or less.321 There is no absolute definition of clinical stability, but per the implant package insert, patients may be stable if they are:322 Abstaining currently from illicit opioids. Having little or no craving for illicit opioids. Living in a stable environment. Participating in a structured job or activity. Engaging in a positive social support system. Lacking recent hospitalizations, emergency department visits, or crisis interventions for substance use or mental illness. Adhering to clinic appointments and other aspects of treatment and recovery plans. Informed Consent Inform all patients of: Their OUD diagnosis and the nature of the disorder. Risks and benefits of all available medications for OUD. Risks and benefits of nonmedication treatments. Educate patients about basic buprenorphine pharmacology and induction expectations (Exhibit 3D.5). They should understand the need to be in opioid withdrawal that's visible to the Do not taper patients to 8 mg daily solely to switch them to implants.3-63 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder prescriber (or, for home induction, that meets predefined self-assessment criteria) to avoid precipitated withdrawal. Initiating Buprenorphine Treatment It can be helpful to use a buprenorphine treatment agreement for patients treated in office-based settings (see Chapter 3D Appendix for a sample treatment agreement). Induction can occur in the office or at home. Most clinical trials were conducted with office- based induction, and extant guidance recom- mends this approach.323 However, office-based induction can be a tion. Home induction is increasingly common.324 Office-Based Induction perform office-based induction by ordering and storing induction doses in the office or by prescribing medication and instruct- ing patients to bring it to the office on the day of induction. Office-based induction allows providers to: Ensure that patients know how to take medication without swallowing or spitting it out if they have too much saliva or experience unpleasant tastes. Tell them to wait to eat or drink until the medication is totally dissolved. Enhance the therapeutic relationship. Verify the presence of opioid withdrawal and absence of precipitated opioid withdrawal. Ensure the lack of sedation 1 to 2 hours after the first dose in patients taking sedatives. Use time between doses for patient self- assessment. See the Chapter 3D Appendix for sample goal-setting forms that help patients identify treatment goals and triggers for use. Home Induction Home induction can be safe and effective.325 Retention rates are similar to office inductions,326 but no comparison data from large randomized EXHIBIT 3D.5. Key Points of Patient Education for Buprenorphine Before starting OUD treatment with buprenorphine, patients should: Tell providers the prescribed and over-the- counter medications they take to allow drug interaction assessment. Understand the goal of the first week of treatment: To improve withdrawal symptoms without oversedation. Tell providers if they feel sedated or euphoric within 1 to 4 hours after their dose. Be given the appropriate buprenorphine medication guide. Know possible -Vomiting. -Sweating. -Constipation. -Sexual dysfunction. Agree to store medication securely and out of the reach of others. Alert providers if they discontinue medications, start new ones, or change their medication dose. Understand that discontinuing buprenorphine increases risk of overdose death upon return to illicit opioid use. Know that use of alcohol or benzodiazepines with buprenorphine increases the risk of overdose and death. Understand the importance of informing providers if they become pregnant. Tell providers if they are having a procedure that may require pain medication. Be aware of resources through which to obtain further education for: -Themselves: Decisions in Recovery: Treatment for friends: Medication- Assisted Treatment ( https://portal. ct.gov/DMHAS/Programs-and-Services/ Opioid-Treatment/Medication-Assisted- Treatment)3-64Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Advise patients to abstain from tobacco before dosing. Many patients with OUD use tobacco products. Nicotine causes vasoconstriction, decreasing the surface area of blood vessels that absorb buprenorphine.controlled studies exist. The American Society of Addiction Medicine National Practice Guideline recommends home induction only if the patient or prescriber has experience with using buprenor - phine.327,328 Clinical experience indicates that patients suitable for home induction: Can describe, understand, and rate withdrawal. Can understand induction dosing instructions. Can and will contact their provider about problems. Educate patients about how to assess their withdrawal, when to start the first dose, how to take the medication properly, and how to manage withdrawal on induction day. Instruct patients to take their first dose when they expe- rience opioid withdrawal at least 12 hours after last use of heroin or a short-acting prescription opioid. Effectively switching from methadone to buprenorphine can be challenging. This should generally be started with office-based induction. Consult with a medical expert knowledgeable about methadone in these situations until experi- ence is gained. Withdrawal can include: Goose bumps. Nausea. Abdominal cramps. Running nose. Tearing. Yawning. Be available for phone consultation during the induction period and for an in-office evalua- tion should the need arise. See patients in the office within approximately 7 days of the start of home induction. (See the Chapter 3D Appendix for a sample buprenorphine/naloxone home dosage schedule.) Induction Patients who are currently physically dependent on opioids Patients should begin buprenorphine when they are exhibiting clear signs of opioid withdrawal. Induction typically starts with a 2 mg to 4 mg dose of buprenorphine or a 2 mg/0.5 mg to 4 mg/1 mg dose of buprenor - phine/naloxone.329 Depending on the formula- tion used and whether a given patient has a dry mouth, the dose can take between 3 and 10 minutes to dissolve fully. After approximately 2 hours, an additional 2 mg to 4 mg dose of buprenorphine/naloxone can be given if there is continued withdrawal and lack of sedation. Always individualize dosing. The FDA label recommends a maximum buprenorphine/ naloxone dose of 8 mg on Day 1 and 16 mg on Day 2.330 When dosing outside of FDA recom- mendations, document the clinical rationale, including risks and benefits. Remember that some patients stabilize on lower doses. If patients experience sedation upon first dose, stop and reevaluate the following: Did they recently take other sedating medications (e.g., benzodiazepines)? Have they recently been in a controlled envi- ronment, such as a hospital, jail, or residential drug treatment facility? Was the history of recency and amount of opioid use inaccurate? Was the heroin used of poor quality? Was their use mostly of low-potency opioids (e.g., codeine)? Consider whether a dose decrease, change in treatment plan, or both are necessary. If induction is still indicated, adjust the dose 3-65 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder more slowly as needed to minimize sedation. The dose can be adjusted on subsequent days to address continued withdrawal or uncontrollable craving if the patient is not sedated. Patients with a history of OUD who are not currently physically dependent on opioids Buprenorphine induction can be appropriate for certain patients with a history of opioid addiction at high risk for return to use of opioids but not currently dependent on them. This includes patients who've been incarcerated or in other controlled environments.331 Before starting treatment, discuss risks and benefits of buprenorphine and other medications (including extended-release naltrexone [XR-NXT]). Buprenorphine doses should begin at lower- than-usual levels (e.g., 1 mg). They should be increased more slowly than in tolerant patients to avoid oversedation and possible overdose. Take particular care with patients who are being treated with other central nervous system depressant medications.332 At the beginning of treatment, directly administer doses in an OTP or in the office. This will allow patients to be observed for sedation after dosing and will reduce the risk that patients take more medication than prescribed. In one study, research participants not currently physically dependent on opioids but with a history of OUD were started on 1 mg buprenor - phine with weekly 1 mg dose increases to 4 mg, followed by 2 mg weekly increases to 8 mg. Most patients tolerated this dose induction, and the mean daily dose exceeded 8 mg per day by the fifth week, when the planned dose was 6 mg.333 As with all opioid agonist treatment, dosing should be individualized and based on careful patient assessment during treatment. Patients who are currently taking methadone Some patients who take methadone may wish to switch to buprenorphine treatment for a variety of reasons. This often requires methadone dose reduction before switching medications, which may increase the risk of return to opioid use. Exercise caution with this approach and thoroughly discuss the risks and benefits with the patients before embarking on the change in medication. Experienced prescribers should conduct this procedure in the office, not via home induction. The lower the methadone dose and the longer it's been since the last dose, the easier the transition. Before initiating buprenorphine, carefully taper methadone to lower the risk of return to illicit opioid use during transition. Patients who take methadone for OUD should taper to 30 mg to 40 mg methadone per day and remain on that dose for at least 1 week before starting buprenorphine.334 With patients' permission, OTPs can confirm the time and amount of patients' last methadone dose. Do not start buprenorphine until the patient manifests signs of opioid withdrawal. At least 24 hours should pass between the last dose of methadone and the first dose of buprenorphine. Waiting 36 hours or more reduces risk of pre- cipitated withdrawal. Lower doses of buprenor - phine/naloxone are less likely to precipitate methadone withdrawal.335 For example, once opioid withdrawal is verified, an initial dose of 2 mg/0.5 mg can be given. If patients continue to have unrelieved opioid withdrawal after the first 2 mg dose, administer another 2 mg/0.5 mg dose approximately every 2 hours as needed (holding for sedation). Induction should be conducted slowly; consider palliating unrelieved withdrawal with nonopioid therapies for the first few days of transition to buprenorphine. Be alert to any increase in withdrawal symptoms, as this may suggest precipitated withdrawal. Dose Stabilization Stabilization occurs when there is evidence of: Markedly reduced or eliminated illicit opioid use. Reduced craving.3-66Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Suppression of opioid withdrawal. Minimal side effects. Patient-reported blunted or blocked euphoria during illicit opioid use. Remind patients to take their dose once daily rather than splitting it. Document reduced illicit drug use via patient self-report and urine drug testing. Consecutive negative urine test results suggest a positive prognosis. Continue monitoring dose effectiveness during early stabilization. Dose adjust- ments may still be necessary (Exhibit 3D.6). EXHIBIT 3D.6. Adjusting the Buprenorphine Dose When to increase the dose: Are patients taking medication correctly and as scheduled? -If they take at least 16 mg per day, mu-opioid receptors are approximately 80 to 95 percent occupied.336 -If there are adherence problems, assess causes and intervene to promote adherence and proper administration (e.g., offer supervised dosing at the clinic, by a network support, at a pharmacy). -If patients are taking doses correctly, a dose increase may be indicated, if certain conditions exist. Are patients taking other medications that may interfere with buprenorphine metabolism? If patients are taking doses properly, increase the dose if they still have opioid withdrawal (document with a clinical tool like COWS), opioid craving, or \"good\" effects (e.g., feeling \"high\") from using illicit opioids. -Craving can be a conditioned response. It may not decrease with dose increases if patients spend time with people who use opioids in their presence. -Dose increases typically occur in 2 mg to 4 mg increments. -It will take about 5 to 7 days to reach steady-state plasma concentrations after a dose increase. -Offer psychosocial referrals to help decrease and manage cravings. Determine whether nonpharmacological problems are contributing to the need for increase. -For example, do patients show signs and symptoms of untreated major depressive or generalized anxiety disorders? Are they living in a chaotic household? Do they have childcare problems or financial difficulties? Are they experiencing trauma or trauma-related mental disorders? -Address or refer to counseling to address these problems. When to decrease the dose: Decrease the dose when there is evidence of dose toxicity (i.e., sedation or, rarely, clearly linked clinically relevant increases in liver function tests). Hold the dose when there is acute alcohol or benzodiazepine intoxication.Buprenorphine treatment should substantially reduce opioid cravings. See Chapter 3E: Medical Management Strategies for detailed information on the management of patients taking buprenor - phine in office-based treatment settings. Once patients have stabilized, continue to screen and evaluate for mental disorders and psychosocial problems that may need to be addressed (e.g., having a spouse or cohabitant who is using illicit opioids). Support patients' engagement in prosocial activities and progress toward treatment goals and recovery as they decrease use of illicit substances.3-67 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Offer referrals for adjunctive counseling and recovery support services as needed. It may not be possible to eliminate opioid craving completely, regardless of the dose. Counseling can help patients reduce and manage craving. A more important measure of dose adequacy than craving is whether patients report that the feeling of euphoria associated with self- administered illicit opioids is blunted or blocked. Patients who were not interested in adjunc- tive addiction or mental health counseling during induction may become receptive to it when they are feeling more stable. Be cautious when increasing doses above 24 mg/6 mg per day. Nearly all patients stabilize on daily doses of 4 mg/1 mg to 24 mg/6 mg. Very limited data show additional benefits of doses higher than the FDA label's recommended maximum of 24 mg/6 mg.337 Carefully document clinical justification for higher doses and always have a diversion control plan in place. Doses above 24 mg/6 mg a day may unintentionally heighten diversion risk. Patients not responding to high doses of buprenorphine at the upper limit approved by FDA should be considered for methadone treatment. Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Practitioners should become familiar with the FDA-approved REMS for buprenorphine. It provides useful information and checklists for providers. REMS can be Chapter 3D Appendix. Transmucosal Buprenorphine Dosing Summary Induction and stabilization The goal is to reduce or eliminate opioid with- drawal and craving without causing sedation: Induction and stabilization strategies can vary based on patient variables and use of short- versus long-acting opioids. For more discussion on induction models, see the Support System's Induction (http://pcssmat .org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Models -of-Buprenorphine-Induction.pdf). The combination buprenorphine/naloxone product is safe to use for induction for most patients. The buprenorphine monoproduct (without naloxone) has been recommended for the treatment of pregnant women338 because of the danger to the fetus of precipitated opioid withdrawal if the combination product were to be injected. Although there are some publica- tions with small sample sizes that indicate that the combination product appears to be safe in pregnancy,339,340 the safety data are insufficient at this time to recommend its use.341 This is an area of some uncertainty. An expert panel on the treatment of OUD in pregnancy was unable to agree whether pregnant women should be treated with the monoproduct or combination product.342 Prescribers should observe the patient taking the medication to ensure proper use, espe- cially if the patient is new to buprenorphine treatment. It can be helpful to do this peri- odically after induction, especially when the prescribed dose is not providing the expected benefit.3-68Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Before the first dose, the patient should be in opioid withdrawal (to avoid precipitated withdrawal). The first dose is typically 4 mg/1 mg (2 mg if withdrawal is from methadone). Repeat dose as needed for continuing with- drawal every 2 hours up to typically 8 mg on the first day. At the start of the next day, patients typically take the first day's total dose all at once: If necessary, an additional 2 mg to 4 mg can be given every 2 hours up to approximately a 16 mg total daily dose to treat continuing opioid withdrawal and craving on Day 2 or 3, barring sedation. The initial stabilization dose can often be achieved within the first several days of treatment. Maintenance Typical maintenance doses range from 4 mg/1 mg to 24 mg/6 mg per day. An effective main- tenance dose is the lowest dose that can: Eliminate withdrawal. Reduce or eliminate opioid craving. Reduce or stop illicit opioid use's desirable effects. Be well tolerated (e.g., not produce sedation). Duration of treatment Treatment should last for as long as patients benefit from treatment. Longer treatment length is associated with positive treatment outcomes. Initiation of Buprenorphine Implants Prescribers and implanters of buprenorphine implants require special certification to make this formulation available to their patients. In addition, implanters must get special training in the Probuphine REMS program to obtain certi- fication to implant and remove this formulation. After completing training, providers can order implants through a central pharmacy for delivery, along with an implant insertion kit that contains all necessary implant procedure materials except a local anesthetic. If the prescriber is not performing the procedure, the prescriber should ensure that the implanter has completed the required training. For more information, see the Probuphine REMS program webpage (https:// probuphinerems.com/). The prescriber and implanter/remover must record the number of implanted/removed rods and their serial numbers and location, the date of the implant, and who performed the procedure. The implanter should document implant and inspection procedures, as with any other standard procedure. Instruct patients to take the last transmu- cosal dose of buprenorphine 12 to 24 hours before insertion. Remind them to shower and thoroughly wash the nondominant arm, which is preferred for insertion. Implant procedure Subdermal insertion of the four rods takes less than 30 minutes. Local anesthetic (lidocaine) is typically used. The implant procedure includes the following steps: Provide education about what to expect during the procedure. Obtain appropriate consent form(s). Provide a local anesthetic (e.g., lidocaine). Using sterile procedures, make a single incision in the inner upper arm between the biceps and triceps muscles, about 8 cm to 10 cm from the medial epicondyle. Using a cannula and an obturator, insert rods serially, pivoting the cannula slightly after each rod insertion in the subdermal space so that the rods lie next to one another, nearly parallel in a fanlike pattern. After implantation, apply butterfly strips and a pressure bandage. Review wound care with the patient, and provide a copy of the instructions. Advise the patient not to drive or engage in heavy physical activity for approximately 24 hours.3-69 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Do not give the patient a prescription for transmucosal buprenorphine at this time. Wound care The patient should return within 1 week of the implant procedure for a wound care check. Check for signs of infection, trouble healing, or implant extrusion. The rods are subdermal, so they should remain palpable. Document that all four rods were palpated. Stabilization Maintain contact with patients after implant placement. Even among highly stable patients, return to illicit opioid use can occur. Explain the risk of unintentional overdose if patients return to illicit opioid or alcohol or benzodiazepine use while implants are in place. It is important to monitor the patient between implant placements. Schedule office visits no less than once a month for continued assessment of main- tenance of stability, manual palpation of the four implanted rods, and ongoing psychosocial support and counseling per the FDA label (www .accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016 /204442Orig1s000lbl.pdf). If the patient returns to illicit opioid use, consider whether adequate psychosocial treatment has been given. Consider transmucosal medication supplemen- tation if a patient with implants destabilizes and reports inadequate opioid blockade. In one study,343 17.9 percent of participants with buprenorphine implants needed supplemental sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone. Most required small doses, such as 2 mg/0.5 mg per day. Consider more frequent assessment and higher intensity of treatment for patients who continue using illicit opioids or other substances. Removal After 6 months, have a certified implanter remove them. Implantation of a second set of rods in the opposite arm can then occur. There is no experience with inserting additional implants into other sites or second insertion into a previously used arm. After one insertion in each arm, most patients should transition to a transmucosal buprenorphine-containing product for continued treatment. Patients should follow the same directions to prepare for implant removal as they did for insertion. The removal procedure may require stitches. Patients should visit the clinic for removal of stitches and wound assessment within 1 week of removal. Store and dispose of rods safely in accordance with local and federal regulations. Initiation of Buprenorphine Extended- Release Injection Healthcare settings and pharmacies need special certification to order and dispense extended-release injectable buprenorphine to ensure long-acting preparations are dispensed directly to healthcare providers for administra- tion and by healthcare providers to patients (see www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/rems/index .cfm?event=indvremsdetails.page&rems=376 for more details). Before initiating extended-release buprenor - phine treatment, patients with moderate- to-severe OUD should be stabilized on trans- mucosal buprenorphine (8 mg to 24 mg daily) for at least 7 days. Do not use in opioid-na\u00efve patients. Obtain liver function and pregnancy tests. Extended-release buprenorphine is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of the long-acting nature of this formu- lation. There are insufficient data on its use in pregnancy to recommend initiating this formula- tion during pregnancy. Inform patients that: The medication is only available in a restricted program (the Sublocade REMS Program) via specific pharmacies and healthcare providers, as intravenous self-injection by patients can cause death. After abdominal injection, a lump may be present at the injection site for a few weeks. It 3-70Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 will get gradually smaller. Patients should not rub or massage it or let belts or waistbands rub against it. Patients should tell their healthcare providers that they are being treated with this medication. Using alcohol, benzodiazepines, sleeping pills, antidepressants, or some other medications with extended-release buprenorphine can lead to drowsiness or overdose. The most common side effects are constipa- tion, headache, nausea, vomiting, increased liver enzymes, tiredness, and injection site itching or pain. Patients should inform their provider if they become pregnant during treatment with this formulation. They should have a risk/benefit discussion about continuing with this for - mulation given the limited safety data on its impact on the developing fetus. They should be informed that their newborn can have symptoms of opioid withdrawal at birth. Storage Follow package insert directions for medication storage under refrigeration. Keep at room temperature for at least 15 minutes before injection (discard if left at room temperature for more than 7 days). Administration Rotate the abdominal subcutaneous injection site with each injection, following the instructions in the package insert. Record the location of each injection in the medical record. Each of the first two monthly doses (with at least 26 days between doses) should be 300 mg. Subsequent monthly doses should be 100 mg. Some patients may benefit from increasing the maintenance dose to 300 mg monthly if they have tolerated the 100 mg dose but continue to use illicit opioids. Medical management Monitor patient progress and response to treatment during regular office visits and with periodic urine drug testing. Examine the injection site for reactions, infections, or evidence of attempts to remove the depot medication. If the medication is discontinued, the patient should continue to be seen and evaluated for several months for sustained progress in treatment and for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, which should be treated as clinically appropriate. Duration of Buprenorphine Treatment There is no known duration of therapy with buprenorphine (or methadone or XR-NTX) after which patients can stop medication and be certain not to return to illicit opioid use. Those who stay in treatment often abstain longer from illicit opioid use and show increasing clinical stability. Long-term treatment outcomes up to 8 years after buprenorphine treatment entry show lower illicit opioid use among those with more time on medication.344 Patients should take buprenorphine as long as they benefit from it and wish to continue. Successful Buprenorphine Treatment The goal of buprenorphine treatment is full remission from OUD. Maintaining illicit opioid abstinence is ideal, but imperfect abstinence does not preclude treatment benefits. Patients should do better in treatment than before treatment. If not, seek alternatives. Do not judge treatment progress and success on the amount of medication a patient needs or how long treatment is required. Rather, gauge treatment progress and success based Given the often-chronic nature of OUD and the potentially fatal consequences of unintended opioid overdose, it is critical that you base patients' length of time in treatment on their individual needs.3-71 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder on patients' achievement of specific goals that were agreed on in a shared decision-making and treatment planning process. Consider this analogy: A patient with poorly controlled diabetes was previously unable to work and was admitted to the hospital several times for diabetic ketoacidosis. When taking insulin regularly, the patient worked part time, had fewer hospitalizations for diabetic ketoaci- dosis despite a nondiabetic diet, and had lower (but still high) hemoglobin A1C. This patient's treatment with insulin is not a \"failure\" because perfect control and function were not restored, and the patient would not be discharged from care against his or her will. Dose Tapering and Buprenorphine Discontinuation Following short-term medically supervised withdrawal, patients frequently restart illicit opioid use.345 In contrast to short-term medically supervised withdrawal, dose tapering refers to gradually reducing the buprenorphine dose in patients who have been stabilized on the medi- cation for some time. Base decisions to decrease dose or stop buprenorphine on patients' circumstances and preferences. Successful dose reductions may be more likely when patients have sustained abstinence from opioids and other drugs, psychosocial support, housing, effective coping strategies, stable mental health, employment, and involvement in mutual-help programs or other meaningful activities.346 However, there is no guarantee that even patients with years of ab- stinence, full-time employment, stable housing, and psychosocial supports can remain abstinent after discontinuing buprenorphine. It is up to patients to decide whether to taper or eventually discontinue medication. Help them make informed choices by educating them about the process and fully including them in decision making. Invite them to reenter treatment if they believe they may return or have already returned to opioid use. Before beginning to taper the dose of med- ication, explore these considerations with patients: How have they responded to treatment so far? Are they in full remission from OUD? Do they have adequate mental and social supports to remain in remission and maintain recovery? Why do they want to taper? They may be motivated by inconvenience, expense, loss of insurance coverage, side effects, feelings of shame, pressure from family, and lack of recovery supports. Many of these reasons are not predictive of a successful outcome. What do they expect to be different after tapering or discontinuing buprenorphine? Do they understand the risks and benefits of dose decrease and discontinuation of buprenorphine? What strategies do they have for engaging family members and recovery supports to reduce the risk of return to illicit substance use? Do they grasp the risk of overdose associ- ated with a return to illicit opioid use? Do they have a safety plan? To reduce overdose risk after a return to use, plans should include: A prescription for naloxone or a naloxone kit. Instructions on recognizing and responding to an overdose. Information on naloxone use for family members and others in the patient's recovery support network. See the SAMHSA for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 If patients return to opioid use, it may be appropriate for them to restart buprenor - phine or switch to methadone or XR-NTX treatment. These options should be discussed with them. Have they thought about how they will feel if they attempt to taper off of medication but cannot do so? Convey to patients that the inability to taper is not a failure and that they should not be afraid or embarrassed to discuss stopping the taper. Document the discussion, patient education, and decision in the medical record. There is no ideal tapering protocol. Providers and patients should understand this before beginning a taper. Whether buprenorphine is ultimately discontinued, patients need additional psychosocial and recovery support during this time. Generally, taper occurs over several months to permit patients to acclimate to the lower dose and to reduce potential discomfort from opioid withdrawal and craving.For patients who wish to discontinue buprenorphine, national and international guidelines recommend gradual dose reductions and advice to patients that they can stop the taper at any time.347,348,349 Consider increased monitoring and proactive discussions about how to address and manage cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Taper protocols vary in duration and may include use of ancillary medication, such as clonidine, if needed (Exhibit 3A.2).350 Continue to monitor patients who successfully taper off buprenorphine completely. Establish a post-taper monitoring and support plan (see Chapter 3E for more information on medical management strategies). Continue to assess and monitor patients' progress and how they cope with stress and triggers to use. Discuss the role of XR-NTX in preventing return to opioid use after completing treatment with an opioid agonist (see Chapter 3C for more information on naltrexone).3-73 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Chapter 3D Appendix Buprenorphine Induction and Maintenance Appropriate Use Checklists Continued on next page3-74Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Available online (www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/rems/BTOD_2017-01-23_Appropriate_Use_Checklist.pdf).

Continued on next pageTREATMENT AGREEMENT I agree to accept the following treatment contract for buprenorphine office-based opioid addiction treatment: 1. The risks and benefits of buprenorphine treatment have been explained to me. 2. The risks and benefits of other treatment for opioid use disorder (including methadone, naltrexone, and nonmedication treatments) have been explained to me. 3. I will keep my medication in a safe, secure place away from children (for example, in a lockbox). My plan is to store it [describe where and how _____________________________________________________________________]. 4. I will take the medication exactly as my healthcare provider prescribes. If I want to change my medication dose, I will speak with my healthcare provider first. Taking more medication than my healthcare provider prescribes or taking it more than once daily as my healthcare provider prescribes is medication misuse and may result in supervised dosing at the clinic. Taking the medication by snorting or by injection is also medication misuse and may result in supervised dosing at the clinic, referral to a higher level of care, or change in medication based on my healthcare provider's evaluation. 5. I will be on time to my appointments and respectful to the office staff and other patients. 6. I will keep my healthcare provider informed of all my medications (including herbs and vitamins) and medical problems. 7. I agree not to obtain or take prescription opioid medications prescribed by any other healthcare provider without consulting my buprenorphine prescriber. 8. If I am going to have a medical procedure that will cause pain, I will let my healthcare provider know in advance so that my pain will be adequately treated. 9. If I miss an appointment or lose my medication, I understand that I will not get more medication until my next office visit. I may also have to start having supervised buprenorphine dosing. 10. If I come to the office intoxicated, I understand that my healthcare provider will not see me, and I will not receive more medication until the next office visit. I may also have to start having supervised buprenorphine dosing. 11. I understand that it's illegal to give away or sell my medication; this is diversion. If I do this, my treatment will no longer include unsupervised buprenorphine dosing and may require referral to a higher level of care, supervised dosing at the clinic, and/or a change in medication based on my healthcare provider's evaluation. 12. Violence, threatening language or behavior, or participation in any illegal activity at the office will result in treatment termination from the clinic. 13. I understand that random urine drug testing is a treatment requirement. If I do not provide a urine sample, it will count as a positive drug test. 14. I understand that I will be called at random times to bring my medication container into the office for a pill or film count. Missing medication doses could result in supervised dosing or referral to a higher level of care at this clinic or potentially at another treatment provider based on my individual needs. 15. I understand that initially I will have weekly office visits until I am stable. I will get a prescription for 7 days of medication at each visit. 16. I can be seen every 2 weeks in the office starting the second month of treatment if I have two negative urine drug tests in a row. I will then get a prescription for 14 days of medication at each visit. 17. I will go back to weekly visits if I have a positive drug test. I can go back to visits every 2 weeks when I have two negative drug tests in a row again. 18. I may be seen less than every 2 weeks based on goals made by my healthcare provider and me. 19. I understand that people have died by mixing buprenorphine with alcohol and other drugs like benzodiazepines (drugs like Valium, Klonopin, and Xanax).3-79 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder 20. I understand that treatment of opioid use disorder involves more than just taking medication. I agree to comply with my healthcare provider's recommendations for additional counseling and/or for help with other problems. 21. I understand that there is no fixed time for being on buprenorphine and that the goal of treatment is for me to stop using all illicit drugs and become successful in all aspects of my life. 22. I understand that I may experience opioid withdrawal symptoms when I stop taking buprenorphine. 23. I have been educated about the other two FDA-approved medications used for opioid dependence treatment, methadone and naltrexone. 24. I have been educated about the increased chance of pregnancy when stopping illicit opioid use and starting buprenorphine treatment and been informed about methods for preventing pregnancy. Other specific items unique to my treatment is adapted from the American Society of Addiction Medicine's Sample Treatment Agreement, which is updated periodically; the most current version of the agreement is available online (https://www.asam.org/docs /default-source/advocacy/sample-treatment-agreement30fa159472bc604ca5b7ff000030b21a.pdf?sfvrsn =bd4675c2_0).

It covers regulatory and administrative concerns specific to buprenorphine and naltrexone that affect medical management of patients in office settings. Management of patients taking medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) varies by setting. Whereas OBOT stabilizes patients on buprenorphine or naltrexone, providers focus on medication management and treatment of other substance use, medical comorbidities, and psychosocial needs. Treatment of comorbid conditions should be offered onsite or via referral and should be verified as having been received. Exhibit 3E.1 addresses use of terminology in this chapter. Patient Selection To assess patients' chances of success with standard office-based treatment, consider: Concurrent substance use disorder (SUD) involving alcohol or benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepine (illicit and prescription) and alcohol use are common in patients with OUD. This use presents clinical challenges, including increased risk of respiratory depression and unintentional overdose or death. Some patients may have taken appropriately pre - scribed benzodiazepines for years with limited or no evidence of misuse. For such patients, tapering benzodiazepines may be contrain - dicated and unrealistic. Others may require treatment for a benzodiazepine use disorder. (See Exhibit 3B.1 for strategies for assessing and managing patients in OUD treatment who have concurrent benzodiazepine use disorder.) Although concomitant use of buprenorphine with benzodiazepines increases the risk of an adverse reaction, including overdose death, opioid agonist treatment should not be denied to patients solely because they take benzodiazepines,353 because untreated OUD can pose a greater risk of morbidity and mortality. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises that careful medication man - agement by healthcare professionals can reduce risk (see www.fda.gov/Drugs/Drug Safety/ucm575307.htm for more information).EXHIBIT 3E.1. Key Terms In addition to the key terms defined in Exhibit 3.1 of this Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP), these terms appear in Chapter 3E: Psychosocial support: Ancillary services to enhance a patient's overall functioning and well-being, including recovery support services, case management, housing, employment, and educational services. Psychosocial treatment: Interventions that seek to enhance patient's social and mental functioning, including addiction counseling, contingency management, and mental health services.3-84Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Approaches to addressing concurrent benzo- diazepine use include: Get patients' permission to contact their benzodiazepine prescribers to confirm their histories. Speaking with close family members or friends (with patients' permis- sion) can also help in evaluating evidence of alcohol or benzodiazepine misuse (e.g., intoxication, accidents, withdrawal seizures). Make sure patients understand that combining buprenorphine with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other central nervous system depressants risks potential re- spiratory depression and unintentional overdose death.354 Overdose death with buprenorphine is most often associated with intravenous benzodiazepine and heavy alcohol use. For patients misusing benzodiazepines (e.g., taking in high doses, bingeing, using intravenously), the TIP expert panel recom- mends referral to higher intensity addiction treatment with medically supervised ben- zodiazepine withdrawal if available (e.g., intensive outpatient programs, residential treatment). Do not rule out concurrent use of buprenorphine or extended-release in- jectable naltrexone (XR-NTX) for treatment of OUD in more structured settings for these patients. For patients who are physically dependent on illicit benzodiazepines but do not inject or binge, a gradual outpatient medically supervised withdrawal can be attempted using long-acting benzodiazepines, under certain conditions that promote safety and reduce risk. These conditions may include: Requiring frequent office visits with ob- servation of patients taking medication. Having significant others monitor patients and report back to the office. Offering a short-duration prescription supply. Monitoring prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) reports more frequently. Conducting frequent urine tests. Using written treatment agreements outlining conditions for dual buprenor - phine and benzodiazepine prescriptions. Review patient progress regularly; adjust treatment plans as needed. Document treatment decisions, as research showing the effectiveness and safety of these approaches is lacking.355 Significant comorbid mental illness or suicidal or homicidal ideation. Patients who are actively suicidal, homicidal, severely depressed, or psychotic or who are having other significant psychiatric problems may need assessment and treatment by a mental health professional who can treat both the psychiatric comorbidity and the OUD. Depending on the severity, they may need higher levels of mental health services in a crisis center, emergency department, or inpatient setting. An addiction psychiatrist can treat such patients upon discharge. Significant medical comorbidity, including infections. Severe abscesses, endocarditis, or osteomyelitis from injecting drugs may require hospitalization. If hospitalization is necessary, buprenorphine can be initiated.356 Initiation of HIV and hepatitis C virus treatments do not contraindicate buprenorphine treatment.357 Patient Management and Treatment Monitoring Base management of OUD on a comprehen- sive assessment that is updated throughout treatment (see Part 2 of this TIP for more information on conducting assessments). Tailor the management approach to patients' needs and goals. Components of the management approach include: The length and frequency of office visits. The length of time between prescriptions or XR-NTX injections. The frequency of drug testing. Ancillary psychosocial and medical treatments and referrals.3-85 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Course of Treatment The typical course of OUD treatment is varied. There is often not a direct pathway from heavy illicit opioid use to no illicit opioid use.358 Some patients have only occasional returns to use and do not require reinduction on buprenorphine or naltrexone. Other patients may return to use in the context of medication nonadherence, requiring reinduction and restabilization on buprenorphine or medically supervised withdrawal from opioids and an appropriate period of abstinence before re- starting naltrexone. Some patients may have sustained abstinence and choose to remain on their maintenance buprenorphine or naltrexone dose. However, others may try to taper their buprenorphine dose, discontinue naltrexone, consider a change in pharmacotherapy (e.g., from buprenorphine to naltrexone or naltrexone to buprenorphine), or attempt maintenance of remission of OUD without any medication. Because OUD is often a chronic and relapsing illness, patients may have different types and durations of treatment over their lifetimes. Some may have periods of successful outpa- tient treatment at different times with all three available FDA-approved medications for OUD. Others may experience forced medication discontinuation (e.g., insurance lapse, time in controlled environments that disallow or discriminate against OUD medication, cases in family and drug courts, parole and probation). A relative few may remain in remission after successfully discontinuing medication voluntarily. Different treatment journeys occur in different treatment settings (e.g., intensive outpatient, residential programs) and with different phar - macotherapies and ancillary psychosocial and recovery support services. To the extent possible, coordinate primary care, behavioral health, and wraparound services needed and desired by the patients to address their medical, social, and recovery needs. Individuals with co-occurring physical, mental, and substance use disorders may benefit from collaborative care.359 RESOURCE ALERT Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Treatment Guidance for Individuals With Co-Occurring Disorders TIP 42, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Co-Occurring Disorders, provides treatment strategies for SUD treatment for individuals with mental disorders (https://store.samhsa.gov/product/TIP- 42-Substance-Abuse-Treatment-for-Persons-With-Co-Occurring-Disorders/SMA13-3992). General Principles for the Use of Pharmacological Agents To Treat Individuals With Co-Occurring Mental and Substance Use Disorders offers assistance for the planning, delivery, and evaluation of pharmacotherapy for individuals with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders (https://store. samhsa.gov/product/general-principles-use-pharmacological-agents-treat-individuals-co-occurring- mental). Pharmacologic Guidelines for Treating Individuals With Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Co- Occurring Opioid Use Disorders is tailored to the provision of medication for OUD to individuals also diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (https://store.samhsa.gov/product/pharmacologic- guidelines-treating-individuals-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-co-occurring). 3-86Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Role of the Treatment Plan and Treatment Agreement in Medical Management The initial treatment plan should include: Treatment goals. Conditions for changing or stopping treatment (the Chapter 3E Appendix has a sample goal-setting form). Therapeutic contingencies for nonadher - ence and failure to meet initial goals, such as: Increase in the intensity or scope of services at the office or through referral. More intensive psychosocial treatment, including inpatient treatment or transfer to an opioid treatment program (OTP) for observed buprenorphine dosing if the office-based practice is unable to provide such services. Reassessment to ensure psychiatric and other comorbid addictions are adequately addressed via consultation with mental health, addiction treatment, or pain management providers as available and indicated. Some patients may need a more structured environment when there is continued opioid use or comorbid use of substances other than opioids or when mental disorders are impeding their progress toward remission and recovery. In these cases, medication for OUD should not be interrupted. Treatment agreements can help clarify expec- tations for patients and healthcare profession- als (see the Chapter 3C Appendix and Chapter 3D Appendix for sample treatment agreement forms for naltrexone and buprenorphine, respec- tively). Review and amend treatment plans and treatment agreements periodically as patients progress (or destabilize) and new goals emerge. This will help healthcare professionals across settings deliver coordinated, effective care. Updating treatment plans and agreements helps patients recognize their progress and supports their motivation to remain engaged. Involving patients' support networks makes patients accountable to a group of caring people rather than to a single healthcare professional. Engage patients' family members and other recovery supports (with patients' written consent) by sharing their treatment goals and agreements. Identify specific ways they can support patients' goals.360 Medical Management Strategies Medical management includes: Providing brief supportive counseling. Referring to ancillary psychosocial services. Referring to psychiatric and medical care if not directly provided by the healthcare pro- fessional prescribing or administering OUD medication. Adjusting the frequency of office visits. Conducting drug tests. Monitoring patient adherence to medication with occasional observed dosing, random medication inventorying, or both. Addressing patient concerns about side effects.If a patient does not discontinue all illicit drugs for extended periods, it doesn't mean treatment has failed and should not result in automatic discharge. It means the treatment plan may require modification to meet the patient's needs. The TIP expert panel recommends medication management and brief supportive counseling at each visit. Refer for adjunctive addiction counseling and other psychosocial supports as clinically indicated.3-87 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Discussing any concerns with the patient or their support network. Prescribing medication for co-occurring alcohol use disorder (e.g., disulfiram, acamprosate). Strategies for optimizing medical management and brief supportive counseling involve: Helping the patient manage stressors and identify triggers for a return to illicit opioid use. Providing empathic listening and nonjudg- mental discussion of triggers that precede use or increased craving and how to manage them. Providing ongoing assessment to mark progress. Revise treatment goals via shared decision making to incorporate new insights. (See \"Treatment Planning or Referral\" in Part 2 of this TIP for more on shared decision making.) Providing medical care for comorbid health conditions. Referring patients as needed to: Adjunctive psychiatric treatment. Addiction counseling. Case management. Community-based recovery support groups. Inviting supportive family members and friends to medical visits to discuss strategies to support patients. Engaging and educating family members and friends who are reluctant to accept medication's role in treatment. Advocating for patients as needed if their treatment becomes threatened by their employer, housing provider, insurance company, the courts, or criminal justice agencies. These threats, refusal of service, or frank coercion may constitute potential viola- tions of the Americans with Disabilities Act or other discrimination or parity violations.Referral to counseling and other psychosocial supports Prescribers of buprenorphine must be able to refer patients for appropriate adjunctive counseling and ancillary services as needed according to federal law.361 (However, patients can still receive buprenorphine treatment even if they do not use such services.) There's no such referral requirement for naltrexone treatment, but patients should receive medical manage- ment and be referred as needed for adjunctive addiction, mental health, or recovery services. To achieve clinical stability and abstinence from illicit drug use, many patients need psychosocial counseling and support services beyond what their buprenorphine prescriber's practice offers. For example, patients with mental disorders (e.g., depression, posttrau- matic stress disorder)362 should be assessed and treated with appropriate medications (as indicated) and adjunctive mental health services. Some patients are reluctant to engage in addiction counseling or recovery support groups until they stabilize on medication. Once stabilized, they may see benefits to participating in these supports. Recommend additional addiction, mental health, and social services as appropriate if patients: Do not achieve full remission. Continue to misuse nonopioid substances. Do not reach their treatment goals with medication management alone. Behavioral treatment with contingency manage- ment (e.g., rewards for illicit drug abstinence) is highly effective and is offered in some specialty treatment programs. It can motivate the patient to reduce illicit drug use, including opioids and stimulants, and increase medication adherence.363 Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Self-Management and Recovery Training, and other peer recovery support groups can be 3-88Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 helpful to patients, especially if they find groups with accepting attitudes toward OUD medication and people who take it. (See Part 5 of this TIP for resources on recovery support groups.) Some peer recovery support groups consider patients taking methadone and bu - prenorphine for OUD treatment as not being abstinent from opioids. Check with local groups before referring a patient. Groups not accepting of OUD medications are not appropriate for patients taking them. Patients are most likely to benefit from peer support programs if they actively participate in offered recovery activities.364 Monitor recovery activities to ensure that patients are accessing appropriate supports and are benefiting from them (Exhibit 3E.2). Patients may need many other psychosocial services. Case managers can help patients obtain: Housing support. Medicaid or other health insurance. Income support. Food assistance services. Vocational and educational services. Mental health and family therapy.Refer to psychosocial services as appropriate. Get patient consent to share information and make provider introductions, just as referrals to other medical specialists would occur. Strategies include: Referring per program availability, afford - ability, and patients' needs, preferences, and treatment responses. Ensure referrals to programs that accept and support patients receiving OUD medication. If possible, personally introducing patients to the new behavioral health service providers or peer recovery support specialists if changing settings, to encourage a successful transition. Developing and maintaining a list of referral resources, including: Drug and alcohol counselors. Inpatient, residential, and outpatient addiction counseling programs. OTPs. Inpatient/outpatient behavioral health programs. Primary care and mental health providers. Community-based services. Recovery support groups. EXHIBIT 3E.2. Monitoring Recovery Activities At medical management visits, do not simply ask about attendance at recovery support meetings\u2014 explore the level of participation and engagement in those activities. Some activities include: Finding and working closely with a sponsor. \"Working\" the 12 Steps at 12-Step meetings and with a sponsor. Doing service at meetings (e.g., setting up chairs, making coffee, going on a \"commitment\" to speak at a meeting in a jail or an inpatient drug and alcohol program). Having and frequently attending a regular \"home\" group.365 Remember this statement from recovery experts A. Thomas McLellan and William White: Recovery status is best defined by factors other than medication status. Neither medication-assisted treatment of opioid addiction nor the cessation of such treatment by itself constitutes recovery. Recovery status instead hinges on broader achievements in health and social functioning\u2014with or without medication support.\"3663-89 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Using active referral procedures (e.g., linking patients directly via phone to a specific program staff member) instead of passive ones (e.g., giving a patient a name and a phone number to call). Avoiding leaving patients to find their own referrals. Monitoring patients' follow-through via phone contact or at the next office visit. Frequency of medical management visits The TIP expert panel recommends that patients be seen approximately once a week until they demonstrate significant reductions in or abstinence from illicit substance use.367 This is also a time to ensure adherence to pharmacotherapy. Nonadherence to naltrexone or buprenorphine prevents optimal treatment outcomes. In scheduling patient visits, be sensitive to treatment barriers such as: Work and childcare obligations. Cost of care and lack of insurance coverage. Driving time. Lack of public transportation to visits, which may be particularly challenging for patients in rural areas. Goals of weekly visits include: Assessing patients' clinical needs and challenges. Assessing medication effectiveness and side effects. Assessing functional status (e.g., home, work, school). Assessing and monitoring stress coping strategies and potential triggers for return to substance use. Assessing adherence to the recommended frequency of attendance for XR-NTX injections or the prescribed buprenorphine dosing regimen and responsible handling of the medication (e.g., safely storing out of reach of children, taking as prescribed, not sharing or losing it). Monitoring use of alcohol and illicit drugs and ensuring adequate therapeutic dosing (e.g., opioid blockade if there is ongoing illicit opioid use and adherence to medication). Following up on any referrals made, such as adjunctive counseling, recovery support groups, or other psychosocial services (the Chapter 3E Appendix has a sample medical management visit form). Once patients adhere to therapeutic doses of OUD medication, decrease illicit drug and alcohol use, and increase negative opioid toxicological samples, consider less frequent visits. Monthly visits (or less for carefully selected patients who have been stable on buprenorphine for extended periods with adequate support) are reasonable for patients taking naltrexone or buprenorphine who show progress toward treatment objectives. Indications that a patient is ready to come less than weekly include: Several weeks of illicit opioid abstinence based on self-report and negative drug tests. Adherence to appointments and treatment plan. No ongoing drug use that may risk patient safety (e.g., alcohol or benzodiazepine misuse). Absence of significant medication side effects. Stable mental health and medical conditions. Responsible handling of medication (e.g., safe storage, no requests for early refills). Absence of unexpected controlled medication prescriptions from other providers in the PDMP . As visits become less frequent, consider random urine drug testing, medication counts (buprenorphine tablets or films), and involve- ment of network supports if available. Buprenorphine implants are indicated only for stable patients already taking transmucosal buprenorphine with positive treatment response. Extended-release buprenorphine is indicated for patients treated with transmu- cosal buprenorphine for at least 1 week. It's 3-90Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 expected that patients with the implants or those treated with extended-release buprenorphine will receive medication management services with visits approximately weekly at the start and then less frequently as clinically indicated based on patient treatment response. Likewise, patients treated with XR-NTX should be seen more than once per month when initiating the medication to monitor progress and assess and address any side effects. Drug testing in ongoing medical management Ongoing clinical monitoring that includes drug testing of urine or oral fluid specimens is part of good practice. Objective evidence of any ongoing illicit substance use is important to consider along with patient reports. Patients may not wish to disclose recent drug use because of shame, fear of punishment, or even fear of discharge from treatment. Explain to patients that testing will help them meet treatment goals and is not performed to render punishments. Results help: Detect medication nonadherence that could cause harm (e.g., unintentional overdose). Monitor abstinence and response to medica- tion treatment. Counsel and improve treatment plans. Detect a return to illicit opioid use or other substance use.The TIP expert panel recommends periodic random testing. Drug testing frequency should be clinically determined. It should occur at least at the time of the initial evaluation and initiation of medication (naltrexone, buprenorphine) and at a frequency consistent with office visits (e.g., weekly initially). Point-of-service tests give immediate results, allowing findings and implications to be discussed with patients during visits. However, some circumstances require confirmatory labo- ratory testing, such as when the patient contests the results and when testing for employment or legal monitoring. In these cases, samples may need to be collected and sent to a Department of Health and Human Services-certified labora- tory under strict chain-of-custody procedure. In addition, norbuprenorphine may not be available in point-of-service tests and therefore, periodi- cally, a specimen should be sent to a laboratory for testing. Important aspects of testing include: Testing technology. The cutoffs for positive tests. Any administrative requirements. Time windows to detect a positive result. Cross-reactivity, sensitivity, and specificity. Test interpretation. (See Part 2 for more information about how to interpret drug testing results.) Consideration of panels based on drugs most commonly used in the region. Conduct point-of-service drug tests following the manufacturer's instructions. Use Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-waived testing kits. A provider's office must enroll and pay a modest fee for certification. The applica- tion is available online (www.cms.gov/Medicare /CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/downloads/cms116 .pdf).Visit frequency should not depend only on dosing schedule for long- acting OUD medications. Also consider patients' treatment needs, preferences, and responses. To ensure continued engagement, consider adding to the treatment agreement the expected visit frequency and frequency of other ancillary treatments tailored to patients' needs, goals, and preferences.3-91 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Sample collection via oral swab is straightforward; follow the manufacturer's directions. If collecting urine samples, take steps to reduce the likelihood of tampering. In settings that treat many patients or treat patients potentially facing criminal justice sanctions, consider taking these measures: Have patients visit the bathroom alone, without bags or jackets, to deter use of another person's urine specimen. Set the sink to run only cold water and use a colored toilet bowl cleaner to prevent dilution of urine specimens. Use specimen cups with specific gravity testing, if possible, to identify diluted samples. Use temperature-sensitive strips in collection cups to identify tampered specimens. Ongoing positive opioid tests during treatment indicate the need to reassess the patient and revise the treatment plan. Repeated positives may indicate that patients: Are not taking some or all of their medication or may be taking the medication incorrectly. Need a different medication. Need directly observed medication adminis- tration in the office or at an OTP . Need a buprenorphine dose increase. Need more counseling or a higher level of a specialty addiction treatment program. Need to participate in recovery support services. For more information on drug testing in the primary care setting, see Technical Assistance Publication 32, Clinical Drug Testing in Primary Care368 (https://store.samhsa.gov/product/ tap-32-clinical-drug-testing-primary-care/sma12- 4668) and ASAM's Consensus Statement on Appropriate Use of Drug Testing in Clinical Addiction Medicine.369 Opioids and opiates in point-of-service tests Point-of-service and laboratory screening tests for opiates only test for opioids metabolized to morphine (e.g., codeine, heroin). Semisynthetic and synthetic such as methadone, buprenorphine, and others (e.g., fentanyl, oxycodone), are not metabolized to morphine and do not test positive on most opiate tests. Specific point-of-service tests exist for these opioids. Some point-of-service and laboratory tests can detect methadone, buprenorphine, and other opioids. Patients taking buprenorphine should have buprenorphine specifically included in their urine test panel to assure the prescriber that the patient is indeed taking the medication. Some patients may put some of their buprenorphine in the urine to mask nonadherence. Periodically testing for a buprenorphine metabolite (e.g., norbuprenorphine, buprenorphine glucuronide) is advised. Assessing buprenorphine adherence Medication nonadherence and diversion can signal inadequately treated OUD (e.g., return to use with positive urine drug tests). Assess such behaviors clinically and develop therapeutic responses to them. Remember that nonadherence, misuse, and diversion occur with other medications as well\u2014those with and without abuse potential. For instance, it's clear that opioid analgesics have been overprescribed for pain, misused, and diverted; they have contributed to deaths among individuals prescribed as well as those not prescribed these medications. Antibiotics for bacterial infections are also overprescribed, and patient nonadherence (e.g., not completing the full course), misuse (e.g., saving leftover medi- cation for a later self-diagnosed and self-treated infection), and diversion (e.g., giving leftover medication to ill family members or friends) can cause significant public health harm, given the spread of drug-resistant bacteria. Medication nonadherence has largely fueled development of longer acting medications (e.g., depot anti- psychotics, long-acting contraceptives, XR-NTX, buprenorphine implants).3-92Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Strategies for addressing medication non- adherence and diversion include carefully assessing the patient to understand under - lying causes of the behavior. Address these causes and monitor adherence. For instance, if a patient gives his or her medication to a relative on a waiting list for treatment, getting the relative into treatment can help that patient become adherent. Monitor adherence by: Asking patients to bring their unused medica- tion into the office for counting. Increasing the frequency of office visits. Increasing urine drug testing. Talking with family members or significant others. Writing prescriptions for shorter duration. Observing medication administration at the office, pharmacy, or OTP . Checking urine for buprenorphine and its metabolites. Checking the PDMP . Avoiding doses over 24 mg (save in rare cases). Chapter 3D Appendix includes a sample patient urine drug screen and medication count form, as well as a pharmacy tablet/film count form. If these steps have no positive effect, patients may need referral to higher levels of care at OTPs or residential addiction treatment programs. Different formulations or pharma- cotherapy may need to be considered.370 If a change in setting is required, consider patients for return to OBOT once they stabilize. Discontinuing medication for OUD Patients should decide whether to taper off or discontinue pharmacotherapy with the support of their healthcare professional and, if applicable, their addiction or mental health counselor, family, and peer recovery supports (e.g., peer support specialist, recovery coach). If patients' goals include stopping medication, discuss the risks and benefits of discontinuing. Work closely with patients to develop a buprenorphine dose taper plan, if needed, and a robust plan to sustain recovery and reengage in treatment before any return to substance use. Before patients begin a buprenorphine dose taper or discontinue XR-NTX, they should demonstrate: Medication adherence. Abstinence from illicit opioid use. A stable living environment. Social support. Sustained improvements in functioning at home and at school or work. Consider treatment with XR-NTX following successful taper from an opioid agonist or partial agonist (after an appropriate period of absti- nence). Data are limited on the effectiveness of this approach. The TIP expert panel recommends that providers not discharge patients from treatment solely because of continued illicit opioid use if the benefits of treatment continue to outweigh the risks. If risks outweigh benefits or alternative treatments may offer more benefit, refer patients to alternative treatment (e.g., OTP). Discharging patients without attempting meaningful referral when illicit opioid use is ongoing can worsen the patient's condition and may be considered patient abandonment. Forced tapers or abrupt discontinuation Forcing a patient to taper off of medication for nonmedical reasons or because of ongoing substance misuse is generally inappropriate. Many patients are abruptly discontinued or tapered from OUD medication against their will Do not require discontinuation of pharmacotherapy because of incomplete treatment response. Doing so is not a rational therapeutic response to the predicted course of a chronic condition.3-93 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder while detained or awaiting trial. A randomized trial of continuing versus tapering off methadone for detainees found that those who kept taking medication in detention were significantly more likely to return to treatment on release.371 It is likely that the same holds true for forced discon- tinuation from buprenorphine during detention. As is sometimes the case in general medical practice, patients who are unable to pay their bills should not be discontinued from treatment without attempting meaningful referral. Attempt referrals to publicly funded addiction treatment services (e.g., specialty treatment programs, federally qualified health centers). If patients cannot continue treatment because of inability to pay, providers can contact the pharmaceutical company about patient assistance programs to help defer the cost of medications. Forced dose tapers against the patient's desire may be clinically indicated when risks of treatment outweigh benefits or, in unusual cases, where the patient has been violent toward staff or other patients. In these cases, attempt to place the patient in a higher level of care and document the attempt. In some circumstances, forced tapering or abrupt discontinuation may violate the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Legal Action Center (www.lac.org) and the National Alliance for Medication Assisted Recovery (www.methadone.org) offer informa- tion on how to legally manage forced tapers. Patient follow-up Medical management should not end when patients taper off of medication. The TIP expert panel recommends regular follow-up visits (or phone checkups by clinical staff or recovery support specialists) to help patients manage their condition, address potential concerns about returning to illicit opioid use, and discuss reinitiating OUD maintenance medication if warranted. Attendance at drug counseling or mutual-help groups can be helpful, as can periodic drug testing.Administrative Considerations Patient Limits Individual healthcare practitioners can prescribe buprenorphine in any medical setting, as long as they apply for and receive waivers of the special registration requirements defined in the Controlled Substances Act. Several laws and regulations contain information about which healthcare practitioners are eligible to apply for a waiver and how to qualify (https:// www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/ training-materials-resources/apply-for-practi- tioner-waiver). This information is summarized below. Eligible physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other qualifying practitioners (clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives) can apply for a waiver. At present, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives are only eligible to apply for a waiver until October 1, 2023. For the first year of waiver use, all providers can treat up to 30 patients at one time. However, providers who satisfy additional practice and reporting requirements, and physicians who are board certified in addiction psychiatry or addiction medicine, may request to treat up to 100 patients at a time in the first year of waiver use. Additionally, practitioners who provide MAT in \"qualified practice settings,\" as defined in title 42, section 8.615 of the Code of Federal Regulations, may also request to treat up to 100 patients within the first year. After the first year of waiver use, all providers may request to increase their patient limit to 100.3-94Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Physicians who are board certified in addiction psychiatry or addiction medicine or who satisfy additional practice and reporting requirements may apply to increase their patient limit to 275 after a year at the 100-patient limit. Diversion Control Policies for OBOT With Buprenorphine Controlled substance diversion refers to unau- thorized provision of medication to someone for whom it was not prescribed.372 Patients may divert buprenorphine for various reasons, such as: To \"help\" someone who needs medically su- pervised withdrawal or awaits treatment.373,374 To provide income for the seller. To enable someone else to experience the euphoric effect of the medication.375 Address diversion of controlled substances with patients using the following strategies: Clarify that continuing in office-based treatment depends largely on taking med- ication as prescribed; nonadherence and diversion are thus problematic. In a nonjudgmental way, discuss to whom within their network of family, friends, and acquaintances they might be tempted to divert their medication and why they might be tempted to do so. Instruct patients to store medication securely (children may inadvertently ingest it and overdose, or other people may take the medication for their own use or to sell).376 Discuss patients' plans to safely store buprenorphine. Advise patients to keep the medication in the original packaging and out of the reach of children.377 Tell patients not to store their medication in common areas (e.g., kitchen, bathroom) where others may access it. Educate patients that any portion of a dose taken by a child or pet can be deadly and that they should call 9-1-1 immediately if this occurs. Explain how diversion causes negative views of treatment, leading to discrimination against people with OUD. Therefore, healthcare pro- fessionals must proactively address diversion to help prevent it. Possible signs that a patient is diverting bu- prenorphine378 include: Frequently missed appointments. Requests for early refills because medication was reportedly lost or stolen. Negative buprenorphine urine screens. Positive buprenorphine urine screens that are negative for buprenorphine metabolites. Specific requests for the buprenorphine monoproduct owing to naloxone allergy. Specific requests for doses of buprenorphine greater than 24 mg/6 mg. PDMP shows prescription fills for opioids or other medications that are not positive on his or her drug tests. Failed film/pill callback counts. Establish a diversion control plan to minimize OUD medication diversion. The plan provides measures to reduce diversion and assigns specific responsibility to medical and admin- istrative staff members for carrying out these measures.379 It should address medication storage, dispensing and administration (if applicable), and prescribing380 (see the Chapter 3E Appendix for a sample diversion control policy). For providers who store buprenorphine for administration and dispensing, plans should indicate how they will control diversion and which approaches they will use to ensure that patients take their medication. Exhibit 3E.3 summarizes key elements of a diversion control plan. Physicians who prescribe buprenorphine to more than 100 patients need a diversion control plan. Document diversion incidents and responses to incidents in the patient record. More information about Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) requirements for Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA 3-95 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder 2000)-waivered healthcare professionals is available online (www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/ pubs/docs/dwp_buprenorphine.htm). Storage of Buprenorphine Practices that store buprenorphine onsite must have appropriate security, which includes storing the medication in a securely locked, substantially constructed cabinet.381 If a signifi- cant amount of stored buprenorphine is lost or stolen, providers must notify the local DEA office in writing within 1 business day and complete a Form DEA-106 (https://apps.deadiversion.usdoj .gov/webforms/dtlLogin.jsp). Employees convicted of a felony related to a controlled substance or who had a DEA registration denied, revoked, or surrendered \"for cause\" are not permitted to have access to buprenorphine. EXHIBIT 3E.3. Key Elements of an OBOT Clinic Diversion Control Plan382 New Patients Check the state's PDMP before admission to determine whether patients are receiving opioids or benzodiazepine prescriptions from other providers. Ask patients to sign a release of information to speak with the other prescribers. Patients who are unwilling to sign a release of information are poor candidates for outpatient treatment. Review the clinic diversion control policy with new patients. This should include counseling patients to: Keep buprenorphine locked up and out of children's reach. Never share medication with anyone. Never sell medication to anyone. Acknowledge giving or selling medication to others as illegal. Take medication only as prescribed. Review, understand, and agree to the practice's buprenorphine treatment agreement before they start. Prescribe buprenorphine/naloxone when possible rather than monoproduct. Exceptions include prescribing the monoproduct for pregnant women with OUD. Prescribe an adequate but not excessive dose. Most patients respond to doses at or below 24 mg per day. Carefully evaluate requests for higher doses and confirm, document, and assess medication adherence continuously. Ongoing Patients Periodically check the state's PDMP. Conduct random urine tests that include a wide spectrum of opioids\u2014including morphine, oxycodone, and buprenorphine\u2014and periodically include buprenorphine metabolites. This will help monitor response to treatment and determine whether patients are taking at least some of their prescribed buprenorphine. Use unobserved specimen collection to preserve patient privacy and dignity: Do not let patients bring backpacks, jackets, or other items into the bathroom. Do not let others enter bathrooms with patients. Temperature test the urine sample. Use observed specimen collection (obtained by a staff member of the same gender) or oral fluid testing if there is reason to suspect tampering or falsification. Contact patients at random; ask them to bring in their medication within a reasonable period (24 to 48 hours) to count the tablets/films to ensure that all medication is accounted for. Provide a limited number of days of medication per prescription without refills (e.g., several days or 1 week per prescription) until the patient has demonstrated stability and lowered diversion risk.3-96Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Records for Dispensers Office-based practices that dispense buprenor - phine must keep records of:383 The number of units and doses dispensed with the names and addresses of the patients. The dates the medication was dispensed. The names (or initials) of the staff members who dispensed or administered the medication. The diversion control plan should include approaches to ensuring that patients take the medication and do not divert it to others. Recordkeeping for ordering, storing, and dispensing buprenorphine in the office All prescribers and staff members must follow federal and state laws for ordering, storing, administering, and dispensing buprenorphine in outpatient settings. Records of inventories of medication received, dispensed, destroyed, and lost or stolen must be maintained. For guidance on how to comply with federal requirements, see: Diversion Control Division's Practitioner's Manual (www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/pubs clinicaltools.com/pdf/Buppractice/V5-Bup- How-To-Comply.pdf). Recordkeeping for prescribing buprenorphine Consider writing an initial prescription for only a few days. An example of a 1-day fill on __________________________ [insert date that is 1 day before the scheduled induction to make it less tempting for patients to use on their own before induction]Keep a log for possible DEA inspection that includes: Patients' names (or ID numbers). Dates of prescriptions. The names, strengths, and quantities of the medications. Although not required, such a log facilitates inspection and indicates that the provider is within the approved patient limits. Alternatively, electronic health records can be used for this purpose. DEA Inspections Under DATA 2000, DEA must ensure that providers administering, dispensing, or prescribing buprenorphine are following re- cordkeeping, security, and other requirements. To fulfill this requirement, DEA conducts routine, unannounced onsite inspections. A description of the inspection process and how to comply with its requirements is available online (https://pcssnow.org/?s=how+to+prepare+- for+a+DEA+inspection). Emergency Protocols and Patient Safety Measures Clinics that provide buprenorphine or naltrexone do not need special emergency protocols, crash carts, or other special equipment. However, for patient safety, the TIP expert panel recommends having injectable or intranasal naloxone onsite. Clinics that admin- ister XR-NTX or buprenorphine should have a written policy and procedure for responding to precipitated withdrawal and medication allergies. Providers who give more than 100 patients buprenorphine must have on- call services. Such services are valuable regardless of the number of patients in treatment.3-97 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder On-call services and backup during absences should be available either directly or through contracts or cooperative agreements with other local providers with waivers. Qualified medical staff can offer routine medical and psychiatric coverage even without a buprenorphine waiver. Recommendations for Staff Member Training All staff members who interact with patients are part of the treatment environment. They can affect patients' treatment experiences and, ultimately, their outcomes. Staff members who interact with patients can include receptionists, billing clerks, urine specimen collection clerks, and all clinical staff members. Therefore, it is useful to educate and train all staff members in key areas, including: Organizational mission. The scientific and empirical underpinnings for the use of FDA-approved medications for OUD, how these medications work, and the evidence for their effectiveness. The similarity of medical management and support of patients with OUD to that of patients with other chronic illnesses. The importance of maintaining a nonjudgmen- tal and welcoming attitude toward patients. How to hold discussions about negative perceptions and prejudices associated with OUD. Side effects of OUD medications and proce- dures to alert staff members when patients exhibit them. The effect of OUD and other substance use and mental disorders (including posttraumatic stress disorder) on patients' behavior and how staff members can respond appropriately. Procedures for seeking help from other staff members to deescalate disagreements or solve problems. Procedures for protecting patients' confidenti- ality and safety. Treating OUD can be a challenging yet rewarding part of a clinical practice. Addressing key administrative issues keeps the focus on the rewarding aspects of developing long-term relationships with patients as they work to overcome negative effects of OUD on their lives and improve their health. RESOURCE ALERT Training and Mentorship for Prescribers The Providers' Clinical Support System, with the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry as the lead organization along with partners from ASAM and other professional organizations, delivers education, training, and mentorship to providers who wish to treat OUD with medications. More information about training and professional mentorship is available online (https://pcssnow.org/education-training/ ).3-98Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Patient's Name: ________________________________________________________________ Date: _________________________ GOAL CATEGORYCURRENT SITUATION SCORE 10 = major problems and 0 = no problemsWhat would need to change to decrease this score?PRIORITY SCORE 10 = highest priority (\"I really want to work on this\") and 1 = lowest priority (\"I really do not want to work on this\") Opioid use Other illicit drug use: ______________ Alcohol use Tobacco use Physical health Mental health Legal/court issues Finances Job/employment Hobbies Family relations Partner relations Supportive drug-free network Education Keeping medication safe (e.g., not giving it away, selling it, having it stolen) Other Other M.

It is intended to offer healthcare professionals guiding principles and policies regarding best practices in diversion control for patients who are prescribed buprenorphine. This policy is not intended to establish a legal or medical standard of care. Healthcare professionals should use their personal and professional judgment in interpreting these guidelines and applying them to the particular circum- stances of their individual patients and practice arrangements. The information provided in this Policy is provided \"as is\" with no guarantee as to its accuracy or completeness. Preamble: Healthcare professionals can now treat up to 275 patients with buprenorphine. This increased access may contrib- ute to increased diversion, misuse, and related harms. Signs that a patient is misusing or diverting buprenorphine include (1) missed appointments; (2) requests for early refills because pills were lost, stolen, or other reasons; (3) urine screens negative for buprenorphine, positive for opioids; (4) claims of being allergic or intolerant to naloxone and requesting monotherapy; (5) nonhealing or fresh track marks; or (5) police reports of selling on the streets. Likewise, there are a range of reasons for diversion and misuse (e.g., diverting to family/friends with untreated opioid addiction with the intent of trying to \"help\" convince them to also get treatment; diverting to family/friends on a treatment waiting list; selling some or all of the medication to pay off old drug debts/purchase preferred opioid of misuse/pay for treatment in places where there are inadequate addiction treatment professionals taking private insurance or Medicaid for such reasons as inadequate reim- bursement/no reimbursement/burdensome prior authorization process). The safety and health of patients and others in the community could be at risk if misuse and diversion are not addressed proactively throughout treatment. The reputation of XYZ Medical Practice may also be put at risk. Definitions: Diversion is defined as the unauthorized rerouting or misappropriation of prescription medication to someone other than for whom it was intended (including sharing or selling a prescribed medication); misuse includes taking medica- tion in a manner, by route or by dose, other than prescribed.384 Purpose: Misuse and diversion should be defined and discussed with patients at the time of treatment entry; periodically throughout treatment, particularly when there have been returns to illicit drug use; and when suspected (e.g., incorrect buprenorphine pill/film count) or confirmed. These procedures will establish the steps to be taken to prevent, monitor, and respond to misuse and diversion of buprenorphine. The response should be therapeutic and matched to the patients' needs, as untreated opioid use disorder and treatment dropout/administrative discharges may lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality and further use of diverted medications or illicit opioids associated with overdose death. Procedures for Prevention: Use buprenorphine/naloxone combination products when medically indicated and cost is not an issue. Reserve the daily buprenorphine monoproducts for pregnant patients and patients who could not afford treatment if the combination product were required, who have a history of stability in treatment and low diversion risk, or who have arrangements for observed dosing. Buprenorphine monoproducts are recommended for pregnant women. Counsel patients on safe storage of, and nonsharing of, medications. Patients must agree to safe storage of their medication. This is even more critical if there are children in the home where the patient lives. Counsel patients about acquiring locked devices and avoiding storage in parts of the home frequented by visitors (e.g., do not recommend storage in the kitchen or common bathrooms). Proactively discuss how medication should be stored and transported when traveling to minimize risk of unintended loss. Counsel patients on taking medication as instructed and not sharing medication. Explicitly explain to patients the definitions of diversion and misuse, with examples. Patients are required to take medication as instructed by the healthcare professional; for example, they may not crush or inject the medication. Check the prescription drug monitoring program for new patients and check regularly thereafter. Prescription drug monitoring program reports can be a useful resource when there is little history available or when there is a concern based on observation. Check for prescriptions that interact with buprenorphine and for other buprenorphine prescribers.3-101 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Prescribe a therapeutic dose that is tailored to the patient's needs. Do not routinely provide an additional supply \"just in case.\" Question patients who say they need a significantly higher dose, particularly when they are already at 24 mg per day of buprenorphine equivalents. Make sure the patient understands the practice's treatment agreement and prescription policies. The XYZ Medical Practice's treatment agreement and other documentation are clear about policies regarding number of doses in each prescription, refills, and rules on \"lost\" prescriptions. Review the policies in person with the patient. Offer an opportunity for questions. Patient and provider must sign the agreement. Review the policies again with the patient at subsequent appointments. See Sample Buprenorphine Treatment Agreement or Sample XR-NTX Treatment Agreement as needed. Procedures for Monitoring: Request random urine tests. The presence of buprenorphine in the urine indicates that the patient has taken some portion of the prescribed dose. Absence of buprenorphine in the urine supports nonadherence. Testing for bu- prenorphine metabolites (which are present only if buprenorphine is metabolized) should periodically be included to minimize the possibility that buprenorphine is added directly to the urine sample. Dipstick tests can be subverted or replaced. A range of strategies can be used to minimize falsified urine collections, including (1) observed collection; (2) disallowing carry-in items (e.g., purses, backpacks) in the bathroom; (3) turning off running water and coloring toilet water to eliminate the possibility of dilution; (4) monitoring the bathroom door so that only one person can go in; and (5) testing the temperature of the urine immediately after voiding. Schedule unannounced pill/film counts. Periodically ask patients who are at high risk at initial or subsequent appoint- ments to bring in their medication containers for a pill/film count. With unannounced monitoring (both pill/film counts and urine tests), the patient is contacted and must appear within a specified time period (e.g., 24 hours) after the phone call. If the patient doesn't show, then the provider should consider this as a positive indicator of misuse or diversion. Directly observe ingestion. Patients take medication in front of the healthcare professional or another qualified clinician and are observed until the medication dissolves in the mouth (transmucosal [sublingual or buccal] absorp- tion). Patients who are having difficulty adhering to their buprenorphine can have their medication provided under direct observation in the office for a designated frequency (e.g., three times/week). Limit medication supply. When directly observed doses in the office are not practical, short prescription time spans can be used (e.g., weekly, 3 days at a time). Procedures To Respond to Misuse or Diversion: Misuse or diversion doesn't mean automatic discharge from the practice. However, it will require consideration of one or more of the following procedures: Evaluate the misuse and diversion. For instance, describe the incident of misuse (e.g., \"the patient took the pre- scribed dose on three or more occasions by intravenous route immediately after starting treatment, stating that she believed the dose would not be adequate by sublingual route; she has just initiated treatment\") or diversion (\"the patient gave half of dose to his wife, who is still using heroin and was withdrawing, because he did not want her to have to buy heroin off the street; she is on a waiting list for treatment\") and tailor the response to the behavior (e.g., reeducation of the patient on buprenorphine pharmacology in the first example above; assistance with treatment entry for the spouse in the second example). Reassess the treatment plan and patient progress. Strongly consider smaller supplies of medication and supervised dosing for any patient who is taking medication intravenously or in- tranasally or diverting, regardless of reason. Treatment structure may need to be increased, including more frequent appointments, supervised administration, and increased psychosocial support. Intensify treatment or level of care, if needed. Some patients may require an alternative treatment setting or pharma- cotherapy such as methadone. The clinician will discuss these alternatives with the patient to ensure optimal patient outcome. This should be discussed at treatment onset so the patient is aware of the consequences of misuse and diversion. Document and describe the misuse and diversion incident. Also document the clinical thinking that supports the clinical response, which should be aimed at minimizing risk of diversion and misuse and treating the patient's opioid use disorder at the level of care needed.

The audience is healthcare professionals in emergency, general medical, surgical, psychiatric, and obstetric units. Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) who present to emergency departments (EDs) or are admitted to hospitals for acute medical or psychiatric care can benefit from medication to treat OUD in the hospital setting. During acute medical illness, patients experiencing consequences of opioid use may be motivated to change.386 Hospital-based providers can take this opportunity to initiate long-term medication maintenance.387,388 Unfortunately, less than one-quarter of patients with an opioid-related hospitalization are offered Food and Drug Administration-approved med- ication for OUD within 30 days of discharge.389 Patients who already take OUD medication may also present to the hospital. Thus, a broad understanding of how to manage their OUD medication during hospitalization is necessary. The keys to effective patient management in general hospital settings are: Balancing pharmacotherapy for OUD with other medical concerns (e.g., surgery, pain management) during hospitalization. Careful management after discharge. Seamless transfer to opioid treatment via an opioid treatment program (OTP) or office- based opioid treatment (OBOT) provider after discharge.Hospitalized or ED Patients Taking Medication for OUD Buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone may be ordered in EDs or inpatient hospital units. It's essential for the patient to continue receiving OUD medication while hospitalized. Pain Management Pain management for hospitalized patients who take OUD medication is a key element of medical management. Discuss pain manage- ment and engage in a shared decision-making process with patients being treated for OUD with buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone. OPIOID-RELATED inpatient hospital stays INCREASED 117% nationally from 2005 to 2016.390,3913-104Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Patients may have strong preferences and opinions about pain and use of opioid analgesics for pain treatment. Some patients may want to avoid opioid analgesics. For others, inadequately treated pain may be a trigger for illicit drug use. Involve primary care pain specialists and addiction treatment providers in discussing options for managing OUD medication and pain during patient hospitalization. Buprenorphine The hospital team will need to manage bu- prenorphine for patients who present to the ED or are hospitalized on buprenorphine main- tenance. Physicians in inpatient settings can legally order buprenorphine without a waiver if a patient is admitted primarily for other medical reasons.392 Key medication manage- ment strategies include: Obtaining written consent to contact the patient's providers, including: Primary care provider. Buprenorphine prescriber. Pharmacy. Confirming the patient's outpatient bu- prenorphine dose by: Checking prescribing records. Contacting the prescriber or pharmacy. Examining recent prescription bottles. Checking the prescription drug monitoring program database before administering buprenorphine. Providing the usual daily dose to the patient, once that dose is confirmed. Ensuring the patient's outpatient prescriber understands the reason for any missed visits. Informing the patient's outpatient prescriber that the patient may test positive for opioids if treated with opioid analgesics while in the hospital. Maintaining contact with the patient's pre- scriber, especially when a buprenorphine dose change is considered and in discharge planning.Patients with pain may continue their buprenorphine while in the hospital. For mild-to-moderate pain, dividing the patient's usual buprenorphine dose three times per day (TID) may provide sufficient pain relief.393 In some cases, increased buprenorphine dose may be appropriate. For moderate-to-severe pain, additional analgesia will be necessary. Two approaches to consider: 1. Continue buprenorphine treatment and use full agonist opioids for added pain relief. Because of the partial blockade caused by buprenorphine, higher-than-usual doses of opioids will probably be required for pain relief. Fentanyl, hydromorphone, and morphine have relatively high binding affinities for the mu-opioid receptor and are most likely to displace buprenorphine from receptors and provide improved analgesia. Once the painful condition has improved, if mild-to-moderate pain persists, bu- prenorphine can be divided TID to manage residual pain. This approach is usually successful and allows the patient to remain stable on buprenorphine. 2. Discontinue buprenorphine upon hospi- talization and use full agonist opioids to treat pain and prevent withdrawal. This approach avoids the blockade effect of buprenorphine on the mu-opioid receptors but leaves the patient vulnerable to a return to illicit opioid use. It may be useful if the first approach does not achieve adequate pain control.394 Consider a consult by an addiction medicine, psychiatric, or pain management provider if appropriate and available. Pregnant women on buprenorphine can continue buprenorphine through their labor. Labor pain for pregnant patients on buprenor - phine can be managed effectively with epidural analgesia or intravenous opioids. Spinal anes- thesia is effective in patients on buprenorphine; patients can receive general anesthesia if needed.3953-105 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Perioperative pain management of patients on buprenorphine requires further study, but multiple approaches have been found effective. Most patients can continue buprenorphine through the operative period. Treat postoperative pain with regional anesthesia, nonopioid pain management, or full agonist opioids. Remember that higher doses are likely to be necessary. Some data suggest that buprenorphine divided TID may even be as effective as morphine for postopera- tive pain control.396 Alternatively, buprenorphine can be discontinued 72 hours before a planned surgery and restarted after resolution of acute postoperative pain. The risk of this approach is that it leaves the patient vulnerable to a return to use of illicit opioids.397 Methadone The hospital team will need to manage methadone for patients who present to the ED or are hospitalized on methadone maintenance treatment. This includes pregnant women. Generally, only physicians in OTPs can order methadone to treat OUD. However, physicians in an inpatient setting can legally order methadone administration to patients admitted primarily for other reasons.398 Contact the patient's OTP directly to confirm the outpatient methadone dose, the last day of dose administration, and whether the patient was dispensed take-home doses (and how many doses) after the last dose administration at the OTP . This is to avoid double dosing and to avoid providing a full dose to a patient who hasn't been to the OTP for several days. Notify the OTP of the patient's admission and discharge so that OTP staff is aware of: The patient's upcoming missed visits. Medications received during hospitalization. Medications prescribed at discharge. Patients in pain should receive their full usual daily dose of methadone, barring contraindi- cations. This is their baseline dose and should not be considered a dose for pain management. They'll need pain medication in addition to their usual methadone dose. If their condition is painful enough to require opioids, prescribe short-acting opioids as scheduled, not as- needed, treatment. Because these patients are already opioid tolerant, they'll likely require higher doses of opioids than patients without tolerance.399 However, as with any patient, use nonopioid multimodal pain management when possible to minimize reliance on opioids and maximize pain control.400The expert panel for this Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) recommends restarting buprenorphine before discharge when possible, with a proper handoff between inpatient and outpatient providers. CLINICAL CAUTION Do Not Rely Solely on Patient Self- Report of Methadone Dosage Do not administer the methadone dose based on patient self-report of OTP enrollment and methadone dose; get OTP confirmation. This is important because doses above 30 mg can be lethal if the patient is not currently receiving methadone treatment and has relatively low tolerance to opioids. If it's not possible to confirm the patient's methadone dose because the OTP is closed on nights or weekends and has no emergency contact, up to 20 mg per day can be administered to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms, but monitor for signs of opioid intoxication. If the patient shows no signs of sedation or opioid intoxication 3 to 4 hours after the initial dose and continues to display symptoms of withdrawal, an additional 5 mg to 10 mg may be safe to administer.3-106Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 It is important to tell patients who receive take-home doses that they should not take their own medication while in the hospital. They will receive methadone from the treatment team. Patients can be asked to lock their take-home medications with their other valuables. It is also important to monitor these patients closely after the initial and subsequent methadone administration in the hospital. Some patients who receive take-home doses do not take their entire dose every day, so they may display signs of intoxication or frank overdose if the hospital staff gives them the full dose. Naltrexone Patients taking oral naltrexone for OUD treatment may continue naltrexone when admitted to the hospital if they do not have and are not at risk for developing a painful condition requiring opioid analgesia. Oral naltrexone provides full blockade of opioid receptors for up to 72 hours. Extended-release injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX) provides mea- surable naltrexone levels for 1 month or longer. Thus, managing acute pain in patients taking XR-NTX is complicated. In patients who have taken naltrexone, manage severe pain intensively via nonopioid approach- es, such as regional anesthesia or injected non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Naltrexone blockade can be overcome with very high doses of opioids, but patients must be closely monitored for respiratory depression in a setting with anesthesia services. This is especially true upon discontinuation of oral naltrexone, which dissociates from opioid receptors. Hospitalized or ED Patients Not Taking Medication for OUD Patients with OUD who present to the ED or are admitted to the hospital for an acute medical problem may benefit from initiating medications for OUD during their hospital- ization. A thoughtful and respectful discussion of treatment options and patient-centered provision of medication can be a critical entry point into care. Research supports the efficacy of initiating either buprenorphine or methadone during acute hospital stays401,402 and starting patients on buprenorphine in the ED.403 Buprenorphine Induction in the Hospital Setting Patients admitted to the hospital for medical conditions incident to OUD can undergo medically supervised withdrawal or receive buprenorphine maintenance treatment during their inpatient stay.404 It is important to adequately address opioid withdrawal because hospital patients may otherwise sign out against medical advice or use illicit opioids in the hospital. Buprenorphine can also be initiated for maintenance treatment if there is a system in place that allows smooth and reliable discharge to an outpatient buprenorphine pre- scriber. Unlike methadone, a several-day delay between discharge and the first visit to the out- patient provider is acceptable for stable patients, as long as sufficient medication is provided until the patient begins outpatient treatment. The prescription for medication to be taken outside the hospital must be written by a prescriber with a buprenorphine waiver. If there is no prescriber with a waiver, it is possible to have a patient return to the hospital ED or a clinic within the hospital to have the buprenorphine dose admin- istered by a physician (who does not need to be waivered) for up to 3 days. To provide continuity of care at discharge, use these strategies: Develop and maintain a network of local buprenorphine prescribers and other drug treatment providers. Discharge patients directly to a specific outpatient prescriber for stabilization and maintenance after inpatient buprenorphine induction. Send discharge information directly to the outpatient prescriber, including treatment course, medications administered, and medi- cations prescribed.3-107 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder To initiate buprenorphine during hospitalization: Confirm that there are no contraindications to buprenorphine before initiation. Discontinue opioids for pain management only when no longer needed and the patient is stable enough to tolerate withdrawal. Wait for patients to develop opioid withdraw- al symptoms. Initiate buprenorphine treatment. Individualize buprenorphine dosing. Follow the dosing guidance found in Chapter 3D of this TIP . A clinical trial found that starting buprenorphine in the ED to treat OUD was more effective in linking patients to buprenorphine treatment in the community than were two other approaches without medication.405 When patients presented in opioid withdrawal, they received 8 mg of buprenorphine in the ED. Patients who were not in withdrawal received a detailed self-medication guide and were provided buprenorphine for an unobserved home induction. In both cases, patients were given sufficient buprenorphine to take 16 mg per day at home until they could see an outpatient prescriber within 72 hours. Close follow-up with an outpatient buprenorphine prescriber was critical for dose stabilization and ongoing medication management. Methadone Induction in the Hospital Setting Offer to treat hospitalized patients in opioid withdrawal with methadone (or buprenor - phine) maintenance if they can continue the medication in an OTP seamlessly after discharge. Do not start patients on methadone maintenance in the hospital without a clear follow-up plan. Form relationships with local OTPs that allow discharging of patients directly into methadone maintenance treatment.RESOURCE ALERT Telehealth Tools for the Treatment of OUD The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and other federal agencies have developed numerous resources to guide healthcare professionals in their use of telehealth and telemedicine approaches for OUD. These resources include information on: Guidance on the use of telemedicine in OTPs (https://store.samhsa.gov/product/Federal- Guidelines-for-Opioid-Treatment-Programs/ PEP15-FEDGUIDEOTP ). The policies that must be put in place (to comply with the Controlled Substances Act) by physicians who wish to use telehealth in treating patients with buprenorphine for OUD under the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000. Federal (and sometimes state) restrictions apply, which can be reviewed by accessing 21 USC \u00a7 802 (www.gpo.gov/fdsys /pkg/USCODE-2011-title21/pdf/USCODE-2011 -title21-chap13-subchapI-partA-sec802.pdf ). guidance on telehealth (www.cms.gov/Medicare /Medicare-General-Information/Telehealth /index.html). Challenges and opportunities rural populations (https:// store.samhsa.gov/product/In-Brief-Rural- Behavioral-Health-Telehealth-Challenges- and-Opportunities/SMA16-4989). How certified community behavioral health clinics can use telehealth approaches to expand their services (www.samhsa.gov /section-223/care-coordination/telehealth -telemedicine).3-108Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Inpatient inductions should follow the same \"start low, go slow\" principles that outpatient inductions do (see Chapter 3B of this TIP). The initial dose should be from 10 mg to 20 mg per day. Increase slowly by 5 mg every few days in response to symptoms of opioid withdrawal and level of sedation at the peak plasma level 2 to 4 hours after dosing. Naltrexone Induction in the Hospital Setting Consider XR-NTX initiation for patients who complete withdrawal in the hospital and are opioid free for 7 days (short acting) and up to 14 days (long acting). Only do so if: There are no contraindications (such as the need for opioid analgesia). The patient prefers it after a risk/benefit discussion that covers alternative treatments. There are available follow-up opportunities for ongoing medication maintenance upon discharge.No published data indicate this approach's effectiveness. If a patient desires and gives informed consent for medically supervised withdrawal and naltrex- one initiation while in the hospital, a first dose of naltrexone can be given before discharge. As with other medications for OUD, discharge coordination is critical. Hospitals that develop naltrexone induction protocols need to have a clear discharge plan in place for patients who will then need to continue naltrexone in the outpa- tient setting. Patients should be advised about the risk of overdose if return to opioid use occurs after discontinuing naltrexone. Medical Management Plan The key to effective treatment is to involve patients and all treating healthcare profes- sionals in developing a comprehensive plan for managing treatment with OUD medication during and after hospitalization. This plan should include: Strategies for pain management (if required). In-hospital dosing procedures. Postdischarge coordination of care with out- patient programs and outpatient providers. This plan ensures effective pain relief as well as continuity of ongoing care for patients taking medication for OUD.406The TIP expert panel urges providers not to force patients to withdraw from opioid agonist treatment in the hospital, especially if they have acute illness, pain, or a mental illness.3-109 TIP 63Part 3 of 5\u2014Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Use Disorder Notes 1 Department of Health and Human Services.

Counselors play the same role for clients with OUD who take medication as for clients with any other SUD. Counselors help clients recover by addressing the challenges and consequences of addiction. OUD is often a chronic illness requiring ongoing communication among patients and providers to ensure that patients fully benefit from both pharmacotherapy and psychosocial treatment and support. OUD medications are safe and effective when prescribed and taken appropriately. Medication is integral to recovery for many people with OUD. Medication usually produces better treatment outcomes than outpatient treatment without medication. Supportive counseling environments for clients who take OUD medication can promote treatment and help build recovery capital. Subs tance Abuse and Ment al Health Services Adminis tration4-iii TIP 63MEDICATIONS FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER\u2014Part 4 the Evidence on Counseling in Support of Medication To Treat About OUD and a Chronic Care Approach to Its Treatment . . TIP 63Overview and Context Scope of the Problem Opioid misuse has caused a growing nationwide epidemic of OUD and unintentional overdose deaths.1 This epidemic affects people in all regions, of all ages, and from all walks of life. Opioid misuse devastates families, burdens emergency departments and first responders, fuels increases in hospital admissions, and strains criminal justice and child welfare systems. Counselors can play an integral role in addressing this crisis. Counseling helps people with OUD and other substance use disorders (SUDs) change how they think, cope, react, and acquire the skills and confidence necessary for recovery. Counseling can provide support for people who take medication to treat their OUD. Patients may get counseling from prescribers or other staff members in the prescribers' practices or by referral to counselors at specialty addiction treatment programs or in private practice. Counselors and peer recovery support specialists can work with patients who take OUD med- ication and refer patients with active OUD to healthcare professionals for an assessment for treatment with medication.Partnering Addiction Treatment Counselors With Clients and Healthcare ProfessionalsPART 4 of 5 Part 4 uses \"counselor\" to refer to the range of professionals\u2014including recovery coaches and other peer recovery support services specialists \u2014who may counsel, coach, or mentor people who take OUD medication, although their titles, credentials, and range of responsibilities vary. At times, Part 4 refers to individuals as \"clients.\" For other key terms, see Exhibit 4.1. Part 5 of this TIP provides a full glossary and other resources related to the treatment of OUD. Counseling clients who take OUD medication requires understanding: Basic information about OUD. The role and function of OUD medications. Ways to create a supportive environment that helps clients work toward recovery. Counseling's role within a system of whole-person, recovery-oriented OUD care.Part 4 of this TIP is for addiction treatment professionals and peer recovery support specialists who work with individuals who take an FDA-approved medication for OUD\u2014methadone, naltrexone, or buprenorphine. These providers have direct helping relationships with clients. They don't prescribe or administer OUD medications, but they interact with healthcare profes- sionals who do. They also help people who take OUD medication access supportive services (e.g., transportation, child care, housing). 2 MILLION people in the U.S., ages 12 and older, had OUD involving PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS, HEROIN, or both in 2018.2 4-2Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 EXHIBIT 4.1. Key Terms Addiction: As defined by the American Society of Addiction Medicine,3 \"a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry\" (p. 1). It is characterized by inability to consistently abstain, impairment in behavioral control, craving, diminished recognition of significant problems with one's behaviors and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response. Like other chronic diseases, addiction often involves cycles of relapse and remission. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition4 (DSM-5), does not use the term for diagnostic purposes, but it commonly describes the more severe forms of OUD. Care provider: Encompasses both healthcare professionals and other professionals who do not provide medical services, such as counselors or providers of supportive services. Often shortened to \"provider.\" Healthcare professionals: Physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other medical service professionals who are eligible to prescribe medications for and treat patients with OUD (i.e., until October 1, 2023, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse midwives). The term \"prescribers\" also refers to these healthcare professionals. Maintenance treatment: Providing medications to achieve and sustain clinical remission of signs and symptoms of OUD and support the individual process of recovery without a specific endpoint (as is the typical standard of care in medical and psychiatric treatment of other chronic illnesses). Mutual-help groups: Groups of people who work together on obtaining and maintaining recovery. Unlike peer support (e.g., the use of recovery coaches), mutual-help groups consist entirely of people who volunteer their time and typically have no official connection to treatment programs. Most are self- supporting. Although 12-Step groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) are the most widespread and well-researched type of mutual-help groups, other groups may be available in some areas. They range from groups affiliated with a religion (e.g., Celebrate Recovery, Millati Islami) to purely secular groups (e.g., SMART Recovery, Women for Sobriety). Opioid misuse: The use of prescription opioids in any way other than as directed by a doctor; the use of any opioid in a manner, situation, amount, or frequency that can cause harm to self or others.5 Opioid receptor agonist: A substance that has an affinity for and stimulates physiological activity at cell receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) that are normally stimulated by opioids. Mu-opioid receptor full agonists (e.g., methadone) bind to the mu-opioid receptor and produce actions similar to those produced by the endogenous opioid beta-endorphin. Increasing the dose increases the effect. Mu- opioid receptor partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine) bind to the mu-opioid receptor. Unlike with full agonists, increasing their dose may not produce additional effects once they have reached their maximal effect. At low doses, partial agonists may produce effects similar to those of full agonists. Opioid receptor antagonist: A substance that has an affinity for opioid receptors in the CNS without producing the physiological effects of opioid agonists. Mu-opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., naltrexone) can block the effects of exogenously administered opioids. Opioids: All natural, synthetic, and semisynthetic substances that have effects similar to morphine. They can be used as medications having such effects (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine, oxycodone). Opioid treatment program (OTP): An accredited treatment program with Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) certification and Drug Enforcement Administration registration to administer and dispense opioid agonist medications that are approved by FDA to treat opioid addiction. Currently, these include methadone and buprenorphine. Other pharmacotherapies, such as naltrexone, may be provided but are not subject to these regulations. OTPs must provide adequate medical, counseling, vocational, educational, and other assessment and treatment services either onsite or by referral to an outside agency or practitioner through a formal agreement.64-3 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals EXHIBIT 4.1. Key Terms (continued) Opioid use disorder (OUD): Per DSM-5,7 a disorder characterized by loss of control of opioid use, risky opioid use, impaired social functioning, tolerance, and withdrawal. Tolerance and withdrawal do not count toward the diagnosis in people experiencing these symptoms when using opioids under appropriate medical supervision. OUD covers a range of severity and replaces what the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, termed \"opioid abuse\" and \"opioid dependence.\" An OUD diagnosis is applicable to a person who uses opioids and experiences at least 2 of the 11 symptoms in a 12-month period. (See Exhibit 2.13 and the Appendix in Part 2 for full DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for OUD.) Peer support: The use of peer support specialists in recovery to provide nonclinical (i.e., not requiring training in diagnosis or treatment) recovery support services to individuals in recovery from addiction and to their families. Peer support specialist: Someone in recovery who has lived experience in addiction plus skills learned in formal training. Peer support specialists may be paid professionals or volunteers. They are distinguished from members of mutual-help groups because they maintain contact with treatment staff. They offer experiential knowledge that treatment staff often lack. Prescribers: Healthcare professionals who are eligible to prescribe medications for OUD. Psychosocial support: Ancillary services to enhance a patient's overall functioning and well-being, including recovery support services, case management, housing, employment, and educational services. Psychosocial treatment: Interventions that seek to enhance a patient's social and mental functioning, including addiction counseling, contingency management, and mental health services. Recovery: A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential. Even individuals with severe and chronic SUDs can, with help, overcome their SUDs and regain health and social function. Although abstinence from all substance misuse is a cardinal feature of a recovery lifestyle, it is not the only healthy, prosocial feature. Patients taking FDA-approved medication to treat OUD can be considered in recovery. Recovery capital: The sum of the internal (e.g., motivation, self-efficacy, spirituality) and external (e.g., access to health care, employment, family support) resources that an individual can draw upon to begin and sustain recovery from SUDs. Recovery-oriented care: A service orientation that supports individuals with behavioral health conditions in a process of change through which they can improve their health and wellness, live self- directed lives, and strive to reach their full potential. Relapse: A process in which a person with OUD who has been in remission experiences a return of symptoms or loss of remission. A relapse is different from a return to opioid use in that it involves more than a single incident of use. Relapses occur over a period of time and can be interrupted. Relapse need not be long lasting. The TIP uses relapse to describe relapse prevention, a common treatment modality. Remission: A medical term meaning a disappearance of signs and symptoms of the disease.8 DSM-5 defines remission as present in people who previously met OUD criteria but no longer meet any OUD criteria (with the possible exception of craving).9 Remission is an essential element of recovery. Return to opioid use: One or more instances of opioid misuse without a return of symptoms of OUD. A return to opioid use may lead to relapse.4-4Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Setting the Stage Since the 1990s, dramatic increases in controlled medication prescriptions\u2014particularly opioid pain relievers\u2014have coincided with increases in their misuse.10 Since the mid-2000s, heroin11,12 and fentanyl (mainly illicit formulations)13 consumption has also sharply increased. People who turn to illicit drugs after misusing opioid medications have driven greater use of heroin and fentanyl, which are cheaper and easier to obtain. Approximately 1,500 OTPs currently dispense methadone, buprenorphine, or both.14 They may also offer naltrexone. Historically, OTPs were the only source of OUD medication and offered only methadone. Buprenorphine is increasingly available in general medical settings. Physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants (whether or not they're addiction specialists) can get a federal waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. These healthcare professionals can also prescribe and administer naltrexone, which does not require a waiver or OTP program certification. Until October 1, 2023, qualified clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthe - tists, and certified nurse midwives also can obtain a waiver to prescribe and administer buprenorphine in office-based settings. People with OUD should have access to the medication most appropriate for them. Medication helps establish and maintain OUD remission. By controlling withdrawal and cravings and blocking the euphoric effects of illicit opioids, OUD medication helps patients stop illicit opioid use and resolve OUD's psychosocial problems. For some people, OUD medication may be lifesaving. Ideally, patients with OUD should have access to all three FDA-approved pharmacotherapies. (See the \"Quick Guide to Medications\" section for an overview of each medication.) Many patients taking OUD medication benefit from counseling as part of their treatment. Counseling helps people with OUD change how they think, cope, react, and acquire the skills and confidence needed for recovery. Patients may get counseling from medication prescribers or staff members in prescribers' practices or by referral to counselors at specialty addiction treatment programs or in private practice. Exhibit 4.2 discusses recommending versus requiring counsel - ing as part of medication treatment for OUD. Distinguishing OUD From Physical Dependence on Opioid Medications According to DSM-5 ,15 OUD falls under the general category of SUDs and is marked by: Compulsion and craving. Tolerance. Loss of control. Withdrawal when use stops. Continued opioid use despite adverse consequences. Properly taken, some medications cause tolerance and physical dependence. Medications for some chronic illnesses (e.g., steroids for systemic lupus erythematosus) can make the body build tolerance to the medica - tions over time. If people abruptly stop taking medications on which they've become physically dependent, they can experience withdrawal symptoms. This can be serious, even fatal. Physical dependence on a prescribed, properly taken opioid medication is distinct from OUD and opioid addiction. OUD is a behavioral disorder associated with loss of control of opioid use, use despite adverse consequences, reduction in functioning, and compulsion to use. The professionals who revised DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for OUD made several significant changes. Among the most notable was differentiating physical dependence from OUD:The counselor's role with clients who take OUD medication is the same as it is with all clients who have SUDs: Help them achieve recovery by addressing addiction's challenges and consequences.4-5 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals Tolerance or withdrawal symptoms related to FDA-approved medications appropriately prescribed and taken to treat OUD (buprenor - phine, methadone) don't count toward diagnostic criteria for OUD. If the individual is being treated with an OUD medication and meets no OUD criteria other than tolerance, withdrawal, or craving (but did meet OUD criteria in the past), he or she is considered in remission on pharmacotherapy. Accepting this distinction is essential to working with clients taking OUD medica- tion. One common question about patients taking medication for OUD is \"Aren't they still addicted?\" The new DSM-5 distinction makes the answer to this question \"No, they're not still addicted.\" A person can require OUD medica- tion and be physically dependent on it but still be in remission and recovery from OUD. Understanding the Benefits of Medication for OUD Medication is an effective treatment for OUD.18,19,20 People with OUD should be referred for an assessment for pharmacotherapy unless they decline.21 To be supportive and effective when counseling clients who could benefit from or who take medication for OUD, know that: Treatment with methadone and buprenor - phine is associated with lower likelihood of overdose death compared with not taking these medications.22,23,24,25,26 Medication helps people reduce or stop opioid misuse.27,28,29,30 As Jessica's story in Exhibit 4.3 shows, even if people return to opioid use during treatment or don't achieve abstinence in the short term, medication lessens misuse and its health risks (e.g., overdose, injection-related infections).31 Patients taking FDA-approved medication used to treat OUD can join residential or outpatient treatment. Decades of clinical EXHIBIT 4.2. Recommending Versus Requiring Counseling The TIP expert panel affirms that counseling and ancillary services greatly benefit many patients. However, such counseling and ancillary services should target patients' needs and shouldn't be arbitrarily required as a condition for receiving OUD medication (although they are required by regulations in OTPs), especially when the benefits of medication outweigh the risks of not receiving counseling. The TIP expert panel recommends individualized treatment. Patients who choose to start medication and medication management with their prescriber without adjunctive counseling and don't adequately respond to such treatment should be referred to adjunctive counseling and more intensive services as needed.16 The law requires buprenorphine prescribers to be able to refer patients taking OUD medication to counseling and ancillary services. Buprenorphine prescribers may meet this requirement by keeping a list of referrals or by providing counseling themselves. The law doesn't require naltrexone prescribers to refer patients to additional services. However, FDA labels for both medications recommend counseling as part of treatment. Some treatment environments require counseling by regulation or contractual obligation. In other cases, a healthcare professional may believe that a patient taking OUD medication would benefit from counseling. Some healthcare professionals may require counseling, particularly if patients aren't responding well to medication. OUD is often a chronic medical illness.17 Treatment isn't a cure.4-6Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 experience in OTPs, which must provide counseling, suggest that patients taking OUD medication can fully participate in group and individual counseling, both cognitively and emotionally. Patients with concurrent SUDs (involving stimulants or alcohol) can benefit from residential treatment while continuing to take their OUD medication. Randomized clinical trials indicate that OUD medication improves treatment retention and reduces illicit opioid use.32,33,34 Retention in treatment increases the opportunity to provide counseling and supportive services that can help patients stabilize their lives and maintain recovery. The longer patients take medication, the less likely they are to return to opioid use, whereas short-term medically supervised with- drawal rarely prevents return to use:35,36,37,38,39 Conducting short-term medically super - vised withdrawal may increase the risk of unintentional fatal overdose because of decreased tolerance after withdrawal completion.40,41 Providing short-term medical treatment for OUD is the same as treating a heart attack without managing the underlying coronary disease.EXHIBIT 4.3. Jessica's Story About Medication Jessica is a 32-year-old who unsuccessfully quit heroin dozens of times. She had been in and out of treatment but says, \"It just never stuck. I'd always start using again when I left the program.\" Three years ago, her primary care doctor started prescribing her buprenorphine. Now Jessica says: Some days I pinch myself. I can't believe I got my life back. I tried quitting so many times but always got pulled back into the scene. Ever since I've been on buprenorphine, I haven't had any cravings. Even when I'm around triggers, they just don't set me off the same way. I've been able to get a job and I'm starting to build a community of friends who don't use. The hardest part about being on buprenorphine is that my emotions aren't masked anymore. I have to feel all of the sadness and fear that I was avoiding all these years. But it's good. I'm getting a chance to work through it. Providing longer courses of medication that extend beyond withdrawal can allow patients to stabilize. Getting stabilized, which may take months or even years, allows patients to focus on building and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Patients taking OUD medication can achieve long-term recovery. People who continue to take medication can be in remission from OUD and live healthy, productive lives.42 Reviewing the Evidence on Counseling in Support of Medication To Treat OUD Dedicated counseling can help clients address the challenges of extended recovery. For clients who seek a self-directed, purposeful life, counseling can help them: Improve problem-solving and interpersonal skills. Find incentives for reduced use and abstinence. Build a set of techniques to resist drug use. Replace drug use with constructive, rewarding activities.4-7 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals Moreover, evidence shows that counseling can be a useful part of OUD treatment for people who take OUD medication. Impact studies of counseling for people with SUDs show that: Motivational enhancement/interviewing is generally beneficial.43 This approach helps get people into treatment. It also supports behavior change and, thus, recovery. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of SUDs, whether used alone or in combination with other strategies.44 Clinical trials have not shown that CBT added to buprenorphine treatment with medical management is asso- ciated with significantly lower rates of illicit opioid use.45,46 However, a secondary analysis of one of those trials found that CBT added to buprenorphine and medical management was associated with significantly greater reduction in any drug use among participants whose OUD was primarily linked to misuse of prescription opioids than among those whose OUD involved only heroin.47 Thus, CBT may be helpful to those patients receiving buprenorphine treatment who have nonopioid drug use problems. Case management helps establish the stability necessary for SUD remission.48,49,50 Case management helps some people in SUD RESOURCE ALERT Principles of Effective Treatment In its Principles of Drug Addiction Treatment, the National Institute on Drug Abuse lists 13 principles of effective treatment (p. 2).59 Two principles that pertain to counseling are: \"No single treatment is effective for everyone. Treatment varies depending on the type of drug and the characteristics of the patients. Matching treatment settings, interventions, and services to an individual's particular problems and needs is critical to his or her ultimate success in returning to productive functioning in the family, workplace, and society.\" \"Effective treatment attends to multiple needs of the individual, not just his or her drug abuse. To be effective, treatment must address the individual's drug abuse and any associated medical, psychological, social, vocational, and legal problems. It is also important that treatment be appropriate to the individual's age, gender, ethnicity, and culture.\"treatment get or sustain access to services and necessities, such as: Food. Shelter. Income support. Legal aid. Dental services. Transportation. Vocational services. Family therapy can address SUDs and various other family problems (e.g., family conflict, unemployment, conduct disorders). Several forms of family therapy are effective with adolescents51 and can potentially address family members' biases about use of medica- tion for OUD.52 There is more research on combined methadone treatment and various psycho- social treatments (e.g., different levels of counseling, contingency management) than on buprenorphine or naltrexone treatment in office-based settings. More research is needed to identify the best interventions to use with specific medications, populations, and treatment phases in outpatient settings.53 Motivational intervention, case manage- ment, or both can improve likelihood of entry into medication treatment for OUD 4-8Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 among people who inject opioids, according to a systematic review of 13 studies plus data from a prior system- atic review.54 Clinical trials have shown no differ - ences in outcomes for buprenor - phine with medical management between participants who get adjunctive counseling and those who don't (i.e., prescriber-provided guidance focused specifically on use of the medication).55,56,57,58 Yet those trials: Relied on well-structured medical management sessions that may not be typical in practice. Excluded patients with certain co-occurring disorders or factors that complicated treatment. Benefits from counseling may depend on factors such as the number of sessions and adherence.60 Using a Recovery-Oriented Approach to Treating Patients With OUD Counseling for OUD gives patients tools to manage their illness, achieve and sustain better health, and improve their quality of life. There are limits to how much medication alone can accomplish. OUD medication will improve quality of life,61 but many clients in addiction treatment have complex issues that may decrease quality of life, such as: Other SUDs (e.g., alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder).62,63,64 Mental distress65 (i.e., high levels of symptoms) and disorders66,67,68 (e.g., major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder). Medical problems (e.g., hepatitis, diabetes).69 History of trauma.70,71 Poor diet, lack of physical activity, or both.72 Lack of social support.73 Unemployment.74RESOURCE ALERT Recovery-Oriented Treatment Recovery-Oriented Methadone Maintenance: This guide by Bamber and White is the most thorough document on this topic currently available and is applicable to clients receiving other medications for OUD (http://www.williamwhitepapers.com/pr/2011%20 Bamber-White%20Dialogue%20on%20Recovery- Oriented%20Methadone%20Maintenace.pdf ).

SAMHSA'S GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF RECOVERY76 Recovery emerges from hope. Recovery is person driven. Recovery occurs via many pathways. Recovery is holistic. Recovery is supported by peers and allies. Recovery is supported through relationships and social networks. Recovery is culturally based and influenced. Recovery is supported by addressing trauma. Recovery involves individual, family, and community strengths and responsibilities. Recovery is based on respect.4-9 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals Building confidence in ability to maintain abstinence (i.e., increasing abstinence-related self-efficacy) Finding ways to help other individuals who are new to recovery Help clients further grow recovery capital by offering or connecting them to a range of services, such as: Ancillary services (e.g., vocational rehabilitation, supported housing). Additional counseling. Medical services. Mental health services. Provide person-centered care Clients' confidence in their ability to stay away from illicit substances, or self-efficacy, is an important factor in successful change. In person-centered care, also known as patient- centered care: Clients control the amount, duration, and scope of services they receive. They select the professionals they work with. Care is holistic; it respects and responds to clients' cultural, linguistic, and socioenviron- mental needs.83 Providers implement services that recognize patients as equal partners in planning, devel- oping, and monitoring care to ensure that it meets each patient's unique needs.84Acknowledge many pathways to recovery Recovery occurs via many pathways.75 OUD medication may play a role in the beginning, middle, or entire continuum of care. Support clients in making their own informed decisions about treatment. Counselors don't need to agree with clients' decisions but must respect them. Educate new clients about: Addiction as a chronic disease influenced by genetics and environment. How medications for OUD work. What occurs during dose stabilization. The benefits of longer term medication use and the risks of abruptly ending treatment. Promote recovery for clients with OUD Focus on addressing personal and practical problems of greatest concern to clients, which can improve their engagement in treatment.77 Recovery supports can sustain the progress clients made in treatment and further improve their quality of life. Addressing the full range of client needs can improve clients' quality of life and lead to better long-term recovery outcomes. A recovery-oriented approach to traditional SUD counseling may help address client needs.78,79 Increasing recovery capital supports long-term abstinence and improved quality of life, espe- cially for clients who decide to stop medication. Clients with substantial periods of abstinence from illicit drugs identify these strategies for increasing recovery capital as helpful:80,81,82 Forging new relationships with friends/family Obtaining support from friends, family, partners, and communities Using positive coping strategies Finding meaning or a sense of purpose in life Engaging in a church or in spiritual practices Pursuing education, employment, or both Engaging in new interests or activities (e.g., joining a community group, exercising)RESOURCE ALERT Decision-Making Tool Decisions in Recovery: Treatment for Opioid Use Disorders is a SAMHSA web-based tool (https://mat-decisions-in-recovery.samhsa.gov/ ) to help people with OUD make decisions about treatment and recovery.4-10Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 A person-centered approach to OUD treatment empowers clients in making decisions, such as:86 Whether to take OUD medication. Which medication to take. Which counseling and ancillary services to receive. Fragmented healthcare services are less likely to meet the full range of patients' needs. Integrated medical and behavioral healthcare delivery provides patient-focused, comprehensive treatment that meets the wide range of symptoms and service needs that patients with OUD may have. Significant demand remains for better integrated and coordinated SUD treatment (including OTP), medical, and mental health services.87 Such improvements are particularly important for the many individuals with co-occurring substance use and mental disorders who receive OUD medication.88,89 In a randomized trial of methadone patients with co-occurring mental disorders receiving onsite versus offsite mental health services, those receiving services onsite had less psychiatric distress at follow-up.90 Promote family and social support Support from family and friends can be the most important factor in long-term recovery, according to many people who have achieved long-term recovery from OUD.91,92 Support from intimate partners helps all clients, especially women, avoid return to opioid use.93,94 But the more people in clients' social networks who use drugs, the more likely clients are to return to use.95,96Most clients are willing to invite a substance- free family member or friend to support their recovery.97 Most have at least one nearby family member who does not use illicit drugs.98 A client's community may provide a cultural context for their recovery and culturally specific supports that may not otherwise be available in treatment.99 Help clients develop and support positive relations with their families by: Suggesting that clients invite family and friends to aid in the recovery planning process (Exhibit 4.4). Emphasizing the importance of relationships with family and friends who actively support recovery. Supporting clients in mending broken relationships with loved ones. Helping clients cut ties with individuals who still use drugs or enable clients' drug use. Encouraging clients to build new relationships that support recovery.The confrontational/expert model that characterized much of SUD treatment in the past may harm some patients and inhibit or prevent recovery.85RESOURCE ALERT Treatment Guidance for Co- Occurring Substance Use and Mental Disorders TIP 42, Substance Abuse Treatment for Persons With Co-Occurring Disorders , provides SUD treatment strategies for people with mental disorders ( https://store.samhsa.gov/product/ tip-42-substance-abuse-treatment-persons-co- occurring-disorders/PEP20-02-01-004 ).

According to SAMHSA,100 trauma-informed counselors know what trauma is and also: Understand how trauma can affect clients, families, and communities. Apply knowledge of trauma extensively and consistently in both practice and policy. Know ways to promote recovery from trauma. Recognize the signs and symptoms of trauma in clients, families, staff members, and others. Resist things that may retraumatize or harm clients or staff. Incorporate trauma-informed principles of care into recovery promotion efforts, because: Trauma histories and trauma-related disorders may increase clients' risk for various problems, including early drop-out from treatment101 and greater problems with pain.102 Childhood trauma is highly prevalent among people with OUD.103,104 People often suffer multiple traumas during opioid misuse.105EXHIBIT 4.4. Engaging Reluctant Family Members in a Client's Treatment If the client agrees and has signed the appropriate releases, help even reluctant family members engage in the client's treatment to offer support. To reach out to family members who hesitate to engage, try to: Recognize that they have been harmed by their family member's substance use and that their participation in his or her recovery can help them heal, too. Ask them to recall some positive experiences they have had with the client. Introduce them to mutual-help groups and other supports for families (e.g., Nar-Anon, Learn to Cope, Parents of Addicted Loved Ones Group). Ensure that suggested groups don't have a negative option medication bias. Help them understand OUD, the treatment process, and medication's role in recovery. This knowledge can keep family members from pressuring the client to taper medication prematurely. Hold multifamily therapy groups or informal discussion sessions for families (with or without clients present) so that family members can learn from one another and share their experiences. Offer family or couples therapy as an option for additional support. An intervention that integrated trauma treatment and standard care (which goes further than the trauma-informed care detailed here) had better outcomes than standard care alone in a diverse group of women treated in various settings, including an OTP .106 RESOURCE ALERT Trauma-Informed Care TIP TIP 57, Trauma-Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services , has more information on providing trauma-informed care in SUD treatment programs ( https://store.samhsa .gov/product/TIP-57-Trauma-Informed-Care -in-Behavioral-Health-Services/SMA14-4816 ).4-12Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Quick Guide to Medications This section introduces the neurochemistry and biology of OUD and the medications that treat it. Reading this section will familiarize counselors with terminology healthcare profes- sionals may use in discussing patients who take OUD medication (see also Exhibit 4.1 and the comprehensive glossary in Part 5). Understanding the Neurobiology of OUD Opioid receptors are a part of the body's natural endorphin system. Endorphins are chemicals our bodies release to help reduce our experience of pain. They can also contribute to euphoric feelings like the \"runner's high\" that some people experience. When endorphins or opioids bind to opioid receptors, the receptors activate, causing a variety of effects. After taking opioids, molecules bind to and activate the brain's opioid receptors and release dopamine in a brain area called the nucleus accumbens (NAc), causing euphoria. Like opioid receptors, the NAc has a natural, healthy function. For example, when a person eats, the NAc releases dopamine to reinforce this essential behavior. The NAc is a key part of the brain's reward system. Opioid use leads to an above-normal release of dopamine, essentially swamping the natural reward pathway and turning the brain strongly toward continued use. The brain also learns environmental cues associated with this dopamine release. It associates specific people, places, and things (e.g., music, drug parapherna- lia) with the euphoria; these environmental cues then become triggers for drug use. Intermittent opioid use causes periods of euphoria followed by periods of withdrawal. The brain's strong draw toward euphoria drives repeated and continued use. Few people with OUD reexperience the euphoria they obtained early in their opioid use, yet they continue to seek it.Changes in brain function that result from repeated drug use cause a person who once took the drug for euphoria to seek it out of habit, then compulsion. People with OUD use opioids to stave off withdrawal. Without opioids, the person feels dysphoric and physically ill, only feeling normal by taking opioids again. At the same time, other areas of the brain begin to change:107 The amygdala, which is associated with feelings of danger, fear, and anger, becomes overactive. The frontal cortex, which is associated with planning and self-control, becomes underactive. The ability to control impulses diminishes, and drug use becomes compulsive. The need to escape the discomfort and intensely negative emotional states of withdrawal becomes the driving force of continued use. Even after opioid use stops, brain changes linger. A person's ability to make plans and manage impulses stays underactive. That's why return to substance use is very common even after a period of abstinence. Medications for OUD promote emotional, psychological, and behavioral stabilization. By acting directly on the same opioid receptors as misused opioids (but in different ways), medications can stabilize abnormal brain activity. Learning How OUD Medications Work The following sections describe how each of the OUD medications functions (Exhibit 4.5; see also Part 3 of this TIP for greater detail). Discuss questions or concerns about a patient's medi- cation, side effects, or dosage with the patient's prescriber after getting the patient's consent.4-13 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals EXHIBIT 4.5. FDA-Approved Medications Used To Treat OUD: Key Points MEDICATIONHOW IT'S TAKENWHY IT WORKS SIDE EFFECTS NOTES Bupre norphine Tablet dissolved under the tongue or film dissolved under the tongue or against the inside of the cheek. Taken once daily, every other day, or 3 times a week. It also comes as an implant that lasts 6 months or as an injection that lasts 1 month. Partially activates the opioid receptor. Reduces craving and blocks the euphoric effect of opioids.Can cause constipation, headache, nausea, insomnia, excessive sweating, or opioid withdrawal. Overdose is possible but less likely than with methadone. Overdose death risk is increased if buprenorphine is taken with alcohol or intravenously in combination with benzodiazepines or other syndrome methadone. Prescribers must have a special SAMHSA waiver but don't need to be part of a federally certified OTP. Can be prescribed through pharmacies or provided via OTPs. The implant and injection can only be prescribed by waivered providers who have completed REMS training. Methadone Liquid or tablet once daily. Dose may be divided for twice- daily dosing if medically necessary.Fully activates the opioid receptor. Reduces craving and blocks the euphoric effect of opioids.Can cause constipation, sleepiness, sweating, swelling of hands and feet, sexual dysfunction, heart arrhythmias, low blood pressure, fainting, and substance misuse. Can cause overdose death if increased too rapidly, taken in a much higher than usual dose, or taken concurrently with some substances and medications, particularly CNS depressants such as alcohol or benzodiazepines. NASInitially requires visits 6 to 7 times per week to an OTP. Patients can decrease attendance gradually based on time in treatment and clinical stability. Naltrexone Daily tablet (can also be taken 3 times a week) or monthly injection in buttock.Occupies the opioid receptors. Reduces craving and blocks the euphoric effect of opioids.Can cause nausea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, liver toxicity, depression and suicidality, muscle cramps, fainting, and loss of or decreased appetite or other appetite disorders; in the extended- release injectable formulation, can cause pain, swelling, and other complications at the injection site. Patient must complete withdrawal and stay opioid abstinent for at least 7 days before starting naltrexone and longer (e.g., 10 or more days) for long-acting opioids, such as methadone.Tablets are rarely effective. Monthly injections are more effective than tablets.4-14Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Buprenorphine Buprenorphine reduces opioid misuse, HIV risk behaviors, and overdose death.108,109,110,111 Buprenorphine only partially activates opioid receptors; it is a partial agonist. It binds to and activates receptors sufficiently to prevent craving and withdrawal and to block the effects of illicit opioids. Appropriate doses of buprenorphine shouldn't make patients feel euphoric, sleepy, or foggy headed. Buprenorphine has the benefit of a ceiling effect. Its effectiveness and sedation or respiratory effects don't increase after a certain dosing level, even if more is taken. This lowers risk of overdose and misuse.112 Groups at particular risk for buprenorphine overdose include children who accidentally ingest the medication113 and patients who also use CNS depressants like benzodiazepines or alcohol.114,115 (See Part 3 of this TIP for more information on concurrent use of CNS depressants and buprenorphine.) Buprenorphine is available outside of OTPs, through non-OTP healthcare settings (e.g., physicians' offices, outpatient drug treatment programs). Healthcare professionals (including nurse practitioners and physician assistants, per the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016, and, until October 1, 2023, qualified clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives, per the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act of 2018) can prescribe it outside of an OTP , provided they have a specific federal waiver. This is often referred to as \"being waivered\" to prescribe buprenorphine. Buprenorphine can cause opioid withdrawal in patients who have recently taken a full opioid agonist (e.g., heroin, oxycodone). This occurs because buprenorphine pushes the full opioid activator molecules off the receptors and replaces them with its weaker, partially activating effect. For this reason, patients must be in opioid withdrawal when they take their first dose of buprenorphine.The most common buprenorphine formulation contains naloxone to reduce misuse. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist. It blocks rather than activates receptors and lets no opioids sit on receptors to activate them. Naloxone is poorly absorbed under the tongue/against the cheek, so when taking the combined medication as directed, it has no effect. If injected, naloxone causes sudden opioid withdrawal. Buprenorphine comes in two forms that melt on the inside of the cheek or under the tongue: films (combined with naloxone) or tablets (buprenorphine/naloxone or buprenor - phine alone). For treatment of OUD, patients take the films or tablets once daily, every other day, or three times a week. Various companies manufacture these forms of the medication. Some are brand name, and some are generic. The different kinds vary in strength or number of milligrams, but they have been designed and tested to provide roughly the same amount of medication as the first approved product (Exhibit 3A.5 in Part 3). Buprenorphine is also available in a long- acting implant and long-acting injection that specially trained healthcare professionals place under the skin (subdermal implant) and an ex- tended-release formulation that is administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection). The implant is appropriate for patients who have been stable on low doses of the films or tablets. It lasts for 6 months and can be replaced once after 6 months. The extended release injection lasts for 1 month and can be repeated monthly. It is appropriate for patients who have been stabilized on the films or tablets for at least 7 days. Healthcare professionals with waivers can prescribe buprenorphine. Physicians who take an 8-hour training and get a waiver can prescribe buprenorphine. Nurse practitioners and physician assistants are eligible to apply for waivers after 24 hours of training. Until October 1, 2023, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives also are eligible to apply for waivers after 24 4-15 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals hours of training. Providers who wish to deliver buprenorphine implants must receive special training on how to insert and remove them. Buprenorphine can cause side effects including constipation, headache, nausea, and insomnia. These often improve over time and can be managed with dosage adjustments or other approaches. Methadone Methadone is highly effective. Many studies over decades of research show that it:116,117,118 Increases treatment retention. Reduces opioid misuse. Reduces drug-related HIV risk behavior. Lowers risk of overdose death. Methadone is slow in onset and long acting, avoiding the highs and lows of short-acting opioids. It is a full agonist. Patients who take the same appropriate dose of methadone daily as prescribed will neither feel euphoric from the medication nor experience opioid withdrawal. Methadone is an oral medication that is taken daily under observation by a nurse or phar - macist and under the supervision of an OTP physician. Methadone is available as a liquid concentrate, a tablet, or an oral solution made from a dispersible tablet or powder. Methadone blunts or blocks the euphoric effects of illicit opioids because it occupies the opioid receptors. This \"opioid blockade\" helps patients stop taking illicit opioids because they no longer feel euphoric if they use illicit opioids. When on a proper dose of methadone, patients can: Keep regular schedules. Lead productive, healthy lives. Meet obligations (family, social, work). Methadone can lead to overdose death in people who use a dose that's considerably higher than usual, as methadone is a full agonist. People who don't usually take opioids or have abstained from them for a while could overdose on a fairly small amount of methadone. Thus, patients start on low doses of methadone and gradually adjust upward to identify the optimal maintenance dose level. Patients must attend a clinic for dose adminis- tration 6 to 7 days per week during the start of treatment. Healthcare professionals can thus observe patients' response to medication and discourage diversion to others. Visit frequency can lessen after patients spend time in treatment and show evidence of progress. Methadone can cause certain side effects. Common potential side effects of methadone include: Constipation. Sleepiness. Sweating. Sexual dysfunction. Swelling of the hands and feet. Sleepiness can be a warning sign of potential overdose. Patients who are drowsy should receive prompt medical assessment to determine the cause and appropriate steps to take\u2014which may require a reduction in methadone dose. Some patients may appear sleepy or have trouble staying awake when idle, even if there is no immediate danger of evolving overdose. These patients may need a lower dose or may be taking other prescribed or nonprescribed medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, clonidine) that are interacting with the methadone. Naltrexone Naltrexone stops opioids from reaching and activating receptors, preventing any reward from use. Naltrexone is an antagonist of the opioid receptors\u2014it does not activate them at all. Instead, it sits on the receptors and blocks other opioids from activating them. Naltrexone appears to reduce opioid craving119 but not opioid withdrawal (unlike buprenorphine and methadone, which reduce both craving and withdrawal). Someone starting naltrexone must be abstinent from short-acting opioids for at least 7 days and from long-acting opioids for 10 to 14 days before taking the first dose. 4-16Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Otherwise, it will cause opioid withdrawal, which can be more severe than that caused by reducing or stopping opioid use. Naltrexone comes in two forms: tablet and injection. Patients take naltrexone tablets daily or three times per week. Tablets are rarely effective, as patients typically stop taking them after a short time.120,121,122 Highly externally monitored populations in remission may do well with the tablet,123,124,125 such as physicians who have mandatory frequent urine drug testing and are at risk of losing their licenses. The injected form is more effective than the tablet because it lasts for 1 month. Patients can come to a clinic to receive an intramuscu- lar injection in their buttock. Naltrexone can produce certain side effects, which may include: Nausea. Headache. Dizziness. Fatigue. For the extended-release injectable formulation, potential reactions at the injection site include: Pain. Bumps. Blistering. Skin lesions (may require surgery). Knowing What Prescribers Do The following sections will help explain the role healthcare professionals play in providing each OUD medication as part of collaborative care. Part 3 of this TIP offers more detailed clinical information. Administer buprenorphine Patients typically begin buprenorphine in opioid withdrawal. Patients may take their first dose in the prescriber's office so the prescriber can observe its initial effects. Increasingly often, patients take their first dose at home and follow up with prescribers by phone. Most people are stable on buprenorphine dosages between 8 mg and 24 mg each day. Patients who take buprenorphine visit their prescriber regularly to allow monitoring of their response to treatment and side effects and to receive supportive counseling. The visits may result in specific actions, such as adjusting the dosage or making a referral for psychosocial services. Stable patients may obtain up to a 30-day prescription of this medication through community pharmacies. Visits may include urine drug testing. Early in treatment, patients typically see their prescribers at least weekly. Further along, they may visit prescribers every 1 to 2 weeks and then as infrequently as once a month or less. The prescriber will make dosage adjustments as needed, reducing for side effects or increasing for unrelieved withdrawal or ongoing opioid misuse. OTPs that provide buprenorphine will typically follow a similar process, with the principal difference being that the program will administer or dispense the medication rather than the patient filling a prescription at a pharmacy. Administer methadone Only SAMHSA-certified OTPs may provide methadone by physician order for daily observed administration onsite or for self- administration at home by stable patients.126 The physician will start patients on a low dose of methadone. People in early methadone treatment are required by federal regulation to visit the OTP six to seven times per week to take their medication under observation. The physician will monitor patients' initial response to the methadone and slowly increase the dose until withdrawal is completely relieved for 24 hours. A prescriber can't predict at the start of treatment what daily methadone dose will work for a patient. An effective dose is one that eliminates withdrawal symptoms and most 4-17 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals craving and blunts euphoria from self- administered illicit opioids without producing sedation. On average, higher dosages of methadone (60 mg to 100 mg daily) are associated with better outcomes than lower dosages.127,128 That said, an effective dose of methadone for a particular patient can be above or below that range. The prescriber will continue to monitor the patient and adjust dosage slowly up or down to find the optimum dose level. The dose may need further adjustment if the patient returns to opioid use, experiences side effects such as sedation, starts new medications that may interact with methadone, or has a change in health that causes the previously effective dose to become inadequate or too strong. If patients taking methadone drink heavily or take sedatives (e.g., benzodiazepines), physicians may: Treat the alcohol misuse. Refer to a higher level of care. Address comorbid anxiety or depression. Decrease dosage to prevent overdose. Administer naltrexone To avoid severe withdrawal, prescribers will ensure that patients are abstinent from opioids at least 7 to 10 days before initiating or resuming naltrexone. Prescribers may require longer periods of abstinence for patients tran- sitioning from buprenorphine or methadone to naltrexone. Prescribers typically take urine drug screens to confirm abstinence before giving naltrex- one. Healthcare professionals can confirm absti- nence test\" with naloxone, a Healthcare professionals manage withdrawal symptoms with nonopioid medication. Prescribers are prepared to handle withdrawal caused by naltrexone despite a period of abstinence.129 Ideally, they administer the first injection before patients' release from residential treatment or other controlled settings (e.g., prison) so qualified individuals can monitor them for symptoms of withdrawal. Healthcare professionals typically see patients at least monthly to give naltrexone injections. For those taking oral naltrexone, prescribers schedule visits at their discretion. Thus, urine drug testing may be less frequent for these patients than for patients taking buprenorphine. But periodic drug testing should occur. There is only one dose level for injected naltrexone,130 so prescribers cannot adjust the dose. However, they can slightly shorten the dosing interval if the medication's effectiveness decreases toward the end of the monthly dosing interval. If the patient is having side effects or intense cravings, the prescriber may recommend switching to a different medication. Set expectations Ideally, prescribers will collaborate with counselors and other care providers involved in patients' care to set reasonable patient expectations. Medications can effectively treat OUD, but they don't treat other SUDs (save naltrexone, also FDA-approved to treat alcohol use disorder). Patients may still need: Counseling for psychosocial issues. Social supports/treatment to get back on track. Medications, therapy, or both for co-occurring conditions. Collaboration between all involved healthcare providers helps patients understand the OUD treatment timeline, which generally lasts months or years. Courses of medically supervised withdrawal or tapering are considerably less effective than longer term maintenance treatment Patients may still benefit from the counseling you can offer in addition to care from other providers, even if you can't communicate with those providers directly. 4-18Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 with buprenorphine or methadone and are often associated with return to substance use and a heightened risk of overdose.131,132,133,134 Counselor-Prescriber Communications OUD medication can support counselors' work with clients who have OUD, and counseling supports the work prescribers do with them. Good communication facilitates mutually supportive work (Exhibit 4.6). A counselor will probably: See patients more frequently than prescribers. Have a more complete sense of patients' issues. Offer providers valuable context and perspective. Help patients take medications appropriately. Ensure that patients receive high-quality care from their other providers. Obtaining Consent Get written consent from patients allowing communication directly with their providers (unless the counselor and the providers work in the same treatment program). The consent must explicitly state that the patient allows the counselor to discuss substance-use-related issues. It should also specify which kinds of in- formation the counselor can share (e.g., medical records, diagnoses). Consent forms must comply with federal and state confidentiality laws that govern the sharing of information about patients with SUDs.135,136 Carefully protect any identifying informa- tion about patients and their medical and treatment information. Don't send such infor - mation through unsecured channels, such as: Text messaging. Unsecure, unencrypted emails. Faxes to unsecured machines.Good communication with prescribers and other treatment team members allows everyone to work together to: Assess patient progress. Change treatment plans if needed. Make informed decisions about OUD medication. EXHIBIT 4.6. Example of Counselor-Prescriber Communication Counselor: Dr. Smith, thank you for referring Jeff to my counseling practice. I'd like to review with you the elements of the treatment plan we've developed. Prescriber: That would be really helpful. Counselor: We agreed to meet weekly while he's getting stabilized on the buprenorphine. The initial focus of our sessions will be helping Jeff expand his recovery support network. Prescriber: I'm glad to hear that you're following up on that. My nurse reported that he's alone in the waiting room before his appointments, and he also mentioned to me that he doesn't have anybody to talk with. Counselor: I suggested a support group for people taking buprenorphine that's in his neighborhood. We've also begun talking about recreational activities that can help him fill the time he used to spend with drug-using friends. Prescriber: I'll reinforce your suggestions when he comes in this Friday. Counselor: Also, he seems confused about where the film goes in his mouth. I urged him to discuss that with you. Prescriber: I'll make a note to go over that with him again on Friday.4-19 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals Phone calls are the most secure way to discuss patient cases, although it may be more conve- nient to reach out to healthcare professionals first through email. Structuring Communications With Prescribers Regular, structured communication can improve the flow of information between treatment teams. Some multidisciplinary programs produce regular reports for prescribers about patient progress. Exhibit 4.7 provides some strategies for discussing patient care with healthcare professionals. Helping Clients Overcome Challenges in Accessing Resources By collaborating with healthcare professionals in OUD care, counselors can help clients overcome challenges they face in obtaining treatment, such as: Ability to pay for OUD medication. Counselors are often already skilled in helping clients address treatment costs (e.g., facil- itating Medicaid applications, linking them to insurance navigators). Try to refer clients who face difficulty meeting prescription costs or copays back to the agency's financial department for sliding scale adjustments and ability-to-pay assessments. Also try to help patients find and apply for relevant pharma- ceutical company medication prescription plans. Transportation. Options to offer clients may include: Providing vouchers for public transportation. Providing information on other subsidized transportation options. Linking clients to peer support specialists and case managers who can arrange transportation. Assisting eligible clients in navigating Medicaid to obtain transportation services. If available, arranging for telehealth services to overcome clients' transportation barriers. Access to medication in disaster situations. Counselors can review options with patients for obtaining prescription replacements and refills or daily medicine dosing under various scenarios. This could include if their usual clinic or primary pharmacy is closed or if they're relocated without notice because of an unforeseen emergency. Also advise patients on the items to take with them in such scenarios to facilitate refills from a new EXHIBIT 4.7. Tips for Discussing Patient Care With Prescribers Identify the patient. Once the counselor has established secure communication through encrypted email or by phone, he or she should state the patient's name, date of birth, and medical record number (if obtained). Let prescribers know up front the purpose of the call. Begin by clearly describing the question or concern leading to the call. If it is simply to establish contact because of a shared patient, that's fine. Share any relevant information about the patient (if the patient has consented). If there is a concern about a side effect, for example, describe observed changes to the healthcare professional. If there is a concern about return to opioid use, describe which elements of the patient's behavior are worrisome. Work together to build a shared understanding of the patient's situation. The counselor likely has key information about the patient that the prescriber does not have, and vice versa. Discuss next steps with the healthcare provider before ending any communication to help coordinate patient care. Consider scheduling a check-in with each other to assess patient progress.4-20Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 medication-dispensing facility. Key materials include: Photo identification. Medication containers of currently pre- scribed medications (even if empty). Written prescriptions. Packaging labels that contain dosage, prescriber, and refill information. Any payment receipts that contain medication information. To overcome systemic barriers, help enact collaborative policies and procedures. Work with program management and the community at large to address the following issues: Connection to treatment: Counselors may be able to participate in community efforts to ensure that information on how to obtain treatment for OUD is available wherever people with OUD: Gather (e.g., all-night diners, bars, free health clinics, injection equipment exchanges). Seek help (e.g., emergency departments, houses of worship, social service agencies). Reveal a need for help (e.g., encounters with law enforcement and child welfare agencies). Encourage buprenorphine prescribers to make known their availability if they are prepared to accept new patients. Help disseminate lists of addiction treatment providers and share their infor mation via peer recovery specialists (see Part 5). Rapid assessment and treatment initiation: Try to help OUD pharmacotherapy providers, particularly in OTPs, streamline counseling intake processes to help patients receive medication efficiently. The expert panel of this TIP recognizes that same-day admission of patients with OUD may not be possible in all settings, but it's a worthwhile goal. Every program should streamline its intake processes and expedite admissions. Return to treatment: When patients dis- continue treatment prematurely and return to use of opioids, it can be hard for them to reengage in treatment because of the shame they feel or because there is a waiting list for admission. The waitlist problem may not be solvable because of capacity limitations, but all collaborative care team members\u2014 including counselors and prescribers\u2014should: Inform patients from intake onward that the program will readmit them even if they drop out. Encourage patients to seek readmission if they return to opioid use or feel that they are at risk for returning to opioid use. Inform patients of the importance of overdose prevention (see the \"Counseling Patients on Overdose Prevention and Treatment\" section). Provide continued monitoring if possible; it can range from informal quarterly check-ins to regularly scheduled remote counseling or peer support (e.g., from a recovery coach). Offer an expedited reentry process to encourage patients to return if they need to. Engage in active outreach and reengage- ment with OTP patients, which can be effective.137,138 Try to contact patients who have dropped out to encourage them to return. Creation of a Supportive Counseling Experience Maintaining the Therapeutic Alliance The therapeutic alliance is a counselor's most powerful tool for influencing outcomes.139 It underlies all types and modalities of therapy and helping services. A strong alliance welcomes patients into treatment and creates a sense of safety.4-21 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals Certain counselor skills help build and maintain a therapeutic alliance, including: Projecting empathy and warmth. Making patients feel respected and understood. Not allowing personal opinions, anecdotes, or feelings to influence the counseling process (unless done deliberately and with therapeutic intention).140 These skills are relevant for working with all patients, including those taking medication for OUD. Apply them consistently from the very first interaction with a patient through the conclusion of services. For example, recognize and reconcile personal views about medication for OUD so that they don't influence counseling sessions. Educating Patients About OUD and a Chronic Care Approach to Its Treatment Help ensure that patients understand the chronic care approach to OUD and their: Diagnosis. Prognosis. Treatment options. Available recovery supports. Prescribed medications. Risk of overdose (and strategies to reduce it). Seek to understand patients' preferences and goals. Doing so can help convey information meaningfully so patients understand the choices available to them. Also, help communicate patients' preferences and goals to healthcare professionals and family members. Educate colleagues and other staff members so they can help create a supportive experience for patients with OUD: Provide basic education to colleagues about medications for OUD and how they work. Share evidence on how these medications reduce risky behavior, improve outcomes, and save lives. Note that major U.S. and international guide- lines affirm use of medication to treat OUD. Ask about and address specific fears and concerns. Provide resources for additional information. Counseling Patients on Overdose Prevention and Treatment Know how to use naloxone to treat opioid overdose; share this information with patients and their family members and friends. Available by prescription (or without a prescription in some states), naloxone is an opioid antagonist that has successfully reversed many thousands of opioid overdoses. It comes in auto-injector and nasal spray formulations easy for laypeople to administer immediately on the scene of an overdose, before emergency responders arrive. Ask patients if they have a naloxone pre- scription or help them get it without one if possible. Providers may prescribe naloxone in addition to OUD medication. Counselors should check state laws to learn their jurisdiction's naloxone prescription and dispensation policies (see \"Resource Alert: Overdose Prevention/ Treatment\").COUNSELING PATIENTS WITH OUD WHO DON'T TAKE MEDICATION Patients who don't take an OUD medication after withdrawal are at high risk of return to opioid use, which can be fatal given the loss of opioid tolerance. Provide these patients with overdose prevention education and the overdose-reversal medication naloxone, or educate them about naloxone and how they can obtain it in their community. Advise them to report a return to opioid use or a feeling that they are at risk of relapsing. Work with them and their care team to either resume medication for OUD or enter a more intensive level of behavioral care.4-22Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Inform clients and their friends and families of any Good Samaritan laws in the jurisdiction, which protect against drug offenses for people who call for medical help while experiencing or observing overdose. Emphasize that a person given naloxone to reverse overdose must go to the emergency department, because overdose can start again when naloxone wears off. Consider working with the program admin- istrator to place a naloxone rescue kit in the office, if one is not already available. To be ready for an emergency, learn: The signs of overmedication (which may progress to overdose) and overdose itself. What to do if an overdose is suspected. How to administer naloxone. Consider working with the program admin- istrators to set up a program to distribute naloxone directly to patients. Many states allow organizations to do this under a standing RESOURCE ALERT Overdose Prevention/Treatment SAMHSA Opioid Overdose Good Samaritan Laws Project Lazarus' Naloxone: The Overdose Antidote Abuse Policy Map of Naloxone Overdose Prevention Laws (http://pdaps.org/datasets /laws-regulating-administration-of -naloxone-1501695139)order from a physician. Clients are more likely to access naloxone if their program provides it directly to them rather than sending them to another organization to get it. Learn more at Prescribe to Prevent (http://prescribetoprevent.org). Helping Patients Cope With Bias and Discrimination Patients taking medication for OUD must deal with people\u2014including family members, friends, colleagues, employers, and community members\u2014who are misinformed or biased about the nature of OUD and effective treatments for it (Exhibit 4.8). Wherever possible, such as in a counseling session or a community education forum, counter misunderstandings with accurate information. Emphasize the message that addiction is governed by more powerful brain forces than those that determine habits. As a result, having a lot of positive intent, wanting to quit, and working hard at it sometimes won't be enough. Remind patients about building recovery capital and sticking with their treatment plan and goals. A particularly good opportunity to do so arises when patients ask how to \"get off medication.\" Statements such as \"The longer you take medication, the more of your life you can get back and the less likely you are to return to opioid use\" and \"We usually recommend continuing medication long term because it helps people maintain recovery\" can help clients understand that they are following medical rec- ommendations and doing a good job of caring for themselves (Exhibit 4.9). People may think that addiction is just a bad habit or willful self-destruction and that someone who has difficulty stopping opioid misuse is lazy. They may view OUD medication as \"just another drug\" and urge patients to stop taking it.4-23 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals EXHIBIT 4.8. Conversation: Addressing Misinformation Mother of Patient: They want to put my son on methadone, but it's going to rot his teeth. Father of Patient: Yeah. I don't want him to look like he's on drugs when he's finally off them. Counselor: You have the impression that people who use drugs have bad teeth. And in many cases, that's true. But there are a lot of reasons why people with a substance use disorder develop teeth and gum problems\u2014such as a high-sugar diet, co- occurring depression that prevents them from taking good care of themselves, poor health that allows oral disease to develop, and lack of access to preventive dental care or treatment. But if your son practices good oral hygiene, his mouth will stay healthy while he takes methadone. Mother of Patient: What do you mean by \"oral hygiene\"? Counselor: Like all of us, he'll have to limit his sweets and brush and floss regularly. Methadone can reduce the flow of saliva, which means that not as much of the bacteria on his teeth will get washed away. So, he'll want to get good dental advice on how to address dry mouth if that's a problem for him. Regular dental checkups will be really important, too. Father of Patient: So, he won't trade his teeth for his recovery. Thanks\u2014that's one less thing to worry about! Review a client's motivation for tapering or quitting medication (Exhibit 4.10) and have a conversation about the best timing for such a change (Exhibit 4.11). If the client has consented to communication with other providers, inform the client's prescriber about the client's desires or intent so that shared decision making can take place. Be proactive in dispelling myths and providing facts about medications for OUD when coun- tering misconceptions and judgmental attitudes. Point out that multiple organizations consider individuals to be in recovery if they take OUD medication as prescribed, including: The American Medical Association.141 The American Society of Addiction Medicine.142 The National Institute on Drug Abuse.143 The Office of the Surgeon General.144 The World Health Organization.145Explain that alcohol and opioids are different substances with different effects on the body and brain. This counters the mistaken belief that people receiving buprenorphine or methadone are always \"high\" and as impaired as if they drank alcohol all day. People acquire tolerance to impairments that drinking causes in motor control and cognition. But this tolerance is partial; alcohol consumption always results in some deficits. Opioids don't have the same motor or cognitive effects. Complete tolerance develops to the psychoactive effects and related motor impairments opioids cause. If a person takes a therapeutic dose of opioid agonist medication as prescribed, he or she may be as capable as anyone else of driving, being emotionally open, and working produc- tively. Some people worry that OUD medication causes a \"high\" because they've seen patients taking OUD medication whose behavior was affected by other substances (e.g., benzodiaze- pines). Others may assume that someone is high 4-24Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 on a medication for OUD who isn't taking any such medication at all. Point out that many thousands of people are prescribed medication for OUD every year, are receiving appropriate treatment, and are indistinguishable from other people. People taking OUD medication rely on it to maintain daily function, like people with diabetes rely on insulin. Nevertheless, some people think that individuals taking buprenorphine or methadone are still addicted to opioids (Exhibit 4.9), even if they don't use illicit drugs. For people with OUD, the medication addresses the compulsion and craving to use. It also blocks the euphoric effects of illicit opioids, which over time helps people stop attempting to use. For people with EXHIBIT 4.9. Addressing the Misconception That an Opioid Medication Is \"Just Another Drug\" Concerned Colleague: These patients are just replacing one drug with another. Instead of heroin, they're using buprenorphine or methadone. Counselor: Actually, there's substantial research that medication for opioid use disorder helps patients stop feeling withdrawal and craving and allows them to get their life back on track. These medications keep patients in treatment and reduce crime and HIV risk behavior. Concerned Colleague: Yeah, but aren't they still addicted? Counselor: Physically dependent, yes; but addicted, no. There's an important difference. Someone addicted to heroin has to take the drug several times a day to avoid withdrawal. This usually leads to craving, loss of control, and taking more than intended. Drug-seeking behavior causes loss of family and friends. It makes the person unable to perform daily roles and meet obligations. Concerned Colleague: Yes, I know how addiction works. But isn't taking methadone an addiction, too? Counselor: Patients only take methadone once a day, and its makeup is different from heroin. Daily methadone lets the body stabilize so patients don't have the highs and lows that come from heroin use. If patients use heroin, the methadone blocks its effects; they don't get high. Methadone is taken orally, so there isn't the same danger of infection that comes with injection drug use. Taking methadone as part of a treatment program lets patients feel normal and focus on changing the other aspects of their lives that led to drug use. Concerned Colleague: But you just said they take methadone every day. Counselor: Yes. That is true of most medications for any disease, if you think about it. Patients have a physical dependence on the medication but are in remission from addiction. EXHIBIT 4.10. When a Patient Wants To Taper Medication or Stop Altogether Review the decision with the patient to determine the motivation for tapering or quitting medication and the best timing for such a change. Tell the prescriber that the patient wants to taper; shared decision making should guide the patient's decision. Avoid encouraging tapering, which can imply that recovery can only truly occur off of the medication.4-25 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals diabetes, medication addresses the problems caused by inadequate production of insulin by the pancreas. Medication allows both popula- tions to live life more fully. Focus on common ground\u2014all patients want a healthy recovery, and judging or isolating someone for return to use doesn't aid anyone's recovery. A divide may occur between patients in a group setting over return to opioid use. People in the OUD community typically are forgiving of return to opioid use and recognize that it can occur on the path to long-term recovery. However, some people in mutual-help communities judge those who return to use (see the \"Helping Clients Find Accepting Mutual-Help Groups\" section). Address judgmental attitudes through this analogy: People with diabetes whose blood sugar spikes aren't condemned and ejected from treatment. Dispel the myth that OUD medications make people sick. In fact, methadone and buprenor - phine relieve opioid withdrawal, even if patients don't feel complete relief in the first few days. Taking naltrexone too soon after opioid use can cause opioid withdrawal, but withdrawal symptoms can generally be managed success- fully. Point out that people taking medication for OUD sometimes get colds, the flu, or other illnesses, like everyone else. A similar misconcep- tion is that OUD medications make all patients sleepy. Exhibit 4.12 offers a sample dialog for responding to this misconception.It would be inappropriate for a medical team to refuse radiation for cancer patients because the team believes chemotherapy is always needed, or to refuse chemotherapy because they believe that radiation is always needed, regardless of each patient's diagnosis and condition. It would be just as inappropriate to refuse evidence- based treatment with medication for a patient with OUD, when that may be the most clinically appropriate course of treatment.EXHIBIT 4.11. Responding to a Patient's Desire To Taper Medication for OUD Patient: I want to taper off the buprenorphine. Counselor: You'd like to taper\u2014can you tell me why? Patient: I'm getting married. I want a fresh start. Counselor: You're saying you'd like to have this all behind you for the new phase in your life. Patient: Yeah, that's it. Counselor: Would it be alright if I share my concerns about that? Patient: Okay. Counselor: A big change\u2014whether it's having a baby, getting a new job, or getting married like you're about to do\u2014can be very exciting. But it can also be surprisingly stressful. You may want to consider staying on the medication during this transition to make sure you maintain your recovery. I'm just suggesting postponing a taper decision until you start getting settled into married life. Patient: I hear you. The last thing I want to do is mess up my marriage right away by using again.4-26Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 When return to opioid use comes up in a group counseling setting, messages about getting back on track and avoiding shaming and blaming apply just as much to the patients taking OUD medication as to other participants. This topic is an opportunity to address the dangers of overdose, especially the dangers of using an opioid after a period of abstinence or together with other CNS depressants. Helping Patients Advocate for Themselves Educate clients so they can advocate for their treatment and personal needs. Key topics include: Addiction as a chronic disease influenced bygenetics and environment. The ways that medications for OUD work. The process of dose stabilization. The benefits of longer term medication useand risks of abrupt treatment termination. The role of recovery supports (e.g., mutual- help groups) in helping achieve goals. Offer clients' family and friends education on these topics, as well, so that they can advocate for their loved ones. Encourage patients to let family and friends know how important they are and how valuable their support is. Also urge patients to ask loved ones to help them express concerns or fears. Role-playing can help patients self-advocate. It allows them to practice what to say, what reactions to expect, and ways to respond. Coach patients in active listening and in focusing on solutions rather than problems. Exhibit 4.13 gives an example of a counselor helping a client self-advocate. Urge patients to advocate for themselves beyond one-on-one conversations. Options include sharing educational pamphlets, inviting loved ones to a counseling session, or referring them to websites. Addressing Discrimination Against Clients Who Take OUD Medication Patients can face discriminatory actions when dealing with individuals, organizations, or systems that make decisions based on mis-information about, or biases against, the use of medication for OUD. The following sections highlight issues patients taking OUD medication may face and how counselors can help.EXHIBIT 4.12. Conversation: Redirecting a Concern to the Prescriber Concerned Colleague: A p atient in my group was falling asleep. I think his methadone dose is too high. Counselor: That' s an important observation. That certainly is possible, although there are many other possible explanations. What makes you think it's the medication and not lack of sleep or some other reason? Concerned Colleague: Because e veryone taking methadone falls asleep in group. Counselor: Our m edical staff members work hard to make sure that each patient is on the right dose. If a patient is falling asleep in group, you should alert the patient's physician right away, regardless of what medication they're taking. But I'm wondering if anything besides medication could be causing this issue. Concerned Colleague: W ell, this patient is struggling with having an all-night job. Counselor: It ma y be helpful to talk to the patient about moving to a group that meets at a time when he can be more rested. In any case, to be safe, you should call the patient's prescriber about reassessing him.4-27 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals Help clients address employment- related issues Under the Americans With Disabilities Act, employers cannot discriminate against patients taking medication for OUD.146 However, the law doesn't always stop employers from taking such action. For example, some employers conduct workplace urine drug testing, either before offering employment or randomly during employment. The OUD medication they test for most frequently is methadone, but it's possible to test for bu- prenorphine. Naltrexone is generally not tested for. The TIP expert panel concludes, based on multiple patient experiences, that patients who take OUD medication find it intimidating to explain to their employers why their urine test results are positive for opioids. Yet if they offer no explanation, they don't get the callback for the job or are let go from the job they have.EXHIBIT 4.13. Conversation: Helping a Client Self-Advocate Patient: My mom is driving me to my back surgery. I'm worried that she'll find out I'm taking buprenorphine. Counselor: It sounds like you're worried she'll reject you and be upset if she knows you're taking medication. Patient: I think she'll be disappointed in me. She thinks people who take addiction medication are still on drugs. Counselor: What would you think about finding a time before your surgery to tell your mother that you're taking buprenorphine? You can explain how it works and remind her how well you've been doing maintaining your job, regaining custody of your children, and living a balanced and healthy life. That may help ease her fears. Patient: Thanks. I'll give that a try. Counselor: If you want, you could invite her to one of our sessions so that I can answer any questions she has. Patient: Yeah, she may hear it better from you. I like the idea of having her come in after I've told her. Counselor: When would be a good time to bring up this topic? Patient: She's driving me to my pre-op appointment on Friday. Maybe I'll suggest we go for coffee after. Counselor: That's a good idea. How about we practice that conversation? I'll play the role of your mom. RESOURCE ALERT Becoming a Certified Medication- Assisted Treatment Advocate The National Alliance for Medication Assisted Recovery has a training and credentialing program for interested people\u2014not just those who receive medication for OUD\u2014to become Certified Medication-Assisted Treatment Advocates (www.methadone.org/certification /faq.html).Direct patients to legal resources and help them consider how to respond to discrimina- tion at work based on misinterpreted drug tests. Offer to speak with their prospective/ current employers to address concerns and misperceptions about OUD medication and its effect on their ability to do work tasks.4-28Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Understand potential legal issues This section describes issues that can affect access to care for patients involved in the justice system who take buprenorphine or methadone for OUD. These issues usually don't apply for naltrexone. Many jails (short term) and prisons (long term) restrict or disallow access to OUD medication despite the federal mandate that people who are incarcerated have access to medical care.147,148 For example: A jail may not continue methadone treatment or allow methadone delivery by patients' OTPs. Patients' medication may be seized upon arrest. Jail health officials may deny patients' bu- prenorphine prescriptions. Help negotiate patient access to OUD medication during incarceration. Negotiating access to OUD medication can be problematic and often requires multiple meetings between care providers and jail staff members to resolve successfully. Patients taking OUD medication may be forced to go without medication during incarceration. This increases their risk for opioid overdose if they return to use after reentering the community, given the decreased tolerance that results from interrupted treatment. Encourage patients to reengage in treatment as soon as they're released. People with OUD released from prison or jail who don't take OUD medication have higher risk of overdose death during their first few weeks in the community. Early after release, they are at very high risk of overdose, given possible: Decrease in opioid tolerance while incarcerated. Lack of appropriate OUD therapy while incarcerated. OUD medication initiation right before release. Release without coordination or a slot for community-based treatment. Patients who aren't opioid tolerant need a lower starting dose that prescribers will increase more slowly than usual. Extended-release injectable naltrexone can be an effective alternative for these patients.Support patients in getting legal advice or counsel via their OUD medication prescribers' healthcare organization. Members of the TIP expert panel have observed situations in which law enforcement personnel arrested patients leaving methadone clinics and charged them with driving under the influence or arrested them after finding buprenorphine prescription bottles in their cars. Discussions among treatment orga- nizations and local law enforcement leadership can help address such situations. Address concerns and advocate for addiction specialists to select treatments best suited for each patient. Sometimes, authorities insist that patients enter a particular kind of treatment or follow particular rules related to their OUD. To ensure a patient-centered focus, help involve addiction specialists in determining what kind of treatment best meets patients' needs. This kind of advocacy works best when counselors and the programs for which they work have preexisting relationships with personnel in local employ- ment, law enforcement, drug court, and child welfare facilities. Address issues in dealing with healthcare providers Misunderstandings about OUD and its treatment aren't rare among healthcare providers: Patients admitted to the hospital for medical issues may face prejudice from hospital staff members. Providers may not know how to manage patients' OUD medication during their hospital stay. OPIOID ADDICTION is linked with high rates of ILLEGAL ACTIVITY and INCARCERATION.149,1504-29 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals Some providers don't know how to manage pain in someone taking medication for OUD. Help communicate issues to patients' prescribers, who can advocate for proper handling of OUD medication. It is also possible to help hospital staff members see the patient as a whole person who deserves respect and to provide them with essential information about treatment for OUD. Inpatient SUD treatment facilities may refuse admission until patients are off buprenorphine or methadone. Sometimes, patients taking OUD medication seek admission to inpatient facilities for treatment of an additional SUD, a mental disorder, or both. If a facility won't accept someone on OUD medication, call on local or state regulatory authorities (e.g., the State Opioid Treatment Authority) and patients' healthcare professionals to intervene with the facility's professional staff and management. Demonstrate awareness of pregnancy and parenting issues Healthcare professionals may be unaware of current guidelines for treating pregnant women with OUD (Exhibit 4.14). As a result, they may inappropriately: Deny OUD medication to pregnant women. Discourage breastfeeding by mothers taking OUD medication. RESOURCE ALERT Treatment of Pain in Patients With OUD SAMHSA's TIP 54, Managing Chronic Pain in Adults With or in Recovery From Substance Use Disorders (https://store.samhsa.gov/product/TIP -54-Managing-Chronic-Pain-in-Adults-With-or -in-Recovery-From-Substance-Use-Disorders /SMA13-4671)RESOURCE ALERT Pregnancy- and Parenting-Related Issues SAMHSA's Clinical Guidance for Treating Pregnant and Parenting Women With Opioid Use Disorder and Their Infants (https://store .samhsa.gov/product/SMA18-5054) Direct women who become pregnant while taking OUD medication to undergo with- drawal from their medication and attempt abstinence. Hospital policies on screening infants for prenatal substance exposure vary considerably. A positive screen may trigger involvement of Child Protective Services. This may occur even when the positive screen results from treatment with OUD medication under a physician's care rather than opioid misuse. Help pregnant and postnatal clients in these situations by: Educating them and encouraging them to share pertinent information and resources with healthcare professionals involved in their care. Coordinating with their prescribers to help them get prenatal and postnatal care from well-informed healthcare professionals. Getting involved in efforts to educate the local healthcare community about best practices for the care of pregnant and postnatal women with OUD. Legal problems can arise if Child Protective Services or legal personnel don't understand that parents receiving OUD medication are fully capable of caring for children and con- tributing to their families. Judges, probation or parole officers, or Child Protective Services workers may inappropriately request that patients discontinue medication as a condition of family 4-30Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 reunification. Such orders are medically inappro - priate and should be challenged. Possible ways to help: Write letters to judges and lawyers explaining how effective OUD medication can be. Send judges and lawyers literature about current medical recommendations (including this TIP). Testify in court, if necessary. Helping Clients Find Accepting Mutual- Help Groups Voluntary participation in 12-Step groups can improve abstinence and recovery-related skills and behaviors for some people with SUDs. Greater involvement (e.g., being a 12-Step sponsor) can increase these benefits.152,153,154,155 However, not much research has explored less widespread types of groups (e.g., groups that follow a given religion's principles, secular groups that downplay the spiritual aspects of 12-Step groups). Research exploring longitudinal outcomes for people with OUD who attend NA is limited, but findings link more frequent atten - dance with abstinence.156,157,158Clients taking medication for OUD may face challenges in attending mutual-help groups. For example: NA, the most widely available program, treats illicit opioids and OUD medications equally in gauging abstinence and recovery. NA doesn't consider people taking OUD medication \"clean and sober.\"159 Local chapters of NA may decide not to allow people taking OUD medication to participate at meetings or may limit their participation (e.g., not allowing service work). Clients attending some NA meetings may encounter hostile attitudes toward the use of medication. AA's official policy is more accepting of the use of prescribed medication, but clients may still encounter negative attitudes toward their use of medications for OUD. Other groups, such as some religious mutual- help programs, SMART Recovery, and LifeRing Secular Recovery, also have policies that could challenge clients for taking medication for OUD.EXHIBIT 4.14. Summary of Current Guidance for the Treatment of Pregnant Women With OUD An obstetrician and an addiction treatment provider should comanage care, and the woman should receive counseling and supportive services as needed to assist her in achieving a stable life. Treatment with methadone or buprenorphine without naloxone during pregnancy is recommended. Treatment with naltrexone is not recommended during pregnancy. Medically supervised withdrawal during pregnancy is typically not advisable. If not done with great care in a controlled setting, it can cause premature labor, fetal distress, and miscarriage. Attempts at abstinence from opioids without the support of medication are generally not advised because of the risk of return to opioid use, which can adversely affect both mother and fetus. Newborns of women who take OUD medication often show symptoms of NAS, which is treatable. NAS from opioid agonist treatment is not as harmful to the fetus as continued use of illicit opioids during pregnancy. Mothers stabilized on medication for OUD are encouraged to breastfeed. Summarized from SAMHSA's publication A Collaborative Approach to the Treatment of Pregnant Women With Opioid Use Disorders (https://store.samhsa.gov/product/A-Collaborative-Approach-to -the-Treatment-of-Pregnant-Women-with-Opioid-Use-Disorders/SMA16-4978 ).1514-31 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals Prepare clients who take medication for OUD to attend mutual-help meetings Clients will be better able to find supportive mutual-help groups if their counselor and program: Evaluate attitudes toward medication for OUD among local mutual-help groups. Keep on hand information about all mutual- help options available in the clients' area. Recruit volunteers from mutual-help groups to help clients find and attend meetings (e.g., by providing transportation, serving as \"sponsors,\" introducing clients). Do not mandate meeting attendance. Recommending participation is just as effective.160 Keep track of clients' experiences at different groups to ensure that meetings remain welcoming. Help clients start onsite mutual-help groups. Ask staff members to evaluate their own feelings and beliefs about mutual-help groups.161 Facilitate positive mutual-help group experiences Educate clients about mutual-help groups. Explore group types, risks and benefits of participation, and limitations of research in support of those risks and benefits. Suggest buddying up. Clients can attend meetings with other people who take medi- cation for OUD. Review with clients their understanding of and prior experience with mutual help. Explore clients' understanding of the benefits and risks of disclosure about taking OUD medication. Develop a risk-reduction plan for disclosure if clients want to share their use of OUD medication (e.g., talking with an individual group member instead of disclosing to the entire group).RESOURCE ALERT Addressing Bias and Discrimination Are You in Recovery From Alcohol or Drug Problems? Know Your Rights: Rights for Individuals on Medication-Assisted Treatment: SAMHSA publication explaining patient rights and federal laws that protect people receiving OUD medication. Describes whom these laws protect and what they cover, including employment, housing, services, and public accommodations (https://www.samhsa.gov/ sites/default/files/partnersforrecovery/docs/ Know_Your_Rights_Brochure_0110.pdf ) Know Your Rights: Employment Discrimination Facts: Legal Action Center publication that dispels myths and provides facts about OUD medication (https://dmh.mo.gov/media/pdf/methadone- maintenance-myths-and-resources) Methadone Maintenance Myths and Resources: factsheet ( https://dmh.mo.gov/media/pdf/ methadone-maintenance-myths-and-resources) 4-32Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Help clients anticipate and learn to handle negative responses: Develop sample scripts clients can use when questioned about their medication. Role-play scenarios in which clients respond to questions about their use of medication. Respect the privacy of clients' participation in mutual-help groups and recognize that some groups ask that participants not discuss what occurs in meetings. Make sure clients know they can talk about their experiences in mutual-help groups but don't pressure them to disclose in these groups that they take OUD medication. Consider mutual-help participation using groups more open to OUD medication (e.g., attending AA even if the client has no alcohol use disorder; attending groups for co- occurring substance use and mental disorders, such as Dual Recovery Anonymous or Double Trouble in Recovery). Clients with OUD who attend AA and not NA have similar recovery- related outcomes and retention rates.162Online mutual-help groups Before recommending an online group, check its content and tone on the use of medication. Mutual help using the Internet (either through real-time chat rooms or discussion boards where one posts and waits for responses) has been growing in popularity. This is an especially valuable resource for clients living in rural and remote areas. Groups range from general meetings for people with a particular SUD (e.g., online AA meetings) to those that are very specific (e.g., Moms on Methadone). Moderated groups are preferable to unmoderated groups. TIP 60, Using Technology-Based Therapeutic Tools in Behavioral Health Services, addresses many of the pros and cons of online support groups.163 Part 5 of this TIP gives links for several groups that the TIP expert panel has identified as helpful. RESOURCE ALERT Mutual Help for Clients With OUD William White's Narcotics Anonymous and the Pharmacotherapeutic Treatment of Opioid Addiction in the United States: Publication that gives more information on the pros and cons of 12-Step groups for people receiving medication for OUD and how to prepare them for meetings164 (http://atforum.com/documents /2011NAandMedication-assistedTreatment.pdf ) White, Galanter, Humphreys, and Kelly's \"The Paucity of Attention to Narcotics Anonymous in Current Public, Professional, and Policy Responses to Rising Opioid Addiction\": Peer- reviewed journal article on the benefits of NA and the need to include it among the options offered to people receiving medication for OUD165 (www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0734732 4.2016.1217712)RESOURCE ALERT How To Use Technology-Based Tools in Behavioral Health Services SAMHSA's TIP 60, Using Technology-Based Therapeutic Tools in Behavioral Health Services, is available from the SAMHSA Store (https://store.samhsa.gov/product/TIP-60 -Using-Technology-Based-Therapeutic-Tools -in-Behavioral-Health-Services/SMA15-4924). In addition to discussing online mutual-help groups, this TIP can help counselors implement technology-assisted care for patients with OUD. It highlights the importance of using technology- based assessments and interventions and discusses how technology reduces barriers to treatment.4-33 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals Mutual-help groups specific to OTPs Although these meetings occur mostly on the premises of OTPs, it may be possible to use the models developed by OTPs in more general SUD treatment settings. Because they serve only patients receiving medication to treat OUD, OTPs can create and sustain onsite mutual- help groups specific to this population. Such groups include Methadone Anonymous (MA),166 other variations on a 12-Step model,167,168 and the mutual-help component of Medication- Assisted Recovery Services (MARS). MARS is a recovery community organization, not just a mutual-help program. MARS members design, implement, and evaluate a variety of peer- delivered recovery support services in addition to providing meetings. More information on these programs is in the articles cited and online resources presented in Part 5. Facilitating Groups That Include Patients Taking OUD Medication Foster acceptance via attitude and behavior when facilitating groups that include patients taking OUD medication: Establish ground rules about being respect- ful, avoiding negative comments about group members, and keeping statements made in the group confidential\u2014as with any group. Be proactive. State up front that ground rules apply to everyone, regardless of a given person's decisions about whether to include OUD medication in his or her path to recovery. Ask members to discuss how to address any negative comments, should they occur. This is especially important for mixed groups. Ask group members to affirm that they will abide by the rules. Provide consistent reminders throughout each session about the ground rules. Group members may still make negative comments about medication for OUD. Avoid feeding the negativity with attention, which can worsen the situation. Reframe negative comments to express underlying motivations, often based on fear or misunderstanding. Remain positive; model expected behavior, which can benefit the person who made the negative remark (Exhibit 4.15). Additional tips for leading mixed groups include the following: Treat patients taking OUD medication the same as other patients in the group. Patients taking medication can participate in and benefit from individual and group counseling just like other patients. There is no need to have separate counseling tracks EXHIBIT 4.15. Redirecting Negative Comments Petra: How can you say Joni is in recovery when she's still taking a drug every day? I struggled every day and never took anything for 10 years. Counselor: I hear your concern for Joni. You want her recovery to follow the same path you took in yours. Petra: Right! And she's taking methadone, which is an opioid. People use opioids to get high. Counselor: In this treatment program, we see addiction as a brain disease. Methadone treats the brain disease part of addiction. It stabilizes the brain and allows the person to focus on learning new ways of thinking and reacting. It works by blocking the effects of other opioids. Patients on a proper dose can't get high even if they try to use. This helps discourage future drug use. Joni, would you like to add anything? Joni: Petra, it's great that you stopped using opioids and stayed in recovery without medication\u2014but everyone has a different path to recovery. For me, medication helps me hold a job, take care of my kids, stay focused in my counseling sessions, and feel normal.4-34Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 based on OUD medication status, nor should that status limit a participant's responsibilities, leadership role, or level of participation. Meet with patients taking OUD medication in advance to prepare them for mixed- group settings. Advise them that they don't have to disclose their medication status to the group, just as they don't have to disclose any other health issues. Counsel them that if they choose to talk about their medication status, it helps to talk about how medication has helped shape their personal recovery. Don't single out patients taking OUD medication. Let participants decide whether to tell the group about any issue they want to share, including medication status. If a patient chooses to disclose that status, follow up after the session to ensure that he or she is in a positive space and feels supported. Keep the session's focus on the topic and not on the pros and cons of medication for OUD. If the person receiving medication for OUD or other group members have specific questions about such medications, have them ask their healthcare professionals. Reinforce messages of acceptance. During the wrap-up discussion at the end of a session, members may comment on points that stood out for them. This is a chance to restate information accurately and model respect for each patient's road to recovery, whether it includes OUD medication or not. Review confidentiality rules. Affirm that patients' OUD medication status will not be shared with other group members. Remind participants to think carefully before sharing personal details such as their medication status with the group, because other partic- ipants may not respect confidentiality even if they have agreed to do so as part of the group guidelines.The TIP expert panel recommends communication among providers as the standard of care for OUD treatment and recovery support. Carefully consider deviations from this standard, which should occur only rarely. That said, individualize decisions about collaborative communication among providers to each patient's unique preferences, needs, and circumstances.Other Common Counseling Concerns Patients must sign releases to permit ongoing conversations between care providers in accordance with federal regulations on con- fidentiality of medical records for patients in treatment for an SUD (42 CFR Part 2). When patients' primary care providers, prescribers of medication for OUD, and addiction-specific counselors don't work for the same entity, patients must consent for them to share information. It can be challenging when a patient refuses to consent to collaborative communication among his or her healthcare team members. In these cases, the professionals involved must decide whether they will continue to provide either medication or counseling services without permission to collaborate. In other words, is cross-communication among all providers required for collaborative care? The answer to this complicated question depends on each patient's circumstances.4-35 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals Patients may not consent to communication among providers if they: Have experienced discrimination in health- care systems. Have developed OUD after taking opioid pain medication. Have legitimate cause not to trust providers (e.g., perceiving themselves as having been abused by a healthcare professional).169 Are not ready to make primary care providers aware of their disorder, even (or especially) if those providers have been prescribing opioid pain medication. Encounter problems in making progress toward recovery. After typically consenting to communication among providers, a patient's sudden revocation may signal trouble in recovery. Exhibit 4.16 lists common collaborative care issues and responses counselors can consider. Suggested responses assume that patients have consented to open exchange of information among all providers. EXHIBIT 4.16. Common Collaborative Care Issues and Possible Counselor Responses POTENTIAL MEDICATION- RELATED ISSUE COUNSELOR RESPONSE The patient complains of continued cravings.Talk with the patient about his or her medication adherence. Review with the patient strategies for overcoming cravings using a CBT model. Communicate with the prescriber to see whether dosage can be adjusted to subdue the cravings. A patient taking methadone does not appear engaged in counseling sessions and seems drowsy during conversations.Ask the patient whether drowsiness is caused by lack of sleep, disturbed sleep, substance use, or overmedication. Consider obtaining a spot urine test (if available). In all cases of drowsiness, alert the prescriber immediately so that the cause can be determined. This is particularly important during the first few weeks of treatment. The patient is at risk for return to opioid use.Inform the prescriber if the patient appears at risk for return to use given cravings, life stressors, changes in social circumstances, new triggers, or the like. This alerts the prescriber to monitor the patient more closely and consider medication changes to reduce likelihood of return to use. The patient has recently returned to opioid misuse after a period of abstinence.Gather details about circumstances surrounding the incident of use and, in collaboration with the prescriber and the patient, adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Reinforce the patient's understanding of the increased risk of opioid overdose given altered levels of tolerance. Continued on next page4-36Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 EXHIBIT 4.16. Common Collaborative Care Issues and Possible Counselor Responses (continued) POTENTIAL MEDICATION- RELATED ISSUE COUNSELOR RESPONSE The patient is discussing chronic pain with the counselor.Direct the patient to a healthcare professional for assessment of pain and medical treatment as necessary. If indicated as appropriate by a healthcare professional, provide CBT for dealing with pain or instruct the patient in adjunct methods for pain relief (e.g., meditation, exercise, physical therapy). The patient is asking the counselor for medical advice on what dose to take, side effects, how long to stay on the medication, and the like.Answer questions based on your knowledge of medications for treatment of OUD but don't provide medical advice. Refer the patient to the prescriber for that. As appropriate, contact the prescriber with the patient to have a three-way discussion. The counselor or patient is concerned that the prescriber is not giving quality care. As appropriate, advocate for the patient with the prescribing medical team. The patient discloses use of other drugs.Use motivational interviewing techniques to have a collaborative conversation about the details of this drug use. For example, give a response like \"Tell me more about this,\" followed by questions about the specific drugs used, why they were used, and what the patient's thoughts are about changing that drug use. The patient discloses that she is pregnant.Advise the patient to contact her prescriber immediately no matter what medication she is taking. Work with her to help her get access to prenatal care (if she doesn't have it already) and other health services related to pregnancy as needed. The patient has a positive urine screen.Using motivational interviewing tools, discuss with the patient the context of the substance use and what implications this use may have for the treatment plan. If the patient denies the substance use, reconsider the patient's readiness to change and how it affects the treatment plan.4-37 TIP 63Part 4 of 5\u2014Partnering Addiction Counselors With Clients and Healthcare Professionals 14 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

The AUDIT-C is a modified version of the 10 question AUDIT instrument. Clinical Utility The AUDIT-C is a brief alcohol screen that reliably identifies patients who are hazardous drinkers or have active alcohol use disorders. Scoring The AUDIT-C is scored on a scale of 0-12. Each AUDIT-C question has 5 answer choices. Points allotted are: a = 0 points, b = 1 point, c = 2 points, d = 3 points, e = 4 points In men, a score of 4 or more is considered positive, optimal for identifying hazardous drinking or active alcohol use disorders. In women, a score of 3 or more is considered positive (same as above). However, when the points are all from Question #1 alone (#2 & #3 are zero), it can be assumed that the patient isdrinking below recommended limits and it is suggested that the provider review the patient's alcohol intake over the past few months to confirm accuracy. 3 Generally, the higher the score, the more likely it is that the patient's drinking is affecting his or her safety.

Take medications only as prescribed. Don't use drugs when you are alone. Don't use multiple substances at once. Have naloxone available and make sure others know where it is and how to use it. Use a small \"test dose\" if returning to opioid use after a period of abstinence, if the substance appears altered or has been acquired from an unfamiliar source. Beware: This doesn't guarantee safety; illicitlymanufactured fentanyl or other substances may be present in the drug, and any use may be fatal. Overdose Identification Fingernails or lips are blue or purple. Breathing or heartbeat is slow or stopped. The person is vomiting or making gurgling noises. The person can't be awakened or is unable to speak. Overdose Response Call 9-1-1. Administer naloxone (more than one dose may be needed to restore adequate spontaneous breathing). Perform rescue breathing. If certified to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation, perform chest compressions if there is no pulse. Put the person in the \"recovery position,\" on his or her side and with the mouth facing to the side toprevent aspiration of vomit, if he or she is breathing independently. Stay with the person until emergency services arrive. Naloxone's duration of action is 30-90 minutes. The person should be observed after this time for a return of opioid overdose symptoms.

Ask patients to sign a release of information to speak with the other prescribers. Patients who are unwilling to sign a release of information are poor candidates for outpatient treatment. Review the clinic diversion control policy with new patients. This should include counseling patients to: Keep buprenorphine locked up and out ofchildren's reach. Never share medication with anyone. Never sell medication to anyone. Acknowledge giving or selling medication toothers as illegal. Take medication only as prescribed. Review, understand, and agree to thepractice's buprenorphine treatment agreement before they start. Prescribe buprenorphine/naloxone when possible, rather than monoproduct. Exceptions would include prescribing the monoproduct for pregnant women with OUD. Prescribe an adequate but not excessive dose. Most patients respond to doses at or below 24 mg per day. Carefully evaluate requests for higher doses and confirm, document, and assess medication adherence continuously. Ongoing Patients Periodically check the state's PDMP. Conduct random urine tests that include a wide spectrum of opioids\u2014including morphine, oxycodone, and buprenorphine\u2014and periodically include buprenorphine metabolites. This will help monitor response to treatment and determine whether patients are taking at least some of their prescribed buprenorphine. Use unobserved specimen collection to preserve patient privacy and dignity: Do not let patients bring backpacks, jackets, orother items into the bathroom. Do not let others enter bathrooms with patients. Temperature test the urine sample. Use observed specimen collection (obtained by a staff member of the same gender) or oral fluid testing if there is reason to suspect tampering or falsification. Contact patients at random; ask them to bring in their medication within a reasonable period (24 to 48 hours) to count the tablets/films to ensure that all medication is accounted for. Provide a limited number of days of medication per prescription without refills (e.g., several days or 1 week per prescription) until the patient has demonstrated stability and lowered diversion risk.5-32Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Key Points of Patient Education for Buprenorphine Before starting OUD treatment with buprenorphine, patients should: Tell providers the prescribed and over-the-counter medications they take, to allow drug interaction assessment. Understand the goal of the first week of treatment: To improve withdrawal symptoms without oversedation. Tell providers if they feel sedated or euphoric within 1 to 4 hours after their dose. Be given the appropriate buprenorphine medication guide. Know possible side -Vomi ting. -Sweating. -Constipation. -Sexual dysfunction. Agree to store medication securely and out of the reach of others. Alert providers if they discontinue medications, start new ones, or change their medication dose. Understand that discontinuing buprenorphine increases risk of overdose death upon return to illicit opioid use. Know that use of alcohol or benzodiazepines with buprenorphine increases the risk of overdose and death. Understand the importance of informing providers if they become pregnant. Tell providers if they are having a procedure that may require pain medication. Be aware of resources through which to obtain further education for: -Themselves Points of Patient Education for Methadone Before starting OUD treatment with methadone, patients should: Be told that the methadone dose is started lowand increased slowly over days and weeks withmonitoring, because it takes 4 or more days for thebody to adjust to a dose change. This is necessaryto avoid the risk of overdose. Understand that the goal of the first weeks oftreatment is to improve withdrawal symptomswithout oversedation. Patients should tell providersif they feel sedated or high within the first 4 hoursafter their dose. Learn the symptoms of methadone intoxication andhow to seek emergency care. The first 2 weeks oftreatment have the highest risk of overdose. Be aware that rescue naloxone does not last verylong, so they should remain in emergency care forobservation if they are treated for opioid overdose. Know that concurrent alcohol, benzodiazepine, orother sedative use increases therisk OTP about prescribedand over-the-counter medications and herbs(e.g., St. John's wort) they are taking, stopping, orchanging doses of to allow assessment of potentialdrug-drug interactions. Inform other treating healthcare professionals thatthey are receiving methadone treatment. Plan to avoid driving or operating heavy machineryuntil their dose is stabilized. Learn about other possible side effects ofmethadone, including dizziness, nausea, vomiting,sweating, constipation, edema, and sexualdysfunction. Agree to keep take-home doses locked up andout of the reach of others. Understand that givingmethadone, even small amounts, to others may befatal. Inform providers if they become pregnant. Understand that stopping methadone increasestheir risk of overdose death if they return to illicitopioid use.5-33 TIP 63Part 5 of 5\u2014Resources Related to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Key Points of Patient Education for Naltrexone Do not use any opioids in the 7 to 10 days (for short acting) or 10 to 14 days (for long acting) beforestarting XR-NTX, to avoid other opioids. -Methadone. -Buprenorphine. Seek immediate medical help if symptoms of allergic reaction or anaphylaxis occur, such as: -Itching. -Swelling. -Hives. -Shortness of breath. -Throat tightness. Do not try to override the opioid blockade with large amounts of opioids, which could result inoverdose. Understand the risk of overdose from using opioidsnear the time of the next injection, after missing adose, or after stopping medications.Report -An open wound. Some of these reactions could require surgery to repair (rarely). Report signs and symptoms of hepatitis. Report depression or suicidal thoughts. Seekimmediate medical attention if these symptomsappear. Seek medical help if symptoms of pneumoniaappear (e.g., shortness of breath, fever). Tell providers of naltrexone treatment, as treatmentdiffers for various types of pneumonia. Inform all healthcare professionals of XR-NTXtreatment. Report pregnancy. Inform providers of any upcoming medicalprocedures that may require pain medication. Understand that taking naltrexone may result indifficulty achieving adequate pain control if acutemedical illness or trauma causes severe acute pain. Wear medical alert jewelry and carry a medical alertcard indicating you are taking XR-NTX. A patientwallet card or medical alert bracelet can be orderedat 1-800-848-4876.5-34Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Medication Management for Patients With Respiratory or Hepatic Impairment Who Take Buprenorphine CONTRAINDICATION/CAUTION MANAGEMENT Compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia [abnormally elevated blood levels of carbon dioxide], preexisting respiratory depression).Prescribe with caution; monitor closely. Warn patients about the risk of using benzodiazepines or other depressants while taking buprenorphine.20 Support patients in their attempts to discontinue tobaccouse. Hepatic impairment Buprenorphine and naloxone are extensively metabolized by the liver. Moderate to severe impairment results in decreased clearance, increased overall exposure to both medications, and higher risk of buprenorphine toxicity and precipitated withdrawal from naloxone. These effects have not been observed in patients with mild hepatic impairment. 21,22Mild impairment (Child-Pugh score of 5-6):23 No dose adjustment needed. Moderate impairment (Child-Pugh score of 7-9):24 Combination products are not recommended; they mayprecipitate withdrawal. *Use combination products cautiously for maintenance treatment in patients who've been inducted with amonoproduct; 25,26 monitor for signs and symptoms of buprenorphine toxicity or overdose.27 Naloxone may interfere with buprenorphine's efficacy.28,29 Severe impairment (Child-Pugh score of 10-15):30 Do not use the combination product.31 For monoproduct, consider halving the starting and titration doses used inpatients with normal liver function; monitor for signs andsymptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increasedbuprenorphine levels. 32 *Moderate to severe impairment results in much more reduced clearance of naloxone than of buprenorphine. Nasser etal. 33 found that moderate impairment doubled or tripled exposure (compared with subjects with no or mild impairment) for both medications. In subjects with severe impairment, buprenorphine exposure was two to three times higher;naloxone exposure increased more than tenfold. Adapted from material in the public domain. 34 Monitoring Recovery Activities At medical management visits, do not simply ask about attendance at recovery support meetings; explore the level of participation and engagement in those activities. Some activities include: Finding and working closely with a sponsor. \"Working\" the 12 Steps at 12-Step meetings and with a sponsor. Doing service at meetings (e.g., setting up chairs, making coffee, going on a \"commitment\" to speak at ameeting in a jail or an inpatient drug and alcohol program). Having and frequently attending a regular \"home\" group.35 Remember this statement from recovery experts A. Thomas McLellan and William White: \"Recovery status is best defined by factors other than medication status. Neither medication-assisted treatment of opioid addiction nor the cessation of such treatment by itself constitutes recovery. Recovery status instead hinges on broader achievements in health and social functioning\u2014with or without medication support.\" 365-35 TIP 63Part 5 of 5\u2014Resources Related to Medications for Opioid Use OUD Medications: An Overview37,38 CATEGORY BUPRENORPHINE* METHADONE XR-NTX**Appropriate patientsTypically for patients with OUD who are physiologically dependent on opioidsTypically for patients with OUD who are physiologically dependent on opioids and who meet federal criteria for OTP admissionTypically for patients with OUD who have abstained from short-acting opioids for at least 7-10 days and long-acting opioids at least 10-14 partial opioid withdrawal and blocks and euphoric of illicit tolerance and receptor euphoric effects of self-administered occupancy.

Also assess the following: -Psychiatric and medical comorbidity -Motivation for change -Psychosocial support system (obtain history from a significant other if the patient permits) Gauge level of care and setting needed (e.g., residential, outpatient). Inpatient treatment may be best for patients with poor motivation, limited psychosocial support, serious or complicated comorbidity, or injection or binge use. Coordinate with other prescribers. Some patients may have taken appropriately prescribed benzodiazepines for years with limited or no evidence of misuse. For such patients, tapering benzodiazepines may be contraindicated and unrealistic. Address comorbid mental disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression) with other medications or psychosocial treatments, when feasible. Provide medically supervised withdrawal from benzodiazepines or refer to specialty care for same. Create a treatment plan with built-in conditions (e.g., urine testing, more frequent visits, short medication supply). Frequently review patient progress and objective outcomes, such as: -Urine drug testing. -PDMP reports. -Psychosocial functioning. -Reports from significant others. Revise treatment plans as needed, and document the rationale for treatment decisions.

Treatment procedures have been explained to me, and I understand that I should take my medication at the schedule determined by the program physician, or his/her designee, in accordance with federal and state regulations. I understand that, like all other medications, methadone or buprenorphine can be harmful if not taken as prescribed. It has been explained to me that I must safeguard these medications and not share them with anyone because they can be fatal to children and adults if taken without medical supervision. I also understand that methadone and buprenorphine produce physical opioid dependence. Like all medications, they may have side effects. Possible side effects, as well as alternative treatments and their risks and benefits, have been explained to me. I understand that it is important for me to inform any medical and psychiatric provider who may treat me that I am enrolled in an opioid treatment program. In this way, the provider will be aware of all the medications I am taking, can provide the best possible care, and can avoid prescribing medications that might affect my treatment with methadone or buprenorphine or my recovery. I understand that I may withdraw voluntarily from this treatment program and discontinue the use of these medications at any time. If I choose this option, I understand I will be offered medically supervised withdrawal. For women of childbearing age: Pregnant women treated with methadone or buprenorphine have better outcomes than pregnant women not in treatment who continue to use opioid drugs. Newborns of mothers who are receiving methadone or buprenorphine treatment may have opioid withdrawal symptoms (i.e., neonatal abstinence syndrome). The delivery hospital may require babies who are exposed to opioids before birth to spend a number of days in the hospital for monitoring of withdrawal symptoms. Some babies may also need medication to stop withdrawal. If I am or become pregnant, I understand that I should tell the medical staff of the OTP right away so I can receive or be referred to prenatal care. I understand that there are ways to maximize the healthy course of my pregnancy while I am taking methadone or buprenorphine.

It is intended to offer healthcare professionals guiding principles and policies regarding best practices in diversion control for patients who are prescribed buprenorphine. This policy is not intended to establish a legal or medical standard of care. Healthcare professionals should use their personal and professional judgment in interpreting these guidelines and applying them to the particular circum - stances of their individual patients and practice arrangements. The information provided in this Policy is provided \"as is\" with no guarantee as to its accuracy or completeness. Preamble: Healthcare professionals can now treat up to 275 patients with buprenorphine. This increased access may contrib - ute to increased diversion, misuse, and related harms. Signs that a patient is misusing or diverting buprenorphine include (1) missed appointments; (2) requests for early refills because pills were lost, stolen, or other reasons; (3) urine screens negative for buprenorphine, positive for opioids; (4) claims of being allergic or intolerant to naloxone and requesting monotherapy; (5) nonhealing or fresh track marks; or (5) police reports of selling on the streets. Likewise, there are a range of reasons for diversion and misuse (e.g., diverting to family/friends with untreated opioid addiction with the intent of trying to \"help\" convince them to also get treatment; diverting to family/friends on a treatment waiting list; selling some or all of the medication to pay off old drug debts/purchase preferred opioid of misuse/pay for treatment in places where there are inadequate addiction treatment professionals taking private insurance or Medicaid for such reasons as inadequate reim - bursement/no reimbursement/burdensome prior authorization process). The safety and health of patients and others in the community could be at risk if misuse and diversion are not addressed proactively throughout treatment. The reputation of XYZ Medical Practice may also be put at risk. Definitions: Diversion is defined as the unauthorized rerouting or misappropriation of prescription medication to someone other than for whom it was intended (including sharing or selling a prescribed medication); misuse includes taking medica - tion in a manner, by route or by dose, other than prescribed.48 Purpose: Misuse and diversion should be defined and discussed with patients at the time of treatment entry; periodically throughout treatment, particularly when there have been returns to illicit drug use; and when suspected (e.g., incorrect buprenorphine pill/film count) or confirmed. These procedures will establish the steps to be taken to prevent, monitor, and respond to misuse and diversion of buprenorphine. The response should be therapeutic and matched to the patients' needs, as untreated opioid use disorder and treatment dropout/administrative discharges may lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality and further use of diverted medications or illicit opioids associated with overdose death. Procedures for Prevention: Use buprenorphine/naloxone combination products when medically indicated and cost is not an issue. Reserve the daily buprenorphine monoproducts for pregnant patients and patients who could not afford treatment if the combination product were required, who have a history of stability in treatment and low diversion risk, or who have arrangements for observed dosing. Buprenorphine monoproducts are recommended for pregnant women. Counsel patients on safe storage of, and nonsharing of, medications. Patients must agree to safe storage of their medication. This is even more critical if there are children in the home where the patient lives. Counsel patients about acquiring locked devices and avoiding storage in parts of the home frequented by visitors (e.g., do not recommend storage in the kitchen or common bathrooms). Proactively discuss how medication should be stored and transported when traveling to minimize risk of unintended loss. Counsel patients on taking medication as instructed and not sharing medication. Explicitly explain to patients the definitions of diversion and misuse, with examples. Patients are required to take medication as instructed by the healthcare professional; for example, they may not crush or inject the medication. Check the prescription drug monitoring program for new patients and check regularly thereafter. Prescription drug monitoring program reports can be a useful resource when there is little history available or when there is a concern based on observation. Check for prescriptions that interact with buprenorphine and for other buprenorphine prescribers.5-49 TIP 63Part 5 of 5\u2014Resources Related to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Prescribe a therapeutic dose that is tailored to the patient's needs. Do not routinely provide an additional supply \"just in case.\" Question patients who say they need a significantly higher dose, particularly when they are already at 24 mg per day of buprenorphine equivalents. Make sure the patient understands the practice's treatment agreement and prescription policies. The XYZ Medical Practice's treatment agreement and other documentation are clear about policies regarding number of doses in each prescription, refills, and rules on \"lost\" prescriptions. Review the policies in person with the patient. Offer an opportunity for questions. Patient and provider must sign the agreement. Review the policies again with the patient at subsequent appointments. See Sample Buprenorphine Treatment Agreement or Sample XR-NTX Treatment Agreement as needed. Procedures for Monitoring: Request random urine tests. The presence of buprenorphine in the urine indicates that the patient has taken some portion of the prescribed dose. Absence of buprenorphine in the urine supports nonadherence. Testing for bu - prenorphine metabolites (which are present only if buprenorphine is metabolized) should periodically be included to minimize the possibility that buprenorphine is added directly to the urine sample. Dipstick tests can be subverted or replaced. A range of strategies can be used to minimize falsified urine collections, including (1) observed collection; (2) disallowing carry-in items (e.g., purses, backpacks) in the bathroom; (3) turning off running water and coloring toilet water to eliminate the possibility of dilution; (4) monitoring the bathroom door so that only one person can go in; and (5) testing the temperature of the urine immediately after voiding. Schedule unannounced pill/film counts. Periodically ask patients who are at high risk at initial or subsequent appoint - ments to bring in their medication containers for a pill/film count. With unannounced monitoring (both pill/film counts and urine tests), the patient is contacted and must appear within a specified time period (e.g., 24 hours) after the phone call. If the patient doesn't show, then the provider should consider this as a positive indicator of misuse or diversion. Directly observe ingestion. Patients take medication in front of the healthcare professional or another qualified clinician and are observed until the medication dissolves in the mouth (transmucosal [sublingual or buccal] absorp - tion). Patients who are having difficulty adhering to their buprenorphine can have their medication provided under direct observation in the office for a designated frequency (e.g., three times/week). Limit medication supply. When directly observed doses in the office are not practical, short prescription time spans can be used (e.g., weekly, 3 days at a time). Procedures To Respond to Misuse or Diversion: Misuse or diversion doesn't mean automatic discharge from the practice. However, it will require consideration of one or more of the following procedures: Evaluate the misuse and diversion. For instance, describe the incident of misuse (e.g., \"the patient took the pre - scribed dose on three or more occasions by intravenous route immediately after starting treatment, stating that she believed the dose would not be adequate by sublingual route; she has just initiated treatment\") or diversion (\"the patient gave half of dose to his wife, who is still using heroin and was withdrawing, because he did not want her to have to buy heroin off the street; she is on a waiting list for treatment\") and tailor the response to the behavior (e.g., reeducation of the patient on buprenorphine pharmacology in the first example above; assistance with treatment entry for the spouse in the second example). Reassess the treatment plan and patient progress. Strongly consider smaller supplies of medication and supervised dosing for any patient who is taking medication intravenously or in - tranasally or diverting, regardless of reason. Treatment structure may need to be increased, including more frequent appointments, supervised administration, and increased psychosocial support. Intensify treatment or level of care, if needed. Some patients may require an alternative treatment setting or pharma - cotherapy such as methadone. The clinician will discuss these alternatives with the patient to ensure optimal patient outcome. This should be discussed at treatment onset so the patient is aware of the consequences of misuse and diversion. Document and describe the misuse and diversion incident. Also document the clinical thinking that supports the clinical response, which should be aimed at minimizing risk of diversion and misuse and treating the patient's opioid use disorder at the level of care needed.

The information provided in this form is provided \"as is\" with no guarantee as to its accuracy or completeness. TREATMENT AGREEMENT I agree to accept the following treatment contract for buprenorphine office-based opioid addiction treatment: 1. The risks and benefits of buprenorphine treatment have been explained to me. 2. The risks and benefits of other treatment for opioid use disorder (including methadone, naltrexone, and nonmedication treatments) have been explained to me. 3. I will keep my medication in a safe, secure place away from children (for example, in a lockbox). My plan is to store it [describe where and how _____________________________________________________________________]. 4. I will take the medication exactly as my healthcare provider prescribes. If I want to change my medication dose, I will speak with my healthcare provider first. Taking more medication than my healthcare provider prescribes or taking it more than once daily as my healthcare provider prescribes is medication misuse and may result in supervised dosing at the clinic. Taking the medication by snorting or by injection is also medication misuse and may result in supervised dosing at the clinic, referral to a higher level of care, or change in medication based on my healthcare provider's evaluation. 5. I will be on time to my appointments and respectful to the office staff and other patients. 6. I will keep my healthcare provider informed of all my medications (including herbs and vitamins) and medical problems. 7. I agree not to obtain or take prescription opioid medications prescribed by any other healthcare provider without consulting my buprenorphine prescriber. 8. If I am going to have a medical procedure that will cause pain, I will let my healthcare provider know in advance so that my pain will be adequately treated. 9. If I miss an appointment or lose my medication, I understand that I will not get more medication until my next office visit. I may also have to start having supervised buprenorphine dosing. 10. If I come to the office intoxicated, I understand that my healthcare provider will not see me, and I will not receive more medication until the next office visit. I may also have to start having supervised buprenorphine dosing. 11. I understand that it's illegal to give away or sell my medication; this is diversion. If I do this, my treatment will no longer include unsupervised buprenorphine dosing and may require referral to a higher level of care, supervised dosing at the clinic, and/or a change in medication based on my healthcare provider's evaluation. 12. Violence, threatening language or behavior, or participation in any illegal activity at the office will result in treatment termination from the clinic. 13. I understand that random urine drug testing is a treatment requirement. If I do not provide a urine sample, it will count as a positive drug test. 14. I understand that I will be called at random times to bring my medication container into the office for a pill or film count. Missing medication doses could result in supervised dosing or referral to a higher level of care at this clinic or potentially at another treatment provider based on my individual needs. 15. I understand that initially I will have weekly office visits until I am stable. I will get a prescription for 7 days of medication at each visit. 16. I can be seen every 2 weeks in the office starting the second month of treatment if I have two negative urine drug tests in a row. I will then get a prescription for 14 days of medication at each visit. 17. I will go back to weekly visits if I have a positive drug test. I can go back to visits every 2 weeks when I have two negative drug tests in a row again. 18. I may be seen less than every 2 weeks based on goals made by my healthcare provider and me. 19. I understand that people have died by mixing buprenorphine with alcohol and other drugs like benzodiazepines (drugs like Valium, Klonopin, and Xanax). Continued on next page5-53 TIP 63Part 5 of 5\u2014Resources Related to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder 20.I understand that treatment of opioid use disorder involves more than just taking medication. I agree to comply with my healthcare provider's recommendations for additional counseling and/or for help with other problems. 21.I understand that there is no fixed time for being on buprenorphine and that the goal of treatment is for me to stop using all illicit drugs and become successful in all aspects of my life. 22.I understand that I may experience opioid withdrawal symptoms when I stop taking buprenorphine. 23.I have been educated about the other two FDA-approved medications used for opioid dependence treatment,methadone and naltrexone. 24.I have been educated about the increased chance of pregnancy when stopping illicit opioid use and starting buprenorphine treatment and been informed about methods for preventing pregnancy.

Adapted with permission.515-54Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Naltrexone forms Key Techniques for Reducing Injection Site Reactions52 To reduce severe injection site reactions when administering XR-NTX via intramuscular injection, use the following techniques: Use one of the administration needles provided with the XR-NTX kit to ensure that the injection reaches the gluteal muscle. Use the 2-inch needle for patients who have more subcuta - neous adipose tissue. Use the 1.5-inch needle for patients with less subcutaneous adipose tissue. Either needle is appropriate for use with patients who have average amounts of subcutaneous adipose tissue. Use aseptic technique when administering intramuscularly. Using a circular motion, clean the injection site with an alcohol swab. Let the area dry before administering the injection. Do not touch this area again before administration. Use proper deep intramuscular injection technique into the gluteal muscle. XR-NTX must not be injected intravenously, subcutaneously, or into adipose tissue. Accidental subcutaneous injection may increase the risk of severe injection site reactions. Administer the suspension by deep intramuscular injection into the upper outer quadrant of gluteal muscle, alternating buttocks per monthly injection. Remember to aspirate for blood before injection. If blood aspirates or the needle clogs, do not inject. Change to the spare needle provided in the package and administer into an adjacent site in the same gluteal region, again aspirating for blood before injection. Inject the suspension in a smooth, continuous motion. A patient counseling tool is available to help you counsel your patients before administration about the serious risks associated with XR-NTX. The above information is a selection of key safety information about the XR-NTX injection. For complete safety information, refer to the directions for use and the prescribing information provided in the medication kit. You can also obtain this information online ( www.vivitrolrems.com ) or by calling 1-800-VIVITROL. ).5-55 TIP 63Part 5 of 5\u2014Resources Related to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Patient Counseling Tool for XR-NTX Risk of sudden opioid withdrawal during initiation and re-initiation of VIVITROL Using any type of opioid including street drugs, prescription pain medicines, cough, cold or diarrhea medicines that contain opioids, or opioid dependence treatments buprenorphine or methadone, in the 7 to 14 days before starting VIVITROL may cause severe and potentially dangerous sudden opioid withdrawal. Risk of opioid overdose Patients may be more sensitive to the effects of lower amounts of opioids: Patients should tell their family and people close to them about the increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose even when using lower doses of opioids or amounts that they used before treatment. Using large amounts of opioids, such as prescription pain pills or heroin, to overcome effects of VIVITROL can lead to serious injury, coma, and death. Risk of severe reactions at the injection site Remind patients of these possible symptoms at the injection site: Some of these injection site reactions have required surgery. Tell your patients to contact a healthcare provider if they have any reactions at the injection site. Risk of liver injury, including liver damage or hepatitis Remind patients of the possible symptoms of liver damage or hepatitis. Patients may not feel the therapeutic effects of opioid-containing medicines for pain, cough or cold, or diarrhea while taking VIVITROL. Patients should carry written information with them at all times to alert healthcare providers that they are taking VIVITROL, so they can be treated properly in an emergency.

I understand that there is no fixed time for being on naltrexone and that the goal of treatment is for me to stop using all illicit drugs and become successful in all aspects of my life. 17. I understand that my risk of overdose increases if I go back to using opioids after stopping naltrexone. 18. I have been educated about the other two FDA-approved medications used to treat opioid use disorder, methadone and buprenorphine, and I prefer to receive treatment with naltrexone. 19. I have been educated about the increased chance of pregnancy when stopping illicit opioid use and starting naltrexone treatment and have been informed about methods for preventing pregnancy. 20. I have been informed that if I become pregnant during naltrexone treatment, I should inform my provider and have a discussion about the risks and benefits of continuing to take naltrexone. Other specific items unique to my treatment include: Patient Name (print): _____________________________________________________ Patient Signature: ________________________________________________________ Date: ____________________ This form is adapted from ASAM's Sample Treatment Agreement, which is updated periodically; the most current version of the agreement is available online ( www.asam.org/docs/default-source/advocacy/sample-treatment-agreement30fa159472bc604ca5b7ff0 00030b21a.pdf?sfvrsn=0 ). Adapted with permission.545-57 TIP 63Part 5 5\u2014Resources Related to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Glossary of TIP Terminology Abuse liability: The likelihood that a medication with central nervous system activity will cause desirable psychological effects, such as euphoria or mood changes, that promote the medication's misuse. Addiction: As defined by ASAM,55 \"a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry.\" It is characterized by inability to consistently abstain, impairment in behavioral control, craving, diminished recognition of significant problems with one's behaviors and interpersonal relationships, and a dysfunctional emotional response. Like other chronic diseases, addiction often involves cycles of relapse and remission . The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition56 (DSM-5), does not use the term for diagnostic purposes, but it commonly describes the more severe forms of opioid use disorder. Bioavailability: Proportion of medication administered that reaches the bloodstream. Care provider: Encompasses both healthcare professionals and other professionals who do not provide medical services, such as counselors or providers of supportive services. Often shortened to \"provider.\" Cross-tolerance: Potential for people tolerant to one opioid (e.g., heroin) to be tolerant to another (e.g., methadone). Dissociation: Rate at which a drug uncouples from the receptor. A drug with a longer dissoci - ation rate will have a longer duration of action than a drug with a shorter dissociation rate. Half-life: Rate of removal of a drug from the body. One half-life removes 50 percent from the plasma. After a drug is stopped, it takes five half-lives to remove about 95 percent from the plasma. If a drug is continued at the same dose, its plasma level will continue to rise until it reaches steady state concentrations after about five half-lives.Healthcare professionals: Physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other medical service professionals who are eligible to prescribe medications for and treat patients with OUD (i.e., until October 1, 2023, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse midwives). The term \"prescribers\" also refers to these healthcare professionals. Induction: Process of initial dosing with medica - tion for OUD treatment until the patient reaches a state of stability; also called initiation. Intrinsic activity: The degree of receptor activation attributable to drug binding. Full agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist are terms that describe the intrinsic activity of a drug. Maintenance treatment: Providing medications to achieve and sustain clinical remission of signs and symptoms of OUD and support the individual process of recovery without a specific endpoint (as with the typical standard of care in medical and psychiatric treatment of other chronic illnesses). Medically supervised withdrawal (formerly called detoxification): Using an opioid agonist (or an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist if opioid agonist is not available) in tapering doses or other med - ications to help a patient discontinue illicit or prescription opioids. Medical management: Process whereby health - care professionals provide medication, basic brief supportive counseling, monitoring of drug use and medication adherence, and referrals, when necessary, to addiction counseling and other services to address the patient's medical, mental health, comorbid addiction, and psycho - social needs.5-58Medications for Opioid Use Disorder TIP 63 Mutual-help groups: Groups of people who work together on obtaining and maintaining recovery. Unlike peer support (e.g., the use of recovery coaches), mutual-help groups consist entirely of people who volunteer their time and typically have no official connection to treatment programs. Most are self-supporting. Although 12-Step groups such as AA and NA are the most widespread and well-researched type of mutual- help groups, other groups may be available in some areas. They range from groups affiliated with a religion or church (e.g., Celebrate Recovery, Millati Islami) to purely secular groups (e.g., SMART Recovery, Women for Sobriety). Office-based opioid treatment (OBOT): Providing medication for OUD in settings other than certified OTPs. Opiates: A subclass of thebaine). Opioid misuse: The use of prescription opioids in any way other than as directed by a prescriber; the use of any opioid in a manner, situation, amount, or frequency that can cause harm to self or others.57 Opioid receptor agonist: A substance that has an affinity for and stimulates physiological activity at cell receptors in the central nervous system that are normally stimulated by opioids. Mu-opioid receptor full agonists (e.g., methadone) bind to the mu-opioid receptor and produce actions similar to those produced by the endogenous opioid beta-endorphin. Increasing the dose increases the effect. Mu-opioid receptor partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine) bind to the mu-opioid receptor. Unlike with full agonists, increasing their dose may not produce additional effects once they have reached their maximal effect. At low doses, partial agonists may produce effects similar to those of full agonists.Opioid receptor antagonist: A substance that has an affinity for opioid receptors in the central nervous system without producing the physi - ological effects of opioid agonists. Mu-opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., naltrexone) can block of exogenously administered opioids. Opioid receptor blockade: Blunting or blocking of the euphoric effects of an opioid through opioid receptor occupancy by buprenorphine) antagonist (e.g., naltrexone). Opioids: All natural, synthetic, and semisynthetic substances that have effects similar to morphine. They can be used as medications having such effects (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine, oxycodone). Opioid treatment program (OTP): An accredited treatment program with SAMHSA certification and DEA registration to administer and dispense opioid agonist medications that are approved by FDA to treat opioid addiction. Currently, these include methadone and buprenorphine products. Other pharmacother - apies, such as naltrexone, may be provided but are not subject to these regulations. OTPs must provide adequate medical, counseling, voca - tional, educational, and other assessment and treatment services either onsite or by referral to an outside agency or practitioner through a formal agreement.58 Opioid use disorder (OUD): Per DSM-5,59 a disorder characterized by loss of control of opioid use, risky opioid use, impaired social functioning, tolerance, and withdrawal. Tolerance and withdrawal do not count toward the diagnosis in people experiencing these symptoms when using opioids under appropriate medical supervision. OUD covers a range of severity and replaces what the DSM-IV termed \"opioid abuse\" and \"opioid dependence.\" An OUD diagnosis is applicable to a person who uses opioids and experiences at least 2 of the 11 symptoms in a 12-month period. (See Exhibit 2.11 in Part 2 for full DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for OUD.)5-59 TIP 63Part 5 of 5\u2014Resources Related to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Peer support: The use of peer support spe - cialists in recovery to provide nonclinical (i.e., not requiring training in diagnosis or treatment) recovery support services to individuals in recovery from addiction and to their families. Peer support specialist: Someone in recovery who has lived experience in addiction plus skills learned in formal training. Peer support spe - cialists may be paid professionals or volunteers. They are distinguished from members of mutual- help groups because they maintain contact with treatment staff. They offer experiential knowledge that treatment staff often lack. Prescribers: Healthcare professionals who are eligible to prescribe medications for OUD. Psychosocial support: Ancillary services to enhance a patient's overall functioning and well-being, including recovery support services, case management, housing, employment, and educational services. Psychosocial treatment: Interventions that seek to enhance a patient's social and mental functioning, including addiction counseling, contingency management, and mental health services. Receptor affinity: Strength of the bond between a medication and its receptor. A medication with high mu-opioid receptor affinity requires lower concentrations to occupy the same number of mu-opioid receptors as a drug with lower mu-opioid receptor affinity. Drugs with high mu-opioid receptor affinity may displace drugs with lower affinity. Recovery: A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential. Even individuals with severe and chronic SUDs can, with help, overcome their SUDs and regain health and social function. Although abstinence from all substance misuse is a cardinal feature of a recovery lifestyle, it is not the only healthy, prosocial feature. Patients taking FDA-approved medication to treat OUD can be considered in recovery.Recovery capital: The sum of the internal (e.g., motivation, self-efficacy, spirituality) and external (e.g., access to health care, employment, family support) resources that an individual can draw on to begin and sustain recovery from SUDs. Recovery-oriented care: A service orientation that supports individuals with behavioral health conditions in a process of change through which they can improve their health and wellness, live self-directed lives, and strive to reach their full potential. Relapse: A process in which a person with OUD who has been in remission experiences a return of symptoms or loss of remission. A relapse is different from a return to opioid use in that it involves more than a single incident of use. Relapses occur over a period of time and can be interrupted. Relapse need not be long lasting. The TIP uses relapse to describe relapse preven - tion, a common treatment modality. Remission: A medical term meaning a disappearance of signs and symptoms of the disease.60 DSM-5 defines remission as present in people who previously met OUD criteria but no longer meet any OUD criteria (with the possible exception of craving).61 Remission is an essential element of recovery . Return to opioid use: One or more instances of opioid misuse without a return of symptoms of OUD. A return to opioid use may lead to relapse . Tolerance: Alteration of the body's responsive - ness to alcohol or other drugs (including opioids) such that higher doses are required to produce the same effect achieved during initial use.
