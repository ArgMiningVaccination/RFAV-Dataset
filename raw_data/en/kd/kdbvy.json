Her life's work is to help all animals live healthier, happier, longer lives. Rebalancer is comprised of homeopathic remedies that are widely known to help clear the effects of the carriers used in vaccines without removing any of the \"benefits\" of the vaccines themselves. You can repeat the cycle once a month to once a week as long as every time you repeat it you are seeing positive results. If you are doing it weekly it should not be repeated for longer than 1 month, then you can go to once per month and again so long as each time your animal is getting better. You can wipe the pump down with alcohol on a clean paper towel. 4 years Yes. You would be repeating because you are getting benefits ongoing with each repetition. Often the reason this happens is that a large portion of the chronic issue has been from over-vaccination. You can give Rebalancer a day, a week, a month, a year... 5 years after vaccines! It helps the body rebalance to its natural state after it's been forced into an unnatural immune response and also assists the body in the removal of preservatives, heavy metals, toxins, adjuvants, antigens and stabilizers that are added to vaccines.

After their vet visit, their little bellies were suffering and they were losing weight from being so sick. We even had to give fluids to one of them. Within a couple hours of using this product in their food, they began to perk up. Within 24 hours, the vomiting and diarrhea completely stopped and they were back to being normal kittens again. Now they are thriving. This product is amazing! I use this product after vaccines - to help rebalance the system from the vaccine. It is a good product recommended by my holistic vet after any vaccine. I bought it cause the rescue gave my dog a 6 month poison he shot. Says use only 10 days so then I started dandelion root Gave Rebalancer after having rabies vaccine. Unfortunately, this vaccine is unavoidable in my state (Arkansas) if you need any other vetting. They won't titer or treat without a current rabies shot. Saw this product recommended on Dr Judy Morgan's site as a way to minimize vaccine damage, and used as directed. This is the only product that works! My European GSDs are very sensitive to any type of vaccination. Within hours of vaccination, they have diarrhea, and uncontrollable scratching all over their bodies. This can continue for at least 2 weeks. I give a dosage the morning of the vet appointment and directly after they received the vaccination and they show no symptoms of vaccinosis. I continue to give the dosage twice a day for at least 4 days. If I stop a dosage, sometimes symptoms will appear, so I start dosages again. I am very pleased with "}
