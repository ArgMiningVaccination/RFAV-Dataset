Why some of us are immune to this nonsense and some of us run head on into this is beyond me. His crimes are the fault of not just this individual 'John' but of the culture at large. He's not particularly charismatic or clever. He just recognizes the willingness of people to be conned and/or to stay silent while they witness the crimes. It's happened before and very likely to happen again. What won't humanity sacrifice on the alter of money, sex and power. - It is always a tragedy to see someone make a mockery of God. This individual Jo\u00e3o Teixeira de Faria claims he was able to heal people - but did that actually happen? And after viewing the documentary, you have to ask yourself - just who was giving him any power at all? Was it God or was it Satan? Just as members of the catholic church have been accused of sexual abuse over many years, it is a travesty to see any person or group use God as a front - and then perform acts such as these - any church or person who is guilty of such a heinous act will answer to God one day - do not be deceived. If women had come forward very early on, Jo\u00e3o could have been stopped a LOT SOONER. The catholic church is a man-made creation - Christ established Christ' church. There is no catholic church. The catholic church is an aberration, a mutation of Christ' church, just as Jo\u00e3o is a heresy of the Christian faith. The information in this documentary is very valuable - lesson learned to all people - if you experience anything like this - REPORT IT IMMEDIATELY. Movie & TV "}
