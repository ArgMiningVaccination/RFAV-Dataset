It has been an amazing journey of self exploration, realization, and self healing. There isn't any one source of inspiration, tradition, or knowledge base that I have accessed to gain my insights. I have molded my own way with pieces of many practices, teachers, and school of thought. It began with meditation where I learned to align my soul with Divine Energy. In this union I was able to come closer to myself and my own guardian angels, but my need for connection with Spirit was not satiated. On my path I found a Shaman who taught me how to conduct a Spirit Journey that allowed me to travel through various dimensions of consciousness. There I was able to commune with other beings such as totem guides to increase my awareness and hone my skills. I practiced Alchemist exercises, evoking Kundalini rising, that helped to elevate my energetic vibration, inducing an enhanced consciousness. I have been of service since 2005 as a channel of Universal Consciousness where I receive, interpret, and direct energy frequencies that facilitate conscious enlightenment and the body's innate ability to heal. Energy Medicine is multifaceted. Using subtler energy fields to promote wellness and harmony in the mind and body can have a radical effect spontaneously or it may be a shift that integrates over time. In order to better meet the needs of my clients I believe it's best to take an integrative approach with tools that have a noticeable impact in our 3D world. Following this belief, I pursued a higher education in health, where I graduated from the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine March 2015, receiving a Masters in Oriental Medicine and my doctorate in East Asian Medicine at Pacific College of Health and Science December 2022. Today, I am a Licensed Acupuncturist, blending my modalities of Acupuncture, Medicinal Herbs, Psychic Readings, Energy Reading/Healing, and Shamanic Work into a comprehensive treatment; customized for each patient to assure the most appropriate therapeutic experience that will transform the mind-body-soul connection in order to achieve optimum health and wellness.I believe that meeting my clients where they are at physically, mentally, and emotionally is instrumental on their path to improved health. Learning to trust yourself and follow your inner wisdom with confidence is probably the most difficult of all lessons. We are all psychics, healers, and light workers. The unique way that we each access our greatness and share that with the universe is a beauty that can not be captured by words. With that said, know that You are imperfectly perfect, unique and gifted. In a human vessel the distraction of disharmony and disease can diminish our abilities, taking us off course from our path. I invite you to empower yourself by seeking balance and wisdom to realize your potential. Allow this forum to facilitate a balancing for you to secure clarity of mind, body, and soul that achieves holistic well being. Access your greatness with vivacity, share your brilliance with the universe, and bask in your beauty. Energy Medicine is multifaceted.
