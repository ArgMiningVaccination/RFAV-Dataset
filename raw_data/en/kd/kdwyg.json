Macrophagesareamongthemostabundantcellsintherespiratorytract,andtheycanhavestrikinglydifferentphenotypeswithin this environment. Our knowledge of the different phenotypes and their functions in the lung is sketchy at best, but they appearto be linked to the protection of gas exchange against microbial threats and excessive tissue responses. Phenotypical changes ofmacrophages within the lung are found in many respiratory diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary fibrosis. This paper will give an overview of what macrophage phenotypes have been described, what their known functions are, what is known about their presence in the different obstructive and restrictive respiratory diseases(asthma,COPD,pulmonaryfibrosis),andhowtheyarethoughttocontributetotheetiologyandresolutionofthesediseases. 1. Introduction Most tissue macrophages are derived from hematopoietic stem cells and their local expansion within tissues can bedue to local proliferation of existing macrophages or dueto infiltration of blood-derived monocytes, depending onthe circumstances. Traditionally characterized as the firstline of defense against foreign invaders, research in the past decade has shown that their role extends to developmental processes and maintenance of tissue homeostasis in manyways [1,2]. To fulfill these many different roles in tissue, macrophages can adopt a myriad of phenotypes based onsignals they receive from their environment. From in vitro studies a nomenclaturewas proposedsimilarto the Th1/Th2dichotomy,withM1macrophagesbeingknownasclassicallyactivatedmacrophagesinducedbyinterferongamma(IFN ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF )a n dM 2b e i n g known as alternatively activated macrophages induced byinterleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 [ 3,4].

Macrophages are among the most abundant cells in the respiratory tract and can be broadly divided intotwo populations depending on their localization: alveolarmacrophages(AMs)thatlinethesurfaceofalveoliandinter-stitial macrophages (IMs) that reside in the space betweenalveolarepitheliumandvascularendothelium[ 7].Ithasbeen suggested that AM do not originate directly from bloodmonocytes,butinsteadarederivedfromIMswhichthereforeserveasanintermediatebetweenbloodmonocytesandAMs.ComparedwithAMs,IMsarelessefficientinphagocytosingbut are better at stimulating T-cell proliferation in vitro[8]. In addition, IMs as opposed to AMs, were also found toproducehighlevelsofIL-10andtherebyinhibitDCmigration [9]. Although IMs and AMs have distinct functions, they both are among the first to encounter allergens and otherthreats to the lung homeostasis [ 8,10,11]. They are both capable of quickly dealing with those without perturbingnormal gas exchange because they can adopt the mosteffective phenotypes based on signals from surroundingtissue. These phenotypical changes are also linked to many 2 MediatorsofInflammation respiratorydiseases.Inbothobstructive(asthma,COPD)and restrictive respiratory diseases (pulmonary fibrosis) changesinthenumberandphenotypeoflungmacrophageshavebeenfound. In this paper we will first briefly discuss the in vitro generated phenotypes and then compare this with their roleinthepathogenesisofobstructiveandrestrictiverespiratory diseases. 2. M1, M2, and Beyond 2.1. M1 Macrophages. Classically activated or M1 macropha- ges develop after being exposed to IFN and TNFor lipopolysaccharide (LPS, which induces TNF production) under the influence of the transcription factor interferon-regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) [ 12]. They are essential in host defense against intracellular pathogens by generating reac-tive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric (NO) throughupregulated also Figure 1)[13]. In addition, they show enhanced phagocytosisofmicroorganisms,antigen-presentationcapa-bilities, and enhanced production and secretion of matrix metalloproteinases(MMPs) such [ macrophage migration duringinflammatoryresponses,butexcessiveorunregulatedproductionresultsintissuedamage[ 5,17]. 2.2. Alternative Activation. Alternatively activated or M2 macrophages were named to indicate that their activationstatus was distinctly different from the classically activatedmacrophages.

A variety of different names have been suggested,butforthepurposeofthispaperwewilladoptthe names suggested by Mosser and Edwards [ 5]a n dS i c aa n d Mantovani [ 20]. They have suggested alternatively activated or M2 macrophages for the phenotype induced by IL-4/IL-13 and regulatory macrophages or M2-like cells for thephenotype characterized by high IL-10 production that areinducedbyavarietyofstimuli(seealsoFigure 1). 2.3.M2Macrophages. M2macrophages,inducedbyIL-4/IL- 13 under the influence of the transcription factor IRF4 [ 21], havearoleinprotectionagainsthelminthsandareconsideredwound-healing macrophages because of their associationwithphysiologicalandpathologicaltissueremodeling[ 5,22]. Theyarecharacterizedbyupregulatedexpressionofmannose receptors and transglutaminase 2 in man and mice [ 19,23] and by upregulated expression of arginase-1, and resistin-like molecule-(Relm, also known as FIZZ1) in mice only (see also Figure 1)[22,24,25]. They have poor antigen presenting capabilities and exhibit increased release of ironand clearance of produce highlevels of IL-10 (see also Figure 1). They are induced by a number of stimuli that need to be combined with a secondsignal, which is Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. Transcriptional control of this phenotype is unclear b u tm a yi n v o l v ep e r o x i s o m ep r o l i f e r a t o r - a c t i v a t e dr e c e p -tor gamma (PPAR) and have inflammation but may also permit tumorprogressionwhenassociatedwithtumors[ 5,13].Todateithas been difficult to distinguish genuine M2 macrophages fromM 2 - l i k em a c r o p h a g e sb e c a u s et h e ys h a r em a n ym a r k e r s ,most notably the mannose receptor. Only IL-10 productionwould be a reliable marker but is used seldomly to identifyM2-like macrophages [ 5]. The exact differences in tissue distributionandfunctionofthesetwophenotypesarethere-fore difficult to establish from the studies published to date.Wheneverpossible,wewillindicatewhatisknownofM2andM2-likemacrophagesinthecontextofrespiratorydiseases. 3. Macrophages and Asthma 3.1. Asthma. Over the last few decades the prevalence of asthma has rapidly increased, and currently more than halfa million people suffer from asthma in The Netherlands(Annual Report 2011 Dutch Lung Fund). More women areaffected by this underdiagnosed and undertreated airwaydisease than men. Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder ofthe airways, which are chronically inflamed and contracteasilyinresponsetononspecificstimuli.Thisso-calledairwayhyperreactivityisaccompaniedbyincreasedmucussecretionand airway wall remodeling, which leads to symptoms suchaswheezing,coughing,andchesttightness[ 34]. Several distinct forms of asthma have been recognized and can roughly be divided into atopic and the less-studiednonatopicasthma.Themajorityofasthmapatientsareatopic,whichisapredispositiontomountanimmunoglobulintypeE (IgE) response. This type is characterized by infiltration ofeosinophilsinthelungs.Innonatopicasthmathereisnoevi-dence of allergen-specific IgE, and this type is characterizedbytheinfiltrationofneutrophilsinthelungs.Asmallportionofasthmapatientssufferfromsevereasthma,whichincludesboth atopic and nonatopic characteristics. Severe asthmais defined as being unable to control asthma symptoms despite taking high-dose corticosteroids, also referred to as corticosteroid-resistantasthma[ 35]. 3.2. Pathogenesis Asthma. Asthma is traditionally consid- ered a T-helper-2- (Th2-) cell driven inflammatory disorder.Activation of the macrophage phenotypes and their characteristics. IFN :i n t e r f e r o ng a m m a ;T N F:t u m o r Th2- cytokines are for the recruitment of effectorcells resulting in eosinophil infiltrates, IgE production, andhistamine release among other typical asthma symptoms.The innate immune system is increasingly being recognizedas an additional important disease mechanism in asthma[36]. Cells of the innate immune system actively orchestrate adaptiveimmuneresponsesinasthma[ 37].Besidesdendritic cells (DC) in the lung taking up allergens and pathogensa n dp r e s e n t i n gt h o s et ot h ea d a p t i v ei m m u n es y s t e m ,o t h e rcells important for innate immune responses in the lung aremacrophages.Theirrole,however,inasthmahasbeengreatlyunderestimated,andthereforetheircontributiontoasthmaismostlyunexplored[ 38]. 3.3. Macrophage Phenotypes and Asthma. In asthma it appears that effective phenotype switching is impaired and macrophages can actually contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. The next part will focus on the roles of eachknownphenotypeinthepathogenesisofasthma. 3.4.M1MacrophagesinAsthma. Althoughtheinflammatory process in asthma is dominated by a Th2 inflammation,increasing evidence supports the parallel development andinvolvement of both M1 and M2 macrophages in this dis- ease. We have recently shown that during the develop-ment of house-dust-mite-induced asthma numbers of M1macrophages are high in a short model as compared tocontrol mice and decrease with longer exposure [ 39]. Levels of M1 inducers (IFNand LPS or TNF)w e r ef o u n dt ob e significantly higher in asthmatics, especially in those withsevere forms of the disease [ 40-42]. Elevated serum IFN correlateswiththeseverityofairwayinflammationinatopicasthma, and this cytokine has been linked to mechanismsthat induce airway hyperreactivity [ 43,44]. In agreement with the findings in human asthma, it was shown that bothIFNandLPScontributetoairwayinflammationandairway hyperreactivity in a mouse model of asthma [ 45,46]. TNF isimplicatedinmanyaspectsofasthmapathology,includingdevelopment of airway hyperreactivity both atopic and nonatopic asthmatics, the amount of LPS in house dust has been related to the severity of airwayinflammation[ 49,50]. Inhalation of pure LPS by asthmatics is associated with bronchoconstriction and a change inairwayhyperreactivity[ 51,52].Administrationofhighdoses o fL P Si n t ot h el u n g so fa l l e r g i cm i c ep r o m o t e sa i r w a y hyperreactivity,neutrophilicinflammation,andexpressionof4 MediatorsofInflammation M1cytokineIL-12.Inaddition,exposureofasthmaticmiceto bothIFNandLPSinducedhighernumbersofmacrophages inthelungs[ 40]. M 1m a c r o p h a g e sp o l a r i z eu n d e rt h ei n fl u e n c eo ft h e transcription factor IRF5. It was shown that a commonIRF5gain-of-function haplotype is associated with asthma and the severity of asthmatic symptoms. These associations were more pronounced in nonatopic asthmatics, and it wassuggested that IRF5 may only have a profound impact onthe pathogenesis and severity of nonatopic asthma and noton atopic asthma [ 53]. An explanation could be that M1 macrophages are responsible for the recruitment of neu-trophils, which are the major effector cells in nonatopicasthma. Neutrophils are also dominant in more severe phe-notypesofasthma,andthemostcommonlyusedtherapyforasthma, corticosteroids, is not effective against neutrophilicinflammation [ 54]. This is in accordance with recent that asthmatics have increasedexpressionofM1markersonmacrophagesinbronchoalveo-lar corticosteroid-sensitiveasthmatics, suggesting that M1 macrophages also play a keyrole in the development of severe corticosteroid-resistantasthma[55]. Af e ws t u d i e sh a v es h o w nt h a tM 1m a c r o p h a g e sa c t preventively in the onsetof allergic airway inflammation in mice[56,57]andsuppressedDCmaturation[ 58].Thisiscon- sistentwiththefindingsofastudythatinvestigatedtheroleoftheM1cytokineIL-12duringthedevelopmentallergicairwayinflammationinmice.TheyshowedthatneutralizationofIL-12duringthesensitizationphaseaggravateddevelopmentof allergicairwayinflammationbutneutralizationofIL-12dur- ing challenges abolished the development of allergic airwayinflammation.ThesedatademonstrateadualroleofIL-12:itactspreventiveduringTh2sensitization,butitcontributestoallergicairwaydiseaseduringallergenchallenges.Theeffectsof IL-12 neutralization were not shown in IFN knockout mice, suggesting that IFNplays an essential role in the IL- 12-inducedeffect[ 59]. Thus, both the presence of M1 skewing factors (IFN , TNF, or LPS) and the proinflammatory mediators released by M1 macrophages can contribute to asthma. The dataimply that M1 macrophages may be beneficial to preventallergic sensitization, but in already established disease theypromote the development of M2 macrophages and inducecorticosteroid resistance. Besides a role in severe asthma,markers of M1 macrophages have also been implicated innonatopicasthma. 3.5. M2 Macrophages in Asthma. The cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 are abundantly present in the lungs of asthmatics,and it may therefore not come as a surprise that mark-ers expressed by M2 macrophages have been associatedwith asthma. Elevated levels of chitinase family membershave been found in the serum and lungs of patients withasthma,suggestingthepresenceofincreasedM2macrophagenumbers [ 60,61] .I n d e e d ,w es h o w e dt h a ta s t h m a t i c sh a v e higher percentages of macrophages expressing mannosereceptor and transglutaminase 2 in bronchial biopsies thanin healthy subjects [ 23,62]. In addition Kim et al. showed that severe asthmatics had higher numbers of IL-13-positiveM 2m a c r o p h a g e si nB A L Fa sc o m p a r e dt oh e a l t h yc o n t r o l s[63]. Both chitinase levels and the percentage of mannose receptor-positive macrophages also correlated with asthmaseverity [60,62]. Higher numbers of M2 macrophages were also found in children undergoing severe exacerbations of asthma [64]. In addition, we have recently shown in several modelsofhouse-dust-mite-inducedasthmathatthenumberofM2 macrophagespositivelycorrelatedwiththeseverityofairway inflammation [ 39]. These clinical and animal model findings demonstrate a correlation between asthma severityandthenumberofM2macrophages,butitisunclearwhetherM2 macrophages actively contribute to the induction andexacerbation of the disease or are just bystanders in allergicairway inflammation responding to the high IL-4 and IL-13levels. Credit to the role of M2 macrophages in the exacer- bation of the disease was given by adoptive transfer stud-ies. The transfer of in vitrodifferentiated M2 macrophages into the airways of male asthmatic mice aggravated airwayinflammation [ 65]. Another study using IL-4R -positive M2 macrophages showed that intraperitoneal injection to increase the allergicinflammatoryresponseinthelung[ 66].Inadifferentmodel offungus-inducedasthma,Moreiraetal.showedthattransfero fM 2m a c r o p h a g e si n t ot h el u n g so fm i c ee n h a n c e db o t hinflammation and collagen deposition [ 67]a sc o m p a r e dt o asthmatic mice not treated with macrophages. Since M2macrophages and their products have been reported in asthma patients, M2 macrophages may be a target to reduce a s t h m as y m p t o m s .I n d e e d ,t h es t u d yb yM o r e i r ae ta l .i nmicewithfungus-inducedasthmaalsoshowedthattreatmentwith an inhibitor of M2 resultedin lower airway hyperreactivity, mucus cell proliferation,collagendeposition,andM2numbersascomparedtocontrolmice [67]. support of these results, M2- expressed transglutaminase 2 reduced ovalbumin-induced airway hyperreactivity, ovalbumin-specific IgE levels, andinfiltration of inflammatory cells in lung tissue [ 68]. These studies substantiated previous circumstantial evidence con-cerning a role for M2 macrophages in the pathogenesis ofasthma[69,70]. Unfortunately, the previous studies did not conclu- sively prove that M2 macrophages play a causative rolein the development of allergic airway inflammation. Incontrast to what has just been described, Nieuwenhuizenet al. recently demonstrated that M2 macrophages are notnecessary for allergic airway disease and may only be aconsequence of the elevated Th2 response. They studiedthe contribution of M2 macrophages to acute, chronic,and house-dust-mite-induced allergic airway inflamma-tion by using mice with abrogated IL-4R signaling on macrophages. It was demonstrated that activity, Th2 responses, mucus hypersecretion, number of eosinophils, and collagen deposition were not significantlyaffected by decreased development of M2 macrophages.However, the expression of M2 markers was still higher inmice with macrophage-restricted IL-4 receptor- (IL-4R)MediatorsofInflammation 5 deficiencyascomparedtohealthymice.Thepresenceofthese small numbers of M2 macrophages may still have been abletoreinforcetheTh2response[ 71]. To sum up, M2 markers are correlated with severity of allergic airway disease in humans and mice, suggestingthat M2 macrophages contribute to the disease. Indeed, elimination of M2 macrophages in established disease by pharmacological interventions remarkably decreased thedegree of airway inflammation. However, new data suggestthat M2 macrophages are not essential for the developmentofallergicairwayinflammationbutonlyplayabystanderroleasaconsequenceoftheTh2response. 3.6.M2-LikeMacrophagesinAsthma. Reportsontheroleof M2-likemacrophagesinasthmaarefew.Thesemacrophagescould play an important role in the resolution of asthmabecause of their production of IL-10. Interestingly, a lowerlevel of IL-10 production was found in lung macrophagesfromasthmaticscomparedtohealthypersons[ 72].Moreover, macrophages from severe asthmatics produce high levels of IL-6 and IL-8, but IL-10 was undetectable in these cells compared to macrophages from patients with moderateasthma[73]. Studiesinmousemodelsofallergicairwayinflammation have investigated the role of IL-10 intensively and found itto be an important mediator in the resolution of airwayinflammation[ 74],butonlyfewstudiedtheproductionofIL- 10 by macrophages. We have just shown that the number ofIL-10-positivecellsislowerinlungsofmicewithhouse-dust-mite-induced asthma as compared to control mice [ 39], and recentlyitwasalsoshownthatlunginterstitialmacrophagesproducehighlevelsofIL-10andpreventairwayinflammationinmice[9].Stimulationofmacrophagesbyovalbuminuptake and TLR ligands induced increased production of IL-10by these macrophages, and this resulted in lower levels ofIL-5 and ovalbumin-specific IgE and a lower number ofeosinophilsinamousemodelofasthma[ 75]. Although evidence for a role of M2-like macrophages in asthma is scarce, these findings suggest a protective effectsinceactiveIL-10productionbythesecellsislowinmoderateasthma and absent in severe asthma. In a mouse model ofasthma IL-10 was shown to act as an anti-inflammatory.Studies on the resolution of asthma may reveal whetheran increased production of IL-10 by these macrophages is involved.

COPD. COPD is one of the most common respiratory diseases and affects around 320,000 people in The Nether-lands(AnnualReport2011DutchLungFund).Itisprojectedto be the fourth leading cause of death worldwide by 2030and places a huge economic burden on society [ 76]. COPD iscausedbylunginflammationduetoinhalationofnoxiousgasses and particles: in the Western World most commonlyf r o mc i g a r e t t es m o k i n ga n di nd e v e l o p i n gc o u n t r i e sf r o mindoor biomass cooking and heating [ 77]. The disease is characterizedbyairflowlimitationthatisnotfullyreversible,whichiscausedbyacombinationofobstructivebronchiolitis(alsoknownaschronicbronchitis)anddestructionofalveoliresulting in airspace enlargement (also known as emphy-sema) [78]. The relative contributions of chronic bronchitis and the COPD phenotype can vary frompersontoperson. 4.2.PathogenesisofCOPD. Exposuretosmokeandparticles leads to an exaggerated chronic inflammation in lungs ofpeople susceptible to the development of COPD. Excessmucus production and progressive narrowing of the res- piratory bronchioles characterize chronic bronchitis. The mucosa, submucosa, and glandular tissue become infiltratedwith inflammatory cells and the walls of the respiratorybronchiolesbecomethickenedbecauseofedemaandfibrosis[79]. Chronic mucus hypersecretion is induced by goblet cellhyperplasiaandhypertrophyofsubmucosalglands[ 80], whichfurthercontributestoocclusionofsmallairways.Thisprogressivenarrowingleadstoobliterationorevencompletedisappearanceofrespiratorybronchioles.Notmuchisknownabout the macrophages in this part of the disease,but pigmented macrophages were found to cluster aroundsmallairwaysandthesewereassociatedwithperibronchiolarfibrosis[81].6 MediatorsofInflammation The alveolar destruction that characterizes emphysema is the result of infiltration of inflammatory cells with aprominent role for macrophages. Both neutrophils andmacrophages are being recruited to the lung becausesmoke/particle exposure injures epithelial cells that subse-quentlyreleasecytokinesandchemokinestorecruitthem[ 82, 83] .Th e yh a v eb e e np o s t u l a t e dt ob et h em a i ne ff e c t o rc e l l s contributingtotheexcesstissuedamageseeninemphysemabecause of their ability proteolytic of parenchymal lung destruction in emphysematous lung tissue fromCOPDpatients[ 88].Animalstudiesconfirmedthedominant role for macrophages, because deletion of neutrophils insmoke-exposedratsdidnotpreventcigarettesmoke-inducedemphysema, whereas deletion of macrophages did [ 89]. In addition, mice deficient in MMP12 (mainly produced bymacrophages) were completely protected from different macrophage phenotypes in COPD is the topic ofquite a few studies recently and the subject of much debateastheresultshavebeensomewhatcounterintuitive.Basedonstudies in mice and results from patient studies, M1 polar-ization is expected to play an important role in the patho-genesis of COPD. However, the results of other studies havequestioned this view, and this is nicely illustrated by studiesfromShaykhievetal.andHodgeetal.[ 92,93].Thefirstones recently studied the transcriptome of alveolar nonsmokers alveolar COPD smokers [ ul tss h o w edamix edp h en o typef o ral v eo la rm acr o p h a g es after smoking with downregulation of M1 genes and partial upregulation of M2 genes, which was progressively worsei nC O P D .H o d g ee ta l .s h o w e dam i x e dp h e n o t y p ei nalveolarmacrophagesofsmokingCOPDpatientswithsomeM1 (MHC II expression) and M2 (efferocytosis) markersgoing down and some going up (proinflammatory cytokineproduction and DC-SIGN expression) [ 93].

Several lines of evidence support not only a role for M1 macrophages but also a rolefor dysregulated M1 macrophages in the development ofCOPD.Firstofall,exposuretocompoundsinsmokeappearsto induce M1 polarization of macrophages. Smoking is themost important risk factor for COPD and cigarette smokecontainsmanythousandsofcompounds,includingLPSthatcanactivatemacrophagesinthelung[ 94].Indeed,increased e x p r e s s i o no fi N O Si na l v e o l a rm a c r o p h a g e sw a sf o u n di nCOPDpatients[ 95-97],indicatingapolarizationtowardsanM1phenotype.UpregulationofiNOSincreasesROSandNO production and can then cause oxidative stress. Oxidativestress has been shown to be an important contributor to thepathogenesis of COPD [ 98]. Smoking itself of course causes oxidative stress, and increased iNOS activity through M1polarizationcanaddtothisstress[ 99-101]. Furthermore, many studies have shown that smoke exposure enhances the release of the M1 proinflammatorycytokinesIL-1,IL-6,IL-8,andTNF[102-107].M1-derived cytokines also play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD. IL-1,I L - 6 ,I L - 8 ,a n dT N Fhave all been found to be elevated in COPD [ 108-118] and in experimental settings have been found to contribute to the development of persistent airwayinflammation,emphysema,andmucusproduction[ 102,119- 124].TNFwasfoundtodrivemostoftheemphysemadevel- opmentinmiceaftersmokingbecausemicelackingreceptorsforTNFonlydevelopedmildemphysema[ 124].Inaddition, mice overexpressing TNF develop chronic inflammation and emphysema [ 119,125,126]. However, in humans antibodies against TNF seem to be ineffective in COPD,questioningtherelevanceofthiscytokineforhumanCOPD[127].InadditiontoTNF,M1cytokineIL-1wasalso foundtoplayarole[ 102,120].OverexpressionofIL-1inlung caused lung inflammation, emphysema, mucus metaplasia,and airway in mice [ 121]. Taken together these data suggestcytokinesproducedbyM1macrophagesatleastplayaroleinthepathogenesisofCOPD. Another important M1-related cytokine with a role in COPD is IFN.I ti sp r o d u c e db yC D 8 +Tc e l l st h a ti n fi l - trate the lungs in COPD [ 88,128,129]a n dc a nc a u s eM 1 polarization.

COPD is often exacerbated by infections [ 132], and there is accumulating evidence that reducedmacrophagephagocytosisinCOPDmayberespon-sibleforthepersistenceofmicroorganismsinthelungs[ 133- 135].

This overall inhibition of phagocytosis irrespective of macrophage phenotype wasfurther confirmed by the later study of Hodge et al. that hasalreadybeenmentionedbefore[ 93]. Taken together, the available data suggest that a dysreg- ulated M1 response plays a role in COPD rather than ani n c r e a s e dn u m b e ro fM 1m a c r o p h a g e s .S o m ea s p e c t so ft h eM1activationsignatureareupregulatedinCOPD(ROSgen-eration, yb ea b l et oi n d u c ee m p h y s e m a , but so does overexpression of prototypical M2 inducedIL-13.

In mice, M2 macrophages produce large amounts of chitinases like Ym1 and Ym2 [ 139]. Whether their human counterparts are also induced by alternative activationis unclear, but another member of this family, stabilin-1interacting chitinase-like protein (SI-CLP), has been foundupregulated in M2 macrophages [ 140]. Whether or not pointing at alternative activation, many members of thechitinasefamilyassociatewithCOPD.Chitotriosidaselevels,for instance, were increased in bronchoalveolar lavage ofsmokerswithCOPDandtheyalsohadmorechitotriosidase-positive cells in bronchial biopsies and an elevated pro-portion of alveolar macrophages expressing chitotriosidaseas compared to smokers without Furthermore, chitinase-1 was selectively increasedinasubsetofpatientswithsevereCOPD[ 142],and serum concentrations of YKL-40 were significantly higher i ns m o k e r sw i t hC O P Da sc o m p a r e dt on o n s m o k e r so rsmokers without COPD and correlated negatively for M2 macrophages. As mentioned above MMP12plays an important role in mouse emphysema [ 90,91], and MMP12 was found specifically induced in IL-4-stimulatedM2macrophages[ 146].Furthermore,Woodruffetal.showed M2 and COPD. Please note the dysfunc- tionalstateofmacrophagesduringCOPD. smokers using MMP12 as a marker for alternativeactivation [147], and many others showed that smoke induces MMP12 inmacrophages[ 148-154].Interestingly,MMP12production bymacrophageswasalsofoundtobenecessarytoterminateboth neutrophil and macrophage influx at the end of aninflammatory response and may therefore be an instrumento fM 2m a c r o p h a g e st od a m p e ni n fl a m m a t i o nt ob ea b l eto start remodeling of damaged tissue [ 155]. How that ties in with the potential proemphysematous role of M2macrophagesremainsanopenquestion. Summarizing, there is some evidence for a role of M2 activation in COPD, and this evidence points at a role con-tributing to the development of COPD.

Pulmonary Fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a disease that encompasses a collection of restrictive pulmonary disorderscharacterized by progressive and irreversible destruction oflung architecture by excessive deposition of extracellularmatrix(ECM)[ 158].WhileECMformationusuallyfunctions as an essential process of tissue healing after lung injury,continuous damage may result in abnormal wound repairand progress to fibrosis. Fibrosis of the interstitium ulti-mately leads to organ malfunction because of the disturbedarchitecture of the lung, causing impaired gas exchange andeventuallydeathfromrespiratoryfailure[ 158].Insomecases, fibrotic lesions remain localized to a limited area of the lung because the initialtrigger is removed, for example aftertuberculosis or a fungal infection, while in others such asin sarcoidosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) progress throughout the lungsinadiffusemanner[ 159]. IPF is the most common and most dangerous of the fibrotic lung diseases. The chronic and slowly progressingcharacterofthediseasetogetherwithanunknownaetiologymakes it a difficult disease to diagnose and treat. Theincidence of IPF appears to be increasing and is currentlyestimated at 7-16 cases per 100,000 persons [ 160]. Patients diagnosedwithIPFhaveapoorlifeexpectancywithamediansurvival of 2-5 years [ 161]. Currently there are no effective therapies available for these patients, as no therapy has yetbeen proven to cure or even halt the progression of fibrosis[159]. 5.2. Pathogenesis of Pulmonary Fibrosis. To describe the pathogenesisofpulmonaryfibrosisandtobeabletounravelthe complex interactions of macrophages, tissue repair afterinjury can be divided into four different stages: the clottingphase for emergency tissue repair, then the inflammatoryphasetofighttheincitingagent,followedbyformationofscartissue in the fibrotic phase for more permanent repair, andeventually resolution of scar tissue and restoration of tissue homeostasisintheresolutionphase.Duringfibrosissomeor allofthesestagesaredysregulatedaswillbediscussedbelow . Pulmonaryfibrosisisthoughttobetheresultofrepetitive injury to the epithelial cell layer lining the alveoli. Thisdamage initiates a blood coagulation cascade to preventsevere blood loss and to maintain some sort of homeostasis.Thisincludesplateletaccumulationandproductionoffibrinby epithelial cells, which is essential for fibrin-containingclot formation [ 162]. To restore the function of damaged tissue, plasminogen activator (PA) eventually breaks downthis fibrin matrix again. In pulmonary fibrosis, changes inboth the coagulation cascade itself and the resolution of thewound-healing clot can affect the tissue. It has been difficult to investigate the role of the former and this phase in fibrosis because patients usually present with end-stage disease. Nevertheless, theinflammatory response has been extensively studied in LPS-induced inflammation in humans (reviewed by Rossol et al.[166]). It was shown that epithelial cell damage induces the release of several cytokines and chemokines that triggers aninflux of neutrophils, closely followed by monocytes to fightthe inciting agent [ 167]. Epithelial cells also release growth factors like TGF,T N F, and epidermal growth factor alfa (EGF)thatstimulatetissuehealingbyactivatingfibroblasts, which are the main producers of collagen and other ECMproteins[ 168,169]. Control of the inflammatory event, however, is essential for a proper wound healing process [ 169]. Dysregulation of the inflammatory phase with a prominent role for M1macrophages has long been thought to be important to thep r o c e s so ffi b r o s i s .Th ef a c tt h a ta n t i - i n fl a m m a t o r yd r u g ssuchascorticosteroidshavenotherapeuticeffectsinpatientswith pulmonary fibrosis has made this assumption unlikely[170]. Now the new prevailing hypothesis is that pulmonary fibrosis probably develops when the fibrotic phase and/orresolutionphasebecomedysregulated[ 171]. To progress from the inflammatory phase to the next p h a s eo ft i s s u er e p a i r ,i n fl a m m a t i o nn e e d st ob ed a m p e n e d . The release of IL-10 and TGFdampens inflammation and promotes ECM production by myofibroblasts [ 172]. Under the influence of TGFa n dP D G Fp r o d u c e db yd a m a g e d epithelial cells and platelets, fibroblasts differentiate intomyofibroblasts,proliferate,andproduceECMproteins[ 173]. Furthermore, they start producing their own TGF to maintain tissue healing [ 174]. In pulmonary fibrosis this phase is probably dysregulated as increased numbers ofmyofibroblasts and increased production of ECM are foundin fibrotic lungs. Increased numbers of M2 macrophagesa r ea l s oa s s o c i a t e dw i t ht h i sp h a s e ,a n dt h e s em a c r o p h a g e sare therefore suggested to play an important role in thedevelopmentoffibrosis[ 169]. Eventuallyrepairoftheepithelialcellbarrierandremoval ofexcessECMareessentialtorecovernormallungfunction.T oovercomethelossofalveolarepithelialtypeIcells(AECI),alveolarepithelialtypeIIcells(AECII)becomehyperplasticand provisionally restore withthe ECM produced by myofibroblasts [ 168]. Normally these type II cells would revert back to AEC I and homeostasis is restored. However, when injury is repetitive this does nots e e mt oo c c u r ;E C Mi sp r o d u c e dc o n t i n u o u s l ya n dA E CII continue to proliferate without reverting back to AECI. In a proper tissue healing response, the excess of ECM products is removed to gain full function of the lungs again. MacrophagesareimportantcellsindegradingandtakingupECM components. In order to do so they produce MMPsand their inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases,TIMPs). A balance between the activities of MMPs andMediatorsofInflammation 9 TIMPs is important to maintain tissue homeostasis [ 175]. LevelsofbothMMPsandTIMPsareelevatedinpatientsandmousemodelsofpulmonaryfibrosis[ 176],buttheirbalance is clearly disrupted as the net result is an excess of ECM inthoselungs. 5.3. Macrophages in Pulmonary Fibrosis. Macrophages play an important role in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis, buttheir role is complex. They are involved in many of thedysregulated tissue healing responses in fibrosis, and theycan also adopt many phenotypes. This complexes studiesinto their role in fibrosis tremendously. In the next part wew i l ld i s c u s sw h a ti sk n o w na b o u tt h ec o n t r i b u t i o no fe a c hmacrophagephenotypetoeachstageoffibrosis. 5.4. M1 Macrophages in Pulmonary Fibrosis. We have found no studies reporting on the presence of M1 macrophages inpulmonaryfibrosisexceptforonestudybyNagaietal.show-ing that folate-receptor-beta- (FR -) positive macrophages were higher in patients with IPF as compared to controls[177]. These macrophages have previously been shown to produce TNFand oxygen radicals and are therefore very likelyM1macrophages[ 178]. Several lines of evidence suggest that M1 macrophages may play a role in both the inflammatory phase as well asthe resolution phase of pulmonary fibrosis. As a reactiontowardsepithelialcelldamage,monocytesarerecruitedtothesite of inflammation and differentiate into M1 macrophagesunder the influence of proinflammatory cytokines. Onceactivated, M1 macrophages themselves produce TNF ,I L - 1, and oxygen radicals to kill and phagocytose microbes to fight an infection or remove an exogenous agent [ 179]. Many studies indicate that these proinflammatory cytokinesandoxygenradicalsareassociatedwithfibrosisdevelopment[180-188]. In the study by Nagai et al. ablation of the FR - expressing abrogated fibrosis develop-ment [177]. However, the importance of the contribution of inflammation to established fibrosis has been challengedbecauseanti-inflammatorydrugssuchascorticosteroidshaveno therapeutic effects in patients with pulmonary fibrosis[170] .Th i sv i e ww a sc o n fi r m e db yas t u d yf r o mG i b b o n se t al.Theystudiednewlyrecruitedinflammatorymacrophagesin a mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis andshowedthatdepletionoftissue-residentmacrophagesand/or circulating inflammatory monocytes during the inflamma- tory phase did not affect the onset or degree of fibrosisthat developed after this inflammatory phase [ 189]. Another s t u d yp o i n t e do u tt h a tt h eM 1c y t o k i n eT N F has beneficial effects on alveolar epithelial cell recovery and therefore alsocontributestoresolution[ 190]. In the resolution phase, macrophages are involved in the degradation of excess ECM and the uptake of matrixcomponents [ 189,191]. Depletion of macrophages during this recovery phase impaired the resolution of fibrosis byslowing down the degradation of ECM [ 189]. It is unclear what type of macrophages is responsible for degradation ofECM, but a case can be made for M1 macrophages as thesehavebeenshowntoproduceseveralMMPsincludingMMP7 andMMP9.LevelsofMMP9havebeenfoundtobeincreasedinlungsofIPFpatientsandthismayreflectafailingattemptof the lungs to remove excess ECM and may be caused by asimultaneousincreaseoftheinhibitorTIMP-1[ 192-194]. Macrophages are also important in the subsequent removalofECMcomponentsthroughendocytosis-mediated mechanisms.

M2 Macrophages in Pulmonary Fibrosis. There is a great deal of evidence that Th2 responses are important in thedevelopment of fibrosis, and it appears that IL-13 is the predominantcytokineintheprofibroticresponses[ 195-202]. LevelsofIL-13arehigherinpatientswithpulmonaryfibrosisas compared to controls, and isolated fromthese fibrotic lungs produce more IL-13 than macrophagesfrom control lungs [ 203]. It therefore comes as no surprise thatM2macrophagesareassociatedwithpulmonaryfibrosis,although we could not find publications directly showingnumbers of M2 macrophages are increased in lung tissueof patients with pulmonary fibrosis. We did find one studyshowinghighernumbersofM2macrophagesinBALFofIPFpatients as compared to controls and two studies showinghigher numbers of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)-positiveandPDGF-positiveinterstitialmacrophagesinlungtissue of IPF patients compared to controls [ Boththesemarkersareimportantprofibroticmediators,andarecentstudybyChenetal.showedthatexpressionofIGF-I colocalized with arginase-1 and not not the M2-like subset [ 207]. This was a study in mice; it therefore remains to be investigated whether this is alsotrueinhumans. Markers found on or produced by M2 macrophages have also been found to be increased in pulmonary fibrosis.Levels of galectin-3, a carbohydrate-binding lectin that is necessary for alternative activation [ 208], were higher in BALF of IPF patients as compared to control patients [ 209]. Furthermore,macrophagesfromIPFpatientsproducedmoreof the human M2 marker CCL18 than control macrophages,and this correlated negatively with pulmonary function testparameters[ 210].IPFpatientswerealsofoundtohavehigher serumandpulmonarylevelsofchitinase-likeproteinYKL-40as compared to controls, although it is still unclear whetherchitinasesaretruemarkersofalternativeactivationinhumanmacrophages[ 211].Thisisalsothecaseforarginase-1,which is a marker of M2 macrophages in mice but its specificity inhumans is debated [ 22]. Nevertheless, lung tissue from IPF patientshadhigherexpressionofarginase-1inmacrophages10 MediatorsofInflammation than normal lung tissue [ 212]. Lastly, circulating monocytes from systemic sclerosis patients with pulmonary fibrosisshowedenhancedprofibroticphenotypebyincreasedexpres-sion of CD163, a marker of alternative activation in humans[213]. Experimentalmodelsofpulmonaryfibrosishaverevealed more about the role of M2 macrophages in fibrosis of the lung. Depletion of macrophages during the fibrotic phase oflung fibrosis reduced the deposition of ECM in this organ[189]. To confirm a role for M2 macrophages, levels of Ym1 and arginase-1 were measured before and after macrophagedepletion. Both markers showed decreased expression inthe lungs after removal of macrophages. The M1 markeriNOS did not show a reduction in expression, indicatingthat M2 macrophages are predominantlyresponsible for thedevelopment of fibrosis. Furthermore, M2 marker MMP12was shown to be essential in the development of fibrosisinduced by excessive activation of Fas [ 214]a n di nam o d e l ofIL-13dependentfibrosis[ 215]. There is some evidence or how M2 macrophages would contributestothefibrosisdevelopment.Theaforementionedproduction of IGF-I and PDGF contribute to proliferationof and their transformation to ECM-producingmyofibroblasts (also known as resistin-likemoleculealpha)wasfoundtoincreaseECMpro-ductioninfibroblasts[ 216],butarecentpaperbyPesceetal. showedthatFIZZ1actuallyamelioratedfibrosisdevelopmentbynegativelyregulatingTh2-dependentresponses[ 217].This contradictory finding highlights other new findings thatalso suggest that M2 macrophages could be antifibrotic. A mechanistic study in a model of Schistosoma-induced liver fibrosiswithspecific deletionoftheIL-4R on myeloid cells preventingalternativeactivationofmacrophagesshowedthatM2 macrophages required for fibrosis development[218].Inaddition,relatedstudieswithmicelackingarginase- 1 in M2 macrophages showed that the arginase-1-expressingM2 macrophages were required for suppression and resolu-tion of fibrosis [ 217] .Th i sc o r r e l a t e sw e l lw i t hfi n d i n g st h a t uptake of ECM components appears to be mediated by M2macrophages. Uptake of these components is mediated bydifferentmannosereceptors[ 27]andbyglycoproteinmilkfat globule epidermal growth factor 8 (Mfge8) [ 219]. Mannose receptors of course are a known M2 marker, and for Mfge8this is unclear. Both mannose receptor 2 and Mfge8 wereshowntoattenuatefibrosisindifferentmodels[ 219,220]. To summarize, M2 macrophages are firmly associated with fibrosis development, but new evidence suggests theymay actually contribute to resolution of fibrosis. Their pres-ence during fibrosis may be explained as a failing attempt toclear the excess ECM. The conflicting roles described in theliteraturemaybetheresultofdifficultiesseparatingtheeffectsof M2 and M2-like macrophages simply because these Pulmonary Fibrosis. The spe- cificroleofM2-likemacrophageshasnotbeeninvestigatedinlungfibrosisyet,butM2-likemacrophagesmaybeimportantduring the transition from inflammation towards tissue healing.ThesignaturemarkerofM2-likemacrophagesisIL-10, which is the canonical anti-inflammatory cytokine withprofibrotic actions. by alveolar macrophages diseases, including IPF [ 221- 223] and in systemic sclerosis patients with interstitial lung disease [ 213]. Its anti-inflammatory actions in lung are illustrated by a study from Armstrong et al., showing thatIL-10 inhibited TNFproduction by alveolar macrophages after LPS stimulation [ 224]. In addition, several studies in mice using the model of bleomycin-induced profibrotic [ 227]. et al. inducible IL- 10 overexpression inClara cells inducedfibrosisby fibrocyterecruitment and activation of macrophages towards an M2p h e n o t y p e .Th ei n c r e a s e dl e v e l so fI L - 1 0f o u n di nl u n g sof IPF patients may therefore contribute to the fibroticprocess.Theproductionoftheprofibrotic,anti-inflammatorycytokine TGFw o u l da l s ofi tw i t ht h i sr o l eo fd a m p e n i n g inflammation and promoting tissue repair by this subset ofmacrophages.WhetherTGFproductionisrestrictedtothe IL-10-producingM2-likemacrophagesubtyperemainstobeinvestigated. In summary, M2-like macrophages are likely candidates for promotion of fibrosis. They may be recruited or inducedby damage to the epithelium to dampen inflammation andstart repair. In the event of ongoing damage they are contin- ually induced or recruited and may contribute to fibrosis by overexpressionofIL-10.Sincecorticosteroidsarealsocapableof inducing M2-like macrophages, this would explain whythesedrugsarenoteffectiveagainstfibrosisandmayevenbedisadvantageous. This is illustratedby our finding that whencorticosteroidsarespecificallydeliveredtolivermacrophagesin a model of liver fibrosis, fibrosis actually becomes worse[228]. Overall, current data on the role of macrophages in the development of pulmonary fibrosis show that macrophagesare important cells in the pathogenesis of this disease (seealsoFigure 4).M1macrophagesareimportantintheinflam- matory phase and may also be important for resolutionof the disease, although this hypothesis needs testing. M2and M2-like macrophages are highly associated with fibro-genesis. However, new data suggest that M2 macrophagesm a ya c t u a l l yp r o t e c ta g a i n s td e v e l o p m e n to ffi b r o s i sw h i l eM2-like macrophages contribute to fibrosis. Therefore, keyto understanding how these two phenotypes contribute topulmonary fibrosis are studies differentiating between M2andM2-likemacrophages. 6.
