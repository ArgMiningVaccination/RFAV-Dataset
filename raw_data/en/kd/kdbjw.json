Acupuncture Acupuncture is the practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine that has been used for at least 3,000 years to restore and preserve health. It is the insertion of very fine, sterile needles at specific points on the body known to be energetic powerhouses. Acupuncture is a particularly potent tool as a catalyst allowing the body to deeply relax and open to healing. Aromatherapy Essential oils have a wide array of effects on the mind and body. In use for thousands of years as a treatment for mental and emotional problems as well as to alleviate physical symptoms. Essential oils are quickly assimilated through inhalation and can also be absorbed through the skin. Marc Has been teaching about essential oils for nearly 15 years and has developed his own line of Essential Oils Based on Traditonal Chinese Medicine. Essential Oils are quickly becoming one of the most popular adjunct therapies used by Acupuncturists. Hypnosis Hypnosis is a state of deep relaxation, intended to bring someone to a place where previous conditioning does not matter. Intellectual decisions must be backed up by internal changes and supported by the Will. Our Will is the powerhouse we draw upon to get the job done, and its unlimited resources are available to us all. It is easiest to access the Will once our desires are clear. Knowing we want to change and knowing what needs to be done is not enough.. Once we dismiss these ideas that are not serving us, the way is cleared and action becomes easy. Massage and Bodywork Marcs massage is a part of most acupuncture sessions. However, 1 hour and 1.5 hour sessions are available.

Massage increases circulation, flexibility, relaxation and promotes a clear mind.
