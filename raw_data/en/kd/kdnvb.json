Not only are we getting [Resident Evil 4 Remake](https://geekculture.co/resident-evil-4-remake-launches-23-march-2023-for-ps5-pc-xbox-series-xs/), but the intriguing horror game that is [The Callisto Protocol](https://geekculture.co/new-screenshots-for-the-callisto-protocol-fills-that-dead-space-void/) also dropped a new [gameplay trailer](https://youtu.be/iGQTa16PqjE), alongside a 2 December release date. Expect plenty of dark corridors, a creepy atmosphere, and a collection of disgustingly frightening creatures known as the Biophage for company. The game casts players in the role of Jacob Lee, who finds himself trapped in the Black Iron Prison on Jupiter's dead moon, Callisto, in the year 2320. Of course, Lee is there to investigate the United Jupiter Company and all the shady businesses, and the Biophage will likely be one of them. To make the gameplay in The Callisto Protocol even more exciting, the developers are using something called Horror Engineering. This allows them to \"hand craft unforgettable scares\" and \"blending atmosphere, tension, brutality, helplessness, and humanity to thrill players ... and hopefully scare the crap out of them.\" The Callisto Protocol will take advantage of the technology on the PS5 as well, with 3D audio ramping up the immersion and the DualSense haptics to heighten the scares. This will come into play when Lee has to fight off the Biophage using the gravity weapon known as the GRP. The studio behind the game, Striking Distance Studios, was founded by Dead Space creator Glen Schofield, who shared that he was \"excited to be returning to my roots with an all-new take on the sci-fi survival horror genre.\" With a [Dead Space remake](https://geekculture.co/dead-space-remake-kicks-off-2023-with-27-january-release-date/) on the horizon as well, it seems like some friendly competition is on the way. Get ready to experience the merits of horror and terrifying gameplay when The Callisto Protocol releases on PS5 and PS4 this 2 December. "}
