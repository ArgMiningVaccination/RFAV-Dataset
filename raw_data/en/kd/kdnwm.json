Up until then, I'd always thought of it as Our Little Friend, the nubby pencil-eraser thing. My problem: I'd been talking to a lot of scientists who had been upgrading their formerly simple definition of the love button to \"clitoral complex,\" with V-shaped internal components almost equal in size to the penis. It made me want to look at blueprints. Or a treasure map. That wasn't the really confusing thing, though. For men to be clueless about women is, of course, routine. But what the scientists and sex therapists seemed to be suggesting is that a lot of women are also confused. It's possible that there are about as many nerve endings in the tip of a woman's clitoris as there are in the tip of a man's penis, but the nerves of the clitoris are in a more concentrated area. Women also take a bit longer than men to produce a genital response, and they do so in a pansexual wonderland of situations. But at the same time, they often seem to be just as oblivious as men are to what's going on down there. Where lust is a constant drive for men, many women may be deep into foreplay before it kicks in, like an old memory: Oh. This is sex. It feels good. Why don't we do this more often? (To make sex even better, pick up a copy of the [Men's Health Guide to the Best Sex in the World](http://www.mhbestsex.com/ann/?keycode=143362).) This developing picture of female sexuality--physically ready below, but holding back up in mission control--may not sound like good news at first. But if there's static on the communication lines--between a man and a woman or a woman and her own sex organs--recog-nizing it is often a first step toward a remedy. And gaining new insights into sex as women perceive it, not as a mirror image of the male experience, is the best way to reach the promised land of better sex (and more of it) for both sides. But brace yourself. The road to bountiful sex may be a little curvy, with plenty of missed turns en route. It's not an easy trip for a caveman--sorry, you really do need to engage her mind. And it's also a challenge for the politically correct; feminists now frequently espouse something called \"responsive desire,\" which sounds, to male ears, surprisingly passive. Also be aware that there is no simple formula. Women seem to vary far more than men in their approaches to sex, and they confound easy theories. Among the many other interesting variations I heard about were women capable of extragenital orgasms, including a paraplegic woman who could have one by applying a vibrator to the point where her neck and shoulder meet. (It may sound weird until you recollect high-school hickies.) And I met a grand-motherly sex-shop owner offered old-fashioned courtship advice--hand-holding, candles, sweet nothings--while selling strap-ons to women who wanted to perform anal sex on their (surprisingly passive) boyfriends. But mostly I met women in long-term relationships who dreamed that their boyfriends or husbands would wash the dishes, show affection without expectations--and also now and then throw them (the women, not the dishes) down on a bed, or push them up against a wall for a good, hard...philosophical discussion. The statement \"I want men to be men\" came up a lot. But so did the rueful statement, \"Not tonight, dear. I'm too tired.\" Women reminded me that actually arriving at your destination (bountiful sex, or did you forget?) is never guaranteed. But they also gave me lots of good directions from here to there. Some of them were psychological--for instance, about the value of saying the simple things men start to forget to say roughly 6 weeks into a relationship, like \"Wow, that was great,\" or even just \"Thank you.\" And some of it was largely mechanical--for instance, if sex hurts, desire gives way to dread. (The lubricants are on aisle seven, next to the condoms.) Almost everyone reminded me that the challenge for any man, especially as a relationship becomes established, is to cultivate her desire. You can't just expect it to happen automatically. And honestly, you're kidding yourself if you think it's her responsibility as much as yours. In one study of college students in long-term relationships, half the women admitted to having had sex without desire in just the previous 2 weeks. And college is the easy part! If you want her to keep wanting it--wanting you--even as work, the children, and the house nibble away at your life together, you have to keep wooing her. Happily, science can help. But probably not the way you think, with a pink pill to match that blue one. The European pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim tried to produce just such a drug, to address hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). But an advisory panel of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was unimpressed, and in June 2010 the panel turned thumbs down on the company's application. Flibanserin was designed to work on a woman's brain, apparently by decreasing the neurotransmitter serotonin and increasing the feel-good hormone dopamine. Though this drug failed to ring the bell, some analysts believe the market for drugs that reignite lust in women could be worth even more than the market for male counterparts like Viagra. And such drugs may well help some women who have lost their sexual desire. In a recent study funded by Boehringer Ingelheim, 48 percent of women with HSDD who took flibanserin reported improvement. But critics worry that if such drugs eventually win approval (like the testosterone patch for women now available in Europe), they will end up being prescribed far more widely than the medical evidence might warrant, because of aggressive marketing and our own tendency to regard drugs as a quick and easy solution. How can science help? By explaining how lust works in women and why it disappears--and what to do about low desire without necessarily resorting to drugs. That explanation starts with a widely publicized experiment at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, in which each participant sat alone and watched porn. They viewed heterosexual and homosexual couplings, men and women doing naked beach aerobics, and even bonobos (a type of monkey) enjoying hairy simian romance. All the while their arousal was measured two ways--with a keypad for answering written questions, and with a genital gauge for registering physiological responses. The men's sexual response was generally simple. If men think with their penises, as women often allege they do, at least their penises and brains are thinking the same thing. Heterosexual men generally responded both physically and mentally to heterosexual imagery, and homosexual men responded the same way to homosexual imagery. Naked aerobics on the beach was good for a thrill, even though the context wasn't sexual. Bonobos were not, no matter how torrid the embrace. The women's responses also seemed predictable: Heterosexual women said they felt aroused by heterosexual imagery, and so on. But their genitals told a different story. According to information from vaginal probes, women seemed to be aroused--even when they weren't aware of it--by sex in almost any form. Heterosexuals, homosexuals, and even bonobos started the juices flowing. If sex was happening, women--or at least their vaginas--were into it. That doesn't mean all women are bisexual, any more than it means they are secretly interested in bonobos. A more likely explanation for the disconnect between mind and body has to do with evolution: When it comes to mating, women have traditionally been the choosier sex because they needed to find men who would stick around to protect them and share the costs of pregnancy and child rearing. \"Women have a lot more to lose in a sexual scenario, so it makes sense to be cautious,\" says Meredith Chivers, Ph.D., the study's author and a psychologist at Queen's University. Being able to maintain a cool head in sexually charged situations might help them make smarter decisions about potential partners. But if that's so, I wonder, why would a woman's genitals respond so indiscriminately to such a variety of sexual situations? Chivers describes it as an automatic response, like the way we salivate when we smell food whether or not we're actually hungry. \"Vegetarians will sometimes salivate when they smell a steak cooking. Not that they want to eat steak,\" she says. Then she explains the protective hypothesis, an innocuous-sounding phrase for one of the more disturbing ideas ever to come out of science: In our evolutionary past, rape may have been so common that women's bodies adapted to it, with automatic vaginal lubrication providing some protection from pain, injury, or even death. In one study coauthored by Chivers, women had the automatic-arousal response even when they were shown scenes of Jodie Foster's character being violently gang-raped in the film The Accused. A little wishfully, I suggest a less brutal interpretation: Women have traditionally been more socially and emotionally aware than men, perhaps because they are charged with keeping the children happy and the family together. So they smile more than men do, and whether it's nurture or nature, they actually have bigger smile muscles. Couldn't women also have evolved to be sexually responsive, even in the absence of desire, as a way to hold relationships together--like the women in that study of college couples? Not necessarily. \"It's still unwanted sex,\" Chivers says. So far none of this sounds terribly helpful, or flattering to men. But learning why a woman's psychological response could be as important as her physiological response, and how deeply rooted this distinction is in her biology, help me dimly understand things about women that had frankly baffled me. For instance, when I asked women what parts of a man's body--six-pack abs, say--turn them on, they typically responded with bemusement or outright laughter. \"If I like you, I like your body,\" says Tracy Quan, the author of Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl. Sensibly, she adds, \"I mean, within reason.\" Then she veers off in a direction that has almost nothing to do with the body: \"A big turn-on is if a man is being smart and considerate about contraception. I want a guy to care about me. It allows me to relax.\" And when Debby Herbenick, Ph.D., of the Kinsey Institute (and the Men's Health \"sex doc\") tells me about factors that make for satisfying orgasms, I can (almost) understand why women in one study ranked \"psychological intensity of the sexual experience\" and \"relationship satisfaction\" ahead of clitoral stimulation. In her book Because It Feels Good, Herbenick reports that a woman's lust for her partner is a function of both her feeling happy and satisfied with him, and of his lust--that is, how badly he wants her. The mind-body divide might also explain why drugs like Viagra rarely help women regain lost sexual desire. Viagra can increase bloodflow to the genitals in both sexes, and for men, that's enough. But for women, it's not necessarily even a beginning. While her body seems to be saying \"yes,\" her mind may be saying, \"Yikes, I could get pregnant,\" or \"Yecch, he's been kind of a jerk lately.\" Testosterone, another widely prescribed remedy for low sexual desire in women, sounds as if it would yield better results because it perks up mind and body alike. But it also frequently fails to sustain feelings of lust. If the underlying problem is really about the relationship, says Sheryl Kingsberg, Ph.D., chief of behavioral medicine at University Hospitals Case Medical Center, \"she's going to come back in 3 months and say, 'I still don't like my husband.'\" The bottom line is that men have focused almost forever on playing the wrong game. It's not about winning her body. That's the easy part. The real trick is winning her mind. It's a game both men and women seem to be losing. In a 2008 study in Obstetrics & Gynecology, about 40 percent of women of all ages said they rarely or never desired sex--and the lack of desire bothered only about 10 percent of them. That fit the dismal pattern found in other studies, though with a couple of caveats: The respondents in this case were self-selected, not randomly chosen, and the study was paid for by the drug manufacturer Boehringer Ingelheim. It was perhaps a way of priming the market for pharmaceutical solutions to this \"problem.\" Researchers outside Big Pharma respond that women are just fine as is. They worry that drug companies are trying to pathologize and \"medicalize\" normal, healthy biology. An article in the British Medical Journal describes \"female sexual dysfunction\" as one of the \"clearest, freshest\" instances of \"the corporate sponsored creation of a disease.\" In some women, drug companies may literally have created the disease: Reduced sexual desire is a common side effect of antidepressants, antianxiety drugs, blood-pressure medicines, and a long list of other pharmaceuticals. A recent German study reports, a little ironically, that women taking birth-control pills have lower levels of desire and arousal. So they could end up taking a new drug to help them want the sex that the old drug has made undesirable to them. Beyond the drug issue, this debate could lead to one outcome men might well find alarming: Lack of sexual desire could be enshrined as a new norm for women. Negotiations are now under way to revamp the definition of female sexual dysfunction in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM, as it's known among medical professionals. This reference is a bible for mental-health providers. Critics of the current definition say it's extrapolated from what we know about men. So it treats spontaneous sexual desire as the norm, and lack of it as a dysfunction. But recent research suggests that an internal physical urge--that is, feeling horny--isn't necessarily how sex happens for up to a third of women. Instead, \"responsive desire\" is triggered by something or someone outside the body. In such women, researchers say, arousal normally comes first, and desire shows up later--maybe only when she's on the brink of orgasm. When I first heard about responsive desire, it struck me as odd for female researchers with a feminist perspective to be proposing such a passive model of women's sexuality. But it's not passive, says Lori Brotto, Ph.D., a psychologist at the University of British Columbia. \"If anything, what it suggests is that women initiate or respond to sexual cues on the basis of being motivated.\" Instead of acting on a dumb physical urge (my term, and possibly my life), they think about sex. They have reasons for having sex. \"Those reasons may be sexual--'I want to feel sexual pleasure, I want to connect sexually,'**\" Brotto says. \"Or they may be nonsexual--'I want to do this to enhance the intimacy of my relationship, because I love my partner, because my partner's done something good for me, or because it's a stress reliever.' I would argue that it's anything but passive.\" Having the DSM include responsive desire would make doctors less likely to prescribe drugs for women who merely lack spontaneous desire. And that makes sense, says Kingsberg. But when desire never kicks in, and when the problem is persistent and distressing to a woman, she says, that is \"definitely a sexual disorder.\" Medical providers--often older men who are not comfortable discussing sex--have customarily dismissed dwindling sexual appetite in women as a normal part of relationships and aging. And now, says Kingsberg, women may be hearing the same message from the feminist side: \"By trying to normalize low desire,\" we might be making women who miss that sexual urge and want it back \"feel that they're going against their sisters.\" So where does all this leave a man and a woman who don't like losing the game and who want to do something about their sex life, preferably something that doesn't involve drugs? If it's about winning her mind, where do you start? What do you do when feelings of lust, male and female, are entirely intact, but life and the relationship seem mostly to deal out reasons not to have sex? It happens to everyone, even my female friend who claims to have a broadband connection from her brain to her vagina. She and her husband have the usual stressful modern life, with infinite to-do lists and ample occasion for that romance dealbreaker--resentment--to creep between them. \"Where are you guys?\" she wondered at one point, a bit plaintively. \"You could be having sex all over the place. All you need is to figure us out. All you need is the key.\" But there's no single key, of course. That's partly because women are too varied, and partly because the key that works brilliantly one day is liable to jam the lock on her chastity belt the next. (Just try throwing her down on the bed two days in a row.) Even so, here are a few ideas worth keeping in mind. Being desired is often what makes a woman feel desire, according to psychologist Marta Meana, Ph.D., of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. That is, she wants you to want her for her own special traits--not just because of an indiscriminate male urge to hump anything that jiggles. Her desire is also tied into how she perceives her own desirability and the sexiness of her body. But the sexy feelings may fade as relationships go long-term. Partly it's the nature of domestic life, with the woman often falling into a caretaker role. (Surprise: Being like your mom isn't all that sexy.) In the back of her mind, a woman also realizes that her partner wants to have sex with her at least partly because the rules of monogamy give him no other choice. That may be why a favorite fantasy of many women is about being wanted by a stranger. One answer, Quan suggests, is to be a bit of a stranger yourself, keeping the \"clinical little aspects of your life\" separate--picking up your own dry cleaning, say, and maintaining a certain wry distance. Beyond that, here's the single smartest comment (and the closest thing to a key) I heard from anyone on the topic of women and lust: \"People talk least about sex with the person they are having sex with.\" Sorry, I don't mean to use the one four-letter word--\"talk\"--that's most likely to scare men out of the bedroom. But judging by most relationships, talk may well be the sexual missing link. And if lust is largely a force that develops in her mind rather than in her body, talk is the single best way to dive in there and bring it to the surface. Dirty talk, if you prefer. And the nice thing about the woman who made this observation, a Connecticut couples counselor named Tammy Nelson, is that she makes talk seem easy, and also kind of hot. The way to change your sex life, she says, is by completing four sentences, all based on appreciating your partner. 1: \"One thing I really appreciate about our relationship is...\" 2: \"One thing I really appreciate about our sex life is...\" 3: \"One thing we're already doing that I want more of is...\" And 4: \"One thing I'd like to try is...\" Okay, it's a little more complicated than that. In her book Getting the Sex You Want, Nelson outlines a series of step-by-step conversations that a couple can have as a way of opening up and extending their sexual repertoire. Keeping it gradual is a way to bring along the more reluctant partner. Talking about sex also serves to tease a woman along through the ascending levels of arousal. Hint: Don't start by telling her that you've always dreamed about having sex in a skin-tight black leather executioner's outfit with nipple clamps and a cutaway crotch. Really, gradual is good. Nelson, a 48-year-old woman with a therapy practice who's married for the second time and has a blended family of four teenagers, understands harried modern life. So she recommends a weekly sex date, \"a couple of hours a week, Friday at 9...you light candles, change the sheets, take a shower.\" Date night isn't enough. \"People go out to dinner, talk about the kids, drink too much wine, and fall asleep,\" Nelson notes. But a scheduled sex date is another way to help a woman build up anticipation and arousal: \"Oh, it's Friday, maybe I should buy some new underwear or have my legs waxed.\" The element of time can seem daunting to men. When couples go to therapy, it often turns out that his idea of foreplay is to grab her ass or \"tune her breasts like a radio,\" and then go for the prize. Men need to think about how women are wired, Nelson says. It isn't just a product of evolution, but of physiology and culture. Men come with what one of her teenage sons calls a \"pop-up timer,\" a moving part that teaches a strategy of grabbing hold and going for a ride. Women, by contrast, don't see their genitals every day. They're less likely to masturbate, or to do so as often. They may not recognize the signs of arousal, she said: \"If my nipples get hard, it must be cold. I'd better cover up.\" Women also learn to disconnect from their bodies because \"they're dieting from the age of 10. If men are hungry, they say, 'I want a hamburger.' Women say, 'Oh, it must be time for a Diet Pepsi.'**\" As a way to bridge the mind-body disconnect, the familiar advice to women from therapists is to masturbate more. Some therapists make self-pleasuring sound like she's off finding nirvana, complete with burning incense, banging gongs, and mystic visions. But while it would be a stretch to suggest that she is doing this for you, what she learns about herself can help you both. In fact, doing it like a Buddhist may be particularly useful, according to studies by psychologist Brotto. Because so many women complain about disconnectedness and distraction during sex, Brotto has tested a program that borrows mindfulness techniques from meditation. It's about starting in a completely nonsexual context, savoring the sensations of the moment--like the feeling of a penny or the folds of a raisin between the fingers. Next, your partner works at developing a more acute awareness of how her own body feels as she stands in the shower, shifting eventually to how her body feels in a sexual context, and finally to how her skin feels against yours. (Mindfulness works for men, too.) While women are learning more about their bodies, men need to be learning about the uses of strategic delay. \"Men want to know what the secret is,\" Nelson says, \"and the secret is, you whisper in her ear on Wednesday, 'This is what I'm going to do to you on Friday.' \" When I mentioned this to a friend, he said, \"Oh, great, she's turning foreplay into a 3-day event.\" And Nelson readily acknowledges that much of what women have communicated to men about sex in recent years has added up to so much extra static on the wires. \"We've taught men to make love like a woman, looking in our eyes, being emotionally present. We've told them, 'Don't be crazy, control your sexual needs.' It's been very confusing for men, and kind of unfair.\" So here is what really works, she says: A man needs to tease a woman along, ramping up her expectation, and then deliver what she really wants, which is \"ravishment.\" That word is easy to misinterpret. So it's important to remember that it's not about doing anything that scares or hurts your partner. When women talk about being thrown down on the bed, it's not the force that thrills them. What a woman wants, says Nelson, \"is that feeling that he can't control himself, he's so hot for you.\" And, oh yeah, don't forget the clitoral stimulation. You may not burn down the walls every time. So have the grace to laugh about it together. And when you leave her in happy disarray, hair askew, she may very soon reciprocate. Read on to find out how contraceptives affect your partner... \"Not tonight, honey, I'm on The Pill.\" Pills, patches, shots, and vaginal rings do more than stave off babies. Contraceptives can affect your partner in surprising ways. They lower her libido In a German study of roughly 1,000 female medical students, researchers found that those who used oral hormonal methods of birth control had lower levels of arousal and sexual -desire than those who used nonhormonal birth control or none at all. They make her lust after Clooney Very masculine facial features are thought to advertise a strong immune system. Pregnant women and women on the Pill show a stronger preference for men with these healthy-looking faces than do women having a normal menstrual cycle. Women's bodies may be compensating for their progesterone-weakened immune systems. They put her off the scent Mice sniff out mates whose immune-system genes differ from their own; the diverse gene pool makes for disease-resistant offspring. Women may do the same, unless they're on the Pill. Tests show that Pill takers were more attracted to the scent of genetically similar men. Could be trouble at the boozy family reunion. They sometimes turn up the heat Three months after going on either an oral contraceptive or an intravaginal hormonal contraceptive (Nuvaring), women and their partners reported a bump in their sex lives. Two factors may be in play here: The prospect of babyless sex might appeal, and/or a \"foreign presence\" inside the woman stimulates excitement. Try 'em, and see what works for you. "}
