Dr. Peter Smith, long -time and highly respected member of the department, was named as interim Chair. Dr. Cheney has been a faculty member in the department for 36 years and leaves with mixed feelings. On the one hand, additional free time to pursue other interests is a source of pleasant anticipation , but stepping away from a position of leadership in serving the department and its faculty will be missed. During Dr. Cheney's tenure as Department Chair there have been many changes. The faculty size has grown modestly from 20 to 23 tenure track faculty members . During this period 11 faculty members left the department as part of retirements, transfers or departures from the University while 14 faculty members were added to the department as external recruitments and interdepartmental transfers . Some external recruitments came by way of the Cancer Center . These recruitments have further strength ened the cancer pathophysiology research th eme in the department, which previously resided primarily within the reproductive biology group of the department. Additional recruitments have further strengthened the other areas of research focus in the department including neuroscience, reproductive b iology and integrative physiology. Only 39% of the faculty members remain from 2001 when Dr. Cheney took over as department Chair . Research track faculty grew from 4 to 10 during this period and there was a lso a considerable expansion of the doctoral pro gram from 16 students (2001) to 30 students (2004) . Total research funding in the department from 2001 -2014 varied over quite a range from $4,584,661 to $10, 943,448 depending on the year but overall there was considerable growth. For instance, the avera ge funding level over the five year period from 2009 -2014 was $8,177,934 compared to $5,240,738 for the five year period from 1996 -2001 . However, the financial squeeze at NIH and extremely competitive funding environment has taken its toll on our departme nt like it has on most departments and universities. Total NIH funding ranged from 5-7 million/year dur ing the period from 2001 to 2011 but in the most recent years has dropped to about 4 million/year. In some cases, major funding from Foundations has re placed NIH funding. Overall, our department has held up well under the most recent funding crisis - a credit to our talented and vibrant faculty. The department has had an important role in education with responsibility for two modules (Cardio -Pulmonary and Renal -Endocrine) in the medical curriculum and several required and elective graduate courses. Our faculty members continue to make an important contribution to the core IGPBS curriculum. All Physiology faculty members are committed to high quality ed ucation and this is a source of great pride , but two individuals deserve special mention. Dr. John Wood and Dr. Gustavo Blanco truly excel in terms of teaching excellence. Their efforts have been consistently recognized each year by the Student Voice nami ng them \"Outstandin g Instructor s of the Y ear\" and this will undoubtedly continue for many years to come. A great source of stability and support for the department over all these years has come from our outstanding office staff. In particular, our senior administrators, Linda Carr and more recently Shari Standiferd , who took over when Linda retired in 2011, deserve special recognition for their expertise and dedication . Their support of the Department Chair, the faculty in general and the students, postdoc s and laboratory staff has been truly outstanding and highly appreciated. Finally, it is an honor to recognize our greatest advocate and supporter - Jim Osborn, his wife Marion and his daughter Kathleen. Their interest in our department and ver y generous support has contributed enormously to the success we have enjoyed. The Kathleen M Osborn Lectureship is the longest running named lectureship at KUMC and a source of great pride for our department and the University. We have also benefited immensely from two endowed professorships in the department - 2 the Marion M Osborn Professorship , held by Dr. Leslie Heckert, and the Kathleen M. Osborn Chair , held by Dr. Paul Cheney until his retirement as Chair at the end of this academic year . Most recently, with Jim Osborn's support, we have now been able to create a student fellowship in Kathleen 's honor. The first recipient of the Kathleen M. Osborn Fellowship in Reproductive Biology will be named in the Fall of 2014 following a competitive application process. Our deepest thanks and appreciation goes to Jim Osborn and family. HIGHLIG HTS FROM THE 2013 -2014 ACADEMIC YEAR RESEARCH FUNDING : Total research funding for the department was just under eight million dollars ($7,897,952) based on data provided by K UMC Enterprise Analytics. While this is not a record amount, it is still a very healthy level of funding. Total NIH funding improved this year rising to $4, 908,943 from $4,364,350 last year. Based on the latest available data, our department was ranked 31st nationally in NIH research funding among 82 medical schools receiving NIH funding. This is an improvement from 45th last year . However, among the 141 accredited MD -granting medical schools in the United States , 31st places us easily in the top 25th percentile . Although we would like to improve our ranking among public and private medical schools, our current position is still something we can take pride in. Nearly every faculty member's research program was supported by major external funding. It is a tribute to the dedication and talent of our faculty that the department has continued to do so well in spite of the extremely difficult federal and private research funding environment. EDUCATION : To the credit of all the individual faculty instructors and particularly to Dr. Wood and Dr. Wolfe, Directors respectively of the Cardiopulmonary and Renal -Endocrine modules , these modules were , once again, both rated highly by the students. We also had yet another very successful year in terms of teaching awa rds. At the \"Grande Affair\" celebration in April, Dr. Wood and Dr. Blanco were recognized for excellence in teaching. They each won the Student Voice Award for \"Outstanding 3 Lecturer\" in the first year of the medical curriculum. This continues what is now many consecutive years for each of them winning this award. We congratulate both John and Gustavo on their teaching success. And once again this year our department was the recipient of the \"Outstanding Module in the First Year\" award, which went to the Cardio -pulmonary module. As director of this module, Dr. Wood deserves a lot of credit for the continued success of this module. BUDGET CUTS: Thankfully, no budget cuts had to be absorbed this year. We hope this continues and that we might actually g et back to seeing some budget increases, which are badly needed, particularly for salaries. TENURE TRACK APPOINTMENTS: No new tenure track appointments were made during the year. RESEARCH TRACK APPOINTMENTS : Ramakrishna (Rama) Hegde, Ph.D., was appoi nted as a research assistant professor in the department beginning July 1st, 201 3. Rama's research interest is HIV and AIDS focusing primarily on the neurological disease associated with AIDS. Rama received his Ph.D. from the Postgraduate Institute of Med ical Education and Research in Chandigarh, India and did postdoctoral work in the Marion Merrell Dow laboratory of Viral Pathogenesis with the late Dr. Bill Narayan. JOINT AND ADJUNCT APPOINTMENTS : No new joint appointments were made during the year. FAC ULTY PROMOTIONS: We are delighted that Dr. Raj Kumar was promoted to full professor starting July 1st, 2014. Raj has developed a very well -funded research program on regulation of the hypothalamic -pituitary -gonadal axis and has established himself as a le ader in the field. Raj was also appointed as Director of the Center for Reproductive Sciences within the Institute for Reproductive Health and Regenerative Medicine. Congratulations to Raj. FACULTY/STAFF DEPARTURES: We are pleased to report that there were no faculty (tenure track) or staff departures during the year. FACULTY AWARDS/ACCOMPLISHMENTS: Teachi ng awards were mentioned above. Dr. Warren Nothnick was honored at Faculty Research Day (October 8th, 2013) as a recipient of the 2013 Facu lty Investigator Research Award . These awards are given to outstanding investigators who have demonstrated significant research accomplishments and a high potential for sustained productive research in the future. Congratulations on this impressive achievement. This award carries a $1,000 stipend. GRADUATE PROGRAM AND PHYSIOLOGY SOCIETY: The graduate students in the department had another active year. The \"Physiology Society\" leadership included Anand Venugopal as President, Jessica Johnson as Vice President and Keke Pounds as Social Event Coordinator. We are very pleased with the success of the graduate program in Physiology. Five new students were recruited to the department. Including students who are working at Stowers with faculty members who have the ir academic appointment in Physiology, w e now have 28 doctoral students actively enrolled in the department. The number of students who have won external fellowships to support their training is also very pleasing. Sources of this support include the Sel f Fellowship program, the KUMC Biomedical Training Program and the NIH. 4 New Students - Summer 2013 Asona Lui - Dr. Joan Lewis -Wambi Margaret Pruitt - Dr. Peter Baumann New Students - Fall 201 3 Amanda Brinker - Dr. Danny Welch Kelsey Hampton - Dr. Da nny Welch New Students - Spring 2014 Kayla Raider - Dr. John Stanford Ten students completed PhD degrees and 2 students completed a Master's degree during the year.

Collaborations with Dr. Sam Kim (Ob/Gyn) and Dr. Brian Petroff (Medicine) are ongoing and explore the impact of chemotherapy, radiat ion, and endocrine disruptors on the function of the mammalian ovary. Projects underway include (1) the role of stem cells in the generation of germ line and somatic lineages in the ovary, (2) optimizing methodologies for the cryopreservation of oocytes an d ovarian tissue, (3) establishing mechanisms that define oocyte and embryo quality as they pertain to assisted reproductive technologies and (4) defining modifications in cell cycle regulation that occur during the transition from meiosis to mitosis in th e developing embryo.

I am an RNA biologist with interests in understanding the mecha nisms that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional levels of mRNA stability and translation during tumorigenesis. My laboratory has been a leader in the identification of novel RNA binding protein proto - oncogenes and tumor suppressors. In addit ion, we have been leading the efforts on determining the mechanism by which natural and synthetic compounds affect cell signaling pathways in gastrointestinal cancer cells. My lab members primarily focus their work on gastrointestinal cancers. Specific are as of research include: a) Regulation of gene expression at the levels of mRNA stability and translation, b) Cancer Stem Cells, and c) mechanisms of chemoprevention by dietary factors and its novel derivatives.

Gustavo Blanco, M.D., Ph.D. , Professor Our laboratory studies the role of ion -transport proteins of the plasm a membrane in cell function. Research is focused on the Na, K -ATPase, a plasma membrane enzyme system that uses the energy from ATP to establish high intracellular K+ and low intracellular Na+ concentrations which are essential for maintaining cell volume, membrane potential, pH and ion balance. The Na,K -ATPase comprises a group of isozymes, each characterized by unique enzymatic properties and a cell -dependent and developmentally regulated pattern of expression. Research is focused on two main projects. 1. We are studying the function of alpha4, a particular isoform of the catalytic subunit of the Na,K -ATPase that is selectively expressed in spermatozoa. We have found that this isoform, has functional properties that are different from all other Na,K -ATPas es. Alpha4 is expressed in the mid -piece of the sperm flagellum, and is important for sperm motility and fertility. A variety of molecular, cell biology and genetics approaches are being used to study the regulation, activity and mechanisms of action of al pha4 in sperm physiology. Also, we are searching for compounds that will inhibit alpha4 with the idea of using them as male contraceptive agents. These studies will help understand the importance of ion transport in male gamete fertility and contraception. 2. In addition, we are studying the role of the Na,K -ATPase in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Working with renal cells from patients with ADPKD and various mouse models of ADPKD, we have found that the Na,K -ATPase exhibits an abnorm ally increased sensitivity to ouabain, a hormone released by the adrenal glands. Importantly, ouabain stimulates cystogenesis in ADPKD cells and kidneys. Currently, we are investigating how ouabain affects cyst formation and progression in the disease.

Chennathukuzhi, Ph.D. , Assistant Professor My research interests include uterine fibroids, fertility and contraception. Our laboratory is currently trying to understand the roles of GPR10, and its upstream regulator REST, in the pathogenesis of uterine fibroids. We identified that the loss of REST, a tumor suppressor protein, leads to the overexpression of GPR10 in fibroids. We have generated transgenic mice overexpressing GPR10 in the myometrium in order to understand its role in the pathogenesis of fibroids. Additionally, we have generated a conditional knockout mouse model for REST to understand its role in the development of fibroids.

Research in my laboratory focuses on understanding the terminal events involved in follicular development, ovulation and luteal tissue formation. The studies have direct i mplications in development of a fertile healthy oocyte, contraception and disease conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome and ovarian cancer. Current studies focus on understanding the role microRNA post -transcriptional gene regulation plays in the ovulatory process. The laboratory is also working to understand what role extracellular vesicles (exosomes and microvesicles) play in ovarian function (oocyte maturation, granulosa cell function) and in ovarian cancer. These studies use the latest state of the art technologies, including next -gen-sequencing, nanoparticle analysis in addition to standard molecular and biochemical techniques. The laboratory also uses a comparative approach using human, bovine and murine cells and animal studies in both cows and mice to gain further insights into the reproductive biology of the ovary.

Geiger, Ph.D. , Associate Professor Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the leading causes of mortali ty and morbidity in the world. T2D is characterized by insulin resistance and is typically correlated with obesity and aging. In our lab, we study the molecular mechanisms underlying age -related and high fat diet -induced insulin resistance. We hypothesize that oxidative stress is responsible for inhibiting insulin signaling and for the impairment of glucose homeostasis. Stress kinases such as JNK and IKK - are activated by oxidative stress and have recently been implicated in inhibiting insulin signal trans duction. Thus, we are examining the targeted inhibition of stress kinases to improve insulin sensitivity. We are also exploring therapeutic interventions such as heat therapy, exercise and anti -oxidant treatment in high fat -fed rats.

Gonzalez, M.D. , Professor My research interests center on the mechanisms of adaptation to alveolar hypoxia in intact animals. Alveolar h ypoxia occurs when the oxygen levels are reduced in the environment, as it happens in altitude, or when pulmonary function is altered, as in COPD or in restrictive pulmonary diseases. In the last few years my laboratory has studied the mechanisms by which maximal O 2 uptake is altered by hypoxia in a rat model that allows the characterization of the systemic O 2 transport from the atmosphere to the cell. In these studies we have investigated the roles of normoxic and hypoxic exercise training, red blood cell mass, alterations of the affinity of Hb for O 2, among other factors on the determinants of maximal aerobic capacity. Longitudinal studies in rats artificially bred for diverging aerobic capacity have provided important clues on the development of mechanism s of systemic O2 transport along several generations. Another important line of studies involves the interactions between hypoxia and inflammation. Our laboratory demonstrated that hypoxia induces systemic inflammation triggered by activation of alveolar m acrophages. This finding highlights the extrapulmonary effects of alveolar macrophages, which may play a role in the mechanisms of adaptation to hypoxia. On January 1, 2013 I started the Phased Retirement Program, with 50 % effort for 3 years. I closed my lab and terminated my last NIH grant, which was originally funded in 1988.

Exon microarray analysis of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in Exp Ph.D. , Research Assistant Professor The first project that I am working on is to synthesize and test reversible non -hormonal non-steroidal male contraceptive agents. Specifically, my role involves testing novel compounds (in -vitro as well in -vivo) as potential male contraceptives. I also work on determining the mechanism of action of potent compounds and facilitating toxicology, fertility studies for the compound likely to advance towards clinical trials. A second major research interest, concerns whether reproductive potential is affected by space flight. To this effect, we examined the effects of microgravity on the female reproductive tract of mice that were flown on the spac e shuttle on flights STS -131, STS - 133 and STS -135. Our studies on these three space shuttle missions were the first to examine the consequences of space flight on ovaries and uteri of mice. We found that with 12 -15 days of space -flight exposure, female m ice showed significantly small ovaries. Histological analysis showed that flight mice ovaries had fewer corpora lutea and most of the growing follicles in flight ovaries were atretic, indicative of blocked estrous cycle. Ground and flight mice had no signi ficant difference in number of uterine glands, but there was a trend to -ward smaller uteri in flight mice based on the gross pictures, which correlates with the low estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) level. This sets the foundation for our hypothesis that drop in estrogen in reproductive system may be the cause of other estrogen regulated effects seen in the body (bone and muscle loss, wound -healing, immune functions etc.) when exposed to space -flight. I recently got involved in determining the molecular mechan ism of pulmonary hypertension with the goal of elucidating the role of estrogen in pulmonary hypertension .

Osborn Professor for Reproductive Sciences The research in our laboratory focuses on the transcriptional and cell -signaling processes for proper function and deve lopment of the gonads. Sequence and structural information of the genome are queried to identify new proteins and regulatory pathways that direct cellular differentiation and gametogenesis, with the goal of extending our understanding of the mechanistic re quirements for fertility, as a means to improve the options for contraception as well as diagnosis and treatment of infertility. Current research is focused on genes that encode the follicle -stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and doublesex and mab -3 rela ted transcription factor 1 (DMRT1) and using genome editing technology to evaluate the function of predicted regulatory elements in vivo. FSHR is required for cells to respond to the pituitary hormone FSH and thus hormone signaling occurs only in cells th at produce the receptor. FSHR expression is highly cell -specific, limiting FSH response to only somatic cells of the gonads. DMRT1 is a transcription factor that is essential for male fertility. It is found only in the testis, where it is required for th e differentiation and survival of both germ cells and Sertoli cells.

SIV infection in rhesus macaques is one of the best models of HIV -1 infection in humans since the virus has CCR5 phenotype similar to that of HIV. Our findings suggest that morphine has a trend of potentiating virus replicat ion and end -organ pathogenesis, leading to increased mortality in a subset of macaques compared with the virus alone animals. Currently the main focus of our lab research is to address how interactions between morphine & SIV in the acute phase of infection impact disease outcome in the chronic stage neuropathogenesis. Published publication: Gundavarapu S, Mishra NC, induces mucus epithelial cells Professor , Director of the Center for Reproductive Sciences Our laboratory studies development and regulation of the hypothalamus -pituitary - gonadal (HPG) axis using both gain -of-function transgenic and loss -of-function gene knockout approaches. These unique genetic models mimic many of the human diseases and thus enable us to exp erimentally tract them spatio -temporally. Specific projects include unraveling signaling pathways in the hypothalamus that contribute to male sexual behavior, understanding human pituitary null cell tumor pathobiology and developing preventive strategies, delineating mechanisms of secretion of pituitary gonadotropins, and age -dependent gonadotropin regulation of testis and ovarian development and function. These translational studies have significant impact in understanding the physiology and pathology of t he reproductive axis including abnormal reproductive tract development, infertility, and cancer of the pituitary and gonads.

Nothnick, Ph.D. , Professor The uterus is a vital organ for the successful propagation of all higher species. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development and subsequent function of the uterus are absolutely essential for successful reproduction to occur. It is well established that complex interactions among biological mediators dictate the normal pat tern of uterine development and that disruption of these factors plays a causative role in uterine abnormalities, disease and infertility. Our research focuses on three major areas: 1) the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathophysiology of the female d isease, endometriosis, 2) the role of miRNAs in uterine decidualization and early pregnancy loss/embryo implantation insufficiencies, and 3) the identification and development of novel, estrogen -sparing targets for endometriosis treatment. Collectively, t he research in my laboratory focuses on examining the mechanisms which regulate normal uterine development and function, identifying those factors which contribute to these mechanisms and understanding how alterations in these mechanisms lead to uterine di seases such as endometriosis and recurrent pregnancy loss/infertility. The long -term goal of the research conducted in my laboratory is to better our understanding of the pathophysiology of these uterine diseases and in turn develop novel diagnostic/pro gnostic markers and therapeutic agents for their treatment.

We utilize non-human primate and rodent models of recovery after stroke, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury to determine the neurophysiologic, neuroanatomic, and biochemical bases for recovery. By tracking changes in the structure and function of motor areas of the cerebral co rtex as a result injury, we are beginning to describe the cascade of events that give rise to the reorganized brain. We are also studying novel forms of treatment to enhance and accelerate the recovery process. These treatment interventions include physiot herapy, pharmacotherapy, or device -based approaches, either alone or in combination. It is our goal to translate directly the information we gain through brain plasticity research into effective clinical applications.

Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expre ssion by RNA binding protein is a crucial mechanism in regulating the timing and the amount of expression of genes. Growing evidence indicate that the alteration of the expression and function of RNA binding proteins could potentially play a role in inflam mation and cancer. Hence, it is indispensable to identify the RNA binding protein alterations accumulate during cancer progression as well as during the acquisition of metastatic potential in cancer cells. To understand the mechanisms behind the process o f hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in metastasis. Metastasis entails the spread of cancer cells from a primary tumor throughout the body through the blood or lymphatic systems. Hence, blocking angiogenesis could be a strategy to arrest tumor growth. T herefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis processes and their regulation will lead to the discovery of pharmaceutical agents with anti -angiogenic activity.

Treatment and prevention of colon cancer is often unsuccessful and has an extremely high morbidity rate. The major feature of solid tumors is hypoxia; the decreased availability of oxygen has been shown to increase chemotherapy resistance thereby favoring tumor progression. Hypoxia and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) stabilize HIF -1 (hypoxia inducible protein -1), a endothelial factor (VEGF) and inducible nitric oxide synthase HSP90 inhibitors inhibit the expression of VEGF and iNOS suggesting that HSP90 is a critical player in HIF -1 mediated expression of these genes. My research focuses on understanding the mechanism of hypoxia -mediated regulation of cancer stem cells and the effect of hypoxia on hypoxia inducible factor. In addition, to determine the effect of natural HSP90 inhibitors, celastrol and triptolide on the growth and tumor formation of cancer stem cells. Addition to this, isolati ng cancer cells from fresh human cancer patient sample and to try HSP90 inhibitor with and without hypoxia.

In turn, target cells provide molecular signals that govern the quantity and type of innervation they receive. Our research is concerned with this interplay between nerves and targets in controlling end organ activity and in processing sensory signals. We are particularly interested in how hormones and vitamins can regulate neuronal function in conditions such as chronic pain syndromes, the role of renin -angiotensin systems in sensory nerve growth and sensitization, and how genetic variants can lead to d evelopmental neurological disorders.

Infection with Helicobacter pylori results in hypergastrenemia and gastric cancer. In this area is to determine the different gastrin induced cellular signaling response in gastric and colon epithe lial cells and its subsequent effects on the expression of proinflammatory gene COX -2 and IL -8 expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. b) Chemoprevention, to determine the signaling mechanisms of dietary phyto -chemicals & their analogues, and chemotherapeutic agents against colon and pancreatic cancer.

Tash, Ph.D. , Professor My research is funded both by NIH and by NASA. My NIH -funded research focuses on reproductive biology and the regulation of sperm motility and sperm function, and identification of testis and/or sperm speci fic functional components that can be targeted for development of reversible non -hormonal male contraceptive agents. My ongoing NIH grant effort is focusing on continued drug development and elucidating the mechanism of action of H2 -gamendazole (H2 -GMZ), a n 100% effective and 100% reversible orally -active, highly -potent anti -spermatogenic contraceptive agent. The project is also discovering alternative chemical scaffold lead agents that target the same Sertoli cell molecular targets as H2 -GMZ. We recently m et with the FDA to establish the first ever guidance for a non -hormonal male contraceptive that established the testing necessary to enable registering H2 -GMZ as an IND and to ultimately enable first -in human clinical trials. With regard to gravitational research, I have been funded by NASA since 1996 and examining the effects of space flight on both male and female reproductive health. I have had 5 flight experiments on the Space Shuttle from 1997 -2011, including three of the last five shuttle flights). We recently completed a successful flight experiment in May, 2013 on a Russian BION satellite that was the largest and longest animal space flight experiment in NASA and Russian Space Agency history. We are examining the effects of 30 days of space fligh t, including continuous exposure to microgravity and space radiation, on testis function and sperm health in adult male mice. A new NASA grant scheduled to begin funding in Aug 2013, will be the first ever flight of mammalian and sea urchin sperm to the In ternational Space Station National Laboratory to study the impact of space flight on sperm motility, metabolomics and signal transduction.

Wolfe, Ph.D. , Associate Professor Summary of Research: Proper regulation of the hypothalamic -pituitary -gonadal axis as well as development and regulation of the placenta are essential to mammalian reproduction. Research in my laboratory is directed towards understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the genes encoding the hormones within these tissues. An area of interest is how gonadotropin -releasing hormone secreted by hypothalamic neurons signa ls to the pituitary to induce the expression of the gonadotropin genes and also how gonadal steroids feedback to regulate the hypothalamus and pituitary. A second area focuses on elucidating the events associated with the differentiation and function of p lacental trophoblast cells. Our overall goal is to identify the physiologically relevant molecular and cellular events responsible for regulating cell differentiation and tissue/organ function. This will provide a better understanding of how the reproduct ive system is normally regulated and ultimately, will provide clues as to how diseases, drugs and the environment impact reproductive success.
