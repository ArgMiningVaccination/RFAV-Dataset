For example: The impact of each module assessed to create impact factors Module factors can be used as building blocks to assess patient care pathways Allows patient care pathways to be compared with alternative pathwayswww.erm.comAdherence and Carbon Life Cycle Network 2021 28GP visit x5ED visit x2Surgery x2Bed day x3Care pathway afterExample: ~332 kg CO e ~113 kg CO e In this case, increased adherence leads to a saving of ~219 kg CO e. How would this compare with the carbon footprint of a pharma product itself? Would there be an overall saving in carbon emissions? Using life cycle assessment (LCA), ERM can quantify these environmental benefitsIntervention to improve adherence -> improve typical patient care pathways -> fewer emergency admissions, surgical interventions and hospital bed days etc. This leads to a carbon saving which offsets impact of interventionwww.erm.comSmart Inhalers Life Cycle Network 2021 29 Regular inhalers enhanced with either built in or clip -on \"smart\" functionality Device records inhaler use by patient Potential benefits Helps patient to adhere to proscribed inhaler routine Allows medical professionals to monitor adherence Increased adherence leads to improved patient outcome Consequent reduction in: emergency admissions surgical intervention wasted inhalers Potential negatives Life cycle environmental impacts of the device Device production Device disposal Additional cost Do the benefits of the smart inhaler outweigh the device's carbon impact?www.erm.comSmart Inhalers LCA Life with AstraZeneca's Symbicort Turbuhaler Functional unit: The annual management of a child with asthma aged 6 to 16 years old in the United Kingdom, taking regular inhaled steroids, typically with poorly controlled asthma www.erm.comPaediatric asthma -Care pathway Life Cycle Network 2021 31ED visit Ambulance Cycle Network 2021 33The net environmental benefits of healthcare products can be quantified by comparing care pathways Care pathways guidance allows for the impact of patient treatment to be assessed Improved adherence can improve the environmental impact of care pathways This can offset the environmental impact of devices such as smart inhalersThe business of sustainability Thank you Andy Whitingwww.erm.comReferences Life Cycle Network 2021 351.IND/MF and IND/GLY/MF Technical %20Carbon%20Trust%20Certification%202014.pdf , accessed June 2020. 3.Adapted Journal of Cleaner Production , vol. 237, 117733. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.117733.www.erm.comPhoto "}
