During this period three doctors from the Italian Peninsula acted as chief-physicians in Mozambique colony: Jo\u00e3o (1819-1821), a native of Genoa. In 1782, another Italian doctor had been appointed to the Mozambique hospital, but he died during the journey. It is important to note that at least one of these doctors, Carlos Jos\u00e9 Guezzi, was sponsored by a great figure of the Portuguese political Enlightenment, D. Rodrigo de Sousa Coutinho, Portuguese ambassador at Turin (1779-1796) and later state secretary of the Navy and Overseas Affairs (1796-1801).

However, in the course of his stay in Mozambique Guezzi was very involved in the business of slave trade; apparently he did not pay much attention to the hospital.

About 1767, a company of sepoys was transported from Goa to the Zambezi valley to strengthen the defence of the Portuguese colony against the Africans.

Nowadays, there are several ways to cook curry, including the use of coconut milk in the north and the peanut milk in the south. These 'milks' are prepared by pouring hot water over the grated coconut and the ground peanuts. After standing for awhile, each of the mixtures has to be sieved.

Simoni was influenced by the concept of temperament framed by humoral medicine, but he also incorporated the new medical theories about fibres and nerves. Throughout his Medical Treatise he hesitated in classifying temperaments, but he represented people in Mozambique as having lymphatic, bilious, sanguine, muscular, and nervous temperaments, with different kinds of physical and moral characteristics, and distinguished inclination to diverse diseases. E. Rodrigues, 2006, p. 632-636. was not possible to know if this \"bread biscuit\" referred to bread cooked twice or 112v-113. There was not a consensus, but several doctors argued with the benefits of consuming vegetables and some even advocated a vegetarian diet. See J.W. Estes, 2000, p. 1543-1545. J.-L.
