N/A 2Civil Division: Overview Each year the Department of Justice (DOJ) receives roughly 100,000 new civil cases and matters, the majority of which are handled by the U.S. Attorneys' Offices. Situated at the seat of Government, the Civil Division retains only a small portion of this work. Generally, the Division's litigation falls into one of the following categories: case s filed in national or foreign courts; cases that cross multiple jurisdictions; cases that involve national policies; and/or cases th at are so massive and span so many years that they would overwhelm the resources and infrastructure of any individual field office. The Division's role is two-fol d. It represents some 200 Federa l agencies, the Administration and the Congress. And, it must repr esent the Government as a whol e to ensure lasting precedents favorable to the United States. The overwhelming majority - about 90 percent - of the Civil Division's cas es are defensive, and each year, thousands of lawsuits are filed against the Government as a result of its policies, laws, and involvement in commercial activities, domestic and fo reign operations, entitlement programs, as well as law enforcement initiatives, military actions, and counterterrorism efforts. Every year, Civil defeats billions of dollars in unmeritorious clai ms. The Division also brings suits on behalf of the United States, primarily to recoup money lost through fraud, loan defaults, and the abuse of Federal funds. Annually, billi ons of dollars are returned to the treasury, Medicare, and other entitlement pr ograms as a result of Civil's affirmative litigation efforts. In addition, the Civil Divisi on is responsible for the admi nistration of two compensation programs created by the National Childhood Vacci ne Injury Act of 1986 and the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) of 1990. It is now possible for the public to view and better unde rstand the responsibilities and goals of the Civil Division.

Distribution of DOJ Civil Trial Cases 4% 96% Civil Division U.S. Attorneys' Offices Source: Civil Division's case management system (CASES) and the U.S. Attorneys' Annual Statistical Report for FY 2005. MISSION: The Civil Division represents the United States in any civil or criminal matter within its scope of responsibility - pr otecting the public fisc, ensuring that the Federal Government speaks with one voice in it s view of the law, preserving the intent of Congress, and advancin g the credibilit y of the Government before the courts. 3Full Program Costs Funds for the Legal Representation Decision Un it, the Civil Division's only decision unit, are devoted almost entirely to front-line litigation in observance of the management initiatives contained in the DOJ Strategic Plan (2003-2008). Of the Division's roughly 1,000 employees, the vast majority are assigned to the litigati ng branches. In addition, most time expended by branch attorneys is devoted to litigation. For FY 2006, $380,000,000 was available to the Divi sion, exclusive of the RECA Trust Fund (see Civil's RECA Trust Fund Budget) and the September 11 th Victim Compensation Program, which sunset in 2003. Fifty-three percent of this funding came from the GLA appropriation while forty-seven percent was provided throu gh DOJ allotments and reimbursements. The following table provides a list of the Civil Di vision's funding sources, including appropriations and reimbursements. The $15,000,000 dollar d ecrease between 2005 and 2006 was largely a result of the progress made in resolving the Winstar cases.

FY 2008 Est.Commercial Torts OIL Federal Programs Appellate Staff ConsumerFor FY 2008, the Division requests 1,368 positions (959 attorneys), 1,298 FTE, and $245,023,000 to meet its mission and performance goals . Current services positions and FTEs reflect estimates that may change once final staf fing decisions have been determined. The FY 2008 request includes program increases of 192 positions (147 attorneys), 97 FTE, and $17,387,000 to address two of the nation's most pr obing problems: immigration enforcement and the resolution of issues concerning Guantanamo Bay detainees. Issues, Strategies, and Outcomes Between FY 2006 and FY 2008 the workload is e xpected to grow from approximately 53,821 to 65,002 - an increase of 21 percent - as a result of c ontinued growth in immigration cases, as well as an influx of cases filed by pr isoners detained at Guantanamo Bay. These estimates exclude 9,004 Harbor Maintenance Tax as well as some 25,883 ad ministrative claims that have been filed with the Army Corps of Engineers in connection w ith Hurricane Katrina. It is likely that a large number of these claims will be appealed to th e Federal court and handled by the Civil Division attorneys. 1 The potential Katrina cases and the Harbor Maintenanc e Tax cases, for the purpose of this graphic, are so numerous that they must be treated as outliers and have been excluded. 5Because the caseload is mostly defensive, the Di vision cannot control the number of cases filed, the timing of discovery, the size of evidentiary collections, the time span of litigation, or the scheduling of trials. The type, volume, and si ze of the cases are likewise determined by exogenous factors: ! Military Actions ! Natural Disasters ! Influx of Illegal Aliens ! Challenges to Agency Actions ! Statutory Enactments ! Bankruptcies ! Implementation of Count erterrorism Measures ! Whistleblower Referrals ! Vaccine Program Expansion ! Federal Procurement Actions Despite these challenges, the Di vision has achieved remarkable success, as exemplified by the statistics below. This success has been attained by implementing effective strategies, such as retaining a high-quality legal staff and using advanced information technology systems to enhance attorney productivity. Thus far the Division has been able to maximize limited resources by implementing tighter cash-manageme nt controls and obtaining client agency reimbursements. Since FY 2001, the Division has me t or exceeded all of its performance goals. Much of this success was achieved with the particip ation of the U.S. Attorn eys Offices. See the Performance and Resources Table on page 19 for more information. 2 This rate of return is based on amounts recovered in affirmative cases funded through the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) Acco unt and the Three Percent Fund. In FY 2006, the Civil Division: Recovered over $3.2 billion in monies owed to the U.S., yielding $128 for every dollar spent2 Defeated almost $12 billion in unm eritorious claims, saving $61 for every dollar spent Favorably resolved 87% of appellate immigration cases closed Favorably resolved 92% of non-monetary trial cases closed Favorably resolved 87% of non-monetary appellate cases closed 6Summary of Program Changes Proposed FY 2008 Program Changes GLA Appropriation Item Name Pos. FTE Dollars ($000) Page Immigration Litigation 163 82 $14,124 28 Guantanamo Bay Detainee Litigation 29 15 $3,263 33 Total GLA Program Increases 192 97 $17,387 Immigration Litigation The Office of Immigration Li tigation (OIL) defends and upholds the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) enforcement acti ons, enabling the removal of thousands of illegal aliens. OIL's caseload has increased drastically in recent years and has outpaced existing resources. By FY 2008, the caseload is expected to reach a record level of 25,000 cases - nearly four times more cases than in FY 2002. The main factor s contributing to this growth are (1) DHS's heightened enforcement effo rts and (2) an increase in the rate at which aliens appeal removal decisions to the federal courts. As a stopgap measure to address the overwhelm ing number of cases, thousands of briefs have been reassigned to the Department's li tigating components and to U.S. Attorneys' Offices (USAOs) nationwide. The \"outsourci ng\" of briefs forces these components and USAOs to divert time away from efforts crucial to the achievement of their primary missions. Additional resources will enable the centralization of all immigration cases within OIL. As part of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, Congress appropriated $9,000,000 for OIL, emphasizing the importance of immigration enforcement. The attorneys and support staff hired under the supplemental w ill be released when the funds expire later this year unless additional resources are made available. OIL will be unable to keep pace with DHS enforcement efforts thereby weakening the entire immigration enforcement system and necessitating additional resources in FY 2008. Inadequate resources for OIL could result in: adverse judgments leading to the release of criminal aliens; a decreased ability to pursue a unified na tional strategy for immigration enforcement; and an increased in centive for illegal aliens to attempt to enter the country, undermining national security. Therefore, the Civil Division requests 163 positions (124 attorneys), 82 FTE, and $14,124,000 to enable OIL to keep pace with the ever expanding immigration caseload. Guantanamo Bay Detainee Litigation Approximately 400 detainees are currently being held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (GTMO). Through a process that includes a fo rmal hearing before a military Combatant 7Status Review Tribunal (CSRT), almost all of the detainees ha ve been determined to be enemy combatants. These enemy combatants have filed habeas corpus suits against the United States in the District Cour t for the District of Columbia. The Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA) grants the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circui t exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to the validity of any CSRT final determination. Reinforcing the DTA, the Military Co mmissions Act of 2006 replaces district court habeas jurisdiction with DTA review. Based on these two Acts, the Government has as ked that all currently pending habeas actions be dismissed. The approximately 400 detainees may, instead, file challenges to the CSRTs in the D.C. Circuit. Defending this litiga tion is the Civil Division's responsibility. To handle this influx of complex GTMO cases, the Division will require a program increase of 29 positions (23 attorneys), 15 FTE, and $3,263,000 in FY 2008. 8Appropriations Language and Analysis of Appropriations Language* Appropriations Language The FY 2008 Budget request includ es proposed changes in the appr opriations language listed and explained below. New language is italicized and underlined , and language proposed for deletion is bracketed. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LEGAL ACTIVITIES SALARIES AND EXPENSES, GENERAL LEGAL ACTIVITIES In addition, for reimbursement of expenses of the Department of Justice associated with processing cases under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, not to exceed [$6,333,000] $6,833,000 , to be appropriated from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund. Analysis of Appropriations Language Administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, th e Department of Justice, and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is intended to provide a more expeditious a nd less costly way for resolving claims. Administrative expenses are funded through a reimbursement from the VICP Trust Fund. In FY 2005, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was assessed through the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Program A ssessment Rating Tool (PART) program and received a rating of \"Adequate.\" The PA RT assessment recommended an independent evaluation regarding effectiveness, impact, a nd design. OMB stated, \"The VICP has been assessed many times by various internal and ex ternal evaluators, but no single evaluation or group of evaluations together meet each of the standards of quality, independence, scope and regularity. There is a particular dearth of evaluations looking at overall program impact and effectiveness; most existing evaluations focuse d either on process or on only a portion of the program.\" To implement the improvement plan recomme nded by OMB and to procure an independent evaluation of VICP's effectiveness, impact , and design, the Civ il Division requests $500,000. * The FY 2008 President's Budget uses the FY 2007 President's Budget language as a base so all language is presented as new. 9Appropriations Language DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FEES AND EXPENSES OF WITNESSES For fees and expenses of witnesses, for e xpenses of contracts for the procurement and supervision of expert witnesses, for priv ate counsel expenses, including advances, and for expenses of foreign counsel, [such sums as are necessary, ] $168,300,000, to remain available until expended [: Provided , That ], of which not to exceed $10,000,000 [may be made available ] is for construction of buildings for protected witness safesites [: Provided further , That ]; not to exceed $1,000,000 [may be made available ] is for the purchase and maintenance of armored vehicles for transportatio n of protected witnesses [: Provided further , That ]; and not to exceed $9,000,000 [may be made available ] is for the purchase, in stallation, maintena nce and upgrade of secure telecommunications equipm ent and a secure automated information network to store and retrieve the identities and locations of protected witnesses. (Department of Justice Appropriations Act, 2006.) Analysis of Appropriations Language If agreed to by Congress, this ch ange provides that foreign counsel fees be charged to the Fees and Expenses of Witne sses (FEW) appropriation. The Civil Division, under the directio n of the Assistant Attorney Ge neral, is the only litigating component of the Department of Ju stice authorized to ove rsee litigation in fo reign courts. Under 28 CFR \u00a7 0.46: \"The Assistant Attorney Genera l in charge of the Civil Division shall, in addition to litigation coming within the scope of Sec. 0.45, direct all other civil litigation including claims by or against the United States, its agencies or officers, in domestic or foreign courts, special proceedings, and similar civil matters not otherw ise assigned, and shall employ foreign counsel to represent before foreign cr iminal courts, commissions or administrative agencies officials of the Department of Justi ce and all other law enfo rcement officers of the United States who are charged with violations of foreign law as a result of acts which they performed in the course and scope of their Government service.\" This regulation expressly authorizes the employ of foreign counsel in certain criminal cases. Because the Division exercises so le responsibility over foreign lit igation, it must retain private foreign counsel in all cases in which the United Stat es is a party or has an interest. The necessity to employ foreign counsel derives from the fact that DOJ attorney s are not licensed to appear on behalf of the Government in foreign courts. This requirement is analogous to the requirement to retain private counsel for constitutional tort cases. Specifically, DOJ attorneys may not repr esent Government employees who are sued for actions taken while performing the duties require d by their jobs - when such representation would pose a conflict of interest between the defendants. In funding private counsel expenses out of the Fees and Expenses of Witnesses appropriation, Cong ress acknowledged that retention of private counsel for constitutional torts cases is mandatory and, accordingly, its funding source should be mandatory as well. Because the retent ion of private foreign counsel is mandatory, it follows that these expenses should also be funded out of the mandatory FEW appropriation. 10Decision Unit Justification Civil Division: Legal Representation Decision Unit Legal Representation - TOTAL Perm.

The Civil Division is acutely aware of the resource limitations facing the Government. However, the vigorous defense of cases that ar e of paramount importance to the Administration must proceed successfully. The United States should not suffer the detrimental impacts that could arise from (1) an inability to promote the strongest possible immigration enforcement efforts; or (2) a failure to defend legal challe nges filed by those deta ined at GTMO, many of whom are connected to al Qaeda. With respect to GTMO, this issue is so hotly-contested that additional appeals are extremely likely. If these cases cannot be resolved at the circuit court level, the Supreme Court may hear arguments. Depending on the outcome of these higher reviews, the resource requirements for FY 2008 will be adjusted. Program Description The Civil Division's mission to repr esent the United States' interests in the courts is vital, as the Government's activities affect nearly every el ement of society. Each year the Government undertakes millions of commercial transactions involving purchases, contracts, loans, grants, and the management of trust funds. Its policies a nd laws interplay with major counterterrorism activities, the environment, the labor force, national and local economies, industry, prevention of crime, and the resources avai lable to the General Fund. 11Appellate Staff Four Main Areas of Litigation DEFENSIVE MONETARY Contract and Employment Claims, Allegations of Negligence, Patent Infringement, Constitutional Torts Nearly $162.5 Billion at Issue in FY 2006 AFFIRMATIVE MONETARY Health Care Fraud, Procurement Fraud, Illegal Telemarketing Schemes, Loan Defaults, Bankruptcy, Nearly $24.5 Billion at Issue in FY 2006 DEFENSE OF PROGRAMS Challenges to Federal Laws, Provisions of Entitlement Programs, I mmigration Decisions, Counterterrorism Measures, and Implementation of the Military Commissions Act ENFORCING CIVIL STATUTES Prosecution of Consumer Protection Violations, Enforcement of Inspector General Subpoenas In total, 53,821 cases a nd matters were assigned to the Ci vil Division during FY 2006, and of this, the vast majority - 89 percent - were defensive. While plaintiffs in most defensive suits seek direct financial relief, some seek to fo rce programmatic changes that can have far-reaching effects on law enforcement practices, entitlem ent programs, and implementation of Federal statues. Civil's affirmative work is a relativel y small, but critical aspect of the Division's mission, securing billions of dollars owed to the Government each year. The Civil Division is composed of six litigati ng branches and the Office of Management Programs. The litigation handled by each Branch is described throughout the following pages. Appellate Staff attorneys represent the United States at the highest leve ls of judicial review. When trial losses involve policy-sensitive issues, the Division seeks appellate review. The docket includes challenges to th e No Child Left Behind Act and to the policies of the Medicare and Medi caid programs. The Staff also handles a host of counterterrorism cases involving terrorist surveilla nce programs, the freezing of terrorist assets, and the designation of foreign te rrorist organizations. These re sponsibilities have increased significantly with the en actment of the Military Commissi ons Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-366), which permits Guantanamo Bay detainees to challenge their status as enemy combatants. Several GTMO suits have already reached the appellat e courts and approximately 400 GTMO cases may be filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Di strict of Columbia Circuit. These suits will require extensive involvement of the Appellate Staff (see page 33). Other cases reaching the appellate level often ha ve tremendous financial stakes. For example, several other large cases have involved attempts to seize ove r $1 billion in Iraqi and Iranian 12Torts Branch Federal Programs Government assets held by the U.S. These suit s not only have high financial stakes, but their outcomes will establish important precedents with far-reaching effects on U.S. diplomatic relations and foreign policy. The Federal Programs Branch annually handles hundreds of defensive cases that are of unparalleled importance because of their far- reaching repercussions for Government programs and policies. For example, Federal Programs attorneys defend challenges to executive orders a nd Federal statutes, such as the Equal Pay Act and the Child Online Protection Act. In additi on, the Branch's docket also includes a growing number of challenges to antiterrorism laws and national security measures - most notably the habeas corpus actions filed on behalf of Guantanamo Bay detainees. While other Branches handle cases that directly involve the defens e of monetary claims and the recovery of monies owed to the Government , Federal Programs protects the public fisc by defending Government policies and programs invol ving the distribution of monetary resources and benefits. For instance, branch attorneys are defending multiple suits filed on behalf of minority farmers who allege discrimination in cr edit and benefit programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Plaintiffs in these cases seek more than $40 billion in damages. In FY 2006, the Torts Branch handled over 20,878 cases and administrative claims with almost $23 billon at issue. The caseload includes traditional tort suits, such as alleged malpractic e at Federal medical facilities and other personal injury suits filed under the Federal Tort Clai ms Act (FTCA). Among the many issues faced by the Federal Government is how to deal with environmental c ontamination caused by important national defense activities. Congress has pr ovided funds to clean up such contamination. However, tort suits are brought against the Unit ed States, seeking damages above and beyond the funds provided. The Civil Division works diligen tly to protect the public fisc when such lawsuits lack legal merit. In addition, the Tort s Branch is responsible for aviation and maritime accident litigation, both of which produce high-do llar cases and large ev identiary collections. Hurricane Katrina was the costliest and one of th e deadliest hurricanes in the history of the United States. As a result of the destruc tion caused by this disaster approximately 26,000 administrative claims have been filed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and more than 50 tort suits are pending in district courts . In total, the claimants seek $150 billion. Thousands more claims are expected to be filed against the Corps and numerous claims are also expected to be filed against the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Coast Guard. Given the huge financial stakes, the important legal precedents, and the extreme contentiousness surrounding the events that followed this disaster, claims will be appealed in Federal courts and thousands of cases may become the responsibility of the Civil Division's Tort Branch. Fundamental questions of liability may ultimately have to be resolved by the Supreme Court. 13Commercial Litigation Torts attorneys also handle Bivens cases, which involve Federa l employees who are personally sued for actions taken within the scope of their employment. For example, in Mayfield v. Gonzales , plaintiff filed charges agai nst the Attorney General challenging the Administration's actions in the investigation of the Madrid train bombings in 2004. Effective representation of such employees allows public servants to carry out their duties without fear of personal liability for their actions. The Civil Division's two compensation prog rams, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program and the Vaccine Injury Compensation Pr ogram, fall within the responsibility of the Torts Branch. More detail on thes e programs may be found on pages 15-18. In FY 2006, the Branch handled nearly 9,106 active cases with $159.8 billion at issue. 3 T h e most significant of these suits are claims filed in the Court of Federal Claims and the Court of Ap peals for the Federal Circuit, which are national courts located in Washington, D.C. These ca ses often involve protra cted proceedings, high monetary stakes, complex damage theori es, and huge evidentia ry collections. The Winstar cases made history in 1995 when some 400 financial institutions sought about $30 billion for alleged losses arising from banking re forms enacted in the 1980s. In another massive group of lawsuits, Yankee Atomic Electric and othe r commercial nuclear uti lities have filed 66 claims, known collectively as the Spent Nuclear Fuel litigation. Plaintiffs in these suits allege a multi-billion dollar breach of contract against the Department of Energy for its failure to accept and store spent nuclear fuel. One of the larg est defensive cases being handled by Commercial attorneys is Cobell v. Kempthorne , a multi-billion dollar claim file d against the Department of the Interior. Plaintiffs - 300,000 Native American s - seek a full accounting of their Individual Indian Trust accounts. Commercial attorneys are also responsible for re presenting the United States in litigation filed outside of Washington, D.C. For example, the Court of International Trade, a national court located in New York City, is the venue for the t housands of Harbor Maintenance Tax Cases. In addition, the Office of Foreign Litigation attorneys manage a nd retain foreign counsel to represent the U.S. in cases filed in foreign courts. Most of these cases are defensive and arise from a range of actions including military redeployments and commercial transactions. The Office's affirmative efforts are primarily aime d at fighting cross-border fraud that targets American citizens, such as telemarketing fraud. The Branch also handles a wide variety of litig ation involving patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other related matters. For example, when patent infringement claims threatened a cessation of BlackBerry service, Inte llectual Property attorneys worked to ensure that the Government would be exempt from an in junction against use of th e service. The most significant defensive suits are brought by major cor porations seeking substantial recoveries for the Government's use of patented inventions. Affirmative litigation enforces Government- owned patents, trademarks, copyrights, and patent indemnity agreements. 3 These amounts exclude $4.2 billion at issue in the 9,004 Harbor Maintenance Tax filed in the Court of International Trade. The cases were resolv ed in the Government's fa vor in December 2005. 14Consumer Litigation Through affirmative litigation, Commercial Litiga tion attorneys recover lo sses from those who perpetrate fraud against the Government and misu se taxpayers' monies. Working with the U.S. Attorneys' Offices, branch attorneys recover billi ons of dollars each year from individuals and companies who have defrauded the Government by violating the terms of Federal contracts, grants, loans, subsidies, Medicare, and ot her Federal health insurance programs. A significant portion of these cases are known collectively as the \"Pharma\" litigation, which concerns filings under the False Claims Act alle ging various types of fraud in the pricing and sale of pharmaceutical products paid by Federal h ealth care programs. These claims are highly complex both legally and factually, and ofte n involve allegations, named defendants, and witnesses from across multiple judicial districts. The Division's role is the key to ensuring that investigations and litigation ar e properly coordinated among Fede ral and state entities in all cases. To this end, the Commercial Frauds Staff is responsible for superv ising the investigative work of many Federal investigative organizati ons and working closely with other Federal Government attorneys, as well as State Attorney s General and law enforcement partners. Over the past seven years, about $5 billion has been recovered in Pharma matters, including $1.2 billion in 2006 alone. The Office of Consumer Litigation enforces Federal consumer protection laws. Most enforcement suits involve fraud perpetrated by manufacturers and distri butors of misbranded, adulterated, or defective consumer goods. For instance, a Denver grand jury charged Gary Lee Sutton with a 22-count i ndictment, alleging that Sutton purchased high-mileage vehicles at aucti on, rolled back the odometers to false, low mileages, fraudulently obtained false Colorado or Arizona titles, and then sold the used cars to * **37 Judicial Districts with Active Pharma Litigation * ** ** * **** ********** *** ******* * ** * 15Office of Immigration Litigation dealers in Colorado and elsewhere. Success in cases such as these safeguard consumers from dangerous or worthless products, and from unfair and deceptive trade practices. The Office defends challenges to consumer protect ion laws. Such suits include those filed by major drug manufacturers challenging the Food and Drug Administrati on's (FDA) approval of generic versions of some of the most widely-used, name-brand medications. For example, in Biovail Laboratories v. FDA , the plaintiff, a name brand ma nufacturer, claimed that the FDA's approval of a generic drug for the antidepressant, Wellbutrin, XL, violated their right to a thirty month stay of generic competition. The i ssue, decided on December 21, 2006, was whether Biovail's right to a thirty month stay covered this specific generic drug. The district court agreed with the FDA that it did not, and upheld the FDA's approval of the generic competition. Most of the Office's cases, however, are affirmativ e and are filed on behalf of the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the National Highway Traffic Sa fety Administration. The Offi ce handles civil penalty cases brought under consumer protection statutes, as well as cases con cerning fraudulent activities that exploit billions of dollars from unsuspecti ng consumers through unfair credit practices and deceptive advertisements and sales. A growing nu mber of lawsuits seek recoveries in connection with health care fraud. All t ogether, the Office's affirmative litigation generates hundreds of millions of dollars in recoveries for the United States. Established in 1983 to achieve central control over immigration litigation, OIL upholds the enforcement actions of the Departme nt of Homeland Securit y. With its unique expertise in immigration law, OIL provides th e Government with the best possible defense against challenges to removal orde rs filed in circuit courts by illegal aliens, many of whom are criminals. In addition to fulfilling a key role in addressing the public's widespread desire to gain control over the Nation's borders, the Office's docket often includes sensitive and difficult cases, some of which involve fundamental questions concerni ng the authority of the Executive, and the respective roles of Congress and the courts in immigration matters. OIL has developed substantial expertise relating to terrorism and a lien terrorists, and will continue to vigorously defend counterterrorism efforts. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enfor cement divisions estimate that more than 11 million illegal aliens reside in the United States . It is therefore not surprising that the 20,000 immigration cases filed in the Fe deral courts in FY 2006 more th an tripled the number of cases filed in FY 2001. OIL's share of Federal court lit igation is now so large that immigration cases comprise approximately one-third of the cases handled annually by the Department's Civil Division. Vigorous defense of these cases is critic al to national security and the safety of our communities. 16Compensation Programs Vaccine Injury Compensation Program When tort claims are brought under the FTCA, plaintiffs must establish Government liab ility and damages. Congress recognized that it is not always appropriate for all such tort clai ms to meet the requireme nts of the FTCA. For instance, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Progr am (VICP) was created in 1986 by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act to encourage ch ildhood vaccination by pr oviding a streamlined system for compensation in rare instances when an injury results. Unde r the VICP, individuals claiming injury from a covered vaccine file a petition for no-fault compensation with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC), rather than fi ling a lawsuit against the vaccine manufacturer or administrator in the civil tort system. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the named \"respondent\" in all case s and is the general administ rator of the Program. Civil Division attorneys in the Torts Branch represent HHS before the special masters in the Court of Federal Claims. To ensure that compensati on is awarded to those whom Congress intended, claims are closely examined for legal and medical sufficiency, with the r ecognition that eligible claimants should be compensated fairly and exped itiously. Special master s of the court conduct hearings as necessary to determ ine whether a petitioner is enti tled to compensation and, if so, how much. The Act created a Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund that is used for the payment of awards to individuals in jured by vaccines, in addition to clai mants' attorneys' fees. The Trust Fund is funded by an excise tax imposed on each dose of covered vaccine purchased. Funds are adequate for payment to eligible petitioners. Tr ust Fund monies also pay the administrative costs of HHS, the Civil Division's VICP staff, and the Office of Special Masters of the CFC. Specifically, the Civil Division receives its funding through a reimbursement from HHS. The current reimbursement authority is $6,333,000 (41 FTE). 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,000 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Est.2008 Est.Childhood Vaccine Act Cases Pending at the Beginning of the Fiscal Year 17 Over the past several years, the number of vacci ne claims filed with the Program has increased dramatically (see chart on prev ious page). Over 750 new cases were filed in FY 2005, and approximately 1,300 were filed in FY 2004, compared with just 213 filings in FY 2001. Driving the caseload growth are thousands of cases alle ging injuries caused by the vaccine preservative thimerosal. In total, more than $1.6 billion in compensa tion has been awarded to over 2,000 claimants who would have stood little chance of recovery in traditional tort litig ation. In addition, the Program has greatly reduced costly liti gation against drug manufacturer s and health care professionals who administer vaccines. Although an individua l who is dissatisfied with the Court's final judgment can reject it and file a lawsuit in state or Federal court, very few such lawsuits have been filed since the Program began. The supply of vaccines in the U.S. has been stabilized, and the development of new vaccine s has markedly increased. In FY 2005, OMB used their Prog ram Assessment Rating Tool to evaluate the Departments of Health and Human Services and Justice's respec tive roles in administering the Program. The Program received a rating of \"Adequate\" and is working to follow up on the various improvement actions recommended by OMB. For more information, see page 38. Radiation Exposure Comp ensation Act (RECA) In passing RECA in 1990, Congress offered an apology and monetary compensation to i ndividuals who suffered disease or death as a result of exposure to radiation released duri ng atmospheric nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s, and underground uranium mining operations from th e 1940s to the 1970s. This program was designed as an alternative to litigati on, in that the statutory criteria did not require claimants to establish causality. If claimants meet the criteria specified in the Act, compensation is awarded. RECA provides fixed payments in the following amounts: $50,000 for individuals who lived \"downwind\" of the Nevada Test S ite; $75,000 for individuals pr esent at test site locations; and $100,000 for uranium miners, mill workers, and ore transporters. Since the Program began receiving claims in 19 92, 25,696 claims have been filed and more than $1.1 billion has been awarded to 16,867 claimants (a s of January 3, 2007). The vast majority of claims are filed by people who live in the Four Corners region - Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. This area had the greatest concentration of uran ium ore, and both the mining and production industries were centered there. The \"downwind\" regions, counties in Nevada, Utah, and Arizona, account for thousands of claims in connection with the fallout from above-ground nuclear weapons testing. Since its inception, various gr oups have sought to pr essure Congress and the Executive Branch to expand or otherwise change the scope of the Program. In July 2000, RECA Amendments extended compensation to new categories of be neficiaries; added compensable diseases; expanded both the years and geographic areas c overed; and lowered the exposure level that miners must demonstrate to receive compensati on. These statutory changes caused an influx of new claim filings and a substa ntial increase in awards. 18A 2005 study published by the National Academy of Sciences recommended an overhaul of the Program that would base compensation on an exposure dose assessment for all victims regardless of geographic region. Such changes would require legislative amendments to the current statute. In this case, the claims ex amination process would dramatically expand and change. Bills were introduced in the previous Congress to include Idaho, Montana, and Guam as covered downwind areas. In FY 2006, the RECA Program was evaluated with OMB's Program Assessment Rating Tool. The Program received a rating of \"Adequate,\" and is working to implement the improvement actions recommended by OMB.

Quality assurance efforts include: regular interviews with attorneys to review data listings for eac h case; input screens programmed to preclude the entry of incorrect data; exception reports which list data that are questionable or inconsistent; attorney manager review of numerous monthly reports for data completeness and accuracy; and verification of representative data samples by an independent contractor. Despite these measures, so me data limitations do exist. Most significantly, incomplete data can cause the system to under-report case terminations and attorney time. Some pe rformance successes can be attributed to litig ation where the U.S. Attorneys' Offices w ere involved. Performance Indicators 2, 5, and 6: Favorable resolutions include only court judgments in favor of the Government; settlements are excluded. All Workload and Performance Indicators: All workload actuals and workload estimates exclude more than 9,000 Harbor Maintenance Tax Cases. These cases have been removed to avoid skewing the data. ISSUES AFFECTING FY 2006 Performance Performance Indicator 1: The number of cases terminated in FY 2006 was lower than estimated due to the unpredictable nature of litigation. For example, the timing of judgments and other court decisions are up to the judge's discretion. Excluded from the data in the above table were 9,004 Har bor Maintenance Tax cases, which were resolved due to a ruling in the lead case. Performance Indicator 7: Reported values are averages for three fis cal years. Thus, the FY 2006 target repres ents fiscal years 2004-2006. Approximatel y 90 percent of total dollars defeated and recovered is the result of the Division's defensive work. Thus, the an nual amount saved through litigatio n is driven largely by the amount sought in court by the Government's opponents - a metric that is extremely difficult to predict. The Division did not meet its FY 2006 target bec ause it is impossible to predict accurately the number and value of cases that will be resolved in a given year. In addition, recoveries in affirmative cases are dependent up on the defendant's ability to pay (i.e. bankruptcy cases). Performance Indicators 13, 14, and 17: Processing times for on-site participants have increased as a re sult of the extended periods of time requested by the claimants to elect whether to accept the RECA award or an aw ard pursuant to the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EE OICPA). According to the RECA statute, if on-site participant claimants accept an award under RECA, they will not be elig ible to receive any payment or medical benefi ts under EEOICPA, even though they may qualify. Therefore, these claimants are prov ided with sufficient time in which to make this election. Also affecting the FY 2006 result s was a reduced staffing level for most of the year. The Program lost five employees due to norm al attrition and absent adequate staff, cl aim processing times increased, the backlo g of pending claims grew, and fewer claims were adjudicated within 12 months than anticipated. By the end of FY 2006, the Program had hired six additional staff to assist in claims adjudication. Claim processing time is improving and the Program hopes to meet its targets in FY 2007 and FY 2008. ISSUES AFFECTING SELECTION OF FY 2007 AND FY 2008 ESTIMATES Workload Indicators 1, 2, and 3: The workload is measured by tracking the sum of cases pending at the beginning of the year and new cases that the Division rece ives. Hundreds of thousands of potential Hurricane Katrina-related suits have been excluded from the workload indicators because they are an outlier that skews trend lines. Because 90 percent of the Division's caseload is defensive, the size of th e workload is externally driven . Between FY 2006 and FY 2008 , the workload is expected to increase by 21 percent. This increase is prim arily the result of pending immigration and vacci ne cases, as well as additional Guantanamo Bay detainee-related cases, all of which are defensive and are beyond the Division's control. Performance Indicator 1: The number of terminations is a performa nce measure that is directly linked to reso urces: increased fund ing provides the staf f needed to resolve more cases, and at a faster rate. In FY 2008 , there will be an estimated 3,038 additional terminations as the result of the request ed OIL program increase. Performance Indicators 2 and 3: Vaccine Injury Compensation Program cas es are excluded from these measures. Performance Indicators 2 and 7-17: In line with the PMA initiative to integrate budget and performance fully, the Civil Division has developed several new outcome -oriented performance measures. 22 _____________________ * The number of terminations has been updated to reflect the removal of the 9,004 Harbor Maintenance Tax cases from the workl oad statistics.PERFORMANCE MEASURE TABLE Decision Unit: Department of Justice - Civil Division - Legal Representation FY 2000 FY 2001 FY 2002 FY 2005 FY 2006 FY 2007 FY 2008 Performance Report and Performance Plan Targets Actual Actual Actual Actual Actual Actual Final Target Actual Target Target Output 1.

Percentage of claims paid within six weeks of Program receipt of acceptance claims appeals adjudicated within 90 days of filing Strategies Performance Plan and Report for Outcomes The data presented in the Performance and Re sources Table demonstrate the Civil Division's consistent success in meeting performance target s in support of the Department's Strategic Objective 2.5 to \"enforce Federal statutes, uphold th e rule of law, and vi gorously represent the interests of the United States in all matters for which the Depa rtment has jurisdiction.\" The following cases summaries are high lights of how Civil has worked to protect the public fisc, defend U.S. policies, and enforce civil statutes in FY 2006. Between FY 2002 and FY 2006, more than $71 billion was saved as a result of the Civil Division's successful defense against unmeritorious claims. In FY 2006 alone, the Division defeated over $11 billion in exaggerated claims. Significant victories include the following: Winstar Of the 93 cases fully resolved to date, 73 resulted in zero damages paid to the plaintiff. For example, an appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment rejecting damages ex ceeding $420 million in Granite Management Corp. v. United States . Granite Management had sued the United States al leging breach of contract and related claims. Property Damage A large housing developer accused th e Government of negligently closing Hamilton Air Force Base and a llowing landfill waste to damage property purchased after the base closure. A district cour t dismissed the $100 million claim. Over the last five ye ars, the Division has also made significant affirmative recoveries totaling nearly $12 billion. Most were the result of procurement and health care fraud matters. The following cases are particularly noteworthy: Health Care Fraud In June 2006, two health care cor porations settled allegations of health care fraud by agreeing to pay the United States in excess of $1.18 billion. As incentive not to deny treatment to the sickest patients, the Medicare program allows for FY 2006Defensive Cases Closed ($ in 2006Affirm a tive Ca se s Close d ($ in Billions) Dollars Sought Dollars Re cove r e d 25reimbursements to hospitals for unusually costly patient care. Tenet Healthcare Corporation, the nation's second largest hospital chain, wa s accused of fraudulently inflating costs of patient care to receive excessive outlier payments. Tenet agreed to pay $919 million. In the midst of similar allegations, Saint Barnabas Co rporation, New Jersey's largest health care system, agreed to a $265 million settlement. Procurement Fraud Boeing Company agreed to pay th e United States a record $615 million to resolve allegations of Government procur ement fraud. Boeing was accused of obtaining competitors' documents and inappropriately utilizing them to procure contracts from the Air Force and NASA. Of the tota l settlement, $565 million was nego tiated by the Civil Division. Tobacco In August 2006, the Division won a seven-year-old lawsuit against nine tobacco companies when a Federal judge found them guilty of civil fraud and racketeering for de ceiving the public about the risks of smoking in order to maintain profits. The decision provides for injunctive relief, including disallowing future acts of fraud and ordering the companies to advertise \"corrective statements\" regarding the true health risks of nicotine and smoking. Furthermore, the judge barred these companies from using misleading terms such as \"mild,\" \"light,\" and \"ultralight\" in brand names. Many of the non-monetary suits handled by the Ci vil Division are extremely contentious, often dealing with hotly-debated points of law and controversial Government policies and actions ranging from counterterrorism to pharmaceutical sa fety. Because such cases are high-profile and have far-reaching policy repercus sions, Civil's success in them is imperative. The Civil Division's track record in enforc ing civil statutes through affirmative programmatic litigation is no less impressive. The following cases are re presentative of those handled by Division attorneys on a daily basis. Designation of Foreign Terrorists and Their Supporters The U.S. has designated over 400 individuals, companies, and organizations as su pporters of terrorists, terrorist groups and/or their support networks. As a result of these designations, the U.S. and its international partners have frozen more than $145 million in assets that could have been funneled to terrorist activities. In Kahane Chai v. Department of State , the D.C. Circuit upheld the redesignation of Kahane Chai/Kach by the Secretary of State as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under the Antiterrorism Act of 1996. The court rejected th e petitioners' claim that the Secretary had insufficient record evidence to justify redesigna tion and it denied the petitioners' contention that due process rights had been violated. This group had previously been banned by the \"It is about an industr y, and in particular these Defendants, that survives, and profits, from selling a highly addictive product which causes diseases that lead to a staggering number of deaths per year, an immeasurable amount of human suffering and economic loss, and a profound burden on our national health care system. Defendants have known many of these facts for at least 50 years or more. Despite that knowledge, they have consistently, repeatedly, and with enormous skill and sophistication, denied these facts to the public, to the Govern ment, and to the public health community.\" -Judge Kessler, August 17, 2006 26Israeli Government because of its threats to Israeli and Arab l eaders, and its glorification of an Israeli individual who had mu rdered Arab civilians. Communications Decency Act In Nitke v. Gonzales , the Supreme Court summarily affirmed a decision by a three-judge dist rict court and rejected a Firs t Amendment challenge to the Communications Decency Act's prohibition on the knowing transmission of obscenity or child pornography via the Internet. The plaint iff, an art photographer who specializes in sexually explicit material, challenged the Ac t on the grounds that the statute relies on community standards to determ ine obscenity. She also argue d that the restriction on \"obscene\" communication was unconstitutionally vague. The Government successfully argued that the challenge was largely foreclos ed by Supreme Court precedent and that the \"vagueness\" challenge was insubstantial. Generic Drugs In Apotex Inc. v. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , the court upheld the FDA's patent-based approach to generic drug applications made prior to the Medicare Modernization Act. FDA awards a 180-day ex clusivity period for each innovator company's patent that is challenged. Generic drug maker Apotex sought immediate approval to market a generic version of Prilosec - a drug for wh ich FDA found another company was eligible for 180-day exclusivity. Apotex argued that FDA cannot award more than one period of exclusivity for each drug product, but the court agreed with FDA. Apotex's approach had support from a previous distri ct court decision and could ha ve forced FDA to change positions in numerous drug approvals. Pharmaceutical Safety The Division successfully shut down an illegal Internet pharmacy operation that smuggled millions of dollars in counterfeit pharmaceuticals into the country and illegally sold them to consumers online. Customers could or der prescription drugs without having a prior prescription. The webs ite falsely represented that a doctor would review the questionnaire and issue a lawful pres cription before the drugs were shipped to the customers. The pharmacy operator was sentence d to serve a prison term of 51 months and forfeit substantial cash proceeds for his role in operating one of the largest Internet pharmacy schemes ever prosecuted. Defense of the National Motto I n Newdow v. Congress of the United States of America , plaintiff sought to have the national motto, \"I n God We Trust,\" declared unconstitutional for violating the First Amendment. Plaintiff sought various forms of relief, including an injunction barring the Federal Government from printing coins and currency inscribed with the motto. In June 2006, the district court dismissed the case, citing precedent which establishes the national motto as constitutional, while also finding that the Legislative Branch defendants were immune from plaintiff's claims. Toy Safety In July 2006, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the 21-month prison sentence for Matthew Lotze, who was convicted of fraud and false statement charges for reselling hazardous toys that he had been hire d to destroy. Chevron Texaco Corporation had recalled the approximately 600,00 0 toy cars after the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission determined that they were banned hazardous substances because they contained small parts that could break off and pose a choking hazard to children under age three. 27Strategies to Accomplish Outcomes The Civil Division has achieved extraordinary su ccess despite resource lim itations. This is due in large part to numerous innovative strategies employed by the Division: Retain cases that require coordination at the se at of Government or subject matter expertise possessed by the Civil Division, as well as ca ses assigned to nationa l and foreign courts. Improve information dissemination between the Civil Division and the U.S. Attorneys to promote and maintain uniform litigation positions. Recruit and retain a high-caliber legal staff w ith expertise that will best promote successful litigation. Structure support sta ff to take full advantage of new technologies that promote efficiency and productivity. Maximize resources by improving cash manage ment and utilizing authority to obtain reimbursements. Develop new alternative funding sources. Invest in new technologies and litigation su pport services such as ALS to maximize productivity, meet court mandates, and pr evail on behalf of the Government. 28Program Increase Item Name: Immigration Litigation Budget Decision Unit: Legal Representation Strategic Goal & Objective: Goal 2; Objective 2.5 Organizational Program: Office of Immigration Litigation Component Ranking of Item: 1 of 2 Program Increase: Positions 163 Atty 124 FTE 82 Dollars $14,124,000 Description of Item Millions of illegal aliens are living in the United States - a situation that is problematic to the Administration, Congress, and the American public . The Civil Division's Office of Immigration Litigation (OIL) serves a vital role in the enfo rcement of immigration law by defending petitions filed in circuit courts that seek to overturn removal decisions issued by the Department of Homeland Security and DOJ's Executive Office for Immigration Review. Despite the volume of cases challenging orders of remova l, a substantial portion of OIL's litigation resources are also expended in defending class actions and other dist rict court challenges to various aspects of immigration policy and enforcement, including cas es involving counterter rorism and national security. Any attempt to secure the borders must include adequate resources for OIL. For FY 2008, the Civil Division request s 163 positions ( 124 attorneys), 82 FTE, and $14,124,000 to uphold the laws governing immigration policy and enforcement. Background OIL defends the nation's immigration laws at the highest level of j udicial review. U.S. immigration enforcement functions begin with the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Both CBP and ICE enforce the United States' immigration laws by, among other things, initiating legal proceedi ngs to remove illegal aliens. In response, many aliens challenge ICE's actions by seeking asylum or other relief from removal from DOJ's Executive Office for Immigration Review's Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). If the BIA rules in favor of ICE, the alien can challenge the BI A's decision by filing a petition fo r review in Federal court. Source: LatinAmericanStudies.org 29 OIL's caseload is directly tied to DHS's immigra tion enforcement efforts and to the immigration adjudication rates of the BIA in the Department 's Executive Office for Immigration Review. Thus, as DHS continues to increase its immigra tion enforcement efforts and the BIA continues to adjudicate large numbers of removal cases each year, OIL's caseload continues to grow. The vast majority of OIL's cases ar e review petitions ch allenging removal decisions issued by the BIA. In FY 2002 and FY 2003, thousands of revi ew petitions flooded the Federal courts of appeal as the BIA aggressively reduced a substa ntial backlog of cases. As seen in the graph below, between FY 2002 and FY 2006, OIL experi enced a sharp rise in the number of new petitions filed. Although the BIA backlog has b een cleared, heightened enforcement activity by the DHS has caused review petitions to continue to inundate OIL's dock et. This growth in caseload is also fuelled by a sharp rise in the percentage of remova l decisions that aliens appeal to the Federal circuit courts. OIL Unable to Keep Pace with Influx of Review 2008 Est. Review Petitions Filed Total Caseload (Sum of New and Pending Cases) The adverse effects of OIL's caseload increa sing faster than its resources are being felt throughout the entire system of immigration enforcement. Fede ral judges have issued harsh criticisms about the inun dation of circuit court filings. The Department as a whole has also been burdened by the thousands of immigration briefs th at must be \"outsourced\" to attorneys in other DOJ components or reassigned to U.S. Attorneys' Offices in order to keep up with the influx of review petitions. Most importantl y, there may be severe national security consequences if OIL is unable to meet its responsibility to enforce the removal of illegal aliens. 30Justification OIL will require a FY 2008 program increase of 163 positions (124 attorneys), 82 FTE, and $14,124,000. The purpose of this increase is to address the untenable burden placed on OIL attorneys as the caseload continues to rise. This sharp rise in caseload has dramatically incr eased the number of cases that must be assigned to each OIL attorney - from a reasonable leve l of approximately 72 case s in FY 2002 to a peak of 158 in FY 2005. Despite the funding in crease approved by Congr ess in FY 2006, the resulting drop in the per-attorney caseload was al most imperceptible. Over the next two years, over 20,000 new petitions for review are expected to be filed. In order to provide the most effective and vigor ous defense of immigration cases that meets both the standards of the Department and the expecta tions of the courts, the Civil Division seeks to reduce the number of cases per attorney to 82 in FY 2008, and eliminate the outsourcing of cases to other components and U.S. Attorneys' Offi ces. Ending outsourcing and reducing each OIL attorney's caseload will restor e OIL's ability to adequately prepare for each case, ensuring immigration enforcement efforts are fully pr otected from unmerito rious challenges. Cases Per Attorney FY 2002 72 FY 2003 110 FY 2004 137 FY 2005 158 FY 2006 143 FY 2007 Est.* 117 FY 2008 Est. ( +124 Attorneys) 82 * Includes additional attorneys hired with funds from the FY 2006 Supplemental Appropriation. Congress made it clear that improving immigrati on enforcement is a priority by passing the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act fo r Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery in June 2006, which a ppropriated $9,000,000 for OIL through September 30, 2007. In September 2006, Congress passed the FY 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Act, which provided an unprecedented level of fundi ng for DHS's Secure Border Initiative. The new funding will allow DHS to add 1,500 border pa trol agents and 6,700 detention beds, which is certain to translate into more cases for OIL. 4 If this request is not approved, the attorneys and support staff hired under the OIL supplemental will be released when the funding expires in less than one year. OIL will be unable to keep pace with increased enforcement efforts of DHS and other Government entities, thereby weakening the entire immigration enforcement system and necessitating additional resources in FY 2008. 4 \"President Signs FY 2007 Homeland Security Appr opriations.\" DHS Press Release. October 4, 2006. http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/rel eases/pr_1159998463126.shtm 31 Impact on Performance The impact of increased caseload on performance has been threefold: 1) Inadequate staffing has had a negative impac t on OIL's performance in court. OIL enforces and defends the Nation's immigrati on laws and policies at the highest levels of judicial review, directly supportin g the Nation's desire to vigorous ly represent the United States in all matters for which the Department has jurisdiction. Inadequate staffing has a negative effect on the quality of advocacy, and some judge s have complained that the high quality of Government representation has declined as th e flood of immigration cases has increased. Moreover, judges have also voiced the opinion that the Government should use greater discretion in deciding which cases to defend in court, sugges ting that adverse decisions could be avoided if the Government were to \"screen\" cases more carefully. Both criticisms are directly related to inadequate staffing. Inadequate staffing will inevitably cause ove rburdened attorneys to lose cases in appellate courts that should have been won and may lead to the Government's inability to provide a necessary response in all cases . 2) Outsourcing has undercut the productivity of the Department and its litigating divisions. Outsourcing has forced DOJ co mponents to draw resources aw ay from their primary law enforcement missions. To provide some relief to OIL attorneys, thousands of immigration briefs have been \"outsourced\" to attorn eys in other DOJ components and reassigned to U.S. Attorneys' Offices nationwide. Outsourcing entails the a ssignment of briefs to numerous Department components that are, by and large, unschooled in immigration law. OIL retains overall responsibility for each case regard less of whether the brief has b een reassigned to one of the other litigating divisions - ofte n including the responsibility to represent the Government should the case proceed to oral argument. Distributing cases in this manner is inefficient because it often takes attorneys in other components disproportionately more time to brief and argue cases than it takes OIL attorneys, who are more experienced and knowledgeable in this complex area of law. Moreover, because of the highly specializ ed nature of immigration law, the practice may prove to be significantly less effective in de fending challenges to removal decisions than a centralized approach. Approval of this request will improve productivity and effectiveness both in OIL and numerous other DOJ litigating components. 3) Inadequate Resources for OIL adversely affects national security. Immigration enforcement has risen to the forefront of U.S. law enforcement concerns. It is essential for the protection of the borders and the security of the nation. Without adequate resources, OIL will be unable to fulfill its role in the larger system of immigration enforcement and border protection - top priorities of the De partment, the Administra tion, and the American public. Approval of this request will (1) ensure OIL's ability to provide the best defense of immigration cases in court; (2) eliminate th e need to outsource immigration briefs th roughout the Department; and (3) ensure that the United States benefits from a unified Federal immigration enforcement strategy. 32Funding - Office of I mmigration Litigation Base Funding FY 2006 Enacted FY 2007 Estimate FY 2008 President's 241 269 $44,121 315 239 323 $56,796 Personnel Increase Cost Summary Type of Position Modular Cost per Position Number of Positions Requested FY 2008 Request ($000) Attorney $98,493 124 $12,213 Paralegal $52,267 8 417 Clerical $48,245 31 1,494 Total Personnel 163 14,124 Non-Personnel Increase Cost Summary Non-Personnel Item Unit Cost Personnel ($000) Non-Personnel ($000) $56,796 Increases 163 124 82 14,124 363 405 68,310 2,610 70,920 33Program Increase Item Name: Guantanamo Bay Detainee Litigation Budget Decision Unit: Legal Representation Strategic Goal & Objective: Goal 1 and Goal 2; Objective 2.5 Organizational Program: Appellate Staff & Federal Programs Branch Component Ranking of Item: 2 of 2 Program Increase: Positions 29 Atty 23 FTE 15 Dollars $3,263,000 Description of Item Protecting the American people from the threat of terrorism is one of the greatest challenges facing the Government today. Since September 11th, the Government has implemented numerous counterterrorism strategi es that have disrupted terrori st attacks. Many of these policies, however, have drawn legal challenges in court, with cases often rising to the highest levels of judicial review. To ensure that such challenges do not strip the United States of critical counterterrorism tools and hinder co unterterrorism efforts, a strong le gal defense is essential. Among the most complex and contentious counterter rorism suits currently before the courts are the Guantanamo Bay Detainee (GTMO) cases handl ed by the Civil Division. These suits have been filed on behalf of hundreds of alien enemy combatants held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. Most of these cases were placed on hold pending a decision in the leading case of Al Odah v. United States that will interpret the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA) and the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA). Under the MCA, the Division expects to defend approximately 400 GTMO cases in FY 2008 and beyond. In order to handle these cases, the Civil Division seeks Congressional approval of 29 positions (23 attorneys), 15 FTE, and $3,263,000 for FY 2008. Justification The United States is currently detaining appr oximately 400 alien enemy combatants at its Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. The majority of these individuals we re apprehended by the United States and its allies during military actions in Afghanistan. Since arriving at Guantanamo, nearly all of the detainees have b een determined to be enemy combatants through multiple levels of military review, including a formal hearing before a military Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT). The detainees were determined by the CSRTs to be members or associates of al Qaeda or the Taliban. Also, 14 high-level terrorist lead ers or operatives were recently transferred to Guantanamo and are aw aiting CSRTs. Each year, the U.S. conducts further reviews to assess the current threat posed by each detainee and to determine whether each should remain in custody, be transferre d to another country, or be released. 5 5 This annual review does not apply to enemy comb atants designated for trial by military commission. 34 The Government has argued that because they are aliens located outside the U.S., the detainees are not entitled to the protections of the U.S. Constitution. The President has directed that all detainees be treated hum anely, and, under the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , detainees are protected under Comm on Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Also, the detainees are afforded significant procedural protections w ith respect to the determination of their enemy combatant status through the CSRTs. Despite th ese procedural protections , over the last several years more than 200 habeas actions have been f iled in the District Cour t for the District of Columbia. Some of these actions concern two or more detainees. In December 2005, Congress enacted the Detainee Treat ment Act, which grants the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeal s (D.C. Circuit) exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to the validity of any CSRT final determination. The Court may review whether the CSRT determination was consistent with the standards and procedures specified for CSRT proceedings, and whether such standards and procedures are cons istent with the laws of the United States and the Constitution. To date, nine detainees have f iled challenges to their detention in the D.C. Circuit under the DTA. Congress enacted the Mili tary Commissions Act of 2006 in Oc tober 2006. The Act states that, with the exception of D.C. Circuit review provi ded under the DTA, \"no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider\" any habeas claim or claim relating to any aspect of the detention, transfer, trial, or conditions of confinement filed by an alien detainee determined to have been properly detained as an enemy comb atant or who is awaiting such a determination. The Act applies \"to all cases, without exception, pending on or after the date of enactment.\" 6 Based on this Act, the Government has asked th at all habeas actions currently pending in the District Court for the Distri ct of Columbia be dismissed. Detainees claim that the MCA effects an unc onstitutional suspension of habeas corpus. One district court judge dismissed a detain ee's habeas petition ci ting the MCA's removal of Federal court jurisdic tion over such matters ( Hamdan v. Rumsfeld ). Most likely, this decision will be appealed. Despite the new law, counsel for de tainees continue to file habeas cases in district court. A decision is currently pendi ng in the D.C. Circuit in Al Odah v. United States . This matter concerns conflicting Federal district court deci sions about whether or not the detainees have constitutional rights and whether the CSRTs provid e them with any required due process. This decision is expected to determine the scope of both the Detainee Treatment Act and the Military Commissions Act. The non-prevailing party will likely seek Supreme Court review. If this litigation is found in the Government's favor, the approximately 400 detainees may file challenges to the CSRTs in the D.C. Circuit. If the litigation is found against the Government, detainees may be able to maintain cases both in th e D.C. Circuit and in the district court. In either case, the Government will be faced w ith defending at least 400 cases in FY 2008 and 6 Military Commissions Act of 2006, Pub. L. no. 109-366, 120 Stat. 2600, Sec. 7 (2006). 35beyond, perhaps in multiple courts. GTMO suits ar e extremely high-profile and have attracted attorneys and legal scholars from around the nati on to represent the detainees, ensuring that Civil Division attorneys will face a constant ba rrage of innovative legal arguments. In addition, four other cases have been filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of more than 30 detainees allegedly held by the United States at the U.S. military base in Bagram, Afghanistan. While these cases will be impacted by the outcome of Al Odah v. United States , the Government will nonethele ss have to litigate the cases, and potentially other similar cases filed on behalf of Bagram detainees. Approval of the Division's re quest of 29 positions (23 atto rneys), 15 FTE, and $3,263,000, will ensure that the Division is prepar ed to handle the onslaught of cases that represent a vital tool in rooting out and deterr ing terrorist acts. It will enable th e Division to assemble a team of 23 attorneys headed by seven on-board, seasoned Civil Division attorneys who, by FY 2008, will have had substantial experience with the GTMO litigation. The size of this team is consistent with the size of the litigation teams established in the past to handle th e Division's most massive litigation. Included in this request is $700,000 for Automate d Litigation Support (A LS). Contractor- provided ALS services have proved to be indi spensable when the Division's limited staff of attorneys has been confronted with massive discovery and tria l support requirements. This program has a proven track record - over 20 years - for effectively supporting discovery, trials, appeals, and management of highly complex and expansive litigation. Without it, the Government's defense would be impaired significantly. Impact on Performance At the heart of the Guantanamo Bay detainee litig ation are some of the most critical policy, security, and constitutional issues debated today. The Civil Division is responsible for defending current statues in these highly contentious case s before the Federal courts. Accordingly, providing for a successful defense in the GTMO lit igation directly addresses some of society's most prevalent concerns about protecting homes, families, communities, and the United States by preventing future acts of terrorism. 7 The detainees held at Guantanamo Bay were ac tive members or supporter s of al Qaeda or the Taliban at the time of their capture, and several we re highly placed deputies and associates of top al Qaeda leadership. For instance, Khalid Shaykh Muhammad was the mastermind behind the September 11, 2001 attacks, while anot her detainee was the intended \"20 th hijacker\" on that day. Salim Ahmed Hamdan was Osama bin Laden's pe rsonal bodyguard and driver. Other notables include explosives experts who designed cell phone detonators and prototype shoe bombs to destroy airplanes and magnetic mines to sink ships. Other detainees were involved in political assassinations, attacks on journalists and aid workers, and terr orist financing operations. It is essential that the Government put forth the most vigorous defense possible to ensure that these individuals are not free to conti nue to support terrorist networks. 7 With respect to the Department's Strategic Plan, funding of this litigation supports the Department's Strategic Goal 2, Objective 2.5, to \"vigorously represent the United States in all matters for which the Department has jurisdiction\" as well as Goal 1, to \"prevent terrorism and promote the nation's security.\" 36 By enacting the MCA, Congress provided detainees with a venue for legal review of the CSRT determinations. In upholding the pr ovisions of the MCA, the Divi sion expects to face a massive influx of Guantanamo litigation in the coming year s. In FY 2008, the Division estimates that it may handle approximately 400 GTMO cases in the D.C. Circuit. Because of the resource- intensive nature of these cases, such a dramatic rise in workload cannot be handled within the Division's base resources. To ensu re that the U.S. has the means to prevail in these top-priority cases and concurrently combat terrorist threats, ad equate resources must be made available to the Civil Division.

At the end of the assessment, the GLA program received a rating of \"Effective.\"8 Other findings showed that: The Program effectively achieves its goal of re solving cases in favor of the Government. Favorable resolutions, in turn, puni sh and deter violations of the law; ensure the integrity of Federal laws and programs; and prevent the Government from losing money through unfavorable settlements or judgments. The Program collaborates effectively with its pa rtners, notably the U.S. Attorneys' Offices. The two programs work closely to share exper tise, make referrals, and designate cases for prosecution, while minimizing any overlap of responsibilities. The Program exhibits good management pract ices. This includes strong financial management, collecting and using performance information to make decisions, and holding managers accountable for program performance. Additionally, to exhibit continua l improvement of its practices, the GLA components have taken steps toward completing the follow- up actions recommended by OMB: Implementing a plan to conduct an independent evaluation. In FY 2006, the Department's Justice Manageme nt Division (JMD) offered a proposal to the Management and Planning Staff (MPS) and the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to perform an independent ev aluation of the GLA componen ts (GLAs). The proposal recommended that MPS perform initial back ground interviews in a manner consistent with OIG yellow book regulations. MPS would later hand off their preliminary research to OIG to review and offer their findings and recommendations. However, OIG was unable to include the GLA evaluation in thei r FY 2007 docket, and as a result, JMD and the GLAs are currently exploring other opti ons to meet the PART follow-up action of \"Performing an independent evaluation of the GLAs.\" Establishing leadership traini ng and mentoring program to con tinue improving the quality of program management. Civil's Attorney Training Committee complete d three attorney trainings for new Honors Program and lateral attorney hires in Janua ry, February, and Marc h. The trainings focused on electronic discovery and filing, alternative dis pute resolution, and expert witnesses. All of the new Honors Program attorneys have completed the Civil advocacy course at the National Advocacy Center in South Carolina. 8 Programs undergoing the PART recei ve one of five ratings: Effective, Moderately Effective, Adequate, Ineffective, or Results Not Demonstrated. 38 Working with the Department's Chief Informati on Officer to evaluate and purchase litigation software that will improve pr oductivity and efficiency. The Civil Division serves as the chief GLA representative on three major CIO Department-wide initiatives: the conso lidated case management system, the debt collection system, and the unified financ ial management system. Civil Division representatives are active participants in thes e time-intensive project s to develop efficient management tools. Significant progress cont inues to be made on the consolidated case management system (LCMS) and the debt collection system (CDCS). Vaccine Injury Compensation Program During FY 2005, the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services were evaluated th rough OMB's PART on thei r respective roles in administering the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The Program received a rating of \"Adequate.\" This rating describe s a program that needs to set more ambitious goals, achieve better results, improve accountability or strengthen its management practices. OMB's findings include the following: The Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services effectively collaborate to administer the program join tly. The two agencies have a good working relationship and coordinate well with one another and with the judges who adjudicate the claims. The Program has made progress in achievi ng its annual performance goals, but its performance on long-term goals has been inc onsistent. In particular, the Program has experienced mixed results in ensuring that all eligible claimants are compensated and reducing the amount of time needed to process a claim. The Program's design contains fl aws that hinder its ability to satisfy both claimants and vaccine manufacturers. Some of the design -related problems include loopholes allowing circumvention of the Program, extensive delays in the processing of claims, and a large balance in the Program's Trust Fund that remains unspent. DOJ and HHS will take the following actions to improve the performance of the Program: Seek an independent evaluation to assess the Program's effectiveness, impact, and design. On September 30, 2005, a contract was awarded to assess the feasibility and parameters of such an evaluation. The feasibility study is ongoing. Improve the way the Program projects its fi nancial liabilities in future years. In January 2006, HHS conducted an analysis of various op tions for this methodology and decided that the current methodology of esti mating awards by increasing them by three percent over the previous year is the most appropriate methodology to use considering the multitude of unknown variables. 39 Reduce claims processing time by increasing th e use of electronic f ile sharing between agencies, expert witnesses, and other parties. Efforts to convert paper to electronic files are on going. Certain interagency communications previously transmitted via paper hard copy are now electronic. For example, as of March 2006, medical records have been shared with HHS as electronic files on a weekly basis. Using electronic im ages has standardized our distribution of supplemental records, resulting in great er efficiency of case processing. Radiation Exposure Compensation Program During FY 2006, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program was evaluated with OMB' s PART assessment. The Program received a rating of \"Adequate.\" This rating describes a pr ogram that needs to set more ambitious goals, achieve better results, improve accountability or strengthen its management practices. OMB's findings include the following: The Program has developed ambitious annual a nd long-term goals focusing on outcomes that meaningfully reflect the purpose of the Program . However, the program must ensure that partners are committed to achieving annual and long term goals. The Program's statutory scheme contains flaws with respect to some of its claimant categories. Although the statute is founded on th e scientifically-based association between exposure and illness for occupationally exposed uranium workers, the same is not true for the other claimant categories. DOJ is taking the following actions to improve the performance of the Program: Ensure Program partners are expressly committed to achieving the stated annual and long- term performance goals of the Program. Develop a plan to tie resources to specific performance measures. Monitor the activities of the National Academy of Sciences and like organizations that are studying the Act's elig ibility cr iteria.

This request provides for a proposed 3.0 percent pay raise to be effective in January of 2008. (This percentage is likely t o change as the budget formulation process progresses.) This increase includes locality pay adjustments as well as the general pay raise. The amount requested, $2,888,0 00, represents the pay amounts for 3/4 of the fiscal year plus appropriate benefits ($2,473,000 for pay and $415,000 for benefits). Annualization Required for 2008 ($000)Annualization of 2007 pay raise . This pay annualization represents first quarter amounts (October through December) of the 2007 pay increase of 2.2 percent. The amount requested, $1,058,000, represents the pay amounts for 1/4 of the fiscal year plus appropriate benefits ($793,000 for pay and $2 65,000 for benefits). 2007 Increases ($000) Changes in Compensable Days . The increased costs of two more compensable days in FY 2008 compared to FY 2007 is calculated by dividing the FY 2007 estima ted personnel compensation $105,905,000 and applicable benefits $21,876,000 by 260 compensable days. The cost increase of two compensable da ys is $983,000.Annualization Required for 2008 ($000)Annualization of additional positions approved in 2006 and 2007 . This provides for the annualization of 58 additional positions appropriated in 2006 and 114 additional positions requested in the 2007 President's budget. Annualization of new positions extends to 3 years to provide for entry level funding in the first year with a 2-year progression to the journeyman level. For 2006 increases, this request includes an increase of $272,000 for full-year payroll costs associated wi th these additional positions. For 2007, this request includes a decrease of $1,804,000 for one-time items associated with the increased positions, and an increase of $9,906,000 for full-year costs associated with these additional positions, for a net increase of $8,102,000. Exhibit E - Justification for Base AdjustmentsOverseas Capital Security Cost Sharin g. The Department of State (DOS) has embarked on a 14-year, $17.5 billion embassy construction program financed through a Capit al Security Cost Sharing (CSCS) Program in which each agency contributes funding based on the number of positions that are authori zed for overseas personnel. DOS and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established per capita charges, by position type (CAA, non-CAA, etc.), which reflect the costs o f construction of the various types of space. T h per capita charge is fixed and is being phased in over a five-year period, from FY 2005 (20%) to FY 2009 (100%). Funding of $7 1,000 is required for FY 2008.Health Insurance . Effective January 2006, this component's contribution to Federal employees' health insurance premiums increased by 4.6 perce nt. Applied against the 2007 estimate of $5,295,000, the additional amount required is $244,000. Employees Compensation Fund . The $3,000 increases reflects payments to the Department of Labor for injury benefits paid on our behalf in the past year un der the Federal Employee Compensation Act. This estimate is based on the first quarter of prior year billing and current year estimates. Moves (Lease Expirations) . GSA requires all agencies to pay relocation costs associated with lease expirations. This request provides for the costs as sociated with new office relocations caused by the expiration of leases in FY 2008. Funding of $2,644,000 is required for this account. Security Investigations . The $62,000 increase reflects payments to the Office of Personnel Management for security reinvestigations of employees requ iring security clearances.General Services Administration (GSA) Rent . GSA will continue to charge rental rates that approximate those charged to commercial tenants for equivalent space and relat ed services. The requested increase of $1,771,000 is required to meet our commitment to GSA. DHS Security Charges . The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will continue to charge Basic Security and Building Specific Security. The reques ted increase of $9,000 is required to meet our commitment to DHS, and cost estimates were developed by DHS. Note: ATBs must be recalculated following final FY 2007 action.Retirement . Agency retirement contributions increase as employees under CSRS retire and are replaced by FERS employees. Based on OPM go vernment-wide estimates, we project that the DOJ workforce will convert from CSRS to FERS at a rate of 3 percent per year. The requested increase of $238, 000 is necessary to meet our increased retirement obligations as a result of this conversion. Decreases Unfunded Position and FTE Reductio n. Over the past several years, the Department has been unable to fund positions and FTE at authorized levels because of enacte d rescission s pay raise absorptions, and other mandatory increases. The Department is eliminating these unfunded positions and FTE in FY 200 8, including 32 positions and 32 FTE for the Civil Division.
