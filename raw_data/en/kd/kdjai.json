Nevertheless, long-standing public hesitation around vaccines heightened concerns that vaccine coverage would not achieve desired public health impacts, particularly in light of more conta-gious variants. This cross-sectional survey was conducted online just before the European vaccine rollout in December 2020 among 7000 respondents (aged 18-65) in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Ukraine. The survey included open text boxes for fuller explanation of responses. Overall,56.9% of respondents would accept a COVID-19 vaccine, 19.0% would not, and 24.1% did not know or pre-ferred not to say. By country, between 44% (France) and 66% (Italy) of respondents would accept a COVID- 19 vaccine. Respondents expressed conditionality in open responses, voicing concerns about vaccine safety and mistrust of authorities. We highlight lessons learned about the dynamism of vaccine condi-tionality and persistence of safety concerns. /C2112022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The COVID-19 vaccine rollout has offered one powerful mea- sure for pandemic control. Enhancing trust and acceptance of these vaccines, as well as equitable access, has remained challenging throughout rollout [1]. Before rollout, several studies in Europe and beyond evaluated whether members of the public would accept a COVID-19 vaccine; projected vaccine uptake gures raised concerns that vaccine coverage would fall short of desired public health impacts, although Europe's COVID-19 coverage has since expanded considerably [2-7] . Vaccine acceptance is a complex, ''multi-layered\" process [8], influenced by contextual factors [9,10] that include past vaccine experience, shared perceptions of disease severity [11], experi- ences with the health system [12], and trust in authorities [13]. Approved COVID-19 vaccines have made the decision process even more complex, despite health authorities' efforts to reassure Euro- pean publics about vaccine efcacy and safety [2]. These concerns are sufciently complex and dynamic that they cannot easily be distilled into closed questions about projected vaccine acceptance and related factors.Just before vaccine rollout in Europe, we conducted a mixed- method online study [14], whose primary objective was to esti- mate self-reported COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in seven Euro- pean countries and to identify factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. Study results raise lessons for current and future vaccine campaigns. 1. Methods This cross-sectional survey, conducted by the market research rm Ipsos, sought to estimate expected COVID-19 vaccine accep- tance and to evaluate factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. The study was implemented through an online survey from December 4 to 16, 2020 among 7000 respondents in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Ukraine. Following its standard protocol, Ipsos set quotas aligned with nationally repre- sentative proportions based on age (18-65), gender, geographical region, and working status for each country. Developing a sample of participants from its existing online research panels, it contacted potential participants by email. Once Ipsos had lled each quota, it closed the quota immediately. In each country, 1000 respondents between 18 and 65 years old participated. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.01.054 0264-410X/ /C2112022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The survey also collected open text responses from respondents to elaborate results from the core quantitative study, namely whether they would accept COVID-19 vaccination. All qualitative variables were expressed as percentages. Responses to acceptance of vaccine (yes/no/don't know) were com- pared using v2 test for qualitative variables. A p-value /C200.05 was considered statistically signicant. Data were analyzed using STATA Software Version 15.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas,USA). NVivo software (Windows Release 1, QSR International) sup- ported the qualitative data analysis. We evaluated 2251 text responses from the French, Italian, and Spanish panels, because vaccine hesitancy and refusal have been prominent in these coun- tries [2]and conducted deductive and inductive coding to develop a thematic analysis of responses. The University of Antwerp ethics committee provide ethical approval (20/13/150). All participants furnished informed consent before participating in the survey. 2. Results Table 1 summarizes survey respondent social and demographic proles. Although respondent panels for each country were repre- sentative in terms of age (18-65 years), gender, occupational sta- tus, and country region, the panels were heavily weighted towards those with higher than primary-level education. Fig. 1 shows numbers and percentages of those who would accept or reject vaccination, or who did not know, globally and by country. Overall, 3983 (56.9%) would accept vaccination, 1325 (19.0%) would not, and 1688 (24.1%) did not know or preferred not to say. Survey results showed that projected COVID-19 vaccine acceptance varied across countries, and in some populations would be insufcient to achieve herd immunity, particularly with more contagious variants circulating ( Table 2 ). Between 44% (n = 441, France) and 66% (n = 1658, Italy) of respondents would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it was found by scientic investigation to be safe, effective, and free-of-charge. Between 21% (n = 211, Italy) and 28% (n = 279, France) of respondents did not know or preferred not to say if they would accept a vaccine. Fig. 1 shows responses by respondents' socio-demographic characteristics. Overall, and in all countries except Italy, women expressed less intention and more uncertainty about accepting a COVID-19 vaccine than men (n = 1820, 51.8%, versus n = 2163, 62.1%, and n = 986, 28% versus n = 700, 20.1% not knowing/prefer- ring not to say). The oldest age cohorts indicated that they were more likely to accept vaccination (45-54 y, n = 952, 58.1%, 55-65 y, n = 907, 62.9%), except for in Italy and Sweden. Married respon- dents were more likely to accept vaccination (n = 2422, 58.6% ver- sus 1562, 54.5%), except in France and Italy; respondents with higher educational levels (n = 1997, 60.8%) (except in Spain) and those working (n = 2629, 57.8%) (except in Spain) were more likely to accept vaccination. Analysis of factors associated with vaccine hesitancy focused on the safety and purported contents of the vaccine itself ( Table 2 ). COVID-19 vaccine safety and purported contents were signicant factors correlating with projected acceptance, refusal, and not knowing. Across the seven countries, among the 3985 respondents who would accept a vaccine, 53.7% (n = 2140) believed that COVIDvaccines ''would not be dangerous\", compared to 216 (16.3%) among the 1327 respondents who would not accept vaccination. Among respondents who would reject a COVID-19 vaccine, 54.5% believed that safety considerations had been bypassed in vaccinedevelopment, and 42.8% claimed that adjuvants were ''dangerous to human health\", compared to 35.3% and 16.8%, respectively, among those who would accept vaccination. Among respondents who would not accept vaccination, 25.5% believed that authorities wanted to insert ''microchips\" in COVID-19 vaccinations to control European populations; yet up to 11.3% of respondents believing in this objective would nevertheless accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Intentions to accept a COVID-19 vaccine were strongly corre- lated with respondents' trust in their national governments (45.8% accepting vaccination, versus 18.0% rejecting and 22.5% not knowing or saying) and in pharmaceutical companies (46.9%Table 1 Characteristics of study population.

In addition, projected vaccine acceptance was also strongly linked to trust in physicians (85.7% (n = 3414) accepting, 62.6% (n = 830) rejecting, and 75.5% (n = 1274) not knowing or say- ing), in nurses (75.1% (n = 2992) accepting, 57.9% (n = 768) reject- ing, 67.9% (n = 1146) not knowing or saying), and in pharmacists (71.2% (n = 2837) accepting, 49.1% (n = 652) rejecting, and 59.8% (n = 1010) not knowing or saying) as sources of medical informa-tion. Respondents who identied their political afliation as ''left\" were more likely to accept vaccination than those who identied with the ''right\" or those not responding to the question (66.3% versus 59.0% and 41.8%, respectively). Qualitative data collected through this survey revealed further insight into why respondents would accept or reject a vaccine. Those who would accept a vaccine indicated that it would confer individual, familial and societal protection and restore daily life Fig. 1. Vaccine acceptance by socio-demographic characteristics.L.W. Heyerdahl, M. Vray, B. Lana (continued )L.W. Heyerdahl, al. Vaccine 40 (2022) 1191-1197 1194and economic activity. One respondent explained that vaccination was essential, noting, ''I think this disease is terrible. It has taken away our freedom to live as we did before. We need to regain our freedom and our joy of living.\" Those maintaining that they would refuse vaccination claimed that it was unnecessary: they did not believe they were at risk for COVID-19, took other health precautions, or thought that viral mutations would render a vac- cine useless and unnecessary. ''COVID is a virus that mutates all the time,\" observed another respondent, ''which will probably ren- der any vaccine that I receive useless.\" Most important, our qualitative analysis showed that projected COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and refusal were conditional. Respondents intending to accept vaccination claimed that they would only do so if it was proven to be safe, which took consider-able time to demonstrate. ''If a real scientic study indicated that it was effective and certain,\" one noted, ''I see no reason not to accept it. But for such a study to be done, you need time: you can't know in less than one year what the undesirable effects could be.\" Another respondent planning to accept vaccination nonetheless expressed uncertainty about safety because of rapid vaccine devel- opment: ''If I knew that it is effective and safe, but the problem is that I cannot know, because we do not know anything and they have to spend years, they have to experiment with us.\" Qualitative data also showed that those intending to refuse COVID-19 vaccination similarly worried about safety, rapid vaccine development, and side-effects, and their projected refusals were conditional. ''I'm too afraid to get a new COVID vaccine,\" observed one respondent. ''I prefer to wait a bit.\" Some 40% of those refusing in France, 18% in Italy and 28% in Spain acknowledged that they might later accept but would ''let others get vaccinated rst\".These open responses revealed deep concerns about pharma- ceutical companies and national governments. ''I have no con- dence in pharmaceutical laboratories,\" a respondent claimed, whereas another contended that these companies have ''too many secrets about vaccine ingredients, there's what's written, and then what the ingredients really are.\" 3. Discussion Collected just before Europe's COVID-19 vaccine rollout, this survey in seven European countries showed that up to 66% of respondents anticipated accepting a COVID-19 vaccine, raisingconcerns that coverage in certain countries and among certain groups would not be sufciently high to achieve herd immunity [15,16] . COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be effective with more infectious variants, although some commentators have urged investment in other control strategies and health system strength- ening [17-19] . Our results echoed other projections of vaccine acceptance in Europe [2,20,21] and paralleled prior theorizations around vaccine condence, which is closely linked to trust in the vaccine itself, in vaccine producers, and in the health and political structures that promulgate vaccines [9,10] . Our ndings indicated that percentages of people reporting vac- cine acceptance shed insufcient light on vaccine hesitancy: understanding reasons behind vaccine uptake decisions is essential for such insight, and ultimately for improving current and future vaccine uptake. The rapid development and purported content of COVID-19 vaccines (e.g. microchips, toxins) and their safety was subject to considerable questioning in our survey, particularly in open text responses, where many respondents conditioned theirTable 2 Factors linked to accepting or rejecting COVID-19 vaccination: n (%).

Respondents were specically asked to e valuate ''To what extent do you consider the following to be trustworthy, or not, as sources of information about scientic studies concerning the origins, treatment, prevention, or consequences of COVID-19?\" 8Respondents were asked to place their political beliefs on a 10-point scale from left to right. *NA = Missing data.L.W. Heyerdahl, M. Vray, B. Lana et al. Vaccine 40 (2022) 1191-1197 1195acceptance and rejection upon evidence of vaccine safety [22]. Such questioning may have reflected citizens' misgivings about their governments and pharmaceutical companies [8,23] . Both cor- relations between projected vaccine acceptance and trust in these authorities and open text responses illustrated these misgivings. Moreover, our qualitative evidence emphasized the importance of broad social benets of accepting COVID-19 vaccination, echoing results elsewhere [24]. Although conducted in late 2020, our study provides an impor- tant snapshot of European attitudes toward COVID vaccines. It offers two critical lessons for current and future vaccination cam- paigns. As of October 2021, EU/EEA states fully vaccinated 74% of adults over 18 years, with EU states in our survey achieving between 81.6% (Germany) and 93.8% (France) coverage; Ukraine's coverage gures, although unavailable, appear low because ofdelayed vaccine deliveries, high vaccine prices, and mistrust [7,25] . Hence, conditional acceptance or rejection of COVID-19 vac- cines has been ''volatile\", but the ''vaccine hesitant\" can indeed be convinced [26]. Several measures may have contributed to vaccine acceptance but require further study: making vaccines easily accessible and free-of-charge; addressing rapid vaccine develop- ment and safety concerns; and implementing vaccine ''passports\", although this measure's ethical implications are debated [27-29] . Second, although the proportion of Europe's ''hesitating\" adult population vaccination has shrunk, vaccine rumors display remarkable continuity. This observation clearly requires further investigation in Europe, but despite communications campaigns, Swedish, Italian, Canadian and American publics, for instance, still express safety consequences of rapid vaccine development [30]. Deeper qualitative inquiries into persistent vaccine concerns and populations adhering to them can contribute to developing tar- geted, compassionate, non-stigmatizing communications with the persistently hesitant, to help them to make informed decisions. Our analysis has three limitations. Survey panels select repre- sentative samples among age and gender groups, regions, and working status, but are not fully representative because they draw heavily from those with internet access and of higher educational achievements. Second, the panels did not include individuals over age 65. The younger prole of respondents may have biased results toward more vaccine-hesitancy, since younger respondents may perceive themselves as less susceptible to COVID-19. Finally, the survey was conducted in December 2020, providing a past snap- shot of attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. 4. Conclusion With varying success, European public health agencies have tackled COVID vaccine safety concerns to assist publics in making informed choices. Vaccine conditionality can be changed. Yet despite campaigns to enhance vaccine condence and administer doses, the concerns collected before vaccine rollout and reported here persist. More qualitative research can yield deeper under- standing of persistent concerns and those embracing them, poten- tially leading to new interventions that foster more effective exchanges with persistently vaccine-hesitant groups. 5.
