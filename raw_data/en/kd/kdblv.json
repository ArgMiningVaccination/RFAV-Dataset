It generally begins during the first six weeks of pregnancy and passes in [the second trimester](https://www.forbes.com/health/womens-health/pregnancy/guide-trimesters-of-pregnancy/). The waves of nausea, often accompanied by vomiting, can be so unpleasant that some people will try any remedy to make it go away. Luckily, there are safe remedies that really can help ease the symptoms of morning sickness, and doctors usually suggest trying the non-drug solutions first. Start by making some dietary changes like eating frequent, small meals every couple of hours and avoiding triggers like spicy or fatty foods. If that doesn't help, consider one of the following strategies. The Best Remedies for Morning Sickness There are a number of remedies OB-GYNs typically recommend as being safe and effective for [morning sickness](https://www.forbes.com/health/womens-health/pregnancy/what-is-morning-sickness/). Talk to your doctor, though, before taking any medications, herbal remedies and vitamin supplements. Ginger Ginger is an effective non-drug treatment for morning sickness and can be consumed in a number of forms, including capsules. It's also found in ginger ale, lollipops, tea and lozenges (look for products made with real ginger instead of artificial ginger flavoring). Experts recommend taking one 250 milligram capsule every six hours, four times a day. \"The FDA [Food & Drug Administration] cites ginger on its substances generally recognized as safe [GRAS] list,\" says [Rachel Adams, M.D.](https://www.forbes.com/health/medical-advisory-board/rachel-adams/), a Baltimore-based OB-GYN and 2021 Forbes Health Advisory Board member. \"When compared with placebo, ginger decreases frequency of nausea, but not vomiting.\" Buy Ginger Ale: [Available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ginger+ale&linkCode=ll2&tag=forbeshealth-20&linkId=403867b69438c0bedddc424ecc39af87&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) Crackers Crackers are low-cost, taste good and are recommended to help ease morning sickness by the March of Dimes, an organization dedicated to the health of mothers and babies. Bland varieties in particular are typically tolerated best. Try eating some in the morning before you get out of bed, suggests the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). It might also help to snack on crackers throughout the day, as well as nuts or fruit. However, crackers can be high in salt, so keep an eye on your sodium intake. The daily recommended amount of sodium is 2,300 milligrams for healthy women. One Nabisco saltine cracker contains about 135 milligrams of sodium.

An acupuncturist inserts tiny thin needles into your skin at specific points to treat and prevent certain conditions. An Australian study of women in [early pregnancy](https://www.forbes.com/health/womens-health/pregnancy/early-signs-of-pregnancy/) found those who received acupuncture treatments for four weeks experienced less nausea and dry retching than women who didn't receive acupuncture treatments [[1]](#footnote_1). And acupuncture is safe, says Dr. Lerner. \"Many patients report improvement in symptoms, but that the improvement may be temporary until [the] next session,\" she says. Ask your healthcare provider to help you find an acupuncturist who is trained in working with pregnant people. Additionally, look for an acupuncturist with credentials\u2014most states require a license, certification or registration to practice acupuncture, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Education, training standards and requirements for obtaining these depend on the state, but a license indicates the practitioner meets standards of knowledge and use of acupuncture.

It's an antihistamine, meaning it blocks certain chemicals in the body that cause nausea. Whether you take either by itself or both together, these two drugs are safe to take during pregnancy and have no harmful effects on the fetus, states ACOG. Your doctor can prescribe a drug that combines vitamin B6 and doxylamine. If you're taking B6 alone, take 10 to 25 milligrams every six to eight hours, says Dr. Adams, who adds that the maximum dose of vitamin B6 in pregnancy is 200 milligrams a day. \"In combination with doxylamine is Diclegis [a prescription medication], which 10 milligrams of B6 and 10 milligrams of doxylamine.\" You can take this nightly, and may increase to up to four times daily, she says. Another form is Bonjesta, which contains 20 milligrams of B6 and 20 milligrams of doxylamine. You can take up to two tablets daily, she says. Foods That Fight Nausea During Pregnancy If you're experiencing nausea and struggling to keep food down, ACOG advises trying bland foods, specifically the BRATT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast and tea). Ultimately, they suggest finding any food that sounds appealing to you and that you are able to keep down. Experts also recommend consuming smaller amounts of carbohydrates every half hour such as crackers, pasta, rice, bagels, dry toast or breakfast cereal. This is because carbohydrates have a lower risk of upsetting the stomach than some other foods. Ginger is the only non-drug remedy recommended by ACOG to alleviate nausea. Foods and drinks containing ginger may provide relief for some people, but check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking a ginger supplement. Avoid any foods or smells that make you feel ill and of course, be sure to always drink plenty of water. Morning Sickness Medicine If your pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting are not improving with dietary or lifestyle changes, there are a few medications that may help. Over-the-Counter Morning Sickness Medicines ACOG recommends vitamin B6 as the over-the-counter medication to try first. If that isn't enough, they suggest adding doxylamine, an antihistamine that is found in over-the-counter sleep aids aimed at treating short-term insomnia. Prescription Medicines for Morning Sickness There is a prescription drug that combines vitamin B6 and doxylamine sold under the brand names Bonjesta and Diclegis. According to ACOG, both of these ingredients are safe for use during pregnancy and are not harmful to the developing fetus. What Causes Morning Sickness?
