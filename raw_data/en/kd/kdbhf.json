Greene Manhattan College - SBDC ABSTRACT Historically, minority and women owned businesses and bus inesses in economically distressed areas have faced barriers to capital. The Financial Se rvices Corporation of New York City has proposed establishing a Micro Loan Program that will make loans between $5,000 and $50,000 that will target minority and women owned businesses and businesses in economically di stressed areas. A major component of this Program provides for management assistance primarily through Small Business Developm ent Centers in the application prepar ation stage and through a Mentorship program in the post disbursement stage. This paper disc usses the background, components, and management assistance implications of the Program. The opport unity for Small Business Institutes to participate is also addressed. INTRODUCTION A major challenge to most small business owners is obtaining adequa te financing. One particular difficulty is the size of the loan. Many financial institutions have established offi cial or unofficial minimums as to what they will loan - $75,000 or $100,000 or $250,000. After all they argue, \"the paperw ork involved for a $50,000 loan is the same as a $400,000 loan, but the return is not as grea t.\" Often, the amount of loan needed by a small business is less than the minimum established. Another problem is that frequently the small bus iness owner is a minority or located in economically distressed areas. In an effort to address thes e circumstances, the Financial Services Corporation of New York City (FSC) has proposed setting up a Micro Loan Pr ogram that will make loans between $5,000 and $50,000 that will target minority and women owned businesses and busin esses located in economically distressed areas. A major component of this Micro Loan Program is provision for manage ment assistance both in preparing for the loan and in follow up once the loan is made. Background (1) Historically, both minority and women busine ss owners have faced barriers to capita l. For example, recent research has indicated that the typical Black owned business raises $0.55 in debt financing for every dollar of equity; the typical White owned business raises $1.58 for ever y dollar of equity. Similarly, women bus iness owners were found to be able to leverage lower levels of debt fo r a given amount of equity when compar ed to typical male business owners. Interestingly, minority and women owned businesses are heavily represented in sm aller retail and service establishments. A study by Art hur Young finds that Black owned businesse s are overwhelmingly service and retail: out of a sample of 288 Black owned businesses in New York City, 211 or 75% , were serv ice or retail. Women owned firms are also concentrated in service and retail. The fact that there is such a concen tration of minority and women businesses in service and retail is partly a reflection of ba rriers to capital, as these businesses tend to require fewer resources. The reason behind targeting businesses in distressed neighborhoods, is to promote economic activity and employment in areas in need of both. Studies have indicated that banks have increasingly scaled back their activities in distressed neighborhoods, revealing a view that banks see these neighborhoods as unprofitable areas in which to do business. This may also be seen as a reflection of views on bus iness viability generally in such locations. The FSC proposal examined several ex isting government run micro loan funds. All were found to serve businesses owned primarily by minorities in economical ly distressed areas. Three out of seve n lend to start-ups and all types of businesses were eligible including serv ice and retail. The loan-loss ratios were approximately 10% on average. Collateral requirements were flexible to a degree, usuall y premised on using all availa ble collateral. All programs required participation in various types of technical assist ance programs, and most moni tored their loans extensively. The administrators of these loan funds unanimously agreed that the technica l assistance was extremely important in getting the lenders prepared to take on debt. Technical services include financ ial control and management, inventory control, receivable collection, payables , cash flow management, marketing, tax information and general administrative problem solvin g. Consequently, the essence of the FSC proposal can best be summarized by New York City Deputy Mayor for Economic Development Sally Hernandez- Pinero when she stated: \"the conmm on threads running through various parts of the [Mayor's] program are a shared focus on retail a nd service companies in economically hart- hit neighborhoods, with particular concern for women and minority owned busin esses\". (2) However, while FSC has had a history as a lender it had not worked with retail and personal service busin esses in the past. Therefore in structuring the program, provision was made for technical assistance to be provided by established and recognized sources. PROGRAM COMPONENTS Given the foregoing background, the FSC proposal was designed to encompass the best featur es of existing micro loan programs and improve upon them. Recognizing th e special needs of the targeted mark et and the fact that many of the applicants will be approaching lenders for the first ti me, a major element of the proposal was the provision for providing considerable t echnical assistance. The Micro Lo an Program was theref ore structured to make use of several existing providers of technical assistance to assist potential borrowers in the application process a nd to offer business counseling to borrowers who did receive financing. Technical Assistance - Prep aring the Application The consensus among micro loan practitione rs is that successful micro lending ne eds to be combined with technical assistance in various areas such as marketing, financia l management, personnel management and inventory control. Because of their expertise in working with the target population, Small Business Devel opment Centers in New York City (SBDC's) were designated as the pr oviders of technical assistance to assi st applicants in completing the required documentation for their application to the Micro Loan Pr ogram. The application require ments include a completed application, as well as th e following materials: -Tax returns for the last three years -F inancial statements for the last three years -Business plan and projections - Personal financial statement which will include documen- tation of existing loans -Personal guarantee -Lease or deed for the current business site The SBDCs will ensure that application requirements are met, assisting a pplicants in completing their business plan, developing projections and completing their personal financial statement (similar to the form used by the U.S. Small Business Administration). The SBDCs will al so develop financial statements from the three years of tax returns. Applicants approaching SBDCs will ha ve already been screened and referr ed by FSC. The prescreening process by FSC will have determined if the applicant meets the th ree year business requirement and has the appropriate tax returns. Before an applicant comes to the SBDC, they will have been briefed on application requirements and given an outline for completing an initial draft of their business plan. Besides assisting in preparing the application for the Micro Loan Program, the SBDCs will be available for the wide ra nge of management assistance services they routinely provide, such as assistance with marke ting, advertising, or business training. To clarify the responsibilities of bot h the FSC and the SBDC a \"Letter of Understanding\" (3) between the two organizations was drafted. Work able time frames were established for all participants to comply with. Provision was made for appropriate notifications to e ach organization as to status of cases. Also, time requirements were imposed upon applicants to comply with requests for information. Failure to do so would resu lt in the application being considered inactive. The total time involved in processing a loan once eligib ility was determined should take less than 90 days as long as applicant is fort hcoming with necessary information. Technical Assistance - Post Disbursement Services The core of the post disbursement busin ess counseling and technical assistance se rvices will be the New York City Office of Economic and Financial Oppor tunity's Mentorship Program. The Me ntorship Program will match each borrower with an experienced business owner acting as a volunteer mentor. The Mentorsh ip Program's Director will meet with each borrower and match him or her with a ment or most likely to offer valuable assistance and advice. Borrowers will be required to use the Mentorship Program as a condition to obtaining financing under the Micro Loan Program, unless FSC staff determines that such assistance will not benefit the borrower. Other Pro gram Com ponents Application Review: Once an a pplication is complete, having all the require d documentation, it wi ll be forwarded to FSC by the applicant. FSC, will carry out the credit review, all checks (credit checks, Department of Investigation, suits and judgment/ lien search es, certificates of incor poration/ certificate of good standing) and submit the loan for approval to the FSC Loan Review Committee. Disbursements: Funds will be disbursed directly to the borrower or to the vendor if the loan is for machinery, equipment or fixtures. The borrower will not be required to make a payment for the purchased goods prior to receiving the loan. General Administration: Loan billing a nd monitoring will be performed by FSC. FSC personnel will visit each client upon completion of a project to ensure that goods were purchased or work completed as per the approved loan application. Repayments will be administered by the FSC comptroller and borrowers will be cont acted if payments are not made in time. Late payments will have a 14 day grace pe riod, after which they will incu r a 2% late payment fee. If repayments are still not forthcoming, FSC will conduct a work-out procedure to assist the business in making the repayment. DISCUSSION The proposed Micro Loan Program has a num ber of very positive features in its favor. First, the objective of the Program is very timely and indeed needed. Minority and women owned businesses as well as businesses in economically distressed areas do not have access to capital as readily as other bus inesses. Second, focusing on loans of $5,000 to $50,000, a demand that is not adequate ly filled by the private sector is being addressed. Third, the Program is structured so that it facilitates assist ance to potential borrowers rather than establishing excessive paperwork hurdles. By combining the talents of two experienced organizations, the FSC with its lending and administrative expertise along with SBDCs recognized provision of technical assistance, the focus will always be on the applicant. While there are many benefits to the proposed Micro Loan Pr ogram, there also exist some concerns. For example, as the size of anticipated loans are envisione d to be smaller, will the requirements for a detailed business plan or for the amount of collateral be rigid? It is an ticipated that such requirements will be flexible. With regard to a business plan, the essential elements will be incl uded but the degree of support necessary will be less than usually submitted. Concerning collateral, personal guarantees will be required in all cases but due to the nature of the businesses (retail or services) involved a less rigid standard will have to be developed. However, th e Program is not intended to be a give away of funds and that is w hy a major emphasis is placed on providing tech nical assistance. Another concern involves the FSC Loan Review Committee. As this committee meets once a month, timing becomes critical. Consideration is being given to a special Micro Loan Review Committee which could be a subcommittee of the full committee and possibly meet more frequently to expedite the review process. In providing technical assistance a number of concerns also exist. In discussions and in the Letter of Understanding, the SBDCs' position is that assistance provided is for the c lient and any communication to FSC regarding an individual business venture/loan a pplication should be through the client (who can call upon SBDC staff to a ssist with a response when necessary). At the same time, the SBDC is not oblig ated to render or share an opinion on the feasibility of a venture or a client's ability to repa y any loans proposed. Additionally, the SBDC does not \"audit\" previously devised financial documents and tax returns that may become part of any loan applications. A final concern regarding the providing of technical assistance by SBDC is the possibility that the pot ential number of referrals could be overwhelming. As this is a new program, the-number of applicants is undetermined. The Letter of Understanding allows for notification if sufficient staf f time is not available for properly serv icing Micro Loan Pr ogram referrals. S.B.I. Opportunity As the Micro Loan Program is heavily dependent on technical assistance, an opportunity exists for Small Business Institutes (SBI) to be involved. While in many cases, due to time constraints, it may be difficult for student teams to assist in the preparation of the appl ication, there might be instances where this service could be provided either independently or in conjunction with another service provider , such as the SBDC. However, the SBI could de finitely be of service in providing post disbursement technical assistance. Agai n, this could be done eith er independently or in conjunction with another servic e provider. Working with a minority small business owner, who has just received a loan, with regard to a management probl em could prove to be a very mutually rewarding experience for the client, the students, and the fundin g agency. CONCLUSION The Micro Loan Program as proposed by the Financial Services Corporation of New York City targeting minority and women owned businesses is indeed an idea whose time ha s come.With its emphasis on providing technical assistance to applicants both in preparing the appl ication and in post disbursement, a highe r degree of success can be expected. The implications for manageme nt assistance are positive but concerns do exis t with regard to technicalities such as client perspective, rendering of opinions ,and client overload. However, these ar e more procedural than substantive items. The joint collaboration of the FSC and the SBDC in this instance increase the likelihood of a successful resolution. As similar programs develop, an opportunity exists fo r SBI involvement. NOTES (1) \"Micro Loan - Draft Proposal\", Financial Serv ices Corporation of New York City, July 25, 1990.

DO BANKERS ALWAYS KNOW BEST?: A COMPARISON OF BUSINESS FINANCE STRATEGIES OF SMALL BUSINESS OPERATORS AND BANK LOAN OFFICERS Paul Dunn, Leo R. Cheatham, and Carole Cheatham, North east Louisiana University ABSTRACT In spite of the fact that small businesses produce more than $1.5 trillion in sales each year a nd have created most of the 34 million new jobs in the United Stat es since 1970, indications are that they are receiving less than their share of attention and less than good advice from their bankers. A 1989 survey by the Sm all Business Development Center at Northeast Louisiana University provides evidence that both sm all business owners and banke rs are deficient in their knowledge of basic business finance strategi es, particularly during the start-up stag e of business. On some questions in the survey the bankers scored lower than the small busin ess people, making their advi ce as finance professionals somewhat suspect. As a result of the study, the following recommendations ar e made: (1) banks should establish a working relationship between bank officers and small busin ess owner/managers, (2) large banks should establish a small business department, (3) both bankers a nd small business owners should become aware of university resources to assist small business, and (4) bankers shoul d familiarize themselves with small business problems. INTRODUCTION In spite of the fact that small businesses produce more than $1.5 trillion in sales each year a nd have created most of the 34 million new jobs in the Unit ed States since 1970 [4], indica tions are that they are receiv ing less than their share of attention and less than good advice from th eir bankers. Fabian Linden, executive dire ctor of research at the Conference Board in New York says, \"What you are discovering is that banks, like any other business, treat big customers better than they treat small customers. If y ou're a big, brand-name company, the ba nks roll out the red carpet, but small businessmen likely receive le ss cordial treatment\" [11]. A 1989 poll by American Banker indicated that larger businesses are more likel y to be contacted regularly by their banker--two-thirds of midsize companie s were contacted regularly whereas only half the small companies were contacted. Moreover, the midsize companies were contacted mo re frequently [9]. Other than phone calls, the favorite method of communication with small businesses was review of their financial statements. Only one of the 292 small companies surveyed had received persona l visits from it s banker [3]. Worse than the lack of communication is the lack of understanding of small business problems. In the American Banker poll 80 percent of the small busin esses surveyed ranked knowledge of their business as important or extremely important. However, in their eyes most banks ranked only average in their know ledge of their business. Seven percent said their banker's knowledge was below average and 9 percent said it was poor [7]. Joel Newman, co-owner of Micro Metrics Inc., a Paterson, New Jersey, electronics subassembler comments on a related small business concern: I'm particularly annoyed with the quality of employee that banks have now. What banks have now is a collection of yuppies who aren't interested in the long term. They know they'll be promoted or go to another industry. They view us old customers as prospective problem s the other guy left behind [11, p.14]. Commercial banks are the primar y providers of financial services for small businesses; they are used about three times as frequently as the second-ranked prov iders which are finance companies. Comm ercial banks tend to maintain their dominance in the small business area by virtue of the fact that companies prefer a local bank and they tend to stay with a bank relationship for a long period of time. In spite of this dominance, John Forde believes banks do not do enough for their small business customers, particularly in the area of financial guidance [ 3, pp.6-7]. Some bankers feel it is not their place to help companies prepare financial statements or business plans. One north eastern banker says, \"You can give enough help to let them get a loan, but if you give too much, you may be managi ng the business and become le gally liable\" [3, p.7]. John Galles, executive vice president of National Small Business United, comm ents, \"In the small business community, owners do not identify bankers as a prim ary source of assistance when they ne ed it. They are now turning to their accountant or attorney, or trade orga nization. It's unfor tunate\" [7, p.21]. THE SURVEY It appears that there is a si gnificant misunderstanding by bankers of small business needs in spite of the fact that the banker may be the only financial prof essional with whom the entrepreneur has contact. Poor advice from this professional may contribute to business fa ilures, particularly when businesses ar e at the vulnerable start-up stage. A 1989 study by the Small Business Developmen t Center at Northeast Louisiana Un iversity was designed to determine the level of financial mana gement expertise by people operating small businesses and the corresponding level of expertise by their bankers. In order to accomplish the survey a sequential probability sample was drawn from a Dun a nd Bradstreet list of small businesses. Dun and Bradstreet personnel were instructed to draw the sample from firms with less than 500 employees at the primary place of busin ess of single and multiple location businesses. Professionals were specifically excluded. Thus, the sample included only retail, service, wholesale, and manufacturing enterprises. A total of 4,000 companies were provided by the initial list. A seque ntial probability sample of 200 was sele cted from this list of 4,000. A bank in the same city as the business was then chosen. A questionnaire consisting of a series of positive and negative asse rtions about financing actions was mailed to the sample of small businesses and banks. The instructions on th e bank questionnaires requested that a small business loan officer complete and return the quest ionnaire. Completed questionnaires were returned from 46 business and 59 bank loan officers. No follow up was attempted. SURVEY FINDINGS Cash Management Planning During Start-Up. The results of the survey are presented in the appendix. The first group of assertions was designed to dete rmine the views of small business ow ners/managers and bankers about cash management planning during the start-up phase of the business. Cash budgeti ng should begin before a new business opens its doors. Adequate cash reserves are a critical survival factor during th e start-up phase of a small business. Businesses can survive for a long time with no profit, but such firms die the first time there is no cash to meet current obligations. Large start-up outflows will quickly absorb all cash provided by initial equity if realistic cash flow forecasts have not been prepared and steps taken to identif y the timing and amounts of de bt financing that will be needed [14]. There is usually no question of whether or not debt financing will be necessa ry. The only questions to be answered are \"when\" and \"how much.\" Statement A said, \"In start-up situations, using owner's money for purchasi ng buildings and land would be better than using the money for working capital.\" The \"correct\" respons e to this statement would be to disagree. Alternative sources of financing to meet working ca pital needs are more limited than those for needs such as fixed asset financing. Buildings and land can provide collateral fo r real estate loans which would generall y have a lower interest rate than an unsecured loan [5]. Furthermore, leasi ng of buildings and land may be possibl e which requires no commitment of long term funds [6]. Approximately two-thirds of the smal l business people and 73 percent of the bankers gave the correct \"disagree\" response. However, it must be noted that 12 percent of the bankers gave an incorrect response, and 15 percent had no opinion. The 12 percent with the \"agree\" response would be giving in appropriate advice to their small business clients. The other 15 percent could be giving unwise advice or perhaps no advice at all. Statement B said, \"During start-up, owner's money should be re served as much as possible to cover operating needs to cash flow break even.\" The \"correct\" response to Statement B is to agree. There will be a delay in cash inflows due to the fact that products must be produced (in a manufacturing business), then sold, then cash collected. In the meantime, cash outflows occur immediately except for those covered by trade credit and short-te rm borrowing. The owner must be sure that enough cash is available to survive until the cash inflows are realized. As disc ussed under Statement A, it is more feasible to use the owner's funds for this purpose than to borrow to for workin g capital needs. The small business person should turn a deaf ear to the banker's advice on this question. The small business group had a 91 percent correct response while the bankers had only a 78 pe rcent correct response. Ninete en percent of the bankers had an incorrect response while 3 percent had no opinion. Bankers improved their response rate from 73 percent on the first statement. However, they were be hind the small busine ss owner/managers. Statement C said, \"Normally, it is better to cash certificates of deposit for use in the business rather than use them as collateral for loans.\" The \"correct\" response was to disagree. Like Statement A, this is a specific capital conservation decision. Cashing certificate s of deposit provides immediate cas h but destroys an asset in the process. If the certificates are used as loan collateral, the business retains the asset and still acquire s the needed financing. This statement seemed to elicit more un certainty than previous statements in spite of the fact that the general cash conservation principle is the same. Twenty-four percent of the small busin ess people and 25 percent of the bankers had no opinion. Only 41 percent of the bankers and 37 percent of the small business owners/managers gave the \"correct\" response. A third of the bankers would have presumably given inappropriate a dvice. In this case it appears that the knowledge of the bankers is only minimally a bove that of the small business people. Statement D said, \"Survival cash (cash to cover operating ne eds to cash flow break even) should be arranged for when negotiating start-up financing. \"T he \"correct\" response would be to agree. The Van Auken and Carter study identified financial projections as the most comm on requirement for initial debt acquisiti ons among their survey firms [12]. An entrepreneur has a much better probability of being able to borrow survival cash if the request is part of a forecast and management plan presented before start-up rather than a desperation decision to borrow when there is not enough cash on hand to pay the bills. The respondents in both groups did much better on this st atement. Approximately 96 percent of the small business group and 88 percent of the bankers correctly agreed with th e statement. However, it must be noted that the small business people again outscored the banke rs, and 12 percent of the bankers woul d have given bad advice or no advice. It seems an anomaly that 8 percent of the bankers would not like to know in advance of their clients' needs. Errors in Estimating Start-Up Needs. New entrepreneurs tend to be overly optimistic in their assessment of the prospects for their venture. Three statements in the survey we re designed to reveal the exte nt of the awareness of the entrepreneurs and their ba nkers of this tendency. Statement E said, \"Small business borro wers applying for start-up loans tend to underestimate costs and expenses and overestimate sales.\" The \"correct\" response is to agree. Overestimating sales and underestimating expenses is a very common problem among most small business organizers. Expe nses tend to be understated because of omissions of several categories which may not be si gnificant individually but which are qui te large when viewed as a whole. Inaccurate sales estimates result from failure to corr ectly understand the demand for products. Approximately 50 percent of businesses fail for lack of sales, according to Dun & Br adstreet. A new business selling a product or service must compete with established businesses already selling the product or service as well as those offering close substitutes. To their credit, 100 percent of the bankers correctly agreed wi th Statement E. One can spec ulate that their experience has shown that overoptimism by beginners in small business is typical. The smal l business owners also recognized the tendency for the most part, with 93 percent of them agreeing with the statement. Statement F said, \"Small busine ss owners typically underestim ate their new firm's cash re quirements.\" The \"correct\" response was to agree with Statement F. A new firm will show accounting profit s before its cash breakeven point is reached. Revenues from sales are recorded when sales occur, but cash from th e transactions may not be received for two or three months. In the meantime, cash outflows are necessary to produce or purchase invent ory and to meet operating expenses. Once the cycle is stabilized, cash inflow s from sales in previous periods are used to meet cash outflow needs in the current period. Howe ver, the start-up phase is a dangerous period when cash outflows must be financed from sources other than oper ations. Although new business operators pe rceive a need for buying inventories and fixed assets, they typically underest imate the lag between the initial cash out flow and the resulting cash inflows from sales. Again 100 percent of the bankers recognized Statement F to be true, probably from experience. Of the small business respondents, 86 percent of them also reco gnized the statement to be true. Althou gh small business res pondents scored well, they failed to do as well as the 94 percent that correct ly responded to Statement E, indicating that there is more awareness of underestimating operating expenses and overest imating sales than underestim ating cash requirements. Statement H said, \"Small business owners, estimates of worki ng capital needs in startup situ ations are usually too low.\" The \"correct\" response is to ag ree. The period of time require d to convert the initial invest ment in inventory back to cash is called the cash conversion cycle [1]. This cycle cons ists of the number of days from the time inventory is initially purchased until it is sold and converted back to cash. This period includes the time when sold inventory is in the form of accounts receivable. Total cash investment in wo rking capital is equal to the combined asset items of inventories and accounts receivable less the combined financi ng provided by short-term payabl es and accruals reflected on the liability side of the balance sheet. However, an incr ease in payables providing wo rking capital financing also creates a need for larger cash balances to pay the larger bills when they are due. Even entrepreneurs who have been farsighted enough to plan for the cash investment in inventor y often fail to plan for the i nvestment in receivables and additional cash balances to cover increases in payables. Again, bankers as a group were well aware of the problem pos ed in Statement H with 100 percent of them correctly agreeing with the statement. Business ow ners' responses were the same as to th e previous statement, with 87 percent agreeing. Both bankers and small business owners did better on statements indicating an aw areness of errors in estimation than they did on statements concerning cash ne eds to start a business. The tendency towards overoptimism is apparently a well-known phenomenon even among the owners themselves. Identifying Permanent vs. Temporary Need s. Two statements were used to dete rmine if managers and bankers were aware of the need for different types of financing for permanent working capital needs compared to the types suitable for financing of temporary working capita l. Inventory was used as the representa tive working capital asset item in the statements since it is usually easier to segment into the two categories requi ring different financing. Statement I said, \"In start-up situations , basic inventory investme nt should be financed using long term sources of funds.\" The \"correct\" response was to agree. The rule of t humb on all assets is to finance permanent needs with long term debt or equity and to resort to less reliable, high risk, short-term debt to finance only temp orary needs [15]. Nearly all of the initial inve stment in inventory represents a permanent financing requirement. Even though inventory will be sold, cash received must be \"plowed back\" to purch ase replacement inventory. The cash will not be available for other purposes except for the prof it produced due to selling prices ex ceeding operating costs and costs of goods sold. Small business managers exhibited a grea t deal of uncertainty about basic inve ntory investment w ith responses about evenly divided among strongly agree or agree, strongly disagree or disagree , and no opinion. Bankers were somewhat more positive, but positively wrong--56 percent inco rrectly disagreed while only 36 percent agreed. Statement J said, \"Seasonal inve ntory for peak periods should be financed usi ng trade credit or other short term source of funds. The \"correct\" response to Statement J was to agre e. Financing seasonal working cap ital needs with short term funds is an acceptable and co mmon practice. These needs are temporary, a nd the liquidation of the seasonal portion of inventories provides the cash flow to repay the debt obligation. Bankers apparently understand the short term side of inventory financing better th an the long term side. More than 98 percent correctly agreed with Statemen t J. Small business owners were not as certain as the bankers with only 80 percent correctly agreeing with the statem ent that seasonal inventory needs should be financed with short term credit. However, the small business group scored much better on St atement J than they did on the long term side of the equation in Statement I. Again, as in the statements concerning initial cash management in the first section, there seemed to be some confusion among both groups about sources of financ ing for long and short term assets. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS In the initial group of four statements concerning cash mana gement during the startup phase of the business, neither bankers nor small business people did particularly well. Ho wever, it must be noted that the small business people outscored the bankers on two of the questions. A 1989 surv ey by American Banker indicated that 40 percent of companies want advice from their banker about loan struct ures during the first two years of business operation [10]. The findings of the Northeast Louisiana Un iversity (NLU) study indicate that the responses that they get may be less than helpful. The bright spot in the NLU study is that both bankers and sm all business recognize that esti mates of sales and expenses as well as cash and working capital need s may be overoptimistic. Bankers scored an \"A+\" on this group of questions when 100 percent gave the correct response to all three. However, the small business group also recognized the tendency and scored very well themselves. The last two questions dealt wi th use of long and short term funds to fina nce permanent and temporary needs. Bankers scored well on the short term question, but the majority were incorrect on the long term question. The small business group did fairly well on the short term question and did better than the bankers on the long term question. In spite of the fact that \"inquiring [small business] minds want to know,\" it appears that bankers fail to provide knowledgeable financial expe rtise to their small business cl ients in many cases. Th e indication from this survey is that bankers themselves need to familiarize themselves with strate gies that are useful for smal l business, particularly those in the start-up stage. Four reco mmendations seem appropriate: (1) Banks should establish a working relationship betwee n bank officers and small busin ess owner/managers. Small business thrives on the personal touch, and bankers benefit from a more intimate knowledge of their problems. Most small companies bank with a local branch [9, p. 37]. Three-f ourths of small businesses have a bank officer assigned to their account [9, p. 37]. However, contact s may be mininal and may be confined largely to examination of monthly or quarterly financial statements. Phone cal ls and especially visits to the busin ess provide information that financial statements cannot capture. Besides havi ng contact with the primary loan officer , small business people need to know other officers of the bank. If the loan of ficer leaves the bank, the manager does no t need to start from scratch with a new person [13]. (2) Large banks should establish a small business departme nt. The American Banker poll found that 58 percent of the businesses that reported above average or excellent service said their bank had a small business department. However, only 55 percent of the respondents reported that their bank ha d a small business department. Their use appeared to be most prominent in the West and least prominent in the South [2]. Establishment of a sma ll business department allows even large banks to give their small business clients the serv ice they need and to be fami liar with their problems. Equibank in Pittsburgh goes a step further with its Busine ss Alliance service which offers seminars on small business topics: free consulta tion with accountants, employee benefit advisers, a nd other experts; and inexpensive group health insurance [8]. San Francisco's BankAmerica Corporation sp onsors a Small Business Alli ance which gives its small business customers special discounts on it s products and services, a quarterly dige st of business information, seminars, and a special telephon e hotline [2, p.7]. (3) Both bankers and small business owners should become aware of university resources to assist small business. Small Business Development Centers ar ound the country provide a vast array of services for small businesses, including one-on-one counseling, continui ng education seminars, and use of th e Centers' information system and network. Services are for no charge or for a nominal fee. In addition, the Small Business Institute can provide student teams under the supervision of a faculty adviser to tackle a variet y of problems. In cases in which a banker does not have time, inclination or expertise to help a small business owner, the logical place to turn is the local university. (4) Bankers should familiarize themselv es with small business problems. The NLU survey provides ample evidence that bankers are unfamiliar with financial. strategies that are appropriate for sma ll business, particularly in the start-up phase. The typical business school educati on of a banker does not prepare him or her to deal with small business. Accounting, finance, market ing and management courses are usually geared to large compan ies. Little time is spent on strategies for small or young business. Bankers need to pu t forth an effort to lear n about small business through continuing education courses, seminars, and personal r eading. Beyond that, they can learn from entrepreneurs by listenin g to their concerns and visitin g their businesses. Small businesses which survive eventually grow into medium and large size businesse s. Bankers need to realize that by helping small businesses they are help ing themselves. Entrepre neurs who receive good advice and who are pleased with their relationship with their bank er will continue to be good customers for years to come, benefiting both the entrepreneur and the bank.

Davis, Northeast Louisiana University ABSTRACT Concentration of operational control and limited segregation of duties (due to few employees) are two characteristics that create a different envir onment for internal controls fo r a small owner operat ed business and the controls in other businesses. Incorporating the at titude of the owner in the control structure can make a difference since controls in a small owner operated business can genera lly be overridden by the owner. Entrep reneurial controls are unique to the small business and are dependent on specific actions by the owner and the overall business knowledge of the owner. INTRODUCTION It is commonly believed that the need for an internal cont rol system develops as the organization grows. As a small entity characterized by the direct involveme nt of the owner on a daily basis grows into an organization with specialized and/or depart- mental operations, the need for internal controls does increase.[l, p. 200] In general this idea is based on an accepted group of controls that are us eful in allowing management to evaluate financial and operational efficiency from reports. Subordinates, therefore, must transfer information throughout the hierarchy of the business. Management depends on internal controls to provide so me assurance that the reports generated are accurate and their directives have been carried out by the responsible subordinates. These intern al controls increase the conf idence that the owners or managers have in the business. Even though the need for inte rnal controls does increase in direct proportion to size of the business, that does not mean controls are not necessary for the small busine ss. This paper examines the controls needed in a small business that is owner operated. The cont rols mentioned will include some that are found in most businesses whether owner- operated or not. However, the fo cus is on the unique situation created when the small business owner manages operations on a daily basi s and the effect on the control structure. After a definition including the characteri stics a small business incorporates, c ontrols will be examined using the elements (control environment, accounti ng system, and control procedures) set forth in SAS 55, Consideration of the Internal Control Structure in a Financial Statement Audit, which became effective January 1, 1990. Definition of Small Business Although small businesses are frequently defined using dollar value criteria, th is paper will use characteristics, typically found by an auditor, which are not usually pres ent in other businesses. The use of these particular characteristics does not inco rporate a ceiling on dollar volume of sales or on any other value or a ceiling on the number of employees found. The characteristics th at distinguish a small business are: * The ownership and/or operational control is concentrated in one or a few indivi duals. The talents of these individuals are likely to be in some area other than accounting and/or finance - possibly marketing, manufacturing, or research. The owner/owners tend to dominate th e affairs of the business. * There will be limited segreg ation of duties and functions w ithin the accounting system. These two characteristics lead to several secondary characte ristics. A business with one or few owners tends to be relatively uncomplicated. The changes fr om year to year are identifiable. U nderstanding and defining these changes, can usually be done with policies and pro cedures that change very little from ye ar to year. Concentration of ownership also creates greater potential for management override of the internal accounting controls. In a small business operated by the owner, the board of directors or other policy making body is likely to be inactive or ineffective. [ 5, p. 53 ] Therefore, the board exerts little or no control over the activitie s engaged in by the owner. The owner in the small business either doe sn't or is not able to hire employee s with either accounting experience or formal accountin g trainin g. The sim plicity and lack of ex pertise in the small business does mean that the recor d-keeping systems may be informal and documentation of tr ansactions may not be ade quate. [ 3, p. 32 ] One other characteristic that may be found is th at the clerical and administrative personne l have easy access to assets creating a serious control breach. In summary, a small business might be categorized as one w ith fewer management members than duties and functions to be performed. An advantag e of this form of business is that the owner/manager is usua lly involved in daily operations and is in a position to personally safeguard asse ts. On the other hand, due to the small number of employees, duties are not separated allo wing the owner/manager the opportunity to al ter or omit certain information without detection by the employees. It also create s an environment that makes errors a nd fraud perpetuated by either employees or owners difficult to detect. INTERNAL CONTROL STRUCTURE Previously, the internal control structure contained only one element, control procedures . All controls were included under this category. SAS 55 increased to th ree the elements included in the inte rnal control structure: the control environment, the accounting syst em, and control procedures. Control Environment Encompassed in this element is the organization's awareness of and commitment to the impor tance of effective controls throughout the organization. [4, p.41] The ideas, actions, and atti tudes of management are the focus of this element as is indicated by the following factors. * Management's philosophy and operating st yle. * The organizational structure of the business. * The existence and responsibilities of the board of directors. * The methods used in assigning authority and responsibility. * The control methods used by management. * The specific personnel policies and practices followed. Management's Philosophy and Operating Style The philosophy and operating style of manage ment in a small business is typically reflective of the owner's attitudes. Controls to detect problems re lating to the owner's attitude cannot be incorporated into the system. The most important measure that could be taken would be to retain an accountant or financial cons ultant to carefully assess any problems that might occur as a re sult of the following: (1) An unreasonable attitude toward business risks. (2) A liberal attitude toward accounti ng matters. Conservatism is one of th e basic accounting principles and the tendency away from it can lead a business into bankruptc y. Numbers one and two could be controlled by the owner's using an accountant as a regular consultant or including one on an active board of directors. (3) An emphasis on minimizing income taxes. This polic y would likely cause a mi sstatement on the financial statements. One of the most important reasons for internal cont rols is to monitor assets a nd inventory is likely to be misstated by an owner with this attitude. Both the in come statement and balance sheet would be affected. (4) An owner who mixes personal expenses with business expenses. The income statem ent of the business will understate income since expenses will in clude more that just those of the busin ess. The effect on the business's income statement would be similar under this condition as under number three. Both three and four concern, to one degree or another, the ethics of the owner/manager. Since the owner is involved in most facets of the day to day activitie s including the accounting, a control to prev ent either of these is unrealistic. Organizational Structure Organizational structure generally refers to segregation of duties. As previously stated, the segregation of duties in a small business is minimal. However, with an involved owne r and two other individuals, lim ited segregation of sales and cash collections can be achieved. For exam ple, the owner can be res ponsible for transaction authorization (e.g. credit approval, accounts receivable write -offs, and sales returns and allowances ); an employee (accounting) can post journals and ledgers; and a second employee (receptionist) ca n open mail and prepare the da ily deposit. This would separate authorization of transactions, recording of transactions, and custody of assets.[4, p. 43] This process might be enhanced by the owner's involvement in ope ning the mail in order to prevent the re ceptionist from neglecting to report cash collections. Although some segreg ation can be achieved, control is limit ed. The owner might hire part-time employees to perform some functions to separate duties even more. Board of Directors Included in this factor is the existence of a board as well as its actual duties and responsib ilities. Many small businesses have family members or friends listed on the board without any responsibilities to the business at all. There is no management, financial, or accounting ex pertise for the owner to rely on for da y to day operation of the business. Methods of Assigning Author ity and Responsibility Job descriptions, organizational charts, computer procedures, detailed documentat ion, etc. are included in this factor. Small businesses may not need to be as detailed in their do cumentation of all policies and procedures. The one area that is contained within this factor that doe s need attention is that adequate docum entation exists for computer procedures. Specifically, there should be procedures for authorizing transactions as well as approving any changes in the system.[4] Management's Control The methods include such things as budgetary control, anal ysis of operations, cost control, and inventory control. [6.p.16] A sound system of budgetary control can provide th e foundation for sound business management. A lack of understanding or knowledge is frequently the reason given for not utilizing this im portant control. Operational analysis provides the owner with a clear idea of the firm's position both as a stand alone entity as well as a part of its industry. Profitable spending for desired results is the primary objective of cost control. [6] Many uninformed owners simply atte mpt to reduce expenses. Using control for inventory will result in mi nimizing investment in inventory while sa tisfying customer requests which will make purchasing more effective. Personnel Policies and Practices The experience, background, and education of the personnel hired, the turnover rate, the policies regarding bonding of employees, employee vacations, and rotation of duties are cons idered important considerati ons for control. Competent, honest employees that remain with the firm relate directly to improved cont rol. Employees handling cash or other securities should be bonded. Al l employees as well as the owner should be required to take vacations. Rotation of duties will help prevent theft unless there is collusion. Because the factors involved are directly related to the methods used by the owner to communicate authority and responsibility as well as those methods used in supervising the control syst em,[5, p. 53] the cont rol environment is almost totally dependent on the owner in a small business. C ontrols can generally be overridden easily. If the owner is not familiar with business practices, including managerial a nd accounting skills, then expert help should be utilized. A strong ethical background would cover some of th ese factors and help maintain control. Accounting System Included in this element are manuals, a chart of accounts, a double-entry system of bookkeeping, and accounting controls. One of the factors in this element that is of pa ramount importance is creating an audit trail. Written manuals with detailed procedures, and policies, and instructions are a recommended control. However, due to lack of funds, the small number of employees, and the day to day involvement of the owner, these manuals can be done on a more general basis. All accounti ng systems should carefully prepare a chart of accounts that is the skeleton for the accounting system. The use of control accoun ts (with subsidiary ledgers) where nece ssary will also aid in control. The double-entry system should produce a balanced set of records a nd statements so that any irregularity, whether error or fraud, re quires omission from accounts on both sides of the transactions. An audit trail exists if an y financial total in the general ledger can be supported by evidence from the various transactions involved. In other words, all amounts need to be traceable both to the source and to the financial statements. Control Procedures Control procedures are directly interw oven into the control environment and the accounting system. Specific controls necessary for the small busine ss are things such as periodic bank reconcil iations, checking the totals in the control accounts against the subsidiary ledgers , physically counting the inventory on a periodic basis, a nd comparing budgeted and actual results. Prenumbe red documents make physical control over documents simpler. Investigating missing documents also provides a control over recording of transactions. The control procedures that apply to sm all businesses can be grouped into four categories - keeping records, duties of employees, securing assets, and respons ibility of employees. [7.pp. 49-55] Cont rol procedures are found in both the previously discussed elements of the inte rnal control structure. However, for th e small business, the procedures related to employee actions and th eir effect in safeguarding assets take on more importance since the owner is almost totally responsible for the environment and to some degree the ac counting system. Controls for keeping records provide checks on the handling of transactions and assets by employees. If possible, the use of different employees for record keeping and custody of th e respective assets is beneficial. When assigning duties in a small business, the owner should attempt to provide checks by delegating duties to one employee that will check the activities of another. Utilizing the owner to author ize special transactions as well as any checks from an external source, such as giving customers sales receip ts so they can check the salesperson's actions will increase control. Using security devices is one way to se cure assets. Locating some assets off premises (marketable securities in a lockbox) provides some protection. Depositi ng all receipts directly in the bank and using checks to pay bills instead of cash makes it more difficult for an employee to misappropriate funds. When it is necessary for employees to have custody of assets, one control is to give responsibility for an asset to a single employee. Problems can then be easily traced to the source. The owner's personal involvement in all f acets of the business on a daily basis lead to the necessity for what might be called entrepreneurial controls. These relate directly to the owner's knowledge and participation in the business. ENTREPRENEURIAL CONTROLS The entrepreneurial controls that are most likely to be valuable are: * Using the accounting information effectively in both budgeting and day-to-day mana ging of the business. * Explaining any discrepancies in acc ounting information and expectations based on knowledge of the business. * Relying on exception reports (unusual items). * Using part-tim e employees if necessary to help when segregation of duties is important * Personally approvi ng certain transactions before or when payment is made.[2, P. 65] An owner who lacks the sk ills to be involved in such a manner may hire an expert to help out, place such an individual on the board of directors, ask an independent auditor to revi ew, analyze, and interpret reported results, or expand his skills in these areas with continuing education courses. Pe rsonal observation can make the owner aware of cash flows, sales and receipt of goods, production, employee activities, etc. The use of personal observation can effectively increase the owner's internal control in the business. SUMMARY Developing a system of internal control in a small business will be met with severe limitations. The key to the first element of the internal control structur e, control environment, is the owner's personal involvement and capability as a business person. The second and third elements, accounting sy stems and control procedures include some specific controls and procedures that deal more with se paratin g duties of a few em ployees so that record kee ping and custod y of related assets are handled by separate individuals. The lack of financial resources or, if resources exist, the desire on the pa rt of the owner to spend the money elsewhere (e. g., to increase sales, expand manufactu ring, etc. ) creates another limitation. Even if the owne r is willing to develop a perfect system, it will probabl y not be cost be neficial. Entrepreneurial controls and the use of control procedures throughout the organization will increase the internal control structure. REFERENCES [1] Bodnar, George H. and William S. Hopwood.

PAYROLL TAX WITHHOLDINGS: A POTENTIAL CASH FLOW PITFALL Daryl V. Burckel, Mississippi State University Bruce Swindle, McNeese State University ABSTRACT The small business owner/manage r must be alert to the potential hazard of failing to pay federa l employee withholding taxes. As if the pressures of handling cash flow, creditors, customers, empl oyees, suppliers, were not enough, there is the 100 percent penalty for failure to pay taxes. Divert ing cash from employee withholding taxes to pay suppliers, creditors, etc. may appear to be \"top priority\", but the IRS will not take a back seat. S hould the company fail to remit the withheld taxes, the IRS will go directly to the responsible party for payment. Small business owner/managers must inco rporate into their thinking three points regarding federal income tax withheld from employees: 1. A 100 percent penalty may be imposed if the funds are not paid to the IRS. Any person will be liable if: 2. The failure to collect funds or the diverting of funds was willful, and 3. The individual was a responsible party during the reporting period. The individual owner-manager or others may be held personally liable for the penalty. INTRODUCTION Kenneth Eversole was the sole owner of Health Resources Development Corporation, which owned 75 percent of the outstanding shares of Health Resource s, a corporation which managed nursing homes. Eversole was Chairman of the Board of Heath Resources. After filing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the Internal Reve nue Service notified him that he was personally liable for the payment of withheld payroll taxes th at Health Resources failed to pay. Eversole argued that he was merely chairman of the board and not involved in the daily activities of the fi rm. He also contended that he was not aware that the withheld taxe s were delinquent, nor was he responsible for collecting a nd paying the taxes. The IRS countered that Eversole was informed of the corporation' s financial condition, and that his contention that he had no knowledge of the tax delinquency was unsupported by the evidence (6). This case crystalizes the issue of the potential personal liability that may be transferred from the firm to the individual for withheld employee taxes by the IRS. For small businesses, it may be easy to fall into the trap of diverting money (withheld from employee's paychecks) destined for the Internal Re venue Service (IRS) to the payment of seem ingly more pressing li ability claims. In businesses where the number of employees is small, remission of income tax withholdings to the IRS is generally required only monthly or quarterly. Obvi ously, the actual payment of funds withheld can occur weeks after the employee was paid wages. Over the four or thirteen w eek period, cash not paid the em ployee (but withheld) can be utilized for other liability payments. Bu t beware, this \"diversion\" of withheld funds can leave the small business with inadequate funds to pay the IRS on the remission date. CASH MANAGEMENT The owner or manager of a small busi ness is responsible for managing and m onitoring all aspects of the business' performance. Challenges and problems conti nuously press from many directions. Cash is a four letter word that often becomes a curse for small businesses. Lack of cash has driven many small businesses into bankruptcy and no doubt many more will fall prey to neglecting cash management. T hus, businesses must be concerned with (1) the generation of timely, accurate cash flow information, and (2) the prope r management of cash flow. The cash flow challenges are likely more severe for smaller businesse s due to larger businesses' greater accessi bility to more diverse sources of cash. In attempting to meet the business's needs, owners and ma nagers must be alert to a cash-flow-related pitfall of potentially devastating consequences. Wh ile effectively managing cash flow is only one of the many challenges facing small businesses, this potential pitfall is one which ma y easil y esca pe even careful attention. This pitfall, while not new, concerns federal employer withhol ding taxes. Generating funds to pay over past-due amounts to the IRS may be only half the problem. The person responsible for paying out th ese withheld funds to the IRS may be subject to a 100% penalty. 100 PERCENT PENALTY Internal Revenue Code Section 6672 states: Any person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to collect such tax, or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or th e payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable for a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded, or not collected, or not accounted for and paid over. The purpose of Code Section 6672 is to encourage the prompt payment of withheld, and othe r collected taxes, and to insure ultimate collection of such taxes from a secondary source in any event. Th e statute does not apply to direct taxes such as the employer's portion of FICA or FU TA taxes. The penalty is imposed if the willfulness of a responsible party can be determin ed. If a business has willfully failed to pay collected excise taxes, the 100% pe nalty may be asserted against responsible officers and employees of the company. This includes volunteer members of boards of trus tees of organizations whenever such taxes cannot be immediately collected from the company itself. When th e person responsible for withholding, collecting and paying taxes cannot otherwise be determined, the service has viewed the president, secretary, and the treasurer of the corporation as responsible officers. WILLFULNESS An important question in dete rmining whether the 100 percent penalty is imposed is willfulness. Code Section 6672 requires that the failure to collect, account for, and pay the ta xes must be \"willful.\" The st andard of willfulness applied by the courts does not embrace any bad motive or evil intent on the part of the responsible party. Rather, all that must be shown is that the act was voluntary, cons cious, and intentional. All that is nece ssary is that the responsible party was aware of the outstanding taxes and knowingly and intentionally used them to pay operating expenses or other debts of the business. Liability may be shared with others. Most courts reject the contenti on that reasonable cause or justifiable excuse plays a part in determining whether th e responsible party's act ions are willful. In Malone vs. U.S. (9), a chairman's failure to turn the wi thheld taxes over to the IRS was found to be willful. Malone presented insufficient evidence to dem onstrate that he possessed neither the power to control decision making nor the ultimate authority within the corpor ation. After he was notified of the co rporation's withholding tax delinquency, Malone, the chairman of the corporation, continued to write checks to other creditors and suppliers. Additionally, a person who, because of his position in the bus iness, could know and should know of the failure to remit the withheld taxes, is not relieved of the responsibility to know. Lack of knowledge, by intent or by neglect, is not an excuse. A failure to inquire about nonpa yment constitutes a reckless disregard of the significance of known facts sufficient to satisfy what is known as the \"state of mind\" requirement. RESPONSIBLE PARTY Another important aspect of Code Sect ion 6672 is that the penalty will be as sessed against the person responsible for paying over the withheld taxes. Recently the Sixth Circui t court has suggested that: the sp ecific factual inquiry in such cases is directed towards determining (1) the duties of the officer as outlined by th e corporate by-laws, (2) the ability of the person charged to sign checks on the corporation, (3) the id entity of the officer s, directors and shareholders of the corporation, (4) the identity of the pe rson who hired and fired employees and (5 ) the identity of the individuals who were in control of the financ ial affairs of the corporation. However, such a checklist analysis is not determinative. The Court goes on to point out: More than one person can be a res ponsible officer of a cor poration. Essentiall y, liabilit y is predicated u pon the existence of significant, as opposed to absolute, control of th e corporation's finances ... It is basically a factual inquiry. Generally, such a person is one \"with ultimate authority over e xpenditure of funds since such a person can fairly be said to be responsible for the corporation's failure to pay over its ta xes, \" or more explicitl y, one who has \"Authority to direct payment of creditors.\" Responsibility for purposes of section 6672 is a matter of status, duty, and authority.... It is not necessary that an individual have the final word as to wh ich creditors should be paid in order to be subject to liability under this section. Rather, it is sufficient that th e person have significant control over the disbursement of funds. For example, E.A. Cella (3), the treasurer of a bankrupt corporation, was personally liable to the government for withheld taxes that were diverted to pa y other creditors. The treasurer breached his duty to hold such collected taxes in trust until they were paid to the government. Although the treasurer could not sign checks in excess of $1,000 without the signature of another officer, such a limitation on his authority did not protect him from liability as the person responsible for payment of taxes. In another case (1), the taxpayer was not a responsible person during the entire qua rter in which the corporation failed to pay withheld taxes, but he had become a responsible person by the end of the quarter and, therefore, where he preferred creditors (willfulness) over the government when the corporation had sufficient funds at the end of the quarter to pay the taxes, he was liable for the unpaid taxes for the entire quarter. It is also possible to be considered as a responsible person for the trust fund debt of a purchased corporation as seen in a current case. In McCorvey vs. United States (8), Brian McCorv ey acquired the assets of At lanta Tape & Video, Inc. , in October 1984. As president, he had signature authority on corporate accounts and was in charge of day-to-day operations. He signed most of the cor poration's checks and was responsible for collecting, accounting for, and paying over withholding taxes. Prior to McCorvey's a ssumption of control, the company accrued $7,552 in unpaid withholding liabilities. During McCorvey's tenure, Atlanta Tape incurred $14,310 in withholding tax liability and paid more than $14,310 to the government. Ho wever, McCorvey did not de signate how to apply the payments, so the IRS first applied the payments to the pr evious unpaid liability. The IRS assessed responsible person penalties against McCorvey. He filed for bankruptcy a nd sued for a determinati on of his tax liability. Bankruptcy Judge Cotton held McCorvey li able for the penalties. Although the court did not list any factors which showed willfulness, it dismissed as \"without merit\" McCorvey's argument that because Atlanta Tape paid all the withholding liabilities that accrued duri ng McCorvey's tenure that his failure to pay could not be characterized as willful. UNRELATED PARTY PENALTY Furthermore, the 100% penalty may be asse rted against an unrelated party, such as a bank, surety, or other third party who has assumed control over the taxpaye r's business and financial affairs. In Clouse vs. U. S. (2), a stockholder and principal creditor of a corporation who was full y involved in the operations o f the corporation and who had knowledge of its precarious financial condition wa s found to be a responsible person and thus, was held personally liable for unpa id withholding taxes. Clouse was one of the three original corporation's directors, officers and shareholders of Octra Inc. (5). Du ring the period involved, Clouse wa s authorized to sign checks on behalf of Octra, Inc. and in fact ex ercised that authority. He also had the authority to hire and fire employees. Clouse was also involved in the determin ation of which creditors should be pai d. He prepared creditor's lists and took part in determining priorities of payment. Based on these facts the court he ld that Clouse was a person responsible for collecting, accounting for truthfully or pa ying over to the United States the withheld income and social security taxes for Octra, Inc. Clouse was willful throughout the period involved because he was aware that the payroll taxes were unpaid and he preferred other creditors over the United States. He signed checks made payable to other creditors to keep Octra operating and even preferred himself by taki ng rent, salary, and loan repayments rather than paying the United States. Thus, Clouse was held liable for the 100 percent penalty for the failure to pay some $27,000 in withholding taxes for the first and second quarters of 1980. BANKRUPTCY Even when a corporation or company goes into bankruptc y, a tax assessment against a responsible person is not discharged under Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act. In Osborn vs, U.S. (7), A sole shareholder and managing officer of a corporation willfully failed to pay over withholding taxes, and his debt was not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Ho wever, his wife was not shown to have acted willf ully, and her indebtedness was dischargeable. Also in Cergua vs. U.S. (11) the taxpaye r failed to prove that he was not, as a corporate officer, guilty of willfully failing to pay the taxes that were withheld from the corpor ation's employees. As this inde btedness is not dischargeable in bankruptcy, the taxpayer was lia ble for the unpaid taxes. The liability imposed on th e responsible person for the coll ection and payment of withholdi ng taxes is in the nature of transferee liability and it is not a penalty despite the use of that word in Code Section 6672. Thus, a bankrupt individual may not receive a discharge in bankruptcy under 523 of the new bankruptcy act (4). An adjudication of bankruptcy did not di scharge the debtor's liability to pay taxes withheld from employees of his corporation and he remained li able for his failure to do so. Congress's spec ific intent in this situation overrides the overall policy of the Bankruptcy Act of giving a debtor a fresh start. Nor do es it matter that the tax law denominates such liability a \"penalty\" -- the funds were \"taxes\" at the tim e they were collected or withhe ld from others and this is the time period to which the Bankruptcy Act pertains (10). CONCLUSION The small business owner/manage r must be alert to the potential hazard of failing to pay federa l employee withholding taxes. As if the pressures of handling cash flow, creditors, customers, empl oyees, suppliers, were not enough, there is the 100 percent penalty for failure to pay taxes. Divert ing cash from employee withholding taxes to pay suppliers, creditors, etc., may appear to be \"top pr iority\", but the IRS will not take a back seat. Should the company fail to remit the withheld taxes, the IRS will go directly to the responsible party for payment. Small business owner/managers must inco rporate into their thinking three points regarding federal income tax withheld from employees: 1. A 100 percent penalty may be imposed if the funds are not paid to the IRS. Any person will be liable if: 2. The failure to collect funds or the diverting of funds was willful, and 3. The individual was a responsible party during the reporti ng period. The individual owner-manager or others may be held personally liable for the penalty. The key is the willfulness of a responsible party. If cash-flow problems temp t the responsible party to refuse to pay taxes while the choice is made to pay other creditors, then that person may find such decisions costly in the future.

AN MIS MODEL FOR PREPARATION OF AN OPERATING BUDGET FOR SMALL BUSINESS William L. Boyd, Western Carolina University Gary A. Will iams, Western Carolina University ABSTRACT The environment of small business has changed dramatically over the last de cade. Stronger competition, higher levels of business failure, greater government re gulation, etc., have all added to the diff iculty of survival. A major component of survival and success is a good operati ng budget. This paper builds a basic mode l for the preparation of an operating budget for small business using the concept of MIS. The resources for this inform ation revolve around possible computer power on hand or available. Th e model incorporates procedures which provide tools and encourage the small business owner/operator to make hard inte lligent decisions. The ultimate goal is en suring their survival and prosperity. INTRODUCTION How has the decision-making environment for small busines s owners and managers changed over the past decade? Among a host of other considerations -- greater competition, higher levels of business failure, greater government regulation, etc.--perhaps the change with the greatest impact has been the envir onment for decision making. The environment for decision making has come to include in the past decade resources such as the microcomputer and all the power it gives to the decision ma ker. Because of the conti nuing decline in the cost of hardware and software, even the smallest business now has, or soon will have, access to the power the small computer can provide. This means that information for decision making, for so long difficult and expensive (if not impossible) to obtain for the small business owner/manager, can be availa ble to those who wish to use it. Through the power of microcom puter-oriented management information syst em software, alternative scenarios can easily be defined and alternative potential outcomes evalua ted. Furthermore, with the mi crocomputer as a component of an ongoing management information sy stem for the small business, it is possible to take operating data which already exists in the organization's data base and convert it easily into useful information for decision making in, for example, budget preparation. One of the most critical and poorly mana ged activities in small business continue s to be preparation and administration of the operating budget. No single tool could be more help ful in making tough decisions co ncerning resource allocation than the operating budget, provide d it is prepared in a systematic and rati onal manner. The purpose of this paper is to build a basic model for the preparation of an operating budget for small business using the information resources and computer power available. Incorporated in this model are tools and procedures wh ich encourage owner/operators to make the hard and intelligent decisions needed to ensure the survival of their businesses. The primary goal of the model is to us e the management information available to small business owner/managers in a systematic manner to keep them informed about the curren t status of the organization, to make appropriate operating and strategic decisions, and to understand the implications of these decisions. It incorporates information from the operating and transaction levels of the small business into the budget-making process and makes that information the basis for the strategic budget planning that must occur. In one sense, this might be considered to be a bottom-up budgeting process; in reality, it also involves input from manage rs throughout the organization as well as the owner/operator. The model employs several of the techniques used in a zero-based budgeting approach. A.E. Buck stated in the early 1930's that a good budget process is one which goes throu gh formulation, determinati on, and execution.[2] This concept is still true today, whethe r we call the process incremental budge ting, planning programming and budgeting, or zero-base budgeting. A properly designed budget becomes a component of the co mpany's management information system since it serves not onl y as a resource alloca tion tool but also as a tool for makin g informed decisions. The model presented here fulfills the goals of such a system. It also incorporat es the lower-level management and staff of the company into the budget making process and requires participation and input on al l levels so that budgeting decisions for the organization take into consideration the activities the organizat ion judges critical for its success. THE BASIC MODEL Most small business owner/operators have organized thei r businesses in a fairly traditional way. The organization typically includes the owner and/ or president at the top of the company char t with the subordinate areas of the company being divided by function, process, or activity. The depth or breadth of the organization depends on the size of the company and the philosophy of top manage ment. Since few businesses will be stru ctured exactly alike, the model is designed with flexibility so it can be adapted to almost any organizational structur e. The basic model for the development of an MIS-oriented opera ting budget is presented in Figure 1. Step One The first step in the process is to de termine the functional areas of the small business. Some examples of possible functional areas include marketing, production, administration, and finance. This functional breakdown should probably follow the organizational structure or th e formal lines of comm unication in the firm. This step seems at first to be a simple one; in reality, it c ould be the most difficult. If the organization chart is outdated or otherwise incorrect, the managers a nd budget preparers will need to spend time in introspection and evaluation to determine the various functions and how they are related. Furthermore, many small busines ses don't have well-defined hierarchies; at the least, the reporti ng relationships may not be documented. Figure 1 MODEL FOR PREPARATION OF a ZERO-BASE BUDGET 1. Determine functional areas in the organization 2. Set up activities within each functi onal area and evaluate the alternatives 3. Design and prepare alternative decisi on packages 4. Submit decision packages up through the management hierarchy 5. Rank all requested expenditures 6. Prepare from ranked priorities the \"FINAL BUDGET DOCUMENT\" In this case, a well-defined ma nagement information system can help the ma nagers define the de facto organizational structure, since it is likely that the MIS is organized in such a way as to represent the stru cture of the organization as it actually exists. Step Two Once the functional areas are determined, the next step is to divide each area into cost categories. For example the functional area of production coul d be divided into the categories of material s cost, labor cost, fixed overhead cost, and variable overhead cost. Once again, a well-designed MIS will provide the budgeter with appropriate categories as well as the requisite data to develop the budget since the MIS should have been designed to provide feedback about the critical categories within each functional area. In some situations it may be nece ssary to further subdivide each category into sub-groups; labor costs might be br oken into activities such as machin e operators, maintenance personnel, and management, for instance. Alternatively, the compa ny could also be divided into departments or product lines and then be subdivided into activities within each department or pr oduct line. If the MIS has been designe d to include the standards for a cost accounting system, this task should be fairly simple; once agai n, the segregation of activities- -as well as historical data about their respective costs--will ha ve been designed into the MIS. The defined activities within each identified functional ar ea or department should be fairly uniform across the functional areas or departments. The need to be able to co mpare and rank activities dictat es this need for uniformity. The managers of all functional areas should use the same criteria, where possi ble, for measures of cost and performance so that, when ste p three is be gun, com parable activit y packages can be develo ped. Total uniformit y is not a com plete necessity but comparability whenever possi ble is a requirement of the model. Following the identification of the activity areas the managers are then ready to perform step three. Step Three Each activity should have a decision pack age designed and prepared for it. This package should define the activity in question, list the functions and goals of the activity, and list cost component s for funding. Where possible, it should also list the benefits to be derived, show criteria for measuring performance, and list alternative courses of action. The need for the decision package to be concise and at the same time to cont ain extensive amounts of data will cause problems in design. The packages should also have some de gree of uniformity throughout the entire organization, and this will further complicate its design. A great deal of ti me and input from all levels within the company will be required to determine what type of inst rument will best suit each individua l company. Sample decision packages may be found from several sources, some of which are listed at the close of this paper. Each activity should have a minimum of three decision pa ckages prepared for it. One should be at a significantly reduced level of spending, one near the current level, and one at an optim um or desired level. Each package should discuss the implications of adopting that particular proposal. Quantitative and subjective methods should be used to show ramifications of increases or de creases in the current budgeted amounts. Once again, the MIS can be a big help since decision support models, pa rticularly those developed with spreadshee t software will enable managers to use \"what if\" analysis to evaluate the implications of funding decisions. The key to the success of the model is th at all expenditures must be justified in each decision package. These packages should be prepared by the department head or supervisor of the activity and forwarded to the next higher administrator with one of the three packages selected as the re commended level of operation. For example the maintenance department head will forward his pack ages to the next higher administrator who might be the production supervisor. Step Four The second level managers will then combin e all activities under their jurisdiction and prepare a list of these packages along with their recommendations for approval and disappr oval. Continuing the previ ous example, the production supervisor will discuss his decisi ons with his subordinate department heads and ask for their input and recommendations for ranking the packages of that function or activity. He then will prepare a master list and forward his recommended decision packages, along with those not reco mmended, to the next higher level in the company. In the typical small business, this process ma y be repeated only twice, since the organi zation chart is likely to be shallow. However, this process should continue through each layer of mana gement until the top level is reached. The same process of consulting and preparing a reco mmended list for approval is used. The final lists are then forwarded to a company-wide ranking committee for their consideration. Whatever the company size, the iterations are repeated until the process reaches the ranking committee. Step Five The ranking process is very im portant since funds are always limited and capital must be rationed. Each project or decision package will have supporters a nd staff members who consider it to be of primary importa nce. The committee of top level administrators will discus s the strategic priorities of the company and then determine which requested activities should have the funding priority. In the typical small business, this committee may consist of only the ow ner/manager and one or tw o principal subordinates. The ranked list of budget items should then be funded until availa ble funds are depleted. Having the packag es developed in a spreadsheet will make this process easier, since the major task is to co mbine and reorder the input from the approved packages. By using a rational ranking process, the admi nistration is encouraged to make diffic ult but necessary decisions that support the goals that have been defined for the organization. Each decision is made with the overall company operation and strategic plan in mind and with full information of alternative and competin g budget requests. Once again, the MIS can play a hel pful role in allowin g the decision makers to relate the goals and strate gic plans of the or ganization to the supporting activities. If the process is pe rformed rationally, the result will be that all activities critical to the success o f the organization will be funded. Step Six The last step in the budget process is to prepare the fina l budget document. Using the previously completed ranked list, the budget preparers can fairly quickly develop the final budget in a spreadshee t. If the MIS of the company is complete enough to provide output required in previous steps of the model, the da ta has already been made available. Simply reorganizing this already-availabl e information is all that is required. If the ranked list completed in step five includes all the activities deemed critical to the mission of the firm, the budgeting process is complete. ROLE OF MIS SOFTWARE IN DEVELOPING THE MODEL In developing an operating budget using this model, va rious components of an opera tions and decision-support- oriented management inform ation system are used. The following para graphs summarize th ese contributions. In Step One, identifying the functional areas of the small business, a well-designe d computerized operations information system (transactions processi ng system) can provide insight into the primary organizationa l structure of the firm, even if the structure is not formal ized. In fact, since the structure of th e OIS must almost by necessity mimic the true organizational design of the firm, it may be the most logical place to look. In Step Two, functionalizing by cost category, the well-designed OIS can once ag ain provide needed insight into the process of defining activities as well as supporting the mode l with the necessary historical data from the firm. The addition of a spreadsheet application such as Lotus 1-2-30 or Quattro can then help to organize the data for later analysis. In Step Three, the spreadsheet developed in step two can be used to design the activity package. With an integrated MIS which includes word processing soft ware, the design of the \"standard\" decision package can be made easy. Also, it is possible to provide a model of the designed package to all the users of the budgeting model in order to have uniformity. The packages developed by the individuals responsib le for functions or activities can then be integrated into one document as later steps are performed. In Step Four, once again appropriate modeling software, such as forecasting, decision trees and simulation as well as inexpensive statistical package, such as PCStatistics can be used to quantitatively evaluate scenarios and to determine potential outcomes given one or another funding level. In addition, depending on the software pa ckages available, it may also be possible to evaluate potential risk to the firm when reduced levels of spending are recommended. In Step Five of the model, the analys is of the different funding scenarios created in steps three and four will help determine the assigned ranks. The evaluations that have be en made by the decision suppor t models will assist the ranking committee to evaluate impact of differen t funding levels and activities on the firm. Finally, the budget document can be prepared using both the spreadsheet analyses described above and word processing software and model used for the activity package. The process of developing an operating budget can, thus, be made much simpler through the use of data, software, and models that the small busines s already has available. SUMMARY The process presented here will require a good deal of additional effort, traini ng and possible retooling, during the first year of implementation. However, the increased information generated, the part icipation and input from all levels of the company, and the systematic evaluation of alternatives should make the process worth that effort. In subsequent years of application, the process should be more easily applied and could be further refined to meet the unique needs of a particular firm. In particular, the implem entation of such a plan in c onjunction with a functional manage ment information system will, in the long run, permit the owner/ma nagers of small businesses to make informed and well-supported budgeting decisions which will be in the best inte rest of the company. If such a manageme nt information system includes a direct link with the organization's transaction processing system, historical data can easily be available for decision support activities such as budget preparation and used in conjunc tion with forecasting and pla nning models to develop the activity packages required for this process. From the model presented here, an inte rested administrator should be able to prototype a system relevant to his particular situation. If the recommended process is not fully adopted, perhaps the model will at least bring to light the glaring need for a cohesive and integrated effort in allocating the scarce resources of an organization in the decade of the 90's.

HOW BENEFICIAL IS THE SBA LOAN PROGRAM? A SURVEY OF BORROWERS Dennis H. Tootelian, California State University, Sacramento Dale D. Plet cher, California State University, Sacramento ABSTRACT The Small Business Administration has be en the subject of considerable c ontroversy during the 1980s. Supporters believe this federal agency is important to the survival and growth of the entrepreneurial spirit. Critics argue that the SBA is overly costly, bureaucratic, and ultimately provides little benefit to the American economy. The focus of this study was to examine the growth trends in firms with SB A guaranteed loans and owner perceptions of the value of those loans to their firms' survival and prosperity. Findings s how that these firms significan tly grew in terms of sales, profits, taxes paid, and numbers of fu ll and part-time employees. Furthermor e, borrowers thought their loans were important to their success, and we re very satisfied with the lending process and loan administration. INTRODUCTION The Small Business Administration (SBA) wa s established in 1953 to aid, counsel, assist, and protect the interests of small- business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise.(l) Over the years, this federal agency has been quite active in areas of guaranteeing lo ans to small and minority businesses, assisting firms in obtaining government contracts, and providing t echnical management assistan ce. For example, in 1988, the SBA guaranteed loans worth approximately $2.8 billion, generated procur ement contracts in excess of $358 milli on for smaller firms, distributed or sold more than three million publicati ons, and provided manage ment training/counseling to over 500,000 individuals. (2) Over the years, too, the SBA has had its share of supporte rs and critics. Proponents believ e the agency has facilitated the growth and survival of small busines s the cornerstone of the American \"free enterprise\" system. From its inception, it was argued that the creation and su pport of the SBA would help small busin ess compete with big business.(3) Critics cite costs of administration, sm all business failure rates, and excessive bureaucracy as evidence that the SBA does not serve a useful purpose.(4) During the 1980s it was wi dely reported that the Reag an Administration strongly considered eliminating the SB A as a federal agency. A number of articles have be en written about the SBA and its programs. Focusing on its lending program, some tended to be descriptive in nature, while others analyzed repaymen t issues.(5,6) Many articles also have examined SBA management counseling programs. (7) While some studies have identified defi ciencies in portions of th e SBA's programs, the genera l consensus has been that the agency provides a useful service. Unfortunately, a central issue raised by critics of th e SBA has not been adequately addressed: Do firms that are recipients of SBA services contribut e economically to the public good in terms of sales, profits, taxes paid, and employment? A preliminary study of recipients of SBA-guaranteed loans completed by th e researchers focused on, among other issues, this central question. Findings fr om that unpublished report recei ved considerable attention from sources such as The Wall Street Journal, Forb es, and local newspapers.(8) However, that data was limited by the fact that survey participants came from only one lender source. How representative those findi ngs were to SBA borrowers nationwide could not be determined. The purposes of the study reported here were to assess, on a national basis, two broad issues. The first was borrower growth rates in sales, profits, taxe s paid, and employment. From this, some evaluation could be made of the contributions of loan r ecipients to society. A major focus was direct ed toward appraising quantitatively the economic benefits derived from the SBA guaranteed loans with res pect to such factors as revenue generation, wa ges paid, taxes paid, and numbers of people employed. The second issue was borrower perceptions of the importance of SBA loans to th eir firms' success, satisfaction with their lenders and the loan process, and the value of SB A counseling services. Factors of concern here were how important the SBA loan was to the firm's survival and su ccess, whether the SBA helps borrowers who would otherwise be ignored, and whether it provides usef ul support services to businesses. Caus e-effect relationships between lending and firm growth were impossible to determine due to th e many extraneous variables that could impact success. Accordingly, percep tions were considered a us eful surrogate measure. Additionally, comparisons between the growth statistics of this population and national averages for all businesses were made. Within the scope of this study, direct comparisons to a control\" group of nonborrowers that precisely matched the characteristics of the bor rower group was not possible. However, comparisons to the national averages provided some insights into ove rall performance measures. METHODOLOGY The population for the study was defined to be recipients of SBA guaranteed loans from members of the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders. These financing institutions had outstandi ng loans to a total of 1,071 firms, distributed throughout the United States. Be cause of the importance of the study, it was decided to include al l of these borrowers in the survey. The preliminary survey of one lender's borrowers contained 843 firms. Because loan recipients were geographically dispersed, and due to the length of the questionnaire, a mail survey was considered the most appropriate method for data collection. The questionnaire for th is survey was the sa me as that used in the preliminary study. Two forms were developed to accommodate firms th at had more recent and more long- standing loans. Firms that had SBA guaranteed loans prio r to 1986 loan survey group was asked to provide selected financial information over a two year span, while those that had post-1986 loans were asked to provide financial information for a one year span. Both forms of th e questionnaire were alike in all other respects. Respondents were asked questions pertaining to the character istics of their businesses, in cluding type of business (e.g. retail, service), form of ownership (e.g. so le proprietorship, partners hip), length of time in business, and whether it was woman and/or minority owned. They also were asked questions about their SB A guaranteed loans: the primary purpose of the loan (e.g. business start-up, growth/expansion), the amount, when it had been approved, satisfaction with the loan application process and its ad ministration, and the use of SBA suppor t programs (e.g. SCORE counseling). To assess the economic impact of the SBA program, questions were included pertaining to dollar sales, expenses, profits, taxes, and the number of full and part-time employees for different time periods to ev aluate the growth in those variables. Finally, there were questions regarding borrower perception of the importance of the SBA loan program in generating sales, profit ability, and overall success of the business. RESULTS From a mailing to 1,071 borrowers, a total of 350 usable que stionnaires were returned, providing a response rate of 32.7%. Chi-square and difference of means tests were then conducted to see if the respondents and responses to this survey were different from those of the preliminary study. Since no differen ces were found, and the questionnaires were exactly the same, the responses from the two studies were merged. This provided a total of 605 responses. Respondent Characteristics As shown in Table 1, the single largest group of responding fi rms were retail businesses ( 34.0%). Professional services and general services comprised 27.1% and 16.9% of the sample respectively. The single most common form of ownership was corporate (46.8%), with sole proprietorships being the second largest 30.5%. About 71% of the responding firms had been in business for five or more years. Business ownership was nearly e qually divided between males (50.6% ) and females (49.4% ), and 21.0% of the res pondin g firms were at least partly minority owned. Loan Characteristics As shown in Table 2, 70.0% of the res pondents had prior experience seeking loans of various types. With respect to their SBA loans, the single largest group ( 30.1%) had them for five or more years, and 52.7% had loans for at least four years. The main purposes of the loans were for real estate purchases (35.4%) and business start-up (23.7%). The amounts of the loans ranged from under $50,000 to over $450,000, with the largest group (37.1%) being loans from $100,000 to $250,000. For the majority of respondents (50.2%), the SBA loan accounted for 75% or more of their total debt, and only 14.4% indicated that their loans accounted for less than 25% of their total debt. Economic Performance Indicators Growths in sales, profit, labor expens es, taxes paid, and number of employees are shown in Table 3. Average annual growth rates for pre- and post- 1986 loan recipients were computed for each economic category. As is evident, all of these economic variables showed posi tive growth rates. While sales rose 14.9%, profits grew at a much more rapid pace (28.2%). Federal taxes paid also incr ease faster than sales, although state taxes paid rose more slowly. With respect to employment, the number of full-time empl oyees grew at an annual rate of 16.8%. The very large increase in part-time employment was due to a few firms that increased thei r employment radically during the time period studied. Even when these were eliminated, growth in part-time personnel was appr oximately 18.0% per year. Borrower Perceptions Of The Im portance Of Their SBA Loans Respondent perceptions of the extent to which their SBA loan s helped them generate sale s and profits and contributed to their overall success are shown in Tabl e 4. The majority (59.4%) felt that their loans were either somewhat or very important to their firms' abilities to generate sales. Only 16.0% felt it was of no importance. Similarly, 61.4% felt the loan helped generate profit, while 13.1% thought it was of no importance. As an overall measure, 61.2% of the respondents indicated th at their loans were somewhat to very important to their success. Only 11.6% stated that the loan was not at all importa nt. The value of this is sup ported by the fact that nearly 30% of the respondents felt that they would not have been able to go into business if it had not been for the SBA loan guarantee program. Satisfaction With SBA Programs Respondent likes and dislikes concerning the SBA's loan and counseling programs are presented in Tabl es 5 and 6 respectively. What borrowers liked most about the loan program were the availabili ty of funds (29.4%) and the help ful and professional manner in whic h they were treated (18.9% and 17.5% respectively). What they disliked most were the inte rest rate structure (21.3%), pa perwork (18.0%), and the loan requirements (16.3%). Despite some dislikes, 80.2% indicated that they were somewhat to very satisfied with the loan application process, and 81.9% were satisfied with the manner in which their loans were being administered. Only 10.4% were somewhat to very dissatisfied with the application process, and 9.3% we re dissatisfied with the loan administration. Reflecting their overall satisfaction, 85.0% indicated that they would choose the SBA loan program again if the need arose. Just under 14.0% of the respondents indicat ed that they have utilized support SB A programs (see Table 6). Most of those were counseling by the Service Corp Of Retired Ex ecutives (SCORE), Small Bu siness Development Centers (SBDC), Small Business Institute Counse ling (SBI), and/or pre-business works hops. Of those who utilized support programs, 64.8% were either somewhat or ver y satisfied. The ma jority of those who were e ither somewhat or ver y dissatisfied were users of the SCORE program. Finally, comparisons were made of the growth statistics with national averages. Nationa l average data was obtained from Current Business Reports published by the U.S. Depart ment of Commerce. The comparative data is shown in Table 7. As is evident, when divisions are made between types of business activity, these survey firms exhibited considerably higher growth rate s. It is important to recognize, however, that some of that difference would be due to the smaller base of the borrowe r firms. However, the differen ces were still considerable. CONCLUSIONS It appears that recipients of SBA guaranteed loans have experienced significan t growth in terms of sales, profits, taxes paid, and employment. This growth, in turn, resulted in signi ficant increases in taxes paid and employment of full- and part-time employees. Accordingly, these firms are making substantial economic contributions in return for the government-supplied resources they are using. While businesses such as these do not individually make much of an impact on overall GNP output, they provide a signifi cant contribution when c onsidered collectively. While it cannot be stated with certainty that the SBA lending program was the prima ry cause of their economic performance, the great majority of respondents felt that the loans they receiv ed were important to their firms' growths in sales and profits. They also believe d that their loans were important to th e overall success their firms have had. With respect to criticisms concerning the administration of SBA programs, the vast majority of respondents were at least somewhat satisfied w ith the manner in which their loans were processed and administered. While the support programs were not used to the extent that they could be, respondents who did so were quite satisfied with them. Overall, from this study of r ecipients of guaranteed loans, there appeared to be ample eviden ce that SBA programs make genuine contributions to the economy and society. Its pr ograms were well received a nd appeared to be managed in a satisfactory manner. No support was found for the criticisms that have been made of the SBA.

Cummings , Eastern Washington University ABSTRACT The competitive environment th at will face small businesses in the 90's will be an increasingly global market with fierce foreign competition and a high failure rate for those businesses that fail to take note of those fa ctors critical to business survival. The paper outlines the major problems smal l businesses will face and includes ten strategies to stay competitive in the 1990's and beyond. THE COMPETITIVE BUSINESS E NVIRONMENT OF THE 1990's The competitive environment th at will face small businesses in the 90's will be an increasingly global market with fierce foreign competition and a high failure rate for those small businesses that fail to take note of those factors critical to business survival. With the possible exception of the servic e market, most U.S. small businesses will face a myriad of new problems and associated opportunities. Am ong the most pressing of these problems are: * Increased global competitio n at all business levels. As the international community is moving to a single glob al market, the need for small businesses to integrate themselves within that market is crit ical to their long term survivability. Ni neteen hundred and ninety two marks the establishment of a single European \"c ommon market\" which significantly moves the world towards this single market goal. * Lower foreign employee wages. As more and more countries enter the global market, small businesses will increasingly be forced to market their products and services against competitors who have access to a much ch eaper labor force. In order to remain competitive, small businesses will be forced to hold down labor costs and pay increases. * A decreasing trained labor pool and the ne ed to provide more employee training. Small firms say the availability of a qua lified labor force will be their top problem in the coming decade (6, p. B- 1). At the same time, much of the new labor forc e is less educationally qualified, and will have to be trained before they will be effective in competing in the global markets. * Increased competition for capital. The increased number of competitors, the continual growth of international busi nesses, changes in SBA rules, and the overall limit of capital, will result in increased competit ion for venture capital. Small bus inesses will increasingly find themselves competing directly with la rge firms and/or international companie s for these sources of business funding. * Increased consumer demand for qual ity in all products and services. The overall consumer demand fo r quality products will requ ire small businesses to focus much of their attention on doing a few things well rather than tryi ng to provide too wide of a variety of products and services. Finding the right product/service \"niche\" and then being flexible enough to ch ange niches\" quickly when business demands change, will be one of the key elements in business survival in the 90's. * Increased SBA monitoring and co mpetition for SBA services. The increasing limits on SBA resources and the growing numbe r of small businesses desiri ng help from the SBA has resulted in the SBA increasin g its monitorin g of businesses re questin g and usin g its services (Q, P. B-2 ). Additional monitoring will include verificati on of \"minority-owner\" abuses, de fense contract corruption, etc. * Increases in partnerships between larg e/intermediate and small businesses. The business environment of the 90's will increasingly see business partnerships between large/intermediate and small businesses to enhance/complement their pr oduct/service line and improve their flex ibility and responsiveness of U.S. to market changes. While a common practice for years in Ja pan and other foreign business centers, it has only become evident in recent years to some American businessmen. This type of cooperation and inte rdependence may well be the key to survival in the highly specialized an d integrated business market of the 90's. * Rapidly changing ma rket environment. In the turbulent changing market environment of the 90's, all businesses, large and small, must be flexible and responsive. Establishing a single market ni che\" may still be availabl e to some firms, but the dynamics of the markets of the 9O's will require many firms to be flexible enough to change rapidly or go under. Ma rkets, products, services, financial resource availabi lity, etc. will all be extremely dynamic, and th e firms best able to ha ndle and stay on top of this change will be the firms most likely to survive (5, P. 115). * Growing need for immediate access to current bus iness information from a variety of sources. The recognition by many businesses of their need to access and use a wide variet y of business information (financial, market analysis, regulatory, etc.) has re sulted in significant growth in the busin ess infrastructure necessary to provide this type of information to a wide variety of U.S. businesse s (2, p. B- 2). This has been partially fueled by the rapidity of change in the business environment and the overall r ecognition that accessing and mana ging information will be a key ingredient in remaining competitive in the 90's. * Greater need to track legisla tion affecting small businesses. Jeanne Saddler reports that many small businesses feel they have their backs against the wa ll over a bill Se nate passes last fall. The bill requires all business owners, large and sm all, to make considerable changes to permit people with physical or mental handicaps to become their employees and customers. Small firm s fear the bill will force them to change how they operate (9, p. B-2). This is but a small exam ple of why there is a mandatory need for small business to track legislation. * Growing need to stay flexible. Flexibility is one of the main requirements for all businesses to stay competitive in the marketplace. Simply because of their size and lack of cumbersome infr astructure, many small businesses have be en able to take advantage of their flexibility to successfully compete. In th e 90's it will be increasingly important fo r all businesses to be able to readily adapt themselves to the growing needs of their customers. Computer technology offers the small firm the support and information they need to be able to customize their services to meet these changing needs. * Growing need for small businesses to act more like larg e businesses. Increased labor demands for pay and fringe benefits. The major changes in the work force a nd their unwillingness to continue to ac cept the lower pay and benefits offered by many small businesses will require many businesses to begi n to provide functions and benefits similar to those provided by large firms. These functions will include improved employee selection pr ograms, additional employee training, health benefits, workmen compen sation benefits, parental leave programs, etc. (6, p. B- 1). The ability of small businesses to provide these benefits while containing their costs will be a key to their survival in the 90's. * Tightened SBA rules encouraging small businesses to detach themselves from the \"government nest.\" The small business administ ration has recently modified many of its rules to encourage small businesses to become less dependent upon the government and the sma ll business program for their business. Recent ruling changes now require small businesses to show that at least 25% of their business comes from non- program sources (9, p. B-2 ). The tightening of these SBA rules will for ce many small businesses to enter the fier cely competitive a nd less-comfortable national and intern ational business environment. * Large businesses are beginning to target typi cal small business area pr oducts and services. In recent years, many larger businesses have begun to target product and service markets which traditionally have been the sole domain of small businesses. While the increasingl y commonality of business part nerships between large and small businesses is at least partially re sponsible for this trend, in some cases, large businesses are simply entering these markets on their own. The market \"turf-lin es\" between large and sma ll businesses in the 70's and 80's are becoming less and less distinct as businesse s of all sizes attempt to reduce their risk through diversification of product and service lines they can provide. Simultaneously, however, they are ha ving to watch that they do not weaken their competitive position by trying to be \"all th ings to all customers.\" In summary, these major business trends in the 1990's will re quire small businesses to 1) expand their markets into the international community; 2) compete dire ctly against both large businesses (foreign and domestic) and international competitors for markets and business capital; 3) act more li ke big businesses without the benefit of their capital or manpower, 4) control their employee demands for additional pay and benefits such as health, workmen's comp and parental leave; 5) increase their busine ss flexibility in all areas - products, capi tal, markets and work environment, 6) compete for a smaller less trained work fo rce; 7) deal with the SBA's tighteni ng rules; 8) significantly improve the quality of their products and services; 9) reduce and/or c ontrol their costs through the timely investment in and application of new technology, and 10) reduce their dependence on government c ontracts and SBA program sources. Any small business that is unwilling or unable to address these major issues wi ll ultimately find themselves in an increasingly unfavorable competitive position. COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY STRATEGIE S/OPTIONS FOR SMALL BUSINESSE S TO STAY COMPETITIVE IN THE 1990's Based on the need to stay competitive in the 1990's, small business owners must take adva ntage of significant changes in computer technology that have been previously restricted to large compan ies. Among the recent trends that can impact the ability of small businesses to survive are: * Decreased costs and availability of computer hardware and software. Significant reductions in computer hard ware and software costs have result ed in making very powerful automation equipment and software availabl e to nearly all segments of the small business community. Very powerful cost-effective computer systems are now available whic h provide the small busine ss owner with processing power equivalent to large business mainframe computers. The result has been a \"leveling-out\" of the compet itive advantage traditionally held by larger firms. * Improved hardware /software a nd application system integrati on and networking capabilities. Recent improvements in the integration of vendor ha rdware/software and corresponding improvements in the networking of computer terminals, PC's , and mainframes has resulted in signi ficant improvements in the management and operation of both small and large bus inesses. Small businesses have often found that their small scale and more focused application system needs have facilitated their ability to take advantage of these new technologies. * The proliferation of FAX capabilities. Over the past 5 years there has been a 22-fold increase in the number of FAX machines in the hands of U.S. businesses (3 , p. 15 1). This powerful technology is reliable and simple to use and has become a powerful sales tool. Companies are finding it increasingly possible to do away with messengers, overnight express mail, and they also have been able to use the FAX equipment to double as ine xpensive copiers. \"If you ar e a small business today and you don't have a FAX, you are nothing\" (3, P. 15 1). By the mi d- 1990's FAX machines will transfer pages at the rate of one per five seconds versus the current 10 to 40 seconds. While FAX transmissions nett ed phone companies $2.3 billion in 1989, the increased sales to small businesses and access to wider markets has netted co rresponding profits to small businesses who have taken advantage of this very cost-effective technology (3 , p. 153). * Increased availability of applicati on software packages (ie: word proce ssors, spreadsheets, CAD/CAM, accounts payable, business management, etc.). The increased availability and reduced costs of very powerful common appl ication software packages and the corresponding reduction in the hardware costs for PC's, laser printers and desk top publishi ng equipment has resulted in very powerful computerized capa bilities becoming available to most of the small business market. The availability of this very powerful hardware/software ha s allowed small firms to enter markets traditionally handled solely by large firms. It has also reduced many of the old product \"quality di fferences\" that use to exist be tween larger and small firms. * Increased availability of expert and deci sion support systems for small business owners. Throughout much of the 80's, the availa bility of powerful artificia l intelligence, expert, a nd decision support systems has been limited to larger firms. This resulted from the overa ll cost of these types of syst ems and that they simply did not exist in great numbers for small businesses. With the reduced costs of the hardware/software necessary to run these types of systems and the increased number that have been de veloped explicitly for small businesses, smaller firms are now able to use these powerful tools to enhance their comp etitive positions. Many smaller firms have been able to actually use decision support and expert syst ems in place of hiring additional staff. The ability of small businesses to avail themselves to these sophisticated computeri zed management tools will significantly enhance their ability to compete \"hea d-to-head\" with larger businesses in the 90's. * Increased availability of specialized data service functions (i.e. demographic data, market analysis data, etc.). The computer has revolut ionized many small firms in provi ding specialized data service functions. For example, Lotus Marketplace has digitized demographic data used for market ing and sales strategies. Small businesses are now able to purchase databases with names, addr esses, and marketing information on 7.5 million businesses and 80 million households (I , p. 17). These types of services allow the small business owner to zero in on their target markets, helping to reduce sales and marketing costs. * Telecommuting work options and the in creased acceptability of job sharing. Many small businesses are discovering the advantages of job sh aring and work stations in the home. They get a better quality and more productive work hour from employee's who se lect this option, as many are single parents. In several instances, this option eliminates the need for day care nurseri es and allows the small firm to provide a more flexible work environment. Small firms compete on a more equal footing for a highe r quality work force. * Increased use of computers for routine competitive functi ons (ie. phone answering, el ectronic mail, onl ine ordering, electronic banking, access to regulatory agency databases and bulletins). Computers are becoming good listeners. Th ey are in fact becoming such good listen ers, they are taking on more of the work of telephone operators. Large telecommunication comp anies are giving telephone netw ork computers the ability to hear. These computers are able to ask questions of call ers, listen to responses and route the calls to the proper destinations. Voice recognition allows telephone companie s to reduce staff and use remaining operators more efficiently (4 .p. B-2). These new capab ilities will also give small firms a real boost in their productivity and simultaneously will aid in their struggle to keep operating costs to a minimum. In addition to their \"listening skills,\" co mputers facilitate sales ordering, and the financial functions of small businesses. They have allowed the smaller firms to reduce the overhead and number of staf f. The result has been a significant savings in employee costs and a corres ponding improvement in the competitive position of those small firms who have taken advantage of this cost- effective technology. * Improved com puter literac y amon g the work force. The business environment of the 90's wi ll require a work force with high computer literacy. Increasingly both businesses and employees are learning co mmon application software packages. Th e improved computer literacy of the work force will benefit the small firm by helping to keep soaring training costs to a minimum. * The managing of information as a corporate resource. Small businesses realizing the value of in formation and the need to manage it as a corporate resource. The competitive advantage that timely access to financial, sales, and market information can give small bus inesses has become evident. They have begun to draw more heavily upon information alr eady available to them from their existing information systems (management informat ion, financial, etc.). As information has become more of a strategic weapon fo r large business, the proper management of small business data will also become critical for their long term competitive position. CONCLUSION The increasingly difficult business envi ronment that will face small businesse s in the 90's is both worrisome and exciting in the problems and opportunities that will be presented to small busine sses. Major problems, as summarized, are: (Increased global competition at al l business levels, A decreasing trained labor pool and the need to provide more employee training, Increased SBA monitoring and competitio n for SBA services, Increases in partnerships between large/intermediate and small businesses, A rapidly changing market environment, A need to stay flexible, Growing need for immediate access to current business information from a variety of sources, The proliferation of FAX capabilities, Telecommuting work options and the increased acceptability of j ob sharing, Increased availability of specialized data service functions, Decr eased costs and availability of computer hardware and software application packages, and The managing of informat ion as a corporate resource.). Minor problems include: (Increased computer literacy among the work force, Increased availability of expert and decision s upport systems for small business owners, Large businesses beginning to target ty pical small business area products and se rvices, and A greater need to track legislation affecting small businesses.). The key to economic survival will re st on each business' ability to take advantage of computer technology to enhance its competitive position. REFERENCES 1.

Kilpatrick, Idaho State Universi ty Corey D. Schou, Idaho State University ABSTRACT Information is an organizational asse t which must be distributed to suppor t ongoing decision making. The objective of attempts to secure the information system of a small business is to see to it that unauthorized use is not possible, that destructive viruses are not introduced, and that unauthorized study and alteration of reco rds and files does not occur during the distribution of data and inform ation throughout the organization. Are thes e strictly technical problems, or is it possible and appropriate to broaden the scope to include the ethical issues that are raised as the security system is developed and installed? The argument in th is paper is that it is both appropriate and necessary to consider the broader issues. INTRODUCTION Information is the lifeblood of an orga nization and over the years it has become recognized as an asset. This asset should be protected like any other. One of the dominant ch aracteristics facing any firm attempting to become and to stay competitive is the dependence on information processing that relies on computers and computer software. In this paper we attempt to address many of the ethical issues facing managers in small businesses as they attempt to cope with the complexity and cost of acquiring, integrating and se curing information systems in the workplace. In large organizations, this task is assigned to an Information Resource Manager who is responsible for all aspects of information processing from data entry to the Executive In formation System.[1] He plays an important role in the security of the organi zation's information assets. It is critical that Information Resource Managers convey the importance of resource security to se nior management of the organization. In the small business, this communication may be trivial since the task becomes one of the myriad performed by a 'multi-purpose' manager. This make s the awareness no less important. In the process of performing this task, the manager must bala nce two competing objectives. The first is that of meeting the requisite variety of decision makers within a system.[2] The s econd is that of maintaini ng security, confidentiality and privacy of organizati onal information assets. All too frequently, this process is view ed as a technical problem rather than the more complex socio-technical problem which should address some of the following issues: * Whose rights are to be considered? * To what extent are these rights in conflict? * What are the responsibilities of the information specialists? * How honest and trusting are the members of the us er community? In what sense do they represent a 'community'? What are th e implications, if any, of their holding certain inte rests in common? * How trusting ought they to be? What is implied in th e use of the term ought? Of the term trust? These socio-technical problems are fundamental ethical issues. These issu es may or may not be legal issues. The manager should be aware that legal does not al ways equal either et hical or right.[3] QUESTIONS OF PURPOSE AND VALUE Since there is a documented body of law which governs portions of our behavior and a cult of technology which asserts that it can make our electroni c information systems invulnerable to extern al penetration, we tend to rely upon it. To complete the protection of our information assets, we must develop an awareness of value systems. George Smiley: \"You've made technique a way of li fe. Like a whore, techni que replacing love.\"[4] In a technological environment, it is easy to focus on the techniques designed to ac complish goals and on the technology used to assist in the acco mplishment of those goals. At times the tendency is to allow the focus on technique to overshadow the purposes or ends. For exampl e, a common observation of the modern 'rat race' (a revealin g meta phor) is that pend so much time and ener gy pursuin g the good life that little remains for living. As this result suggests, it is easy to become obsessed with the tools and in the process to forget the purpose of the tools. What is the role played by the values that members of a community hold which inform th e choices made and the ends toward which those choices are directed? Stated another wa y, what is the significance of the way a member of the information systems community views the world and his or he r relation to that immediate world and to other members of the community? These values and percep tions underlie the choices that individuals make, th e goals that are pursued, and the priorities that are established. They affect both the means that are sel ected and the ends toward which efforts are directed. ETHICAL SYSTEMS What are the purposes of computer in formation systems? Inform ation systems are organiza tional mechanisms which collect data and distribute information. Fr equently these system rely on electroni c devices such as computers; however, the 'office boy' carrying a scrap of paper to th e file drawer also m eets this definition. Some systems relate to government al objectives (e.g., national defense, collection of revenue, monitoring of international trade), some to business pur poses and needs (e.g., efficiency and comp etitiveness), but all must relate at some level to social needs and values. For example, one mi ght argue that a fundamental value is respect for the rights of others. Another might be th at the overall objective is a better quality of life for all members of the community. There are several ways of identifying and deciding ethical issues. One of the most common ways of categorizing these approaches is the rules vs. consequences criteria. The firs t argues that our actions should be guided by general rules or principles: do not harm; tell th e truth; do not steal; have respect for person s as ends in themselves.' The second argues that we should assess the rightness of an action or decision by the consequences that will likely result. Most commonly the second approach identifies some value or values, and measures an action by the extent to which these values are or are not enhanced, or whether progress is made toward certai n goals, such as a better life for all. From a practical standpoint it may be recognized that, for most people, over a span of time and in different situations, both approaches will be used. That is, in general some ethical rule may s eem appropriate but under extreme circumstances exceptions to the rule or principle will appear ethically a cceptable because of the likely consequences. ETHICS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS For an information system to function ef fectively and efficiently, there must be a free flow of data and information among the participants. In the ideal situation, there would be no barriers to this flow; this would improve the probability that 'perfect inform ation' is in the hands of the decision makers . Of course, for this to occur, there would have to be perfect confidence a nd trust within the organization. Confidence and Trust Information - adequate, relevant, timely, understandable - is a precondition of an ef ficient and free society. Yet it is a means to power ... Therefore, the rights to create property in information, to wi thhold, to disclose, to determine when and how disseminated are critical.[5] In this section we are interested in the ethical issues involving the creation, control, use, abuse, dissemination, protection, manipulation or altera tion, examination and destruction of informati on in computer systems. This is no less true within the small business environmen t than it is large organizations. In orde r for the above information activities to take place efficiently and legiti mately, there must be some minimal level of trust and confidence in the systems which handle the information. Is it also necessary for there to be some minimal level of trus t among and between the various users of the system? Assuming that such a level is necessary, what are the preconditi ons in order for this confidence and trust to exist? It appears clear that first there must be a proven and recognized history of dependa bility, both within the firm and with similar systems. By raising these issues in the context of the firm's culture or atmosphere, one ethical principle is implied: that there must be re spect for persons and certain property rights. This falls within the first approach identified above, which argues for the assessment of c hoices in light of certain ethical principl es or rules. Actions which result in intrusion, examination, alteration or destruction of information belon ging to others mi ght be judged as morall y wron g because they violate the principle of re spect for persons. The second approach, that of looking at the consequences of an action, might suggest that in order for a community to meet the needs of its member s, individuals within the community must be able to have some confidence in syst ems of communication. According to this view, it could be argued that actions that unduly interfere with the smooth opera tion of information and commun ication systems, or that diminish the confidence and trust in these systems, should be judged as unethical. Definitions As a starting point for determining ways of evaluating actions, it is appropriate to construct several definitions. The term legitimate is fundamental to the no tion of balancing rights and responsibilities. For the purposes of this paper, it is argued that for an action or behavior aff ecting an information system to be legiti mate, it must aid in the achievement of one or more objectives of the system without unduly interfering with progre ss toward other accepted objectives. The definition can be applied to the ethica l management of information. One obj ective of the system is to provide information that is without deception and is understandable, timely, relevant, complete and appropriate to the user. Upon examination, it can be seen that this definition suggests both the practica l and ethical elements of managing computer information systems. SPECIFIC CONCERNS RELATING TO TH E DESIGN OF SECURE SYSTEMS Those involved in the design of an inform ation security system must be aware of the conflicting rights, responsibilities and needs of system users and professionals, and of the impl ications of some of these conflicts. Some paradoxical assertions may serve to illustrate: * For people to have trust in a informati on system, the manager must trust no one. * Systems which are truly trus tworthy must use control pro cesses that inhibit use. Another way of putting the problem, as Clifford Stoll suggests in his book, The Cuckoo's Egg,[6] is that as administrative controls are adde d to ensure trustworthiness, the system beco mes more difficult to use. This means that the people for whom the system is designed end up finding some other, less trustworthy but more easily accessible system to use. The term administrative controls refers to those policies and procedures imposed by a manager that are designed to regulate the individuals and activit ies covered by the policies and procedures. Administrative controls are de signed and implemented to make sure that people act in th e way that managers desire. Generally this means, in ways that advance organizat ional objectives. This may be something as simple as standardizing the ways employees claim reimbursements for jo b-related expenses. It may me an something as broad as the budget process, which attempts to regul ate the activities of and to set sta ndards for the entire firm. Frequently, however, it also refers to the need to regul ate behavior when it is perceived that a) there is motivation to engage in ac tivities for personal, as opposed to organi zational, reasons; and b) those activities are potentially harmful to the organi zation, to organizational values or to other organizational members.[7] If the interests of individuals always coincided with those of the organizations with which he or she lives and works, there would be very little need for administrative controls. It is at the poi nt where these interests diverge that the need for controls arises. Further, some conflicts arise becau se of simple misunderstandings, some arise because of differences in perceptions, some are due to different priorities, world views or values, and some come about because of individual malevolent intent. Finally, there are those instances where it is in an individual's self-interest for everyone else to exercise a degree of moral restraint while he or she exercise s none. This can be seen as the free-ride r problem or, to use Garrett Hardin's metaphor, it is the \"tragedy of the commons\".[8] In this e nvironmental fable, the members of the community maintain their livestock on the commonly held gr azing grounds. Animals can safely be a dded until the carrying capacity of the grounds are reached. However, it is to the benefit of any i ndividual community member to add animals to his herd on the commons. The overall costs of degradation are borne by the community but the benefits accrue to the individual community member. The tragedy is that individuals can safely benefit in the short run while the long-term costs are dispersed. Greed is rewarded. One lesson for members of the co mmunity is that, unless they are willing to eliminate all coo perative efforts, the exercise of some moral restraint b y each individual is necessar y. EXAMPLES OF ETHICAL ISSUES CONFRONTED IN SMALL FIRMS The ethical issues confronted in small fi rms are not significantly different from those in larger organizations. However, the percentage of corporate effort in the small firms may be larger and ther efore more significant. As long as the information system consists of 'offic e boys' carrying paper from place to place, the problems are less complex. If he takes something home - he has stolen - he is wrong. However, as soon as the or ganization begins to rely on electronic means, this issue becomes more clouded. The same indivi dual can take or send electronic images of the same information without overtly changing it.[9] The followi ng are examples of some problems which are uniquely electronic. Pirated Software Perhaps the most obvious and most prev alent problem deals with the use of pirated software. The temptations are obvious and the risk of disclosure is slight. Why then the c oncern? There are several ethical issues here, but perhaps the overriding one is that of intellectual property. As with many ethical concerns, one can arrange many positions along a continuum. In this instance, one can take an extreme individualist or ethical egoist pos ition, and argue that pirating another's software is not a big issue, and is useful for financially strapped small busines ses. Further, one can argue that it is the responsibility of the developer to take measures to limit the ease of pirating. In a ny case, is it stealing if the property isn't gone? At the other end is the argument that a) there are rights that are being violated while copyi ng; b) that no community can exist that refuses to acknowledge and prot ect the rights of its members; and c) th at progress will be limited unless there is some incentive for individuals to de velop tools that will prove useful in solving the pr oblems of the community. The small business manager then must addr ess the issue of whether to allow - pr ofit from - the pirating of another's intellectual creation, or, if the policy is to ensure that th is does not occur within the business, what policies will be required to ensure that it does not occur. Gaming Another issue of interest with perhaps less clear cut ethical stands is the use of company facilitie s for office games, such as 'rotisserie baseball' and 'fan tasy hockey'. Employees face an ethical choice over the extent to which such 'enlivening' activities can legitimately be carried on during company time. Managers face the need to balance productivity interests with maintaining a livable working environment that is not so rigid and controlling that the quality of work life dr ives off good employees. Criminal Entry This situation is analogous to the problem of the 'office boy' . If someone breaks your physical lock, or physically enters your premises, there is little question about \" right'. However, the problem of unwarranted en try into proprietary electr onic information systems with criminal intent is more complex. Using technologica l means, each firm will obviously wish to en sure that its own system win not be so penetrated. What of information gained either inadvertently or through the wiza rdry of an employee who also happens to enjoy the challenge of breaking into another instituti on's information systems? Sinc e any technological means of protection may be compromised by 'wizardry' it is important that one engender an atmosphere of 'correctness'within the organization. Computer Surveillance And Employee Records In a 1931 speech, George Bernard Shaw obs erved \"An American has no sense of privacy. He does not know what it means. There is no such thing in the co untry.\" At the time he may have been correct; however, the American society has matured during the last sixty years. Even though Supreme Court ca ndidates have been unable to define the absolute nature of the rights of privacy on a cons titutional basis, most Americans believ e that they have a vested right of privac y. Computerization of information systems has made the communication and dissemina tion of information about companies and individuals an accepted procedure. The issue of computer su rveillance and employee records involves questions about the uses of databases th at may involve invasion of privacy, eith er the customer's or employee's, and employee monitoring in the workplace. Th is latter involves the inclusion of a piece of software in the information system which monitors and times or ot herwise measures the activities of opera tors. Is this a legitimate managerial exercise of administrative control, or is it an unwarra nted intrusion into the employee's privacy? Put another way, should the firm legitimately be concer ned only with the quantity and quality of the employee's activities, or may it also surreptitiously monitor the employee on a minute by minute ba sis? Questions of the impact on morale aside, how far may the manager extend his or her contro l over the activities of the employee? Th e sensitivity of this issue becomes more acute when the ability to control is magnified or enha nced by the computer's capacitie s. One other issue in this category involves the cross-reading or matching across information systems of employee or customer records. Again, the issue involves the right to privacy of employees and cust omers. Formerly, this may have been an ethical concern only in firm's large enough to have exte nsive databases. Today, even small firm s may have the computer capacity, or have access to databases that give the firm the capacity, to intrude into the privacy of employees and customers. The owner/manager of a small firm, then, is faced with many of the same ethical dilemmas that managers in large firms face. Dealing with the issues may be more difficult in that th e small firms manager must be a ll things to all people, with little time for contemplating the complexitie s of the ethics of the computer age. SOURCES OF GUIDELINES AND CODES OF ETHICS There are a number of organizations that have chosen to addr ess directly the ethical issues posed by the rapid expansion of information technology. Computer Professionals for Soci al Responsibility is one such. Another is the Data Processing Management Association (DPM A) that has developed a code of et hics and a separate 'Standards of Conduct.\" [10] Standards of Conduct These standards are derived from the code of ethics and are specific statements of behavi or that no true professional will violate. Excerpts are provided belo w, as examples of ethical guidelines that are being developed by industry professionals: In recognition of my obligation to management I shall: * No t misuse the authority entrusted to me. * Not misrepresent or withhold information concerning the capab ilities of equipment, software or sy stems. In recognition of my obligation to my fellow members and the profession I shall: * Be honest in all my professional rela tionships. * Not use or take credit for the work of others without sp ecific acknowledgement and authorization. In recognition of my obligation to societ y I shall: * Protect the pr ivacy and confidentiality of all information entrusted to me. * To the best of my ability, insure that the products of my work are used in a socially responsible way. * Never misrepresent or withhold information that is germane to a problem or situation of public concern nor will I allow any such known information to remain unchallenged. * Not use knowledge of a confidential or personal nature in any unauthorized manner or to achieve personal gain. In recogni tion of my obligation to my employer I shall: * Avoid conflict of interest and insure that my employer is aware of any potenti al conflict. * Protect the privacy and confidentiality of all informat ion entrusted to me. * Not exploit the wea kness of an information system for personal gain or personal satisfaction. SUMMARY It is of benefit to each user if ever yone exercises discretion, judgment and prof essional respect for other's rights in the use of a computer information system. Each knows then that the system can be 'trusted.' It means that the system manager will be less concerned with in trusions or violations of rights and pr ofessional courtesies, respect and so on. But it also means that if an individua l does desire to gain access to another user's files, to change data, steal information, study someone else's personnel file, install a Trojan horse or release a virus, it is much easier to do so. The implicit trust in the system makes it easy for an individual user to violate that trus t. Self- restraint thus can be seen as a prerequisite for any activity requiring trust. The violation of the trust, if discovered, necessitates a hi gher level of administrative control, new restrictions placed on access, and that additional procedural pr ocesses be installed. The violations have caused a reduction in the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. A funda mental consideration for the small busin ess owner or manager, then, is to assess the role of trust, the desirable and achievable level of trust to be s ought, and the implications of these choices for the firm and indivi duals affected. This dilemma serves to highlight the et hical considerations facing the small bus iness owner/manger. For the small firm, it is further complicated by resource limi tations, both financial and human. What balance between absolute confidence in the security of the system and completely free access fo r users is desirable? What are the tradeoffs between rights and responsibilities, costs and benefits implied by the security or control provisions that ar e contemplated? What values lie behind the choices made? As the level of security increases, and with it th e consequent increase in the level of confidence or trust in the system, what other legitimate values are diminished or threatened? In general, this is the age- old question of the balance between indivi dual and community interests. In specifi c terms, it is the question of how to optimize the legitimate and responsible use of computer information systems wh ile eliminating unauthorized use and protecting the rights of users a nd other affected parties. To generalize the problem: * if people wi n not exercise moral restraint, systems will develop controls for protection; * the controls for protection will prove burde nsome and inefficient; * they will still be necessary as the threat comes, not from responsible users but from 'mavericks' with what is arguably an essentiall y anti-community ethic.

Carland, Western Carolina Un iversity James W. Carland, Western Caro lina University Carroll D. Aby, Jr., University of Tennessee at Martin ABSTRACT One hundred businesses were surveyed to determine the exte nt to which computer security plans and procedures existed. Analysis of the results indicated that security pr ecautions, especially when microcomputers form the base of the computing system, were inadequate. A strategic approach to computer security for small businesses is presented and explained. The role which small business owners must take to alleviate this problem is elucidated. THE PROBLEM OF SECURITY Businesses, small and large, are demanding more inform ation for strategic planni ng and decision making. These demands are mandating greater automation. The unprecedented growth in the area of computer usage and related services in the small business arena especi ally, has caused firms to re view their plans for recovery from disaster or theft losses. Computer-based information sy stems produce benefits that include co st efficiencies, data accuracy, and convenient access to information. However, along with the bene fits come certain disadvantages such as the need for tougher computer security and recovery planning. The industry is rife with horro r stories of companies losing not only hardware but diskettes containing irreplaceable company records and data. Perhaps, one of the more famous cases is the group of youngsters who broke into the offices of an At lanta firm after hours and walk ed away with equipment and diskettes which they planned to recycle or use for games ( 20). In another incident, a sm all business was forced into bankruptcy when an employee c hose to steal from the company by changing a computer program (19). There is also the case of a company which failed to update its disaster recovery plan despite a near loss of its facilities to a tornado. This firm was subsequently devastated by fi re and incurred further costs in tryi ng to recapture lost information about production and clients (18). The list is endless and growing daily to new dime nsions. Now management must concern itself not only with potenti al employee fraud, but with the more insi dious \"viruses\" which are propagating and spreading. Using the excuse of frustrating software pirate s, these virus inventors have wreaked havoc in systems spreading from that of a young hacker to mu ltimillion dollar industries (5; 21; 13; 14). Much has been written in the past few y ears about the concern for computer security is well placed, because co mputer sabotage and spying has become a major electronic age problem. Large corporations tend to be more concerned with electronic securi ty. In such firms physical a sset preservation issues have been a concern for many years and are therefore well planned. However, since small businesses have limited experience with computer equipment, there is some doubt as to whether the same level of planning exists. With an increasing number of small businesses purchasing micr ocomputers to maintain company records, the need for security becomes an issue of paramount importance to the owner/managers of these firms. In small firms, desktop computers tend to be easily accessible to all employees . Furthermore, many popular software packages have no password capabilities. Sm all firms frequently have no separation of empl oyee duties or built-in controls. Due to the lack of extra requirements fo r installation and maintenance of microcomputers, plans for di saster and recovery may not be considered. These concerns are the underlying motivators for the empirical investigation and security paradigm described in this paper. CURRENT LITERATURE There are two aspects to computer security : physical and elec tronic. Physical or disaster se curity is not often mentioned in the literature, perhaps becau se it is less glamorous. Elec tronic security is the more visible and attracts the most attention because it involves protecting a firm from crimes such as illegal data manipulation, information theft and data sabotage. On the other hand, disaster s ecurity is concerned with protection from physical mishaps such as fire, explosion, or water damage. While el ectronic crime can be expensive, phys ical accidents can be operationally destructive in a most plenar y fashion. An electronic thief ma y access the s ystem, steal desired information, and quietly slip away. Information is stolen, but th e hardware and data remain intact. However, if a fire occurs, hardware is destroyed and data is lost as well. This results in a significant problem for th e company without an adequate disaster plan. State of the art security has e volved in the last 10 years. Experience prior to that time is not applicable according to Johnston (17). Until the proliferation of mini and micro computers, there was a paucity of written information about security or disaster pl anning as an issue. Large businesses with enor mous responsibilities and mainframe computer support had long been ensuring against com puter crime as best they could. Such fi rms also instituted contingency plans for recovery in the event of a natural catastrophe. Al though, small business managers have been cognizant of computing resources as justifiable on a co st/benefit basis, all too often they have failed to concern themselves with events they considered remote and improbable. However, the recent influx of arti cles detailing damage done by criminal intruders and disgruntled employ ees has fostered an awareness of the need for security precautions (6; 4; 24; 9; 20; 14). Increasing awareness of the vulnerability of computer syst ems spawned a series of films, including the popular 'War Games', but also triggered the legislativ e process. Popular outcries caused the le gal system to begin its slow, grinding process to contrive laws which can deal with computer cr ime. All inclusive laws which can pertain to the theft of hardware or software or info rmation vital to the survival of a company ar e being addressed (15). However, the passage of legislation is at best a slow proces s. Indeed, even the passage of the Comput er Security Act of 1987 has yet to be effective. The National Bureau of Sta ndards was charged with the task of sett ing guidelines for security standards and yet, budget cuts have hindered its impleme ntation. Meanwhile, security measures required to protect small businesses from such losses have become more complex due to technological advances such as databases and networking capabilities. Security of microcomputers has been alluded to in arti cles aimed at discussing controls necessary for auditing microcomputer systems (i.e., 1; 22; 10; 5; 16). Stair (27) has been one of the few to directly address computer security in small firms. Stair conceived a five point plan for impleme nting disaster and recovery pl ans. The approach entailed: 1) a statement of the object ives for the plan; 2) an analysis of the potential disasters; 3) a formulat ion of a disaster plan; 4) the documentation of the disa ster plan; 5) implementation of that plan; and, 6) testing and maintenance of that plan. METHODOLOGY A questionnaire was developed to ascertain whether owners/managers in small businesses in th e Southeastern U.S. had reflected on security needs in their orga nizations and whether they deemed such precautions to be necessary. Inquiries were also made as to who was responsible for the implementat ion of security and disaster plans if indeed they existed and what those plans were. The instrument consisted of a questionna ire which raised issues about the com puter system presently being employed and microcomputer faciliti es which might be in use. Further, respondents were asked whether there was a disaster plan or data security plan in effe ct. If such plans existed,, an explanation was s ought as to what their contents were and who within the organization was responsible for their implementation. Finally, the involvement of the owner/manager in computer security was explored. One hundred firms were surveyed by telephone. All were inde pendently owned and operated. The firms were selected from advertisers in telephone books published in the Southeas tern U.S. Sixteen of the firms did not presently have computer equipment, although plans for microcomputer purchases were in progr ess. Eighteen other firms failed to cooperate fully with the investigator . Therefore, sixty-six usable respons es were employed in the empirical examination. Table 1 outline s the distribution of types of firms and number of employees within the sample and displays the number of years responding firms have been using computers and the number of data processing specialists employed in the firm. Thirty-seven of the participat ing firms had larger computer systems consis ting of minicomputers or, in some cases,, mainframe computers. Twenty-nine firms relied solely on microcomputers for their data processing needs.

A disturbing finding was that 18% of respondents indicated that no one within the organization had been ch arged with the responsibility for computer security. Table 2 Responsibility fo r Computer Security Data Processing Personnel:1 929% Management Personnel:3248% Clerical Personnel:35% Assigned to No One:1218% Total66100% Twenty-six firms indicated that top ma nagement was involved in computer security. However, when asked to what extent top management was involved, the response in every case was that the management supported the concept. In no case was there evidence of manage ment involvement beyond an expression of support. Only 15 companies in the sample had a written disaster recovery plan. Fortunatel y, only three had actually had occasion to use such a plan. Six firms indicated that they made periodic reviews of their plans to maintain currency. Most of the respondents not only did not ha ve written plans, they had no informal plans. A frequent response was that the firm had not really thought about the need for a disaster plan. The same 15 respondents who had written plans, indicated that there were physi cal security restrictions for their computers. Frequently, security consiste d of a locked door. Only two firms had restricted access to both hardware and software. Almost all of the surveyed firms did keep back-up copies of programs and data, but only seven firms had arranged to keep back-up copies both inside and outside the office. Furthermore, only half of the firms prepared data back-ups on a daily basis. Table 3 displays the frequency of back-up preparation. Table 3 Frequency of Back Ups Back Up Data Daily:3350% Back Up Da ta Weekly:1117% Back Up Data Biweek ly:46% Back Up Data Monthly:69% Back Up Data Semimonthly:23% Back Up Data on Dema nd:815% Do Not Prepare Back Ups: 2 3% Total 66 100% Since only 15 firms actually had a written disaster plan, a correlation analysis was performed between the existence of a plan and the stated involvement of ma nagement in computer security issues . The correlation was moderate (r=.423), indicating that the involvement of manage ment did not explain the majority of variance in the existence of written plans. The real factor in the existence of plans, security precautions, and back- up frequency was the type of computing environment. Those firms who planned, backed up most fre quently, etc. were included in the group of 37 firms who had mini or main frame computer systems. IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Although the sample was purposive in nature, the results spur important questions in sm all business computerization. Data and information are often a com pany's greatest asset. The loss of these assets when backu p copies are not readil y available can place a company in dire financial straits. On ly those organizations in this study ha ving larger computer configurations had adequate disaster plans and back-up procedures. Those co mpanies exclusively using micro computers were a different story. Such firms had typically never cons idered computer security as other than a natural precaution taken for regular office equipment. They were aware of back-up procedures and the necessity for them but were not concerned about access to hardware or software or data. Ninety percent of the companies surveyed claimed that accounting functions such as accounts receivable and payroll were handled by the computer system. However, only 23% had established any degree of access re striction to the computer, the programs or the data. The conclusions reached in this study ar e disconcerting. Owner/ managers of sma ll businesses have realized the need for a management tool which can provide vital strategic information at one's fingertips. However, the tool does not appear to be treated with the proper respect. A comparab le analogy could be individua ls who put their fortunes under the mattress instead of in the bank. Many small businesses are putting their resources in a computer and simply locking the door to the office. An editorial in Infoworld claimed that businesses were becoming too secur ity conscious. The publication advocated that the computer should be available to any employee because it is a tool and s hould be used as such (2). The author was referring to the existence of microcomput ers in a mainframe com puter environment. He compared an employee taking home a diskette of data to tr ansporting a file folder. In reality, a diskette of data is closer to an entire filing cabinet of r ecords. When microcomputers are the sole means of automation in a business, the firm must necessarily be security conscious. Computer security can m ean the survival of the company. Another issue of great concern was the ab sence of vital,, active ma nagerial involvement in co mputer security plans. Only 39% of the respondents indicated that management was involved in planning for computer security. In every case management was seen to support the plans developed by ot her personnel. It would seem that the owner/managers should be more involved with security measures which coul d affect the life of the comp any. Token support is better than a lack of interest but has far reaching implications for the company. DeLone (1988) in his study of the determinants of Success for Computer Usage in Small Business found, as well, th at the chief executive was the key to the realization of the potential impact of success on computerized operations. E xperts in the field are convinced that computer security is a management pr oblem, not a technological problem (14). IDENTIFYING AND CORRECTI NG SECURITY PROBLEMS The relatively low level of security imposed over most computer-based system s can be attributed to a number of factors. First, and most significantly, there is the lack of management understanding c oncerning the sensitivity and criticality of their computer and information related resources. There is a di stinct misperception as to the vulnerability of such systems. Secondly, there is the failure of many hard ware vendors to develop system architectures that foster computer security, reliability, and control or to train clients in their usage. A th ird factor is the absence of a rigorous method for evaluating the effectiveness of an existing security program. No single group should bear complete responsibility for prot ecting the computer system. The need for controls should be inculcated throughout the entire organization. The genesis of security measures rests w ith the management hierarchy and must pervade the firm. It is most important that management be aware of the nature and implications of the risks associated with their computer-based systems. This awareness, and its currency is of particular import ance in view of th e growing level of computer literacy. The expansion of pers onal computer users in the ranks of the general public has greatly increased the number of potential abusers. The simultaneous growth of on-line and networked systems has increased the points of entry into a computer system. Such trends increase the risk dramatically. Primary poi nts of vulnerability in an organization must be monitored constantly in order to prevent or at least detect computer abuse on a timely basis. Management assessment should include an identification of the major areas of ri sk and some estimate of potential impact. The assessment should include an evaluation of control over: 1) comput er files; 2) cont rol over computer operations; and, 3) control over system so ftware. The evaluation of risk and vulne rabilities should coincide with the establishment of a com puter securit y program. Clearl y stated ob jectives should be proposed b y a mana ger assi gned responsibility for computer security and should be author ized by management. Formal objectives will signal that conventional managerial techniques and ac counting function controls apply to co mputer security issues. Since these controls cut across many functional areas , top management authori zation is particularly im portant. The objectives will establish a charter for developing programs and for setting priorities. Any viable, compre hensive program should: 1) establish a company policy; 2) assign responsibility; and, 3) establish a da ta processing contingency plan. An essential first step in security planning is the form alization of a broad policy statement that articulates the organization's commitment to protecti ng its information as sets. Corresponding with the corporate policy is the need to affix responsibility for each of the activi ties highlighted by the policy. This is most challenging in large organizations, where responsibil ities often cross functional, geographic, and entity boundaries. On the other hand, sm all companies are quickly perplexed by th e lack of independence in available personnel. Even the best made plans are subject to failure . A contingency plan is necessary to develop a state of preparedness and the capability to respond to emergenc ies in an effective and controlled manner. The effectiveness of any se curity program is ultimately dependent upon the significance attached to it by top management. It is also dependent upon its compatibility wi th the organizational units of the company that have responsibility for implementation of the plan. Most important is the recogniti on by end users of the significance of computer security to the overa ll well-being of the organization. Heightened by the current rage of user-friendly systems and personal computing, users will be in creasingly responsible for security. As the program is developed, a me chanism for evaluating its effectiven ess and continued operation becomes imperative. The use of internal and external auditors, qual ity assurance teams, and comput er security personnel can be valuable in providing the necessary feedback to top ma nagement. Reporting the results to management closes the information loop and contributes to the maintenance of a se curity program that is responsive to the needs of the organization. For top management, comput er security shoul d be considered integral to operating the business. Understanding the role that data processing plays in supporti ng daily operations is critical . In addition, the attendant risks associated with maintaining info rmation on computer-based systems are necessary lesson plans that must be investigated by management. Continuous ope rations and inviolate syst ems will not evolve wit hout the commitment of the owner/manager,careful planning and extensive follow-up. The benefits gain ed by effective management of the computer security function are tremendous. Resources will be deployed strate gically and efficiently with no surprises. Planning is perhaps the greatest determinant of success in the business environment and the technology of today places this concept literally in the hands of management. If a t op manager uses this tool e ffectively and makes strategic decisions based on knowledge, intuition, and available informat ion, that person will be pe rforming a great service to the organization and indeed the world.

Hanks, Utah State University Jan Elise Crispin-Little, University of Utah ABSTRACT While much has been written about high technology organizations in major centers such as Silicon Valley or Boston's Route 128, we know very little about the experience of high tech organizations lo cated in less heralded settings. What are the relative advantages and disadva ntages experienced by high tech firms wh ich are not located in these centers? This paper presents some preliminary findings relative to th is topic, based on interviews with executives from a number of Utah based high technology companies. INTRODUCTION In recent years, \"high tech\" has attracted a great deal of a ttention in both the popular and academic press. As the U.S. industrial base continues to decline in the wake of increased foreign competit ion, high tech sectors of the economy are expanding (1). State and local economic development agencies, hopi ng to bolster sagging econom ies, are clamoring to attract high tech organizations to their locales. Much has been written about regional technology centers such as Silicon Valley in Califo rnia, or Boston's Route 128. Often touted is the unique infrastructure which has deve loped in these centers, fost ering rapid entrepreneurial development. Ready pools of venture fina ncing, skilled technical personnel and ma nagement expertise are portrayed as readily available. Illustrative of the Silicon Valley infrastructure is the following story as told by Delbecq and Weiss (2): When the senior author first arrived in Silicon Valley to accept the position of dean of the School of Business at Santa Clara, within two weeks a young man arri ved in his office carrying a business plan. The would-be entrepreneur was twenty-one years old and had not yet grad uated with his baccalaureat e engineering degree, but he intended to start an electronics business. He asked, \"Would you he lp me meet the appropriate individuals so that I can ra ise half a million dollars to begin my company?\" In truth, in light of my mi dwestern ethics the request se emed bizarre. However, being new to the region, I took the business plan to a member of the business school's advisory board who had spent the last decade in Silicon Valley, and asked for his advice. He read the busin ess plan quickly but thoughtfully, and suggested that he set up a luncheon with a venture capitalist, a real estate developer, a senior entrepreneur who had set up a similar company six years before, and a re presentative from a local accounting fi rm. The result of the luncheon meeting was that the young engineer was subsequent ly partially funded through a venture capitalist, partially funded through a bank loan, guided through the rental of appr opriate industrial property by the local developer, and provided counsel by two outside board member s (one of whom was present at the first luncheon). This past year the business init iated at the luncheon was sold for $15 million. (p. 124) Certainly not every would-be entrepreneur in Silicon Vall ey has been welcomed with such open arms. Nevertheless, the story illustrates the importance of infrastructure in facilitating entreprene urial development. All of the pieces necessary for forming the new venture seemed to be right at the young entrep reneur's finger tips. While much has been written about high technology in Silicon Valley and Route 128, very little has been written about the contextual experience of high technology firms in less he ralded settings. The purpose of this paper is to present some preliminary findings of a study of Utah-based high technology ventures. Esse ntially two questions are addressed: (1) Why did company founders choose to found their busines ses in Utah?, and (2) What relative advantages and disadvantages do they experience as a result of their \"off-m ain street\" location? Findings are based on case histories and interviews conducted with executives of a number of established and emergi ng ventures. While this study centers specifically on Utah-based firms, it is believed the findi ngs have implications for ne w venture managers on other locales \"off main street.\" WHY UTAH? Accordin g to those interviewed, two ma jor factors were most commonl y mentioned as influential in the Utah location decision. First, this was where the founders wanted to live. In the case of two of the larger firms, the founders came to Utah (leaving more populated areas) for th e express purpose of starting up their businesses. Second, is the presence of three research universities in the stat e, the University of Utah, Utah State University, and Brigham Young University. Crispin-Little and Brereton (3 ) looked at ten emerging Utah -based ventures and found that over half had (and several founders continued to maintain) university connections. ADVANTAGES AND DI SADVANTAGES Establishment of high technology ventures away from traditional high tech centers such as Silicon Valley or Boston's Route 128 presents some unique chal lenges and opportunities for new venture managers. Areas of strategic import include (1) access to venture funding, (2) recruitment of technical and managerial talent, (3) market access, and (4) public visibility. The relative advantages and disadvantages experienced by Utah-b ased ventures in each of these areas are discussed below. Access to Venture Funding All of the firms interviewed identified access to venture funding as a major disa dvantage associated with their Utah location. Most of those who received ventur e financing, had gone out of state to obtai n it, generally to the east or west coast. In regard to working with local banking institutions , many expressed feelings simi lar to the Treasurer of one firm, who said: ... we found that some of the local banks were very rest rictive, not aggressive, not attempting to serve the high technology marketplace .... We found that there were banks outside of this area that were much more organized to deal with high tech companies; they understood the needs better. They were large enough that they had groups within their business whose specialty was high tech. While funding was seldom easy to obtain, Most executives felt that with persistence, good ideas are generally able to attract sufficient fundi ng from some source. Recruitment Recruitment of technical and managerial talent is an ongoing challenge for \"off-main street\" firms. In some cases, local universities can supply a firm's needs during early stages of development; but as the firm grows, its demand for labor exceeds the local supply and additional employ ees must be recruited from out of st ate. In general recruits tend to be cautious about leaving \"main street\" east and west coast locat ions to come to Utah. The major competitive advantage in terms of recruitment are \"quality of life\" kinds of issues. Companies have good success attracting a nd retaining people who enjoy an outdoor life style (skii ng, hiking, fishing etc. ) or have religious or fa mily ties to the region. Other advantages, relative to major high tech centers incl ude lower housing costs, less traffic and c ongestion, and a more relaxed pace of life. While recruiting costs are perceived as higher than main stre et competitors, the interviewe d executives generally felt their overall labor costs were less due to lower wages (reflective of the lower cost of living) and employee turnover. Market Access Since most firms served highly specialized, global markets, the executives generally per ceived no specific disadvantage in terms of location. However, an isolat ed location may be a disadvantage for component-type manufacturers (whose customers are located in the major high tech centers) or firms seeking joint venture opportunities. Public Visibility Off-main-street firms generally have less public visibility than their main street counterparts. This low profile presents both advanta ges and disadvanta ges. For start-u p firms, a low profile can shelter the firm from stron g com petitor response until the firm has begun to establis h itself in the marketplace. However, if the firm wishes to go public, this absence of visibility can have a negativ e impact on the price of th e stock offering. For establis hed firms, isolation from direct competitors may lead to complacen cy, and a loss of competitive vitality. Summary and Conclusions In summary, there are several strategic issues which must be assessed by high tech entr epreneurs who are considering an \"off main street\" location. Some represent major obst acles for successful operation, ot hers provide opportunities for competitive advantage. Strategic disadvantages include (1) re cruitment challenges, and (2) the lack of close access to key resources such as venture funding, ma nagement expertise and other infrastruc ture requirements. Potential strategic advantages include (1) lower labor and property costs, and (2 ) quality of life issues, such as reduced congestion and close access to outdoor r ecreation opportunities. In all, the executives interviewed were pleased with thei r Utah location, feeling that the relative advantages and disadvantages tended to balance out, allowing them to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace.

SMALL BUSINESS COMPUTER SECURITY Lynn Hoffman, University of Northern Colorado Gwen Font enot, Ernst and Young William L. Duff, University of Northern Colorado Jack Stewart, University of Northern Colorado ABSTRACT This article discusses the current growth in computer usag e and the resulting growth in co mputer crime. It encourages small businesses to become more concerned about computer security. It discusses comput er security risks and how small businesses should deal with those risks. INTRODUCTION The growth in the number of small businesses and the growth in computer usage have increasingly lead to small business losses because of theft, sabotage, hackers and accidents. Nationwide, al l forms of computer theft and related losses totalled $46 billion in 1986.(10) Th e average loss reported in a survey of 785 large corporations was $118,932. (5) Most losses that are a fraction of this am ount would cripple or bankrupt a small business. This article addresses three separate questions: (1) Why do small businesses need to develop computer security methods? (2) What computer losses threaten small businesses? and (3) What security methods are most appropriate for small businesses? (4) Why small businesses should be conc erned about computer security? There are four reasons that substantiate the need for sma ll businesses to become concer ned about computer security. These are: A. the increase in small bus iness usage of computers, B. the increa se in the number of employees dealing with information, C. the general increas e in computer crime, and D. the ad vancements in com puter security. With a decrease in computer prices, particularly microco mputers, has come an increase in small business computer usage. Many small businesses started wi th word processing or document edit ing and then began automating their inventory, billing, scheduling, customer records, and a ccounting systems.(6) A few hi gh technology small businesses moved into new uses such as: telecomputing, graphi cs presentations, and remo te order placement. This explosion of information availability has lead to a substantial increase in the number of employees creating, editing, transmitting, and disseminating information. Naisbe tt estimated that the percen tage of workers in the information industry increased from 7.5 mill ion workers in 1960 to 16.4 million in 1981. This was an increase from 11 percent to 17 percent of the work force.(8) Kupsh es timated that 90 percent of the future work force will be in an automated offi ce environment: with 80 per cent using a terminal one or more times a day.(7) Technology's two edged sword becomes apparent when com puter crime advances with technological advancements. New technological advances in telecom puting, phone line data transmission, and remote order placement created new vulnerabilities to inside and outs ide hackers. Computer access theft alone totale d $20 billion in 1986.(10) With the advancements in technology, av ailability, and small business usage ha ve come advancements in computer security technology. Although many small bus inesses are now more vulnerable to computer losses, more security techniques are available at affordable prices. Small businesses from the occa sional user to the high technology small business cannot afford to ignore their exposures or excuse their inaction by ci ting security costs. What types of computer losses threaten small businesses? Several types of computer related loss es threaten small businesses. These in clude: loss of system or data files, unauthorized access, unauthorized use, misu se, sabotage, theft, computer fraud, in terruption of service, and viruses. A very common occurrence is lo ss of system or data file s and is usually th e result of employee negligence or carelessness. (5) Ever y small business com puter user either will, or alread y has, accidentall y lost, erased, or formatted their files or experienced a disk failure. The probability of a loss increases with both the individual's or small business's computer use. The loss to the small business is the cost of the software or the employee's time to duplicate the lost material. Technological computer advancements have also created more ways for insiders or hackers to misuse, steal, or sabotage hardware or software. Consequently, unauthorized access, unauthorized use, and misuse have cost business and government millions of dollars.(10) Once an insider or outside r has gained access, they can use the small business's computers for personal gain by selling, compromising, or alte ring the small business's data. The losses from this risk will increase as more small businesses automate their customer, supplier, or c ontact lists into convenient data bases. The actual losses can range from minimal, but possibly em barrassing, to substantial. Employee access increases the potential fo r employee sabotage from disgruntled, displaced, or terminated employees. As more employees obtain unrestricted or unsupervised access, more potential losses face the small business. A danger for many small businesses is the possibility of an insider or hacker disabling their computer or computer-phone links. Service organizations that use computer links to provide a service such as small financial institut ions, small franchises, or small business tied to a national computer network are particularly vulnerable. Disabled co mputers temporarily forc e many highly automated small businesses to cease operations because they cannot ring up a sale, check invent ories, access a customer data base, or access a national computer network. A recently growing danger is \"viruses\" that are computer code s that replicate themselves from user to user.(2) Some viruses flash innocent messages, others disr upt or destroy system or data files. A new, stronger strain of viruses, can replicate themselves after \"nor mal\" erasing procedures. Shared diskettes or networks transmit these viruses throughout the computer world. A recent re port concludes that the danger is at \"epide mic\" levels with the losses mounting.(11) What security methods are most appropriate for small business? The most appropriate security methods for most small businesses include developing a safety conscious environment, recovery plans, trained employees, physical security, access security, an establishe d company policy, and secured communication links. Safety conscious environments A first priority is to establish a company policy on security a nd to establish a safety conscious environment. This can be accomplished by training employees about each specific potential security risk and by training them on the following security methods. Without employee co mpliance and commitment, all the foll owing measures are either minimally effective or totally ineffective. In addition the small business owner not only has to establish a company policy but strictly enforce and follow it in order to create the motivation for a safety conscious environment. Recovery and back ups Recovery plans and back up copies of key data and system files stored in separate locations are the first line of defense. Small businesses need to learn from thei r bigger counterparts and establish disast er recovery plans.(9) A plan including separately stored copies of key data and system files would reduce or prevent losses. This is particularly true for computer dependent sm all businesses who cannot comple te a transaction without a working computer such as a computerized cash register. Employees need to develop similar habi ts, make frequent copies, back up thei r individual work, and secure key files and equipment. There are software packages that allow user s to set times at which the software package automatically saves the user's work.(12) Utility Packages Each small business com puter o perator should know how to use utilit y packages. Some programs allow users to create, eliminate, rename, send, and move files allowing good file management (an exampl e is QDOS). Others allow users to condense badly fragmented disks. This o ccurs with frequent erasures and save s on the same hard drive or diskette. Condensing the storage area reduces the pr obability that a diskette or hard driv e's file allocation ta ble will lose its electronic mind (and map) of where files are stored. Some p ackages can recover accidental ly erased files and even accidental reformats of a hard drive (examples are Norton Utilities and MACE ). But, the user in the latter case must prepare for this loss by previously running Mace, which establishe s a copy of the hard drive file's allocation table into a special file. After an accidental reformat , the user can use the program to repla ce the file allocation table and recover most of the files. Physical Security Physical security of cr itical hardware and software can be provided several ways . First, smaller machines such as PC's can be secured to heavy objects with cables and bo lts. For the few small businesses using mid range or microcomputers, the equipment can be kept in secured, lock ed rooms, Copies of key data and systems files can be stored in a safe. Frequent back ups of data should be stored sepa rately and securely in a safe. Backups and separate copies enable the small business to replace lost files and mo re quickly resume operations. In addition, these procedures allow the small business to erase virus c ontaminated or altered data and system files. These procedures will some losses and limit opportunistic thieves but not the determined ones. Access Security Small businesses can provide access securi ty by limiting machine use to those empl oyees who have a need to use them. In addition, they should use every security technique provi ded by the software program. For example, most advanced word processing systems allow users to password protect user created data files.(12) The problem with such software protection is that they will foil th e opportunistic insider or outsider but not a knowledgeable one. An experienced hacker can find the password with a utility package and disable it. Some new products are available that pr ovide both physical and access security. An example is a security system by Interlock with software on an additional internal board th at recognizes physical keys, us er identification numbers, and user passwords. Previously authorized employees with th e proper key, identification number, and password can access the computer. The software also logs th e users' identification number, length of use, and the programs or files accessed by the user. A security administrator authorizes employee keys, passwords, identification number, and access to certain specified programs or files. Another product by Micronyx uses a \"securi ty kernel,\" that is stored on an additional board and restricts acce ss, use, input, output, and labels user files. (3) To be effective, such kernels should be transparent to the users, control the disk operating system, and be invisible to hack er's armed with utility packages.(4) Data and Communication Security Some small businesses are using high t echnology to provide a \"niche\" for them selves with computer communication links. This includes small franchises connected to their nati onal office, local credit bureaus, small independent financial institutions, and small businesses with remote sites. Wh ile these communication links allow them to provide unique, fast services, it exposes them to unique computer losses. First remote sites generally ha ve less experienced operators, less security, and are more exposed than the central pro cessing unit.(9) Communication links expose the small business to someone illegally obtaining access and disrupting services, destroying data, or diverting financial transactions for personal gain. The best protections are physical and acce ss security besides data en cryption. Physical and access security limit users to authorized employees who have a le gitimate need to access the syst em. Data encryption prevents the hacker from interpreting the communicated transactions and altering, destroying, or diverting them for personal gain. IBM and the National Security Agen cy developed an algorithm for data encryption standard (DES) devices.(l) This security measure requires hardware and software installed at both ends of the communication link that electronically scramble (encrypt ) the data and de-encrypt it at the receivi ng end. Costs range from inexpensive sets ($600 for two) to very expensive, over $10,000.(1) A problem with encryption is the need to transmit the mathem atical algorithm either physical ly or electronically to both ends of the communication link. This al lows encryption and de-encryption with the same algorithm. Obviously, this transmission must be made safel y without com promisin g the al gorithm or the whole process is ne gated. Local Area Networks Some small businesses have installed Local Area Networks (L ANS) to tie together separate hardware. LANS enable users to share information, data, and programs in a multi- office small business. Exampl es of LAN users are small medical offices, real estate offices, cr edit bureaus, small banks, or other small professional offices. While LANS allow mutual sharing and eliminate the need fo r multiple copies, they expose these fi les and programs to unauthorized access. Required security measures incl ude: file passwords, DOS file restrictions (such as read only), user designated storage areas, user passwords, user identifi cation numbers, and logs of use. Methods Beyond the Scope and Budge s of Most Small Businesses Some methods are beyond the needs and budgets of most smal l businesses at the present. Such methods utilized by large organizations and government security organizations incl ude verifying: fingerprints, signatures, palm prints, hand geometry, eye blood vessels, voice prints, and coded user cards. Risk Analysis The purpose of a risk audit is to deter mine which of the above risks and security measures apply to the individual small business. The audit should examine the small business's pot ential exposures, types of hardware, software, employee use, outsider access, sensitivity of the data, cost to replicate data, physical acc ess of hardware, access to software, and computer communication links. Appendix A contains an audit check list for small businesse s. This check list directs the small business owner to specific areas that warrant attenti on. Any answers that are no's need to be examined and corrected. After the audit is completed the small business needs to make an honest appraisal of the pr obability and effect of a loss occurring for each type of risk. Most large organizations calculate the annual expected loss from each risk. Annual expected losses per risk equal the probabili ty of a loss times the dollar cost of the loss. Large organizations with large numbers of equipment and employees can calculate probabilities and average losses. Most small businesses do not have enough losses per category to calculate me aningful loss and probability data. Some times the probability of a particular loss may be very low but any occurrence would entail seve re losses. An example is a small word processing service maintaining all their customer files on a hard drive. While the probability of a hard drive failure during any particular day is low, eventually every mechanical device will fail. Consequently, the small business needs to determine what,risks would cripple, disrupt their service, lose a client, or endanger their survival despite th e low probability of an occurrence. Developing the Appropriate Security At the conclusion of the risk audit, the small business owner has a better assessment of thei r security risks. The next step is to develop security measures a ppropriate for that small business and its particular situation. For example, small businesses with a few stand alone pc's that are secured in a safe environmen t and how have few users and limited applications should utilize the top four security precautions in Table 1. If the equipment is in open areas with unsupervised access all Table 1 precautions should be implemented. Open access increases the risk of unauthorized misuse or sabotage. As the business's use of computers increases, more empl oyees have access, and more functions are automated, the small business's exposures increase. Cons equently, all the precautions in Tabl e 2 should be used. The systems that protect the machine, limit use, limit use to specific functions, and log users are particularly effective. Many small business now tie together several machines into LANS. While LANS allow users to share software and data files, unauthorized access, sabotag e, and the potential for misuse increase. A developed and enforced company policy will discourage some misuse. Li mited access, software restrictions, user passwords, and logs of user identification numbers are required. If the business includes dial up access to any national organization or from remo te sites to its equipment, then the business needs securit y devices that verif y users, check phone numbers, and call back onl y pre-approved phone numbers. If sensitive or financial data is transmitte d, then it should be encrypted. Developing Security Environments Wood et al.(13) and Perry(9) believe that all organizations need to develop an organization wide environment that makes every employee conscious of security, involved in s ecurity, and willing to implem ent the necessary security steps. Because employee enthusiasm for any program dissolves over time, the small business owner continually needs to train and remind employees. While large businesses can af ford separate security depa rtments, the owner-operator must assume the responsibility of being th e chief security officer. Delegation to a subordinate is possible but creates an additional risk if the subordinate is untrustworthy. Insurance and Legal Coverage Insurance will cover most types of hardware and software losses caused by traditional losses such as fire, theft, and water, but not losses from empl oyee accidents or negligence. Several federal and state laws provide legal coverage. These types of laws pr ovide for prosecuti on of unauthorized access, unauthorized use, mis use, theft, disruption of business serv ices, fraud, and obtaining money under false pretenses.(13) Small business owners shoul d check to see which laws, if any, are operable in their states. In addition, owners should prosecute computer crimes with the vigor they prosecute shoplifting crimes.

IMPACT OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN U.S. LAND ON SMALL FARMERS Samuel K. Moak, Virginia State University Laurie F. Sattler, Flor ida Institute of Technology James E. Turner, Virginia State University ABSTRACT This paper presents the reasons for increasing foreign invest ment in U. S. farmland, the direction of these investments and potential impact on small farmers a nd the farm economy. Relatively lowe r prices of U. S. farmland, highly productive land, and safe inve stment opportunities in land ha ve induced foreign investment . Foreign investment trends indicate a continuing upward direction at slightly higher than the current level of 12 million acres of land. The potential negative impact of foreign investment on small farmers a nd the farm economy appears to outweigh the positive effects of this foreign invasion into U. S. farmland. The considerati ons on price, interest rates, and global trade are key factors in our analysis. The federal government should continue to monitor and regulate foreign investment in U. S. farmland, because of its direct e ffect on the farm economy as well as national secu rity, especially in time of food shortages and war. INTRODUCTION Since the end of World War II, American businesses have been the major investors in foreign countries. American businessmen have exported their knowledge and technology, and gained economic benefits as well as helping foreign nations. However, over the past twenty y ears, that trend has been steadily reversing. The 1973 oil crisis, as a turning point in time, was a major c ontributing factor for this change. The oil crisis of 1973 had a significant impact on U.S. industrial power and the farm sector. At the same time, Japanese and European s were steadily reorganizing their industries and becoming more co mpetitive in global markets [8]. As a resu lt, foreign investors became more active in the world economy with increased focus on investment in U. S. industries and farmland. While this i nvestment has indeed enhanced the American economy and created new employment, a growing concern has been expressed over increased foreign investment in U.S. agricultural land. Throughout time, land ownership has been a basis of wealth and stability for a nation. Sm all farmers were considered the bulwark of democracy and political stability in this country. The land is almost synonymous with the nation itself. These premises are still true today. Especially in an ag e of continuous technological changes,, land use and production of goods have taken on a new value and meaning to small farmers. No doubt, fertile U.S. land has induced foreign interest as a means to enhance and stabilize their own agri cultural economy. This has spar ked a growing concern as to the direction foreign investment is making toward U.S. farmland and the potential impact on our farm economy, especially on small farmers. Conditions of the world economy, coupled with land restrictions in th eir own countries, have provided strong incentives for foreig ners to invest in American farmland, some of the richest and most fertile farmland in the world. The focus of this paper is to provide the reasons for foreign inve stment in U.S. agricultural land, the direction of foreign investment, and an analysis of the impac t this investment may have on small farmers. REASONS FOR INVESTMENT In recent years, foreign investment in U.S. farmland has stea dily risen. It is of importan ce to know the reasons foreign investment has taken place so that policy makers in Washingt on, DC will generate appropr iate economic and legislative decisions. First, many foreign countries are geogra phically smaller in land mass in comparis on to the United States. As a result, their population per acre is greater, forcin g them to seek land elsewhere to accommodate economic ob jectives [4]. Second, the price of land in these count ries is naturally very high compared to American agricultural land. The relatively lower price of U.S. farmland is a great inducement to many of these countries. Foreign countries undoubtedly have placed more of a premium on land acquired out side their saturated country as a means of stabilizing their econom y and agricultural production. Third, foreign investors are aware that U.S. land values ha ve steadily increased over the past three decades, making land a sound investment venture in a safe environment. Foreig n investment in U.S. land can be considered as a hedge against worldwide inflation, and as insurance against political and economic uncer tainties at home [4]. Fourth, foreign investors are also attracted to the U.S. as an investment opportuni ty because of its st able political and social condition. DIRECTION OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT In the early 1970's, the exact amount of acreage owned by foreigners was not readily available due to a lack of reporting laws at the fede ral governmental level. However, in the late 1970's, public concern grew at an alarming rate upon the discovery and publicity surrounding some ma jor foreign purchases of U.S. farmland. One of the outstanding cases involved the selling of the 5,200 acre Zukerman farm located in the rich San Joaquin River Delta of California for 5.8 milli on dollars to foreign investors from Italy. In response to the public outcry, President Jimmy Carter signed the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978 (AFIDA). This law required foreign investors to report their current landholdi ngs, future purchases, leases, and sales to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. While the law has improved the tr acking of foreign investment in U.S. farmland, it has not discouraged foreign investment. It was reported that approximately 2 billi on dollars of farmland sales, estimated as 21 percent of all U.S. farm sales in 1977, involved foreign purchases. By the end of 1979, the first year after AFIDA was enforc ed, it was reported that foreigners bought 5.2 million acr es of U.S. farmland. At the beginning of the 1980's, fore ign purchase of U.S. farmland increas ed rapidly. In 1983, 14 million acres of farmland was owned by foreign investors, an all time record for a single year. Th is represented 1 percent of the total amount of farmland in the Unit ed States. Figure 1 shows foreign investment trends in U.S. land for the period 1974 through 1988. After reaching the peak of a single year in 1983, foreign investment declined slightly and has leveled. The reasons for this leveling since 1985, can be explained by the fact s that many states restri cted foreign purchase of land and a global economy weak ened during this period. ------------------- ----------------- ----------------- ---------------- -- Figure 1.

C., Apri l, 1989. ------------ ----------------- ---------------- --------------- ---------- In the latter part of the 1980's, foreign investment increased slight ly from the 1985 level. Foreign individuals and entities owned 12.5 million acres of U.S. farmland in 1988 [2]. This figure represents 99,,100 acres more than was reported in 1987. The trend seems to indica te continuous influx of foreign investme nt in U.S. farmland at the present level , for the foreseeable future. CONCENTRATION OF FOREIGN OWNED LAND In 1980, almost half of all states had so me form of legislation re stricting foreign ownership of U. S. farmland. In 1978, Missouri passed one of the most restrict ive laws, stating that a nonr esident alien could not acquire more than 5 acres of land for the purpose of farmin g. However, man y states still have ver y little re gulation a gainst forei gn ownershi p of farmland. In 1988, foreign investors owned farm acreage in 49 states, Puerto Rico, and Quam. The only state with no reported foreign ownership of land was Rhode Isla nd. Significant concentrati ons of foreign owned land are reported in the South and West, which constitute 36 and 35 pe rcent of all reported foreign holdings of U.S. farmland, respectively [2]. Surprisingly, the largest amount of foreign owned U.S. farm land is in Maine, representing 10 percent of the state farmland and 14 percent of all foreign owned farmland in the United States. The attraction in Maine for foreign investors is the rich timberland of that state. Foreign interests currently cont rol almost 1.8 million ac res of this state. Foreign countries with the largest owne rship of total U.S. acres are Canada and Mexico. These tw o countries have a substantial interest in U.S. investment ventures with 13.2 percent of the tota l acres owned. Other countries such as West Germany and the Netherlands show a st rong European interest in U.S. farmland. While Japan ranks 9th overall with 146,604 acres owned, in 1988, Japan's interest in purchasing U. S. farmland is increasing. Japan has special interests in American beef and ranch properties. In Oct ober 1988, a Japanese company bought an 80,000 acre ranch in Montana for 13 million dollars for the purpose of producing beef for consumption in Japan. In January 1989, a Japanese firm named Mt. Shasta Be ef, purchased a 6,000 acre ranc h in Northern California for 2.2 million dollars. This investment was after Japan abolished their trade re strictions against importing U.S. beef [3]. In March 1989, filet mignon was priced at $43 per pound in Tokyo [5]. Increased Japanese investment should make beef prices in Japan more affordable to consumers. Agricultural landholdings, by type of fore ign owners, indicate that foreign individuals were the largest number of investors in U.S. farmland. This seems to conform to the premise that foreign individuals seek both the political and economic security of the United States in this time of global uncertainties. The next highest number of landholders were foreign corporations, followed by partnerships. Howe ver, foreign corporations owned the largest acreage; 9,976,640 acres compared to 936,053 acres owned by foreign indi viduals. Obviously, corporat ions and partnerships have stronger financial resources. A siza ble part of the land held (34.7 percent) represents a pure European interest, which includes a number of joint ventures . It appears that foreign interests feel more secure in en tering ventures in conjunction with U.S. corporations when they purchased farmland. Public opinion is less likely to feel threatened in this way and foreign ownership is tole rated.

It may have both positive and nega tive influence. First, foreign purchases of U.S. farmland make small farm ers and other citizens uneasy. Th ey feel a sense of economic invasion by foreign nationals. This is a psychological and sociological impact. Second, small farmers may receive benefits with increases in farm empl oyment, and improved technological operations infused into the farm sector by foreign investors. Japane se investment should also be a boost for farmers who sell supplies and expertise to th e new beef producers [5]. Third, future world food requirements may have a signifi cant effect on the U.S. farm economy. Forecasts of global food requirements indicate that there may be food shortages. Food requireme nts for human consumption will grow ra pidly,, as populations increase, primaril y in develo ping countries, and because of chan ges in diets where more animal proteins are consumed. As foo d-import countries increase their needs, they may turn to American farmland as an opportunity to decrease their de bt. If so, this may become an increasing threat to the American farm economy, and become a national security issue as well [1]. Fourth, interest and exchange rates will have a significant impact in shapi ng the conditions of the American farm economy. Any directions of foreign investme nt that either increase or decrease interest rates will significantly affect small farmers and their ability to produce a nd compete in the marketplac e. Farm expenses are directly related to interest levels. If interest rates are high, small farmers will have difficulty in maki ng the appropriate loan for production and marketing. If foreign investment increases to a significan t level, this may negatively effect the farm sector. Prices will also be a key factor in the overall economic future of the farm econom y and agro-business. If price supports continue, there is likelihood that surplus will continue to appear. This will di stort an optimum resource allocation. If prices are allowed to seek their own level in the free market, then resource allocation in th e farm sector will achieve a reasonable balance, especially in the long run [6]. Farm prices play a pivotal role in influe ncing foreign investment. If prices force a farmer to sell his property to pursue other means of making a living, foreign sp eculation is more likely to step in and capitalize on the farmers' loss. Lastly, the Federal government must modi fy and regulate U.S. farm policies, based on future trends which dictate foreign investment in U.S. fa rmland. American agriculture, especially smal l farmers, has been buffeted by instability from macroeconomic, global trade, and farm policies [7]. It is the responsibility of the federal government to ensure a high degree of stability, and monitor the economic posture of the farm sector. The steady pace of future foreign investment ventures may have serious consequence on the fa rm economy in price, interest rate, production, marketing, and trade. SUMMARY In this paper, we discussed the reasons for foreign invest ment ventures in this count ry, the direction of foreign investment, and provided an analysis of the potential impact this may have on the farm economy and small farmers. It is important for the federal government to continue to moni tor foreign investment in U.S. agricultural land through the AFIDA to determine future trends and potential legislative requirements. Major reasons for foreign investment in U.S. farmland include (1) larger land mass in the United States, (2) relatively lower price of U.S. farmland per acre, co mpared to the price in foreign countri es, (3) steady price increase of U.S. farmland over the past three decades, making a safe and sound i nvestment venture, and (4) po litical and social stability in the United States, making attr active investment opportunities dur ing a time of global unrest. The direction of foreign inve stments indicate that 1983 was a recordbreaki ng year when foreign investors owned one percent of the total U.S. farmland in a single year. After reaching the peak in 1983, foreign investment declined slightly and has leveled. This leveling since 1985, is primarily because that many states restricted foreign purchase of land and the uncertainty of global economic conditions. The potential impact of foreign invest ment on small farmers and the farm sect or includes (1) a negative psychological and sociological impact, (2) so me positive benefits to smal l farmers in the form of fa rm employment and technological and managerial skills resulti ng from foreign investment, (3) potential nega tive effect on the U.S. farm economy and national security in a time of worldwid e food shortages and war, (4) potential negative influence on interest rates and farm prices and its consequence on small farmers, and (5) potential pressure on the federal government to monitor and regulate foreign investment so that stabil ity of the farm economy may be achieved.

COST CONSIDERATIONS IN SELECTING AN EXPORT DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL Arley A. Howard, New Mexico State Univ ersity, Las Cruces, MN 88003 (505) 646-4901 ABSTRACT Europe 1992 presents numerous opportunities for small busi nesses. Many of these small businesses are not in a position to make entries into the international market in th e form of joint ventures or mergers and acquisitions. They must rely on existing distribution channels . This paper considers costs and revenue s associated with various choices of export distribution channels. COST CONSIDERATIONS IN SELECTING AN EXPORT DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL Europe 1992 presents unprecedented opportunities and challenge s for the small business. The most obvious opportunity is the potential access to a unified mark et of over 320 million individuals. In addition, the European Community (EC) is proposing standardization of custom laws and regulations, as well as product standards and exchange rates. Such standardization can only result in the re moval of many of the current barriers to trading in the international markets. There is also increased support available to small busine sses contemplating an overseas market. The Small Business Administration offers both financing a nd counseling. The Export-Import Bank of the United States offers a wide variety of business loans and loan guara nties. Export credit insu rance may be obtained through agencies such as the Foreign Credit Insurance Asso ciation and the Overseas Priv ate Investment Corporation. Th is increased support surely underlines the potential opportunities available to small businesses. In contrast to the aforementioned opportunities, small busin esses could face formidable challenges to entering the European market. The first of these relates to the reason why members of the European Community first decided to unite. Their purpose is to compete with the United States and Japan on a worl dwide basis and that purpose may very well lead to a protectivist policy which excludes many who might otherwise prof itably export to the EC. It is quite possible that the EC will impose tariffs a nd quotas--particularly on those products which are in direct competition with products of their members. It is also possible that local content laws may become even more restrictive, necessitating increasing concern regarding the \"economic nationality\" of a product. These fears have led to an increasing number of joint ventures and mergers and acquisitions between Eur opeans and U.S.owned companies in efforts to position themselves should these fears be wellfounde d. In addition, some larger firms have opened their own plants within the EC, thus not only establishing a physical presence, but dealing effectively with the national origin problem as well. But for many small businesses, joint ventures and/or merger s and acquisitions may be neit her economically feasible nor desirable. Initial investments and ongoing costs of operations may be prohibitive to sm all businesses attempting to establish a presence in the European market. In fact, rather than attempting to establish an actual physical presence in international markets, smaller busi- nesse s, for the most part, deal with foreign distributors. In a recent survey of 65 firms exporting electrical products, machin e tool builders, food equipment, and fluid power industry tools, it was determined that the most commonly used channels of dist ribution were sales representatives and export distributors located on foreign soil (7). A business normally should seek to maximi ze its contribution margin and to incr ease its market share. To do this effectively in the international market involves a thorough investigation of poten tial export distribution channels and careful consideration of the possible co sts, revenues and risks associated with each. Bowersox (3) suggested that there were three broad functions that may be performed by\" ch annel members: the exchange function of buying and selling; the physical distribution function of tr ansportation and storage; and the faci litating functions of standardization, marketing financing, risk bearing, and market informa tion and research. Depending upon the distribution channel selected, some or all of these functions may be assume d by the channel member. Any function assumed by the channel member reduces the cost of that function for the originating company. As small and midsized businesses position themselves for entr y into the international market, their first step should be to carefully examine their reasons for en tering this market. Does the company want the EC as the main market for its goods? Does it intend to sell only excess goods? Sell seconds or goods of poorer quality? Is the EC to be looked upon as a su pplementar y market rather than the main market? Answers to these questions re gardin g the firm's marketin g goals is the first step to determining a cohesive market ing strategy when considering exporting goods. Once the firm has established its intentions in enteri ng the international market , it should identify a target market for its product or products. Following this essential process, the small business is ready to examine potential channel members. There are a number of options when considering an export distribution channel. The firm must first determine whether an indirect distribution channel or a direct distribu tion channel is more suited to its part icular needs. An indirect distribution channel is domestic-based, with firms actually located on U.S. soil, while a direct distribut ion channel is foreign-based. Although an initial reaction might be that it would be more effective to select a direct distribution channel since it implies direct customer contact and knowle dge of the area by the distributor, re search has shown that direct exporting is preferable only if the customers are geographically homogeneous, have simi lar buying habits, and are limited in number. Indirect exporting appears to be preferable when customers and buying habits are heterogeneous and a number of different methods of exporting are necessary (6). Therefor e, the choice of a direct vs. indirect distribution channel would seem to be dependent upon the target market (s) identified and the intended export product. If a firm decides that indire ct distribution is most compatible with its marketing strategy, it has a choice between dealing with agents (those firms which do not take title to the goods), or with merchant middlemen (those firms which actually take title). Agents includ e export management companies, manufac turer's export agents, Webb-Pomerene Association members, foreign freight forwarders, commissi on agents, country controlled buying offices, and selling groups.These agents perform different f unctions. An export management company (EMC) is a U.S. firm which handles all aspects of export operations under a c ontractual agreement. A manufacturer's ex port agents essentially the same as an EMC except that it covers limited markets and is under contract for a short time only (a few months to a year). Members of the Webb-Pomerene Associat ion represent a group of manufacturers who are exempt from antitrust laws as a result of the Webb-Pomerene Ac t of 1918. Foreign freight forwarders sp ecialize in handling overseas shipping arrangements, while commission agents re present foreign clients interested in buying U.S. goods. Country controlled buying offices act as official buyers for foreign government s, and selling groups are U.S. firms who sell excess capacity overseas. Merchant middlemen relieve the company of a great deal of risk in taking title to the goods, frequently resulting in significant cost savings. Within an indirect distribu tion channel, a small business may choose among export merchants, who buy directly from the manuf acturers according to their specifications, cooperative exporters, who distribute other manufact urer's goods along with their own on a contractual basis, or export vendors who specialize in buying poor qua lity or overproduced goods. Direct distribution channels also incl ude agents and middlemen merchants. A firm may deal with export brokers, purchasing agents, sales represen tatives, factors, or managing agents, if it wishes to retain title to the goods. Export brokers bring foreign buyers a nd U.S. sellers together. A purchase agent ope rates in the U.S. searching for products of interest to foreign buyers. Sales representatives, armed wi th literature and samples from the exporting company, travels abroad developing interest in the company's products. Fact ors perform normal brokerage functions, but also finance sales transactions. Managing agents have exclusive contr actual arrangements with a parent company, while working within a foreign country. If the firm wishes to relinquish title (and accompanying risk), it may choose am ong export distributors, retailers, export jobbers, or trading companies. Export distributors purchase goods from U.S. companies at the greatest possible discount and then resell them at a profit. Using a retailer involves dealing directly with a foreign retailer who then sells the goods through its own outlets. Export jobbers fill specific foreign custom er needs by purchasing from U.S. companies. Trading companies are usua lly country-specific import- export agen cies who handle export activities and are frequently responsible for an exclusive product specialty. With this multitude of choices, how does a small business de termine which distribution cha nnel will be most effective for its particular objectives? It seems obvious that the firm 's intention in marketing in ternationally will have a significant bearing on which distributio n channels may be available. Certai n types of channel members handle only certain types of transactions. Initially, th ere will be a sort of \"natur al selection\" which will result in consideration of only those types of channel members who specialize in the so rts of transaction a firm de sires (e.g., marketing of excess goods, poorer quality goods, etc.). Within this group, however, there may be a num ber of potential agencies who could perform the functions desired by the firm, and the small bus iness must decide which of these would be the most effective. Such a decision necessitates a careful consideration of proj ected revenues and costs associ ated with each potential channel member. Once the field has been narrowed down to th e above, a firm should list al l potential channel members, regardless of t ype, as lon g as these channel members have been identified as bein g capable of accom plishin g the task. At this point, these channel members should be screened by the firm's management on the basis of compatibility, availability and individual orga nizational characteristics (9). Compatibility serves as the initial screen. This should be evaluated in terms of the channel member's market covera ge, its functional capabilities , its service capacity, overall image, and any other qualities deemed im portant to the exporting company. Such cr iteria will be of special importance if the exporting firm has decided on a di rect distribution channel, since the re putation of a foreign- based company would be vital to projected sales of a ny product. Availability relates to whether or not the considered channel member is willing to become a part of the e xporter's channel structure. Organizational characteristics of the potential channel member involve considerable judgment on the part of the exporting firm pertaini ng to the probable performance of the channel member, its growth potenti al and its financial stability. Once this screening has taken place to li mit potential channel members, the firm is in a position to project revenues and costs for each considered member. Projected revenue is the starting point for any effectiv e cost analysis. This will involve variable price setting and seri ous consideration of expected sales by each potential channel member. Pricing structure for a particular produ ct may differ depending on whether a channel is direct or indirect. More costs and more risks are associated with direct channels than with indirect. Within each of these areas, price differentials may exist wi th respect to whether the potential channel member is an agent or a merchant middleman. Since me rchant middlemen take ti tle to the goods, many of the costs associated with marketing overseas are held by the middlemen, and not by th e originating company. Prices to merchant middlemen would therefore be lower than prices through agents. Beyond this level, prices may change based upon the type of agent or middleman. For example, sin ce export management companies are comp ensated in the form of commissions or from discounts on goods purchased for e xport, selling prices to these groups ma y be lower than selling prices to other indirect agents. Although such vari able pricing analysis is time-consuming, careful analysis of potential revenues is an essential step in the anal ysis of distribution channels. Once revenues have been projected for each channel member under consideration, costs associated with that channel member must also be estimated. These costs should be separated into one-time non-recurring costs and on-going expenses, as well as fixed and variable components. It should be noted that fi xed costs per channel member may vary depending upon the functions undertaken by that channel memb er and/or the marketing support necessary. One-time start-up costs should be estimated for each channel member and costs and availability of capital must be analyzed. The small business must evaluate its capital requirements, and it s capability to acquire and repay any financing it might need. Variable production cost for a particular product should be the same for all potential cha nnel members, so the total variable production cost for each channe l member would be based on expected sa les volume. Commissions or fees to the distributor must be considered in most of the agent situat ions, regardless of whether the ch annel is direct or indirect. Since commissions are normally a percentage of sales, the wisdom of projecting a relevant sales figure becomes readily apparent. Certain agents, however, do not require a commi ssion from the exporter. These include foreign freight forwarders who receive a discount or fee from the shipping company, and com mission and purchasing agents, who are paid by their foreign clients. In addition, country controlle d buying offices are usually pa id by the foreign government for whom they work, and managing agents operate under an exclusive contractual arrangement with the parent company on a cost-plus basis. Distribution costs must be included in all cases, although once again, these will vary with the particular distribution channel contemplated. Distribution cost s cover a wide variety of functional areas, including transportation costs, inventory holding costs, warehousing, tari ffs and duties, and insurance. Transpor tation costs will differ subject to distance, method of transportation selecte d, time constraints and shipping terms. Shipping to indirect channels in the United States will normally be less expensive than shi pping the product overseas to direct channel members, depending upon the shipping terms. Considering only indirect channels, dealing through agen ts, rather than me rchant middlemen, would be more expensive since middlem en would take title to the goods and assume the overseas shipping costs. Shipping products internationally will obviously result in higher costs than shipping domestically, regardless of whether the shipping is to an agent or a middleman. Choices are to ship to the final buyer via an agent, or to a middleman merchant. Once middlemen merchants take title to the goods, fu rther shipping costs are their responsibility. Methods of shipping and time constraints are directly related. In considering how to ship, the exporter must recognize that all methods of shipping are not avai lable in all locations. He must investigate and price the various shipping modes for each channel member. In addition, he must wei gh the trade-off between slower (cheaper) shipping modes a gainst possible time constraints and customer satis faction. Shipping terms, pa rticularly in the area of international marketing, should be carefully analyzed with respect to who pays which co sts. It should be noted that if the seller pays all shipping costs, the price of the product should be correspondingly higher than if the buyer assumes part or all of the cost. Inventory holding costs increase the l onger the exporter holds his inventory. C onsequently, one way, of reducing such costs is to turn the inventory as rapi dly as possible. Merchant middlemen, who take title to the goods, also take on the costs of holding the inventory. Agents, on the other hand, do not incur inventory holding costs--either the exporter does, waiting for the agent to generate orders, or the buye r does, having ordered specific goods in the hope of selling these overseas. Cost of warehousing a product can vary dr amatically. In theory, products should be centrally located to the selected distributor in order to decrease transportation costs. In actuality, the cost of warehousing such products domestically and internationally needs to be weighed against probabl e demand and the possibility of import quotas. Warehousing may be neither desirable nor necessary. It may be preferable to simply ship directly fro m the originating company in the case of small businesses. Costs of warehousing at various locations should be closely investigated. Tariffs and duties normally will be incurred by the owner of the merchandise at the tim e an international border is crossed. In most cases, that is the seller. This implies th at if an exporter uses indir ect distribution, only sales to merchant middlemen will allow him to escape the tariff and duty costs. This is not necessarily the case. Certain domestic agents, e.g., commission agents and country-controll ed buying offices, buy on behalf of foreign clients. Since the goods are purchased in the United States, the buyers assume responsibility for tariffs and duties. The same situation does not hold when considering direct di stribution. In situations where the ag ent is acting on behalf of a foreign principal, the buyer generally pays tari ffs and duties. On the other hand, use of merchant middlemen for direct distribution does not necessarily relieve the original sell er of tariff and duty costs. Since the buyer (merchant middleman) is located overseas, the seller (the exporter) is normally liabl e for tariff and duty. Insurance costs of marketing internationally must also be analyzed. Exporters are susceptible to risks of war, expropriation, and currency inconvertibility, in addition to the usual commercial losses resulting from insolvency or default. Much of the risk (and cost) may be averted th rough the use of domestic mercha nt middlemen. The risk is increased when the small business attempts direct distributi on. At that point, the small bus iness should consult with the Foreign Credit Insurance A ssociation (FCIA) and Overseas Private Investment Corporation Insurance (OPIC Insurance). FCIA offers umbr ella policies to companies who are either ne w to exporting or who have limited export experience. OPIC Insurance insures prim arily against political risks. Unlike th e FCIA, OPIC Insurance does not insure against commercial risk. In analyzing costs associated with pros pective channel members, the firm shoul d not neglect the concept of marketing support costs. Advertising, customer disc ounts, promotional materials, in addition to frequent visits from the exporter, may be necessary to generate demand for the product. Any marketing support costs should be estimated for each potential channel member. Once all of these costs have been estimated, the small busin ess is in a position to evaluate the potential channel members. Projected revenues le ss estimated costs should give the firm a bette r picture of estimated income by channel member. Viewing the estimated income figure, the firm s hould also take into consider ation the expected growth potential of the channel members being analyzed. Lower earni ngs in earlier years may be countered by higher earnings in later years. Although no one knows for certain what will happen in 1992, there is general agreement that a united European Community presents numerous opportunities for U.S. busin esses. Small businesses ar e already a part of the international market. For those businesse s who are unable or unwilling to enter that market through joint ventures or mergers and acquisitions, sele ction of the proper export distribution cha nnel is of paramount importance. Careful consideration of the costs and revenues associated with the, potential channe l members is a crucial part of the selection process.

Kirk, Drake University, Des Moines, IA 50311 ABSTRACT In order to determine variables that affect whether a sm all business would engage in active exporting, a questionnaire was used to identify differences in \"active\" and \"passive\" exporters. A s econd telephone survey was conducted of exporters and non-exporters to examine differences between the two groups. A pr ofile of active exporters was then developed involving factors of size, annu al sales, product differentiation, e xporting experience, management, location of firm, and perception of risk to a ssist both current exporters and non-exporte rs in becoming \"active\" or high-volume exporters. INTRODUCTION The national trade deficit in th e United States has been a matter of real concern since the early 1970's and has led to numerous articles and studies regardi ng exporting of goods. Although a number of programs have been proposed and some even implemented in order to lessen imports, it is now obvious that a greater need lies in increasing exports. A number of federal and local orga nizations had been established to look at this need and to assist firms in adopting an export strategy. As about 98 percent of the nation's busine sses have fewer than 100 employees (Trewatha, 1988), one important strategy would be to assist small businesses in becoming exporters. The purpose of this paper then is twofold: to examine small fi rms that are currently engage d in exporting in order to determine differences between \"passive\" or low-volume exporters and \"active\" or high-volume exporters a nd second to examine exporters and non- exporters to determine variables which af fect whether or not the fi rms engage in active expor ting. Once identified, the non-exporters that fit the prof ile for potential high -volume exporting can then be ta rgeted for financial and other support to enable them to become \"active\" exporters. Previous Research A number of studies in the past decade have examined various aspects of th e exporting question. Many of these have concentrated on analyzing curr ent exporters in order to determine which va riables affected their decision to export. Bilkey (1982) studied 168 Wisconsin ma nufacturing firms to examine variables associated with profitability of exporting. Other studies (Czinkota & Johnston, 1983; Bilke y, 1978; Wiedersheim-Paul, et al, 1978) looked at management attitudes, charac teristics, and perceptions a bout exporting as a key factor in a firm's export decision. Perceptions of risk and \"peer pressure \" from competitors are also viewed as factors (Root, 1987; Bilkey, 1978). In addition, other studies have distinguished firms that actively export from those which engage in \"sporadic\" exporting. Sporadic exporters would fill unsolicited orders but do not aggressively pursue exporting. Bilkey (1978) states that many firms enter exporting in this way. However, Czinkot a & Johnston (1983) state th at higher-volume exporters usually actively solicit their first export order. Other research has concentrated on dete rmining differences between firms that export and those which choose not to export. Location within large popula tion areas (Wiedersheim-Paul et al , 1978) and product uniqueness (Root, 1987; Bilkey, 1978) were often cited as factors leading to the exporti ng decision. Size is considered to be a critical factor in the decision to export (Jatusripitak, 19 84; Reid, 1985; Bilkey, 1978). Czinkota & Johnston (1983) concentrated on size of the exporting firm in relationship to problems inherent in exporting. Smaller firms are said to be less likely to export. In one article, several sources were quoted saying that \"small business manufacturers . . . lack the resources and time to explore overseas trade opportunities,\" and that smaller firms were \"less aware of the potential of exporting and less confident about their ability to do it\" a nd thus needed more help than larger firms in beginning to export (Czinkota & Johnston, 1985: 158). However, according to Wiedersheim-Paul, Olson & Welch (1978) most firms are small when the y first start ex portin g. In addition, as noted in a stud y by the U.S. De partment of Commerce, small-to-medium sized firms could potentially sell 51 percent of U.S. exports, although currently they only account for 16 percent (Edmunds & Khoury, 1986). As stated by Reid (1985) there has been \"no conclusive evidence as to the relevance of firm size to exporting.\" According to Reid, one major reason for this is lack of interest on the part of researchers. Howe ver, as the trend toward small businesses increases into the year 2000, this represents an important area of research into the \"how's\" and \"why's\" of exporting behavior. Methodology Iowa was chosen for the study as it is an \"above average\" state for exporting, ranking 17th nationally in total value of exports (IA Dept. of Economic Developm ent, 1988). An estimated 22 percent of all Iowa manufacturers export to foreign markets. However, none export more than 20 percent of their total sales, and on ly a few export more than 10 percent. This clear orientation toward domestic markets indicates that there is definitely room to expand foreign sales. Two surveys were conducted in order to examine variables that affect whether or not an organization would engage in active exporting. The first study used a questionnaire that wa s mailed to the CEO's or plant managers of all Iowa manufacturers who had exported products in the past year. Information on exporting activity was gained from the Iowa Manufacturers Directory. A total of 544 exporters were identified and 198 us able questionnaires were retu rned, a response rate of 36.4 percent. Questions regardi ng the percentage of total sales that resulted from exporting, num ber of years firms have been engaged in exporting and the countries exporting to, along wi th percentage of sales from each country were asked. Also, information was collected on export methods, future e xporting investment and expectat ions, and export terms. In addition, information about the firms was obtained, including num ber of employees, annual sales, and type of products exported. After analyzing the data from the questionnaires, the second survey was then conducted by telephone. Two groups were developed using the Iowa Manufact urers Directory. One group represented fi rms that did export and the other was composed of firms that did not engage in exporting. A to tal of 58 firms were randomly chosen to be contacted by telephone. Of these, 32 were exporters, of which 27 resulted in usable information (a response rate of 84%). Twenty-six non-exporters were originally chosen, with 19 completed ca lls obtained (a response rate of 73%). In order to be considered usable information, the CEO or plant manager had to be contacted and complete answers given to a set of questions previously chosen. The questionna ire had been pretested for clarity and face validity with calls made to two exporters and two non-exporters. Calls we re made during normal business hours. The first three questions in th e telephone survey dealt with a general attit ude toward exporting. These statements were taken from a study done in Illi nois on export attitudes, a nd had been tested for validity (Jatusripitak, 1984). These questions were modified slightly to allow for ease in completing the questionna ire during the telephone interview. In addition, questions on geographic market , product differentiation, export paybac k, and after-sales support were used that had been previously developed by a Bradley University research team to quiz potential exporters (Cavusgil and Monahan, 1987). These questions were also modified for ease of questionnaire completion. Also, additional questions were asked as to the respondent's fo reign living experience and language abil ity. The exporters were asked five additional questions aimed at their expe riences with exporting. As many of th e questions involved nominal data, the Chi-square test was chosen to te st for significance in the data. Results of mailed survey of exporters A survey of 198 exporters was used in order to examine the relationship between the vol ume of exporting and the size of a firm, years of exporting experience, number of countries to which products are exported, and the location of the firm. Volume of exporting was determined in terms of the percent of sales exported by a firm. A \"passive\" exporter was defined as one exporting less than five percent of annual sales while an \"a ctive\" exporter would be those firms exporting five percent or more of sales. Obviously, the terms \"passive\" and \"activ e\" will only be relative here; howev er, as many profit margins in small business are fairly small (5-10%), exporting may become a si gnificant concern for management as success or failure in ex portin g can greatly affect the firm's profitabilit y. An examination of the passive and active exporters was made as to the number of employees and total annual sales. Of particular interest was the exporting beha vior of small firms. Firms with a gr eater number of employees were more likely to show a higher volume of exporting. Of passive ex porters, almost three-fourth s had 100 or fewer employees compared to 64 percent of the active exporters with 100 or fewer employees. Ho wever, this was not a statistically significant difference (p < .20). Looking at the size of th e firms by annual sales, again there was no significant difference between those firms with a higher volume of exporting and those with a lower volume (p < .20). The majority of the exporters had annual sales of $10 million or less. Thus, there was no signi ficant statistical difference between active and passive exporters an d size (as measured by either number of employees or annual sales). The firms were al so examined to determine years of experience in exporting, measured in terms of both \"sustained\" and \"sporadic\" exporting. Sporadic exporting meant that the firm did not activ ely seek out exporting but would respond to unsolicited orders . Eight percent of the exporters engaged in only \"sporadic\" exporting. Almost all of these (22 of the 24 firms) were low-volume or \"passive\" exporters. Of those firms which indicate d that they engaged in \"sustained\" exporting, almost half had exported for 10 years or more. Thus , if a firm reported sustai ned exporting, they were much more likely to export at a higher volume (p < .001). An examination was made of the number of countries to wh ich the firms exported with th e assumption that as firms export to more countries they are more likely to fall into the \"active\" category. Over 80 percent of the firms exported to more than one country. About half exported to two to five countries. Active exporte rs were in fact mo re likely to export to more countries than passive firms (p < .001). Methods of payment and marketing strategies were examined next. A number of c hoices were given as terms offered to overseas buyers. The majority of exporters indicated that \"cash in advance\" wa s the preferred payment plan. The next frequent choice was \"open account,\" which means that th e exporter expects payment when the buyer receives the shipment of goods. There were no significan t differences between active and passive exporters as to preferred payment terms. Marketing strategies were also analyzed. This was aimed at determini ng whether the exporter had a separate export unit to solicit export business, or used a separate company such as an Export Management Company (EMC), or handled exporting out of their domestic marketing department. Almost two-thir ds of the exporters used their own domestic marketing department. However, active exporters were much less likely to use their own domestic marketing depa rtment than passive exporters. In fact, active exporters (23% compared to 8% of the passive exporte rs) were sta- tistically more likely to have a separate export unit to actively pursue export sales (p < .05). In addi tion, the research showed that these exporters were more likely to handle the exports them- selves rather than using intermediaries such as EMC'S. The exporters were then asked how they anticipated exporting would change for their firm over the next three years. The majority of the respondent s indicated they believed that exports w ould increase by 10 percent or more. Active exporters were more likely to believe th at this increase would take place than passive exporters (70% compared to 55%), although this was not statistically significant. About a third stated that exporting volume would remain stable and only a very small percentage of the exporters (7%) t hought that exports would decreas e or be discontinued over the next three years. Finally, location of each exporter was checked to determin e if the firm was located in a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA). It was believed that perhaps location might af fect volume of exporting. However, only about one-third of the exporters were located in SMSA's and ther e was very little difference be tween the active and passive ex-porters (34% compared to 31%). Thus location of the firm within an SM SA was not related to export volume. Results of Telephone Survey After careful examination of the data collected on existi ng exporters, a second study was made of both exporters and non- exporters by telephone to ascertain differences between the two groups. In formation on number of employees and the amount of annual sales was gathered firs t in order to determine if the size of the firm would be positively related to a decision to export. The exporting firms were fairly evenly spread out among the employee size categories. However, 75 percent of the non-exporting fi rms were in the \"l to 10\" employee cate gory. By using a cut- off of 10 or less employees and over ten employees, a significant Chi-square of 14.09 was obtained (p < .001). A look at annual sales shows that 89 percent of non-e xporters had annual sales of less than $3 mi llion compared to 41 percent of exporters with annual sales of less than $3 million. A third of the ex porters had sales of $10 million or more. Usin g $3 million as the cut-off, a significant Chi-square of 10.86 was obtained (p < .001). Thus, ther e is a significant difference between exporters and non-exporters as to size of the firm as measured by number of employees and total annual sales. Another question asked both exporters and non-exporters had to do with their percep tions as to the need for post-sales support. However, the overwhelming majo rity of both groups did not believe that considerable post-sales support was necessary. Thus, the idea that postsales support requirements would be negatively related to the decision to export was not support by the survey data. This potential cost of overseas customers is apparently not seen as a barrier to exporting. Product differentiation or uniqueness of a product in the world market was t hought to be an incentive to export. However, the exporters and non-exporters we re fairly evenly split on this questi on. Forty-eight percent of the exporters and 42 percent of the non-exporters stated that their product was unique or signi fi- cantly different from others in the market. Thus, there was no significant difference between the two groups in regard to product differentiation. An additional area examined was the domestic market ar ea of the two groups. The U.S. geographic market was delineated into four categories: (1) Iowa only, (2) Midwest only, (3) Midwest plus other regions of the country, and (4) Nationwide. It was thought that the size of the U.S. domesti c market would be positively re- lated to the decision to export. In fact, two-thirds of the expor ters did have nationwide product distributi on and none indicated that they limited themselves to Iowa or the Midwest only. By contrast, two-thirds of the non-exporters were at the Iowa or Midwest only level. This proved to be a statistical ly significant difference between export ers and non-exporters and their domestic product market (p < .001). Business owners' preference fo r short versus long-term investments was in vestigated with the thought that foreign markets could take some time to cultivate. The question as ked was whether the firm woul d \"accept a payback of three years or more\" if considering investi ng in a new project. More of the exporters (18 out of 27 or 67%) would accept a longer payback period as compared to the non-exporters (11 out of 19 or 58%) although this was not a statistically different percentage. Thus, the idea th at acceptance of a projec t payback period of three years or more would be positively related to the decision to export was not supported by the data. A possible barrier to exporting often cited in the literature is the perception of risk. When the two groups were asked about this perceived risk, two-thirds of the exporters stated that they believ ed exporting was not risky. This contrasts with the non-exporters who were fairly split on this question although 21 percent st ated that they really did not know how much risk was involved. Thus, although the perception that business owners would deci de not to export because o f a high risk involved in exporting was not supported by the su rvey, more of the non-exporte rs were ill-informed about the possible risks in exporting. Next, a general management attitude toward exporting and international trade was examin ed to look at differences between the two groups. However, both exporters and non-expor ters tended to agree with the statement, \"Selling in export markets is likely to increase a firm's overall profit.\" In addition, essentially the same proportion of the two groups agreed with the statements , \"Increasing international co mpetition increases the need for American businesses to export\" and \"Export trade is beneficial to all nations involved.\" Interesting enough, although these questions were taken from a nother survey (Jatusripitak, 1984), the re sults in this study differ somewhat. Thus, the idea that business owners general favorable attitude toward exporting is positively related to the decision to export is not supported by this data. Another area of interest had to do with business owners ' experience with both living overseas and foreign language ability. These two attributes were viewed as greatly influencing whether they decided to export. However, only three exporters and two non-exporters in the st udy had lived in another country (not including Canada). In addition, only one exporter and two non-exporters ha d proficiency in a foreign language. Clearly then, these are not requirements to the export decision. A last question concerned the location of the firm. Previous research (Wiede rsheim-Paul, et al, 1978) indicated that plant location was related to likelihood to export both because of \"peer pressure\" from other exporters and because of the availability of exporter services such as export management companies. As defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, there are 11 \"metro politan\" counties located in ei ght different Standard Metro politan Statistical Areas (SMSA's ) out of the 99 counties in Iowa. Most of the sample respondents ( 38 out of 46) were not locate d in metropolitan countries. Interestingly, all but one of those firms in metropolitan count ies did not export, a result just the opposite of that expected. Apparently, location of th e firm within an SMSA does not affect the decision to export. Conclusions The first part of this study i ndicates that there are differ ences between \"passive\" and \"a ctive\" exporters and that a profile for active exporters can be developed. Volume of exporting, as indi cated by percentage of sales, appears to be important when it reaches the five percen t level. Therefore, for exporting to make any difference to a small business the amount of exporting should be at least 5%. This is important for persons working with small firms to know as well as for the small business owners themselves. It presents a goal th at should be targeted in order for a small business to be successful in exporting. Size of firm for active vs. passi ve exporters appears to make little, if any, difference. The trend in the data, however, supported the idea that the greater the num ber of employees, the more likely the firm is to be an active exporter. This is not surprising in light of the fact that if a company is goi ng to make greater efforts, it probably takes more people to accomplish this. Years of experience in exporting was a factor with the active exporters. This appears to be a critical variable. Firms have to commit to exporting in order to have it make a difference. It cannot be just something that a firm dabbles with if pos itive returns are expected. Another important difference between th e passive and active exporters is the num ber of countries to which the firms export. Small businesses cannot limit them selves to only one country. Several c ountries, between tw o and five, should be developed as markets. Di versification is important for active exporters . In addition, one of the more interesting differences between passive and active exporters was in the area of company location. According to this study, location in a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) makes no difference. This is exciting in that small firms do not have to be bound by geographic location in their decision to export. Small firms can do high-volume exporting from wherever they happen to be located. A final important finding involved the use of a domestic marketing department to handle exporting. The active exporters used their own domestic market ing departments or developed their own export unit within that department rather than use an outside source. This is important in li ght of the trend in the data that the companies with more employees tend to be active exporters. Again, it appears th at the company which is committed to exporting hires and uses employees in order to become an active exporter. To summarize the first study, the prof ile of active exporters then is the following: ** 5% or more in percent of exports to domestic sales ** Size of firm tends to be toward firms with more rather than less employees but annual sales makes no difference ** Seve ral years of exporting experi ence ** Export to several countries (2 to 5) ** Location in a SM SA not relevant ** Use their own dome stic marketing department to handle exporting The second half of the study wh ich examined factors af fecting whether or not firms enga ge in exporting also presented some interesting findings. Size was not a factor when looki ng at passive vs. active exporte rs, but when exporters were compared to non-exporters size did become a factor. This was particularly evident in terms of number of employees. Companies with ten or more employees are more likely to export. Fewer than ten employ ees seems to indicate that there is just not enough people power to handle this aspect of business. This agrees with results found in previous studies (Jatusripitak, 1984; Reid, 1985; Bilkey 1978). This may be literal in that no one has the time, or it could be that the expertise simply is not there in a very small firm. Annua l sales also is a significant variable between exporters and non-exporters. It appears that $3 million in sales is the critical f actor. If sales volume is below this amount, then the firm is much less likely to support exporting activities. The potential cost of overseas customers and product differentiation are not s een as barriers by eith er the exporters or the non-exporters. Management at titudes toward exporting itself did not seem to be a critical factor; however, this becomes interesting when size of U.S. market is compar ed for exporters vs non-exporters. The exporters engaged in national markets rather than limiting themselves to either a regional or state geographic mark et. It could be that while management buys the idea of exporting, when it comes to the pragmati c application of moving the company into a larger market, those firms alread y exportin g have a better a ppreciation and the practical knowled ge to position themselves in the international market. This is further s upported by the results indicating that the exporters did not see exporting as a risky business. The non-expor ters were split on this question and s eemed to be ill-informed about the potential risks involved. What Does This Mean for Small Business Owners? As stated earlier, the great majority of firms will be small businesses in the futu re. Based on the data in this study, small firms which export tend to be more suc cessful than those which do not export. Wh ile this may be due to factors other than exporting, small business owners as well as people w ho consult with small business owners such as SBDC'S, SBI's and financial institutions need to be aware of the great potential that exists in this area. It is not enough, however, to simply be aware of the potential for exporting. Small businesses that are considering exporting or are currently engaged in exporting need to be aware of the profile that exists for active exporting. This profile presents minimal factors indicative of successful small business exporters. Thus, it is important that small businesses that meet the high- volume profile be encouraged to export and that firm that ar e exporting but do not match this profile be encouraged to move toward this target profile in orde r to be successful exporters. Both intern al (management attit ude and perceptions) and external (information and help fr om local and federal government, export management companies) change-agents can be useful in facilitating this process. This evolution from domestic to multinat ional firms appears to be inevitable in today's society.

De Jean, Nort hern Illinois University Angela Weck, Northern Illinois University ABSTRACT Operating in Illinois, Northe rn Illinois University's Sm all Business Institute and Smal l Business Development program have incorporated an international focus into their join t program efforts. The combin ed SBI/SBDC exchange, the primary objective of which is to foster small business development and student exposure to these intricacies, was launched into the international arena in the United Kingdom in 1990. On the heels of this pr ototypical effort, the Soviet Union agreed to apply the pr ogram to peres- troika. The following highl ights Northern's expanded SBI/SBDC program, as well as the respective local accomplishments of each. WORLD-CLASS ARTISANSHIP Championing change, the Small Business In stitute (SBI) and Small Business Deve lopment Center (SBDC) programs at Northern Illinois University (NIU) in DeKa lb, Illinois work in tandem to resolve international economic issues as well as Chicago-area business con- cerns. SBI Director Dan Lema nski and SBDC Director Larr y Rouse form a cohesive unit by combining the objectives of the two programs. In a coll aborative fashion, they augment the traditional program focus to include, in an ever-smaller world, tailored re sults aimed at a world-class level and arrived at through innovation, creativity, and foresight. Lemanski and Rouse have successfully conducted their joint program efforts for the purpose of extending the benefits of Small Business Administration (S BA) and Illinois Department of Comm erce and Community Affairs (IDCCA) assistance into world affairs. Their di stinctive approach simultaneously guides the student teams and delivers timely, uniquely crafted business expertise to local area businesses, as well as to international enterprises eager to shine on the emerging global stage. SBI/SBDC Plays Center Court Nene College, Northampton hosted SBI/SB DC's inauguration into the European Community in the spring of 1990. The British business community, impressed early on with the inte rnational lean of the program and the students' work, provided them with a resource base with which to addres s distribution issues posed to manufacturers by the global marketplace. This initial internationa l effort, the prototypical attempt conduc ted under the auspices of the SBA and IDCCA, afforded the student team a unique hands-on experi ence in overseas customs and business. They acclimated themselves quickly to the culture of the European Community and produced real-time solutions which the enterprise adopted to help it penetrate the world market. Fueled by the progressive philosophy of the program direct ors and the knowledge, dedicati on, and creativity of the country's future business leaders, interest in Northern's SB I/SBDC student exchange program continues unabated in the United Kingdom. The manufacturer, with whom the students worked, has requested a follow-up student team for an upcoming semester and has offered to finance the travel considerations. East Meets West The premise of the program's in ternational vision and the not able success met early in th e pilot United Kingdom effort also captured the attention of the East. Following a stay in Washington, a delegation of ranking Soviet economic and political officials traveled to Norther n, their sole academic visit. The seven- delegation included four who hold cabinet- level positions on the Council of Minist ers and whose responsibilities include dr afting Soviet economic legislation. The purpose of their travel to DeKalb: to determin e the program's application to perestroika. The delegates met with SBA, Regional Director Edward Mu rnane, NIU's SBI and SBDC director, and participating students in Februar y 1990 as a direct result of the Malta Summit, which promises technical su pport and economic assistance to the Soviet Union and em erging governments in Eastern Europe. Valentin Mikhailovich Vologzhin, Chair of the Committee on Economic Reform of the Supreme Soviet (the equivalent to the chair of a key U.S. Senate committee) and Nicholai Akimovich Medvedev, Deputy Mini ster of the forestry indus- try and a specialist on economic issues, were among the key Sovi et officials studying the program. Perestroika Says 'Da! In June 1990, after attending the 52nd Annual World Trade C onference, and Deputy Minister Medvedev, one of the top 10 political leaders in the Soviet system, developed a formal letter of agreement in which the program's application within the Soviet union was defined. Th is agreement is aligned with the Malta Summit document which calls for adapting and conducting an expanded program of academic exchanges of undergraduate students between the two countries during the years 1991 and 1996. Specific goals of th e Soviet exchange, as sugge sted by the Deputy Summit and agreed upon by Deputy Minister Medvedev and NIU, include: Educational Development \u00f9 Student exposure to differing economic systems and cultures \u00f9 Soviet student introduction to the microeconomic s of small business in the United States \u00f9 American student exposure to the pr oblems of introducing private small bus iness into an economy with a strong central planning tradition \u00f9 Student exposure to the techniques and problems of mu ltinational business ventures Enterprise Development \u00f9 identification of investment opportuniti es, markets, and new products in the Soviet Union for American companies \u00f9 identification of small business sour ces for technology transfer, investment, and marketing outlets in the United States for Soviet small business . creation of a support system for small busin ess within the Soviet university system The Americans Are Coming Two graduate students and one upper-level undergraduate student from Northern Illinois University arrived in Moscow on September 15, 1990. Under the direction of Deputy Minister Medvedev and his a ssociates, the students are currently continuing their fall 1990 studies at the Moscow Technol ogical Institute of Timber Indus tries at which Deputy Minister Medvedev is a faculty. At the Institute, located 30 minutes outside of Moscow in the city of Mytischi, the students work directly with the Ministry of Timb er Industries and with their Soviet counter parts to help foster the establishment and growth of small businesses within the Soviet Union's em erging free market. Specifical ly, their efforts have been concentrated on one of the enterprises within the Mini stry, a furniture factory cu rrently employing 1,100 people and located on the outskirts of Moscow. Their task: to reorgani ze the entity into a number of freestanding, market-oriented enterprises. The exchange program, driven by a traditional focus which incorporates the strengths of the practitioner with the strengths produced by academia, ha s proven to be a resource of consider valu e to those Soviet of ficials charged with furthering economic progress. A firmly held belief of the Soviet officials, as noted by the delegates last February, is that perestroika will be facilitated through the education of the country's yout h. Building on that belief, the Moscow Technological Institute of Timber In- dustries has turned to the student team in the classroom where they have guest lectured in business classes. Most notably, Deputy Minister Medvedev has ho nored both the program and the students by requesting their assistance with repl icating the SBI/SBDC progr am structure and objectives within the Institute. During their planned travels to the Soviet Union this De cember, Lemanski and Rouse will join Deputy Minister Medvedev and his colleagues in evaluating the results of the students' work. More importantly with regard to future exchanges, the program directors will have the o pportunit y to assist De puty Minister Medvedev, his associat es, and the students with the program re plication. Perhaps now more than ever, during a time when President Gorbachev is pressed to hasten the process of economic reform, the students' work will help provide much-needed stability to an ec onomic structure committed to championing change...a change resolved to lay the foundation on which the Soviet Union's free mark et economy will be built. The Russians Are Coming Honoring the second half of the exchange, NIU will rece ive at least Soviet students in January 1991. They will participate in the joint SBI/SBDC program and enroll in th e related coursework offered by NIU's College of Business. The nature of their project work, pe rformed under the direction of Lemanski and Rouse, may include: formulating exporting and marketing strategies; cr itiquing management tec hniques; upgrading manageme nt techniques; upgrading management systems, or; developing pr oduct designs. As testament to the Sovi et's commitment to fostering small business development and to the exchange program, Deputy Minister Medvedev has charge d the Soviet students with the additional task of obtaining a thor- ough understanding of NIU's SBI/SBDC progr am so that, upon their return, they will be in a position to further the replic ation of the program at the Institute. Su ch a replication would facilitate future exchanges in that both countries would be operating on the basis of a program with a uni fied structure and objectives. Perhaps more critical to the success of perestroika, the esta blishment of a program within the Soviet Union promises to expand upon the students' current efforts by providing the Ins ti- tute with the resources to address small business development. Home is Where the Heart Is While the current efforts of NIU's SBI and SBDC programs have reached across the world, perhaps their most notable successes have been felt in the Midwest. Since 1983, the SBI program has assisted over 143 Chicago-area firms, primarily manufacturers with an employee base of 10 to 200 people. The technologies employed by these esta blished enterprises range fro m basic metal casting and finishing to programmable logic controllers. To date, SBI cas e work in the Midwest has resulted in the introduction of at least two new products: one, in the elec- tronics i ndustry; the other, in engi neer-related industries. Since reorganizing in the third quarter of 1989, the SBDC's counseling hours to Northern Illinois small businesses have increased by 1,639%, jobs created/retained have increased by over 1,500%, and 57 various types of loan packages have been produced with a total requested loan value of $9,428,300. Working in conjunction with the SBI to provide an extraordinary range of quality services, the SBDC has provide d over 6,400 hours of counseling and consulting during the fi rst nine months of 1990. Over 98% of those hours have been devoted to established and gr owing firms. An Eve to the Future Northern's SBI and SBDC programs are at the forefront of the administration's ove rall initiative to provide technical support and economic assistance in the international arena. Coupled with br oadening their horizons to include the world market, the pro- grams continue their dedication to fostering economic in America. Together, the SBI and SBDC continue to champion change ... change th at spurs job creation and retention in this country, helping the United States regain its economic leadership in the emerging global market...c hange that offers this country 's future business leaders, the students, a glimpse at and, perhaps, a deeper understa nding of, the groundwork of the world market and its ensuing implications for this countr y. ASSESSING THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT A MODEL FOR SMALL BUSINESS Janet Barnard, Rochester Institute of Technology ABSTRACT Many smaller businesses recognize that the opportunities offered by global markets will be in creasingly important to the health of their operations. Often, how ever, small firms avoid global expansi on due to uncertainty, or enter foreign markets with insufficient knowledge a nd understanding of economic and political considerations. They recognize that countries differ in economic, social, and pol itical characteristics, bu t rarely try to measure th ese in any systematic way. Informed choice could enhance both the incidence of entr y and the success of smaller businesses in international markets. This paper presents a model intended for use as a baseline for assessing the attractiveness of a country or region for foreign ventures. The model incorporates both economic and political dimensions of foreign operation, and uses the World Bank (21) classifications to gr oup countries by level of economic de velopment. Building on the work of William Stoever (18), the mode l suggests that the benefits which a host country expects to receive from foreign business increase concurrently with the host country's level of development. The intention of the model is to provide a baseline for further indepth analysis of the appropriateness of a specific country or region for entry by a business firm. In avoiding the scattershot approach, a dvantages from using this baseline m odel could enhance both the incidence of entry and the success of smaller busin esses in international markets. INTRODUCTION No longer is foreign investment the province of large mult inational firms. Many smaller firms recognize that the opportunities offered by global mark ets will be increasingl y important to the health of th eir operations. Foreign markets constitute a significant percentage of total sales for ma ny large companies and offer ri ch opportunities for smaller operations, as well. Secretary of Commer ce Mosbacher stated in an interview, \"You would be amazed how many small and mid-sized companies are now moving to the point where a big part of their business is export\" (2). However, many smaller businesses are uncomfortable a bout engaging in commercial relationshi ps with other countries. They may produce a good or service that c ould be competitive in intern ational markets, but are uncer tain about the appropriate target or the strategy for entry. This can result in failing to follow up on gl obal opportunities, or in entering foreign markets with insufficient knowledge of economic and political considerations. Varying degrees of venture activity --- joint, wholly-owned, and contractual --- are being implemented throughout the world. Companies are doing business in environments that vary economically and politically. Firms of all sizes need to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of any given geographic region from both an economic and political point of view. Informed choice is especially criti cal to smaller operations because they ofte n lack resources to cushion risk. This paper discusses some of the issues of fo reign investment by small bus iness, and presents a mode l that can be useful in making choices about the appropriatene ss of inter- nati onal activities. ALTERNATIVES IN WORLD MARKETS Both the World Bank and the United Na tions have classification systems for categorizing countries and geographic regions of the world in terms of ec onomic development and market philosoph y. The country groupings used by the World Bank in their analyses of economic indicators wi ll be discussed in detail later in the paper. The World Economic Survey (1) cautions that the period ahea d is likely to be greatly influenced by several recent developments. One of those cited was the reduction of international tensions , with the expectation of accompanying cuts in defense spending. However, this annual report was publ ished before the eruption of the situation in the Middle East. Any savings resulting from improve d relations with the Soviet Union can be expected to be consumed by the Arab conflict. Another significant devel opment is the changes that are occurring in th e European Community and in the Eastern bloc countries. It is probably too early to speculate on the outcome of the pol itical overhaul of Eastern Europe, although the new independence of these nonm arket economies has created a great deal of expectation for economic expansion. The economies of the industrialized Euro pean countries have been stimulated b y the o pportunit y for ties with the countries and republics that are struggling to convert to a market economy. There is opportunity here, and it is compounded by expectations for the European Economic Community. The 1992 implementation of the EEC draws close and, if successf ul, will result in a $4 tri llion free-market zone that will be \"a triumph of the economics of Adam Smith\" (20). The EEC will create an economic integration of 12 countries; Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, th e Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. It has been designed as a true common market, with people, products, and capital moving freely among the member countries. The EEC is movi ng steadily toward implemen tation, but there are still issues to be worked out. There are di fferences of opinion as to how much uni formity is required for a common market (13), and arguments that 1992 is doomed to failure because of inadequacies in its organization (6). Although a high level of cooperation among members is required for a succ essful EEC, member nations vary in matters such as regulatory philosophy, political consider ations, and the like. There is some f eeling that a multinational firm which targets the European Community as a region may find that this strategy suffers from major differences among EC member countries. It is not the purpose of this paper to di scuss strategies for entry into internati onal markets. However, a word about entry strategy is useful to a discussion of econom ic and political considerations. It is usually large firms th at establish plant assets in foreign countries or become part ners in joint ventures that require inve stment in fixed assets. A more attractive strategy for smaller businesses is to implement internationa l activities without risking a high level of resources. The most promising way of doing this is through international contracting. Dudley (3) discusses four basic options of foreign investment with respect to manufactured or processed products, each calling for hi gher levels of production commitment and investment; cont ract packaging, contract manufacture or assembly, joint ventures, and subsidiary production facilities. S imilarly, international contracting lends itself we ll to providing competitive advantages such as skills and technology through licensing agreem ents with foreign enterprises or governments. The advantage of this alternative over direct investment is cl ear. Fixed assets can be vulnerable to th e economic and political pressures of a foreign government. At regulation and inte rvention can be inhibiting. In more ex treme cases, foreign assets have been summarily nationalized by th e host government (14;4). ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS Many writings on the internationalization of business have given more attention to the cultural aspects of operating in a foreign country rather than to the economic and political c onsiderations. Smaller firms usually recognize that there are economic and political risks in foreign ope ration, but rarely try to measure them in any systematic way. Failure to do this can be costly. On one hand, uncerta inty about where and how to internati onalize may cause a firm to avoid the opportunities of expanding into foreign markets. On the other hand, a choice of locale that is inappropriate from an economic or political perspective can result in serious cons equences for the firm. Success is never a given, but its chances are enhanced by a positive cost-benefit re lationship between the guest and the host country. Economic Considerations The economic attractiveness of a host country is a composite of a numbe r of factors; level of development, availability of resources, potential markets, labor fo rce, infrastructure, demographic characte ristics, and the like. The state of a country's economy is a major determinant in any decision a bout international activities. A healthy economy provides a cushion for the initial uncertainty of business opera tion, whereas a depressed economy is unforgiving of missteps. For small firms, the state of a foreign economy as it pertains to their produc t is critical in the decision to enter a country. For a useful perspective, we can go back to the work of an economic historian, W.W. Rostow (15;16;17). Rostow proposed the notion that societies can be divided into five stages based on their economic s of production. In Rostow's model, these stages range from the very primitive to wh at he termed the \"age of mass consumption. Three decades later, building on the work of Rostow, William Stoever deve loped a model of economic deve lopment that incorporated the international dimension. The model looks at the stages of economic growth of a deve loping country, and proposes that these be used as criteria for evalua ting the desirability of investment in that country (18). The model presented in this paper is indebted to Stoever's work for its approach to judging the attractiveness of a foreign country or region for commercial investment. The Role of Politics Much of the writing on the role of politi cs in multinational activity focuses on pol itical risk, with risk defined as the loss of ownership or benefits due to the actions of the hos t country's government (7). A number of attempts have been made to assess uncertainty as it applie s to political risk (8;10;11). In a review of the literature on political risk, Fitzpatrick (5) defines three categorie s of political risk in terms of unw anted consequences of host government interference with foreign operations; ev ents that affect all fore ign firms operating in the country, events that are industry or firm-specific, and events that can be viewed in an ongoing envi ronmental context. He concludes from the literature that political risk as a c oncept should include all risks that are c ontained in a host country's political environment, and should be viewed as a cont inuous process rather than discrete events. Among the policy instruments that can be used by a host government to encourage fo reign activity are various subsidies and guarantees to support the operations of the fore ign firm. These incentives are granted in expectation that the foreign operation will provide the technology, capital , and productive capacity needed for the country's development. Other important considerations are the host government's rece ptivity to foreign i nvestment, its market philosophy, the amount of bureaucratic red ta pe, degree of corruption, and predictability of th e regulatory environment (18;12). Strategies are needed to insure th at the partnership will work to the bene fit or both host and foreign firm. If the balance is uneven, the host country may es calate its constraints in the form of regulations and requirements to force desired behavior on the recalcitrant guest . In extreme cases, foreign firms have been summarily nationalized by the host government (14;4). A MODEL FOR ASSESSING ATTRACTIVENESS The model shown in Figure 1 builds on th e Stoever model and adapts it for us e with current economic, social, and political indicators. F I G U R E 1 The horizontal axis classifies countries in terms of average gross national income per capita, which is the base criterion used by the World Bank. Although the GNP of a country does not directly measure its develo pment, this indicator does give an idea of natural res ource use in measuring the total domestic and fo reign value added per capita of residents (21,p.245). Discussed later will be additi onal economic and social indicators that should be carefully examined in a company's evaluation of a foreign venture. The model departs from Stoever's work in that instead of using five \"stages\" of development, it uses the World Bank's classifications of countries and examin es these groups in terms of attractiven ess for foreign investment. This lends currency to the Stoever model, and moves it closer to a framew ork able to be tested empirically for its ability to provide guidance in judging a country's appropria teness for international commerce. The model's vertical axis represents the benefits country. These benefits include technology transfer, industrial diversification, increase in local produc tive capacity, increase in employment , in government revenues, and other similar elements that enhance development. Stoever's belief is that the host country's expectati ons tend to increase as a country's stage of development (and attr activeness) increases. There is a caveat here, however, about assuming that an individual country's level of developmen t and its attractiveness for foreign investment are neces sarily correlated, since there are situational characteris tics that could make even the most highly -developed country unattractive to a foreign investor. This is examined as we look at the adaptation of Stoever's stages to the World Bank's classifications of countries. Low Income Economies With a per capita income of less than $545, these countries may be too undeveloped or too undesirable in other ways to be attractive to foreign investment. Stoever points out, however , that the pendulum may swing in favor of attractiveness if the host government has the resources to offer generous in centives to the potential suitor. The low income grouping includes China and India, as well as many of the African countries. Lowe r-Middle-Income Economies Countries with a GNP per capita income of between $545 and $1400 include some of the countries in South and Central Ameri ca, the Philippines, and the more developed countries of Africa, such as Egypt, the Congo, and Moro cco. Most of these countries are in th e initial stage of foreign investment, usually in consumer goods. Many of these countries are anxious to court foreign companies even though the partnership may produce no immediate benefit for the host country. Because of a weak intrastructure, the products probably will not initially be competit ive in the world market and the inve stor will need subsidies and market protection. For the host, these costs are an investment in futu re growth. The expectation is that the foreign firm will upgrade production and human capital, and wi ll also attract other investors. Middle-Income Economies Included here are Mexico, several S outh and Central American countries, Syria and Lebanon in the Middle East, and one European country, Poland. The per capita income of from $1400 to $2000 gives these countries respectable domestic markets and an infrastructure that supports some industrialized activity. Many are rich in natural resources, although substantial natural resources ar e not necessary for economic success, as evidenced by the track records of a number of Asians countries. Currently, the countries in this category, with the exception of Mexico and perhaps one or two South American countries, suffer fr om economic and political circumstances that make them unattractive to foreign investment. Upper-Middle Income Economics With a per capita income of $2000 to $6000 these countries ar e quite attractive to forei gn investment, and are labor intensive and looking for cheaper producti on. Countries whose labor force has the potential to provide desired skills and is willing to work for lower wage s can be attractive to foreign industrie s. Uruguay, Venezuela, and Argentina are included here, as well as Hungary and Y ugoslavia, Korea, Portugal, and Greece. Developing High-Income Economies These countries are identified as a special group by the World Bank. Their GNP per capita income is between $6,000 and $9,000, which puts them near the top gl obally. There are only six countries in this category; Saudi Arabia, Israel, Singapore, Hong Kong, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. To say that many of these countries raise some serious questions with respect to curr ent attractiveness for foreign act ivity is certainly an understatement. However, they have some positive characteristics that could be extremely attractive to foreign ventures were it not for circumstances of political instability, rest rictive regulatory policies, and other dysfunctions. High-Income Economies All of these countries have a high GNP per capita, ranging fr om Spain's $7,740 to Switzerland's $27,500. This group includes the industrialized countries of the world who are selective in the kind of fo reign investment they will allow. In many of these countries, the host government's policy is to channel investments into sele cted industries or geographic areas to selectively develop the economy and glean a greater ratio of benefits to co sts. In its extreme form, this strategy can include untimely takeover. The economy of these countries is often st rong enough to be globally competitive. Multinationa ls are attracted to the productive capabilities of these countries, and there is less need for incentives to attract investment. The role of foreign business has ch anged from stimulating the basic econom y to upgrading it by providing more sophisticated technologies and skills. Stoever describes this as operating mo re at the margin of the host economy, although there are a nu mber of exceptions to this. For the foreign busin ess, conditions in these countries may be better in some ways than those at home; less restrictive, more stable, and with a greater av ailability of resources. UTILITY OF THE MODEL The model presented in this paper represen ts a baseline approach to analyzing th e attractiveness of a country for foreign investment. The intention of the model is to provide a foundation for further in-de pth anal ysis of the a ppropriateness of a specific country or region for entry by a business inn. Its util ity to a smaller operation would depend upon the quality of a company's environmental scanning activities as they targeted a potential candida te for foreign activity. In addition to the basic indicator of a country's GNP per cap ita, there are a number of ot her economic data that should be analyzed. Among these are gross dom estic product (GDP), structure of pr oduction and consumption, demographics, availability of commercial energy, transportation, communication, interest ra tes, central government revenues and expenditures. As an example of data that is readily avai lable, Figure 2 presents averag e Gross Domestic Product (GDP) dollars for the six country classificati ons, and Figure 3 shows the average GDP growth rate for the country groups. Gross Domestic Product measures the total output of goods and services for final us e produced by residents and nonresidents of a country, regardless of whether th e operations are domestic or foreign-owned (21). F I G U R E 2 In order to be useful to a business, the aggregate GDP of a country would need to be examined for its distribution among agri culture, industry, manufacturi ng, and service activities and, further, for micro and macro aspects of the relevant industry and market. In the same way, all other measurable indicators of economic, social, and political dimensions should be carefully examined for elements that could help or hinder the success of a foreign venture. I ndicators must be examined in the aggreg ate as they pertain to the industry in question in order to provide useful signals. F I G U R E 3 Political considerations also require careful examination by a company. The model suggests that members of the country groupings seek similar benefits from the presence of the foreign guest . However, the individual countries may well differ in the political instruments they use to insure these benefits . Incentives and subsidie s may be attractive to firms in a given industry, whereas tariff protections or other guara ntees may be important to another. On the darker side, all foreign investors should examine a potential host' s restrictive laws and regul ations, financial limits, discriminatory licensing policies, a nd the like. A clear understanding of bot h the expectations and the political instruments of the host is a critical foundation to the process of analysis, strategy, negotiation, and ultimate commitment if a mutual-benefit balance is reached. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Building on the Stoever approach, this model offers a framew ork for use in evaluating the attractiveness of countries and regions for financial investment. By substituting the Worl d Bank classifications of count ries for Stoever's \"stages\" of evolution brings the model a step cl oser to empirical examinat ion; groups of countries which share certain economic and social characteristics would constitu te subjects for the investigation. A rela tionship between the level of a country's development and its expectations of the be nefits to be received from a guest's commercial presence would be a finding particularly useful to smaller operations. First, it would provide a useful scheme for an initial analysis of the attractiveness of country groupings for in ternational activity. Further, by clas sifying groups of countries by similar social, economic, and political char acteristics, it of fers an alternative to the scattershot approach to foreign ventures. A baseline is provided for further in-depth analysis of the appropriateness of a sp ecific country or region for entry by the firm. These advantages could enhance both the incidence of entry and the success of sma ller business in international markets.

THE ON THE ROAD ENTERPRI SE CENTER AND THE SBI Dennis J. Elbert, University of North Dakota James Stai, U.S. Small Business Ad ministration Michael Gallegher, U.S. Small Business Administration ABSTRACT This paper discusses the preliminary experiences of a joint consulting effort between the U.S. Small Business Administration(SBA), the Small Busine ss Institute (SBI) and the North Da kota On-The-Road-Enterprise-Center (OTREC). The pilot project was conducte d during the Fall Semester, 1990 and was in progress at the time of this writing. The most unique element in this team effort is OTREC. OTREC was es tablished as part of the SEA's rural outreach initiative. The OTREC is a trailer set up as a \"rolli ng counseling center\" and totally equipped with computers, telephones, and both a copying and fax machine. Rural business owners and/or aspiring entrepreneurs often do nothave c onvenient access to SBA services. The concept of OTREC is to take services directly to the potential client and provide servic e on a broad range of consulting topics from accounting and finance to marketing. OTREC itself is an excellent exampl e of leveraging federal, regional and local assets in that the SBA, the State Board for Educati on, and a number of other public and private organizations are assisting in the suppor t for the program. INTRODUCTION At the present time there are well over estimated eighteen million businesses in the United States. Many of these are part-time operations. A dditionally much of the job creation in the econom y has been a result of small business growth, expansion and activity. Most of this ha s been in organizations with fewer than twenty employees. For example, the growth of 10.5 million new jobs between 1980-86, almost sixty five percent was at tributable to businesses with fewer than 500 employees. The remaining forty (minus) percent wa s attributable to organizations with fewer than 20 employees.[l] Many of these organizations are located in non-urban areas. Yet smaller, rural communities typically face tremendous challenges as they try to attract ne w business, expand existing businesses and/or initiate business startups. Many approaches have been utilized, Bradle y for example proposes an industrial ta rget marketing modeling to aid rural communities in attracting small business es for industial growth.[2] Along these same lines Ka rimi suggestsa strategic planning framework adapted for small businesses as follows: 1.Assess and evaluate the current organi zational objectives and strategies. 2.Evaluate the current state of information technology. 3.Forecast the organization 's strategic position. 4.Determine the required state of information tech nology needed to support th e strategic position.[3] Most modern day managers or planners would agree in principle with the empha sis on planning and focus on adaptability to change. The eal ity however, is that most small business orga nizations or potential entrepreneurs do not have the time, inclination or acces s to resources to initiate many of the agreed upon planning concept. To assist in this area most states ha ve developed a number of different program s to service small business clients. Much of the activity stems from the original mission of the Small Business Administra tion. This theme has carried down to a regional and state emphasis. The Nort h Dakota Business Resource Directory fo r example, lists over 35 agencies, organizations and programs which can assist small business clients.[4] Despite this fair ly large number of program options however, the geographic distances in a ru ral state often hamper program activities. PROGRAM CONCEPT The U.S. Small Business Administration sel ected North Dakota as test site for a pilot project to provide trans portable assistance to businesses in rural ties. Th is project was initiated in the Spring of 1990. The project entitl ed of officially as \"The On-The-Road-Enterprise Center,\" or OTREC is basically an office on wheels. A modified trailer equipped with computers, telephones, copying machines and a fax machin e is pulled behind a pickup truck to selected sites throughout the state. The primary reason for the development of the program is that North Dakota has many communities which are \"more rural than others.\"Business owners or potential entrepreneurs who ma y have a good ideaor concept of ten are geographically distant from SBA offices andservices. If the rural client already has an existing business and wants to test new ideas or products, they often ca nnot leave theexisting business to travel due to time constraints. The primary purpose of the OTREC is to provide assistance, training, edu cation and counseling directly to the small business client. The program is an outstanding example of the opportunities for cooperative effo rt between federal, state and local agencies. Funding for OTREC was provide d by the State Board for Education, pub lic and private groups and of course the Small Business Administration. The SBA serves as the prime sponsor and provides personnel and administrative support for the program. The intent is that approximate ly twenty communities would be regularly served through OTREC con a \"circuit rider\" form at. The communities were selected from over seventy poten tial communities. All of the potential communities were visited during the sp ring of 1990 and then the actual OTREC site cities were selected. Most of the communities selected had populations of less than 2,500. The original grant money came from two different federal programs. The SBA will run the pilo t program for one year and then evaluate the impact to ascertain whether or not the program should be continued. The OTREC concept is a creative concept stemming from th e emphasis on rural developmen t initiatives, which are a high priority in the SBA. This priority stems from the strong supp ort for President Bush's rural development initiatives. The SBA is in a solid posit ion to assist in rural development and revitalization. This position comes from the \"partnership network\" of Small Business Development Cent ers, Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE), Small Business Institutes (SBI), lenders, Ce rtified Development Companies nd Small Business Investment Corporations. (51 In Fiscal Year 1989 for example, the Small Business Ad ministration provided training and counseling for well over 200,000 business owners and distributed trai ning materials to almost three-fourths of a mil lion rural residents. Additionally the SBA publishes and dist ributes, A Guide to Federal and St ate Resources for Rural Economic Development. This guide is a listing of Federal, state and local organizati ons that provide training, technical and financial assistance for rural re vitalization.[6] OTREC as part of this larger rural development initiative, appears to be an excellent concept with outstanding potential. PROGRAM POLICY The overall objective of the OTREC pr ogram is to provide small town economies with emphasis on small business development through education. The program will operate a fu ll twelve months of each ye ar and serve approximately twenty ties on a rotating basis. Each community would be served for two days. During a year each community would be served four times, four circuits woul d be run with live ties in each circuit. Circuits were to be fully operational by October, 1990. The circuit concept was initiated based on existi ng availability of resources and to serve \"geographical gaps\" in the service delivery area. The in tent of the program was to have an eff ective yet flexible program to insure the best use of resources and wi th an emphasis on responsiveness to community needs.[7] The overall objective was to be accomplished by: o Providing high tech, state-of-the art, equipment and information to ru ral communities to enhance business management skills. o Linkage of local community with outside resources. o Increase awareness of opport unities in business to youth. o Increase partici pation b y veterans in business. o Increase participation by minority (especially na tive americans on reservations) in business.[8] Each of the OTREC objectives was further clarified as follows: Skill Development The emphasis in this area is for both pr esent and future business owners. The skills were to be enhanced utilizing a combination of classroom instruction, computer assisted training, one-on-one instruction and self paced video programs. A core curriculum emphasizing three areas of marketing, finance, and use of computers in a small business environment was to be launched. These ar eas resulted from a statewide survey conducted by personnel at Valley City State University. This thrust was further sup, ported by Vision 2000 (a stat ewide economic development planning effort). Community Linkage The involvement of community activities with state and national resources was to be a primary consideration. Both classroom activities in the OTREC center or in local fac ilities and media contacts were planned. Community residents were to be helped with the identific ation of available resources and with a personal review of resources needed. Linkages would be maintained via SCORE, SBI, SBDC, colleges and universities and other organizations to insure a foremost leveraging of resources available. Opportunities for Youth Opportunities in the small business area would be shared with high school se niors through a combination of classroom visits and discussions and hands-on partic ipation programs. The intent is that through an exposure to opportunity, area youth would be more likely to stay in th eir respective communities a nd help in the development of an economic base. Special Assistance A special emphasis of OTREC was to assist veterans and Na tive Americans. The thrust was to insure understanding of the variety of programs availa ble and to enhance the access to both SBA services and other programs. Due to the special more personalized effort of OT REC in the individual community, it wa s anticipated that both veterans and minorities would be able to bette r participate in the opportunities pr ovided by small busin ess ownership. PERSONNEL The OTREC staff was to consist of one full time professional to man the cente r. The District SBA Office in Fargo, North Dakota was tasked with the re sponsibility to provide management and control support. This was to be accomplished with existing staff and the help of a student intern from a lo cal university. Additional assistance was to be provided to the OTREC center by SC ORE volunteers, SBDC personnel and other resources who could provide personalized assistance for limited time periods. Table 1 shows a sample schedule utilized by the OTREC during the summer of 1990. The circuits identify the groupings of ties served. The state of No rth Dakota has a relatively large geographic area wi th a small population (est. 650,000 minus). The map shown as Exhibit 1 indicates the rota tion of the OTREC circuits and helps one conceptualize both the counseling activity and th e geographic distances involved. SBI OPPORTUNITY The University of North Dakota has a l ong history of assistance to small busin ess owners through the SBI program. ND currently provides over one-hal f of the SBI counseling effort in North Dakota. Based on this background, during the summer of 1990 a special request was made of the SBA Regiona l Office in Denver, Colorado to fund an additional ten SBI cases to be utilized in conj unction with the OTREC program. The SB I program at UND has been offered traditionally through an undergraduate cl ass Marketing 430 - Small Business Proj ects. Selected MBA students have taken the course as an elective, however, enrollment by mast ers students has been limited. Th is limitation results from a heav y emphasis on evenin g courses for MBA'S. The fall 1990 Marketin g Administration Marketin g 510 was a course offered solely for masters le vel students. The primary emphasis was on th e development of a marketing plan. This thrust fit rather very well with the OTREC initiative on marketing. The proposal by the District Office in Fargo, North Dakota was approved by Regional SBA officials in Denver, Colorado. Starting in early September teams of two MBA stude nts have been working with selected clients in the OTREC circuit areas. See Graph 1 for the locations of the cl ients. Client needs range from a marketing plan for an entire community to the development of a tilipia fish farm, co-sponsored by a power cooperative and a small community. Preliminary client, student, and SBA feedback from this cooperativ e effort has been quite positive. CONCLUSION This paper provided an overview of th e joint efforts between SBA, OTREC and SBI during the preliminary stages of the venture. Although initial feedback was qu ite positive, a formal review of the effort will take place at the end of the project in late December, 1990. It is hoped that based on acceptance of th is paper, final comments and recommendations for application in other states can be made at the National SBIDA conference.

McGinty, Eastern Washington University, Cheney, WA 99004 Kevin Coleman, Ea stern Washington Univer sity, Cheney, WA 99004 ABSTRACT The fundamental purpose of this research project is to profile exporting firms and the strategies utilized by small businesses exporting from the Pacific Nort hwest to the countries of the Pacific Rim and Eastern Europe. The profiles o f these small exporters are developed using data collected from a survey sent to 1,150 small exporting businesses. Specific research objective s include the following: 1. To identify common critical factors in effective multinational strategies that allow small or medium sized enterprises (SME's) to trade with Pacific Rim and Eastern European markets, 2. To isolate factors necessary to be su ccessful and effective in de veloping and maintaining a profitable export market, and 3. To determine if exporting SME's differe ntiate between internationa l and domestic markets in strategy and structure. Only one method of measurement is being used since the st udy is exploratory in nature, and because the researchers wanted to provide an open format for receiving additiona l information. A pretested mail questionnaire was sent to 1,150 SME's in the Pacific Northwest. The returns suggest di fferences between internati onal and domestic customers; differences in marketin g strategies based on product line and mix and c ountry being targeted; and differences based on a SME's overall mix of primary international trading activities. PROJECT NEED Current developments in U.S. export markets in the orient and in Eastern Europe, both political and economic, provide research opportunities to explore small and medium sized enterprise export and import activities. The strategies associated with a small business entering the internationa l arena are largely unknown and have been researched very little. Further, there is a lack of empirical support for spec ific measures that determine organizational effectiveness in these environments. Kirchoff found no single predictor of firm effectiveness (6). Yet, proxy measures of sales, ROI, and so forth appear to correlate to exporting success. It is a challenge for small businesses worldwide to become i nvolved in international markets. According to Daniels, et al. (1984) many entrepreneurs do not move into international markets beca use of ignorance, fear, or both. Many of those who do make the effort find ther e are many barriers to success. Some ha ve succeeded, however, and are enjoying tremendous success. Currently, the news is full of larger firms racing to establish economic ties with Eastern Europe. For example, it is estimated that Eastern Germ any wi11 import $ll0,000,000 of computers; Poland, $400,000,000 of food and medical equipment; Romania, $680,000,000 of high tech investment goods; and Hungary, over $320,000,000 of chemicals, pharmaceutical supplies, and farm machinery (14). Smaller firms have not developed strategic plans to compete, but are seeking information whic h is unavailable. Where and how to access this is invaluable information is a critical success factors for SM E's that export and import. Almost all for-profit firms operating in th e inland northwest are classified as a SM E (small or medium-sized enterprise) (5). The success of these businesses in entering international markets is vital to the economic health of an economic region according to the 1988 Washingt on State Economic Developm ent Agenda. One of the goals is to \"enhance a state's stature as a center for internat ional trade.\" This could be accomplished through \"strategic pa rtnerships\" designed to combined SME's in a given region with international fi rms to expand overseas markets for a state's products and to encourage foreign investment (9). Addi tional joint ventures with existing govern ment agencies or larger firms also offer tremendous opportuni ties for SME's to develop international market s and acquire the knowledge to successfully serve these markets: e.g., U.S. Depart ment of Internatio nal Trade, State Department s of Trade, Small Business Association, and U.S. Customs to name a few. Considerin g the role of SME's in the re gional economies and the im portance of fosterin g economic develo pment in the nation, the character and extent of intern ational trade potential for SME's in the orient, Canada, and Eastern Europe is an important new development. Little is known, however, of the strategy formulation and implementation procedures followed by those entrepreneurs who achieve success in these markets (11). So far, resear ch has focused on large firms in international trade (7). The difficulty with this is that substantial differences exist betw een relatively small firms and more complex organizations with speciali zed divisions, technical expe rtise, substantial resour ces, and in some cases, foreign staff. It is likely that strate gic management processes would be substan tially different in SME's and in large, well established and financially stable firms. A clearer understandi ng of the processes necessary for SME success will substantially aid in building greater understanding of strategic management th eory, in promoting new economic ties, and strengthening programs of business ed ucation which include international marketing and strategy components. DESIGN Due to the exploratory nature of the pr oject, the pretested mail que stionnaire was designed to assess factors which were perceived by the responding SME's as lead ing to effectiveness in exporting. The responding companies were also asked to provide financial and other performance information for the past five years. In addition, there were a series of questions included which asked the responding companies to identify differences in domestic and international strategies and structures. A total of 1,150 questionnaires were mailed to members of the Washington State Export-Import Association with a response rate near 10%. Res pondents spread were evenly across several i ndustries. Responses were analyzed as to degree of importan ce of factors contributing to eff ectiveness and percentage of resp onses indicating differentiation between domestic and international approaches. Responses on factor importance ra nged from very important (+2) to not important (-2) on 13 factors, and additional comment space was provided on each quest ionnaire. Comments were analyzed to gain additional insight.

The low response rate is largely due to responding companies reacting negatively to the reque st for financial informati on and executive performance over the past five years. SME's typically react negatively to reque sts for financial data. On e typical response to the request was \"none of your business.\" However, given the intent was to identify a workable design and methodology and to construct a more in depth paradigm, the sm all response rate was not a significant setback. It appeared from the responses (espec ially the comments) that companies tend to identify a specific niche for their product in the international market and do not attempt a divers ified product line or marketing mix. Further, there is very little overlap in product niche intercom pany with firms avoiding attempts to penetrate niches already occupied by another company. Excep tions would include logs, lumb er, and building materials. This is in line with Toffler's ideas presented in Powershi ft, 1990, in which it was proposed companies will increasingly need to identify the best ma rket for theirs strengths. It was also identified that companies exporting to more than one country tend to export to countries having traditional ties or common geographic boundaries (such has Japan and Ko rea or Germany and France). Explanations may include common shipping carriers, use of local agents with ties in both countries, commonproduc t niches due to cultural similarity, or common opportunities. From comments made by respondents, SME management teams do not appear to have technical exporting expertise overall, fail to recognize separate categories of exporting expertise such as financial vs. marketing, and do not be lieve in joint ventures with othe r businesses. Further, there is a lack of evidence that federal and state governments have been successful in contributing to e xport effectiveness. From survey responses, the knowledge of foreign culture, cr edit terms, and feedback from the sales force and sales dated are the most significant factors associated with effective results. Pe rsonal knowledge, sales data, and intuition were also identified as significant in af fecting results. It can be inferred from the results that since most companies either work through agents or resident sales personnel, lo cal information regarding proc edures, capital transfer, and sales niches is critical to effectivene ss. Trade shows and government assistance were helpful to some firms. But most responses were neutra l to their impact. The majority of responses to the issue of whether responding firms differentiate their stru cture and strategies between domestic and international markets indicate considerably more firms do differentiate than do not. Most firms do adapt their product design to be more effective in international ma rkets. This supports the earlier inference, that SME's tend to identify a product need (niche) in a foreign market and ad apt their product to meet this need. The pricing strategy is also differentiated and it is argued this is support for the concept that SME's tend to go into markets with a need for their product where there is little comp etition and price th eir product to cover costs a nd produce profit rather than meeting competition as they do in domesti c markets. Promotion strategies and dist ribution strategies are also different than in domestic markets with agents and resident salesmen identifying monopolistic opportunities with informational promotions versus com petitive com parisons. FUTURE RESEARCH Future research is being designed to improve response rate by not asking for specific financial statements but rather to accept SME self perception of effectiven ess. The inference of SME's focusing on a singular product and differentiating it to satisfy a monopolistic market with local agents is to be tested. The relationship between promotional and distribution strategy and the product mo nopoly concept is also being explored. The specific tendency of SME's to network with each other or to liaison with government also needs better id entification. The avoidance of entering markets in which there would be co mpetition posess strategic challenges more complex than simple product diversification and ne eds clarification. What specific sales data and feedback is used for produc t strategy is also to be pur sued. Specific differentiation approaches used by SME's in international markets is also to be explored. Prelim inary indications in this survey have raised a number of important issues for further research. Discussion of these is sues is encouraged and appreciated.

Morrisand, State College Pennsylvania INTRODUCTION Foreign trade is often viewed in American business as a pr ocess that only involves large organizations such as General Motors and IBM. Businesses that buy or sell products abroad are supposed to be multiface ted firms whose assets total in the billions of dollars. This fictitious profile often prevents many smaller co mpanies from trying to export or import goods. However, selling to foreign market s can sometimes stimulate growth for a product that has saturated its U.S. market. A foreign market can also provide raw materials cheap er than a U. S. market. Chea per raw materials can result in a more competitive product, thus higher productions and profits that could lead to company expansion. Canadian trade is the single largest component of U.S. trad e, and U.S. trade makes up th ree-fourths of all Canadian trade. Additionally, 1.5 million American jobs are supported by trade with Cana da (2). In 1987, the United States exported $59.6 billion of goods to Canada wh ile the U. S. imported $69.2 billion of Canadian goods. It is a market that can provide excellent opportunities for pot ential exporters because most small bus inesses view Canada as a safe and secure trading environment (9). Besi des minimal language and cultural differ ences, U.S. and Canada share similar economic systems making Canadian business practices much simpler to understand than those of many other foreign countries. In addition, sale s can be made directly to the customer in Cana da, eliminating the need for export agents thus making Canada a simpler market to enter. Still, most smaller businesses are not will ing to investigate international markets unless they have a chance of getting some positive results. (It is important to note that small businesses are de fined by the Small Business Administration standards for each industry. For instance, wholesalers are smal l if they employ fewer than 100 people and retail/service industry is small when annual receipts do not ex ceed $3.5 and $13.5 million, depending on the industry.) Like other companies who fall far below the SBA maximum standards for \"small companies,\" the companies in this study need to see firms similar to themselves successfully exporting and/or importing goods. In other words, current exporters and importers can serve as role models to new companies who are interested in trading products. Agricultural products are just some of the many products th at are being exported to Canada. The agriculture industry includes not only farmers and herders, but also food proce ssors and wood harvesters. The market for U.S. hardwoods and other wood products is particularly profitable right now b ecause of an expanding Canadian furniture market (5). Other agricultural markets are expected to grow as trade barrie rs are eliminated between the U.S. an d Canada in the next ten years. The Southern Alleghenies Regi on of Pennsylvania could be faced with losing a significant portion of its forest should its trees die as a result of the gypsy mo th infestation. Presently, the lumber fr om these trees is only being sold as kindling. However, a higher value produc t could be produced with the developmen t of conscientious plan to harvest, mill and sell these trees before they begi n to deteriorate and depreciate in value. The increased profits from the sale of the value-added timber would allow something posit ive to result from the loss of these trees . A large portion of this plan entails the identification of a market for the surplu s lumber. Canada could prove to be an excellent market for this timber because of an expanding household furniture market. The Canadian furniture industry needs the imported raw materials to make furniture and/or furniture imports to satisfy demand. This area's native Appalachian hardwoods are very popular wi th the Canadians who would be willi ng to pay a premium for the timber. This study's objective to show how small agricultural businesses in the Southern Alleghenies Region export to markets such as Canada. A profile of small agricultural companies th at trade these goods is also of fered, dispelling some of the myths about exporters. The problems that can be associated with foreign trad e are also indicated along with some suggestions that could provide resolutions to these issues. BACKGROUND The U.S./Canadian Free Trade Agreement that was signed on October 3, 1987, by the United States and Canada is best considered as a capstone to over 200 years of trade and 130 years of trade agreements between the two nations. Separate territories since the American Revolutionary War, Canada and the U.S. have been natural trading partners who share the worlds longest border. Even before Canada gained its independence from the British Empire in 1867, efforts were being made to en sure that trade between the two nations would not be impeded (3). The following is a brief summary of trade agreements between the U.S. and Canada: 1854 - First free trade agreement signed. Animosities created during the Ameri can Civil War between the U.S. and Great Britain ended that treaty in 1866. 1911 - A second attempt at a free trade ag reement was signed. This agreement, howev er, did not even last a year due to internal Canadian pol itical problems. 1935 - A Most Favored Nation agreement was signed as part of the U. S. Reciprocal Trade Agreement Program in an attempt to break down protectionist barriers. 1947 - 1979 - Seven rounds of the General Agreement on Tariff s and Trade (GATT) talks are held. U.S. and Canada are participants and make a number of agreements that begin to lower their trade barriers. 1965 - Auto Pact is signed making all trade in cars, trucks and parts duty-free. The latest free trade agreem ent took effect on January 1, 1989 . it was the biggest step ev er taken by both nations to ensure that markets remained open for exporting/importing and that any existing protectionist barriers were dismantled. This agreement is expected to bring about a 3% rise in Canadian GNP and a 1% rise in U.S. GNP (1). A significant part of the agreement is the elimination of al l bilateral tariffs between Cana da and the United States. All tariffs will be eliminated in stages beginning January 1, 1989, and ending Janua ry 1, 1998. There are three levels of tariff reduction and all products have b een assigned to one of these levels: Level 1 - Immediate elim ination of tariffs Level 2 - Elimination of tariffs within 5 years, 20% cut per year Level 3 - Elimination of tariffs within 10 years, 10% cut per year In addition, a bi-national tribunal has been created to settle any trade disputes between U.S. and Canadian companies. Traditionally, agriculture has been one of the more pr otected markets, but the ag reement implements numerous measures to encourage more trade. The U.S. should bene fit from (11): 1) Reduced tariffs on fresh and processed fruits and ve getables, an area with tr aditionally high tariffs . 2) Raised import quotas on poultry and poul try products 3) Elimination of Canadi an import licenses for U.S. wheat, barley and oats when U.S. price supports are less than or equal to Canadian support levels for their products. The two countries are also working towa rds harmonizing technical regulations a ffecting agriculture, food, beverages and certain other goods. These regulations of ten resulted in non-tariff trade barriers that kept U.S. goods out of Canada (11). PROCESS Agriculture is the largest industry in the state of Pennsylva nia, and in 1988 its exports contributed #236.8 million to the state (7). The Pennsylvania State Depa rtment of Agriculture s ponsors programs that support the export of food and wood products b y assistin g with marketin g and networkin g with ex portin g specialists. Since agriculture is also the single si gnificant industry within Pennsylvania's Southern Alleghenies Region, a survey sample group was developed from its agricultural companie s. A database of 280 local agriculture companies which include farming, forestry, an d food processing was developed. The names were collected from numerous public and private directories that were published for specific agricu ltural industries and for firm s already identified as being involved in foreign trade. All the busin esses surveyed were from the six-county Southern Alleghenies Region served by the Saint Francis College Small Business Development Center and include s Bedford, Blair, Cambia, Fulton, Huntingdon and Somers et Counties. Each agricultural company was sent a three- part questionnaire aski ng information about: 1) company demographics 2) exporting/ importing involvement in Canada 3) exporting/importing in countries other than Canada The purpose of the first part of the quest ionnaire was to develop a profile of busin esses involved in trade. The other two parts placed special emphasis on accessing in formation from the companies about: 1) What they had learned about exporting/ importing, either in practice or through research 2) Why they were or were not interested in exporting/importi ng 3) Foreign firms that had re quested to trade with them Since the responses to the surveys often raised further questions, responders who had agreed to provide further information were personally contacted. The questions they were asked dealt primaril y with background information about their particular industry and how they fit into foreig n markets. For instance, one company that has exported to Canada discussed the problems and solutions that it had en countered when exporting. The agriculture trade marketing specialist for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was contacte d for further information about Pennsylvania agriculture in general and about the services offered to potential exporters. RESULTS A total of fifty-seven surveys were returned, which repres ents approximately 20% of those distributed. (See Figure I) Therefore, the data from this survey should be significant, since most literature considers 20% to be a high rate of return. Part of the process included sending reminder cards to encourage more companies to return the survey. Before the cards, 34 surveys were returned and after the cards were sent an additional 23 were returned. These 23 surveys were 40% of the total return which justified the time and money involved in the creation of the cards. Of the 57 surveys returned, 5 provided no information beca use the companies had gone out of business. Fifty-two businesses thus contributed information about themselves and their exporting/im porting history. The majority of those companies (46%) reported gross sales of over $1 million in 1989 and they em ployed an average of 29 full-time workers. The operations of these businesses ranged from ma nufacturing to retailing and th e types of customers they served were equally diverse. Sixteen companies, or 31%, were involved in foreign trade. Sixty-three percent of those 16 reported gross sales of over $1 million in 1989. Two of the companie s employed over 300 people while the rest averaged twenty-three full-time employees. Most of these companies were involved in manufacturi ng or wholesaling. Fourteen companies had been involved in trade with Cana da. Quebec and Ontario were the primary sources and/or destinations of their goods, but almost every province had be en involved in a transaction. The principal products being exported are lumber products: hardwoods, furniture squares and upholstered chair frami ng lumber. At one time, two other companies had exported some processed food products . One had its product discontinued and was looking for a new market. The other had become frustrated with the pape rwork and restrictions on colors and stabilizers and the bilingual ingredient labels required on all packaging. One lumber exporter was not comfortabl e with collecting payments from buyers that lived out of the countr y. Lumber is also currentl y bein g imported from Canada as a fish and lobster. Thirteen of the businesses (93%) that ha d traded with Canada had been appro ached by Canadian firms to export/import products. All of the American companies ha d accepted the offers, and half of them listed a good selling price as being an important factor in their decision. One importer commented that low freight rates had made it cheaper for him to import his french fries from Canada than to buy them from the West Coast. Thirty-eight companies had not traded with Canada but 24% were interested in and wanted more information about trading with Canada. Only 5% had even investigated th e possibility of trading the Canada. Three firms had been approached by Canadians to begin trad e relations, but one had found a U.S. divi sion of the same firm to handle its business, one had gone out of the logging business and the third could not produce the quantities of raw materials that the Canadian firm needed. (See Table 1) Nine companies had traded with countries other than Cana da. These businesses had exported to Europe and Asia and imported from the Far East, Israel, Europe, Mexico and Guat emala. Current exports consisted of lumber and leather while imports were mostly food products such as sesame seeds and tomatoes . One company that no longer imports mentioned that it had not been very im pressed by the quality of the product it ha d received and was very cautious about re-entering foreign markets. Two other businesses who no l onger traded goods wanted to find new markets where they could begin trading again. Eight of these companies had been approached by foreigners to become involved in trade but three had refused the offers. One had been concerned that his mode of paymen t was unsecured, and another had been required to purchase more than his company could have afforded. Price was ag ain the primary reason that companies had accepted the offers. Of the 43 companies that had not traded with countries other than Canada, al most one third of the businesses were interested in getting involved in trade. Nine percent had investig ated the possibility of doing so, but found exporting and/or importing to be too complicated or too expensive, and one company simply was holding of f until it had ore information. Six companies had been approached by forei gners to trade goods, ut li mited resources and unstable markets kept companies from en tering international markets. One food processor who was interviewed bout is Canadian trade, exports its pr oduct through a Canadian distributor to 11 of the provinces. Despite its success, he company is not pleased with the amount f paperwork that must be filled out before shipment can cross the border. The paperwork is not only time consuming but compli cated so that \"guesswork\" is often used for answering unclear or vague questions. Re gardless, the company has benefitted from the Free Trade Agreement because tariffs on this product have already been cut twice. This business had also been approached to export to Israel nd the Philippines bu t it is cautious bout entering other fo reign markets because of the additional paperwork and the concerns about ensuring the quality of it product. Some implications that could be si gnificant o small businesses in the S outhern Alleghenies region include: 1)Small businesses are trading with Cana da and other foreign countries (277% in Canada, 17% in countries other than Canada). 2)Small businesses are interested in gett ing involved in foreign trade (24% in Canada, 30% in countries other than Canada). 3)Small Businesses are being approached by foreign firms who want to trade with them (31% in Canada, 31% in countries other than Canada). 4)Most of the companies from this region involved in foreign trade had gross sales over $1 million in 1989. They employ an average of 23 full-time employees a nd are primarily manufactur ers and wholesalers. 5)Lumber is one of the primary products be ing exported from this region into Canada. 6)The majority of companies choose to export becau se the are offered a good pr ice for their product. 7)Small businesses often find that the y do not have the resources available to produce enou gh product for ex port. Other small businesses do not have enough capital to import pr oducts that must be bought in large quantities. 8)The bureaucratic component of exporting can sometimes prohibit comp anies from exporting. APPLICATIONS The results from this survey reaffirm the importance of foreign trade to the S outhern Alleghenies Region. Nevertheless, there are still a number of businesses that are not involved in trade because they have neve r been approached by anyone to trade or they have never had the init iative to investigate it themselves. It is these companies that need to be made aware of the opportunities available in exporting and importing. Presently, me mbers of the Southern Alleghenies Planning and Development Commission (SAPDC)and the Sain t Francis College Small Business Development Center (SBDC) are involved in two proj ects that could expand particip ation in the area of exporting. First, the data results from this survey were presented to the Southern Alleghenies Agricu ltural and Natural Resource Committee. Following the meeting where the gypsy moth pr oblem was also discussed, a letter was written to the committee's chairperson suggesting that exporting their hard woods and their value-added products to Canada should be investigated more thoroughly. It was also recommended that a cooperative be established among the members of the silviculture industry. The idea for the cooperative is based upo n a similar cooperative that is being considered by this region's hay industry. Si nce exporting can often require more resources than one company can supply, the purpose of the cooperative would be to enable its members to co mbine their resources and t hus increase profits. Second, the SAPDC and the SBDC formed a Southern Al leghenies World Trade Association. The organization's members are private companies, banks and export specialists interested in learning abou t and exploiting the exporting capabilities of this region. The goal of the organization is to provide exporte rs and potential exporters with an opportunity to network with each other and with service providers. The forum for the networking is a quarterly dinner/presentation meeting where a presente r will discuss current issues that aff ect small businesses in foreign trade. Even more can be done to get businesses involved in forei gn trade markets. For instance, organizations such as the SBDC and the SAPDC could research potential markets for small businesses to enter. They could also provide educational services such as seminars so that companies can begin to understand the issues related to international trade. The survey points out that exporting and importing products with Canada and other countries is a prof itable marketing option for small agricultural businesses. When conducted successfully, exporting and importing can provide the means for these companies to revitalize and expand their operati ons. To help them start su ccessful trading ventures, agricultural businesses should be aware of the services available. For exam ple, many government agencies exist for the sole purpose of providing information and services to exporte rs. These organizations will ta ke products abroad to trade shows assist companies with identifying trade leads and help find ways for businesses to simplify and expedite their trade transactions. Some of these are: Agricultural Information and Marketing Services (AIMS) - A part of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). AIMS provides trade leads to intere sted companies, maintains a database of 15,000 foreign buyers who want to purchase U.S. food products and publishes a newsletter fo r foreign importers with lists of U.S. companies that are offering goods for export. Many of these services are offere d at no charge to the exporter (10). Eastern United States Agriculture and Food Export Council , Inc. (EUSAFEC) - EUSAFEC represents the department of agriculture of ten northeast ern states, one of which is Pennsylvania. It provides assistance with the mechanics of exporting, education about export issues an d collects data and other information for companies interested in exporting (4). Mid-Atlantic Forest Products Export Coal in - This is an organization that he lps coordinate the export of value-added wood from the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware. It collects trade leads and helps companies set up their initial expor ting ventures (6). Penns ylvania De partment of A griculture The De partment of A griculture's International Trade Division takes Pennsylvania products to forei gn trade shows, provides credit reports on fo reign buyers to expor ters, can help with export documents and can help companies deal with the U.S. and other fo reign governments (8). The United States had a negative balance of trade in 1989 a nd will continue to do so unless more businesses take an interest in exporting. Importing goods can be beneficial too, because materials that are im ported created jobs for the people who process those materials. Foreign trade is a viable option for small agricultural businesses that benefits not only the businesses but the economy as a whole. These companies should be enc ouraged to explore and become involved in international trade. *This survey was supported by the Saint Francis Colleg e Small Business Developmen t Center through he Small Business Institute program.

A census was made of all 520 SBI directors. Approxima tely eight percent of the SB I directors indicated they were involved in community developm ent programs other than the traditi onal one-on-one counseling. While the initiatives appear to be successful, th e weakest efforts exhibite d by SBIs occur in the evaluating phase while the strongest occur in the implementing phase. The findings indicate that most of these efforts have been local responses to local needs on a project by project basis rather than addre ssing all phases of the model in a comprehensive manner. INTRODUCTION RURAL DEVELOPMENT Community development became an important aspect of rural development strategies during the 1960's and 1970's. Rural health care and physician recruitmen t were major initiatives. Developed in part to assure equal access to rural residents, regional planning and de velopment commissions emphasized inte rgovernmental planning and growth strategies. The Economic Development Administration began and continues to fund many of these efforts, often in cooperation with other federal agencies and the states. Economic studies of rural America ha ve been conducted by the federal govern ment, state agencies, colleges and universities, local developmen t organizations, and private consultants during the 1980's. Most studies recommended states consider both agriculture and non- agriculture approaches in crafting long -term solutions to the farm and rural crisis in their states. In a 1986 survey , conducted by the Center for Agricultur e and Rural Development at The Council of State Governments, four basic approa ches were identified: agriculture-rela ted development, tr ansition assistance, rural business assistance and rural community assistance. More than 500 state programs in 34 categories were iden tified. An update of this survey in 1988 found over 700 programs in 30 categories. Three state ag encies emerge as the principal factor s in state agriculture and rural policy formation: agriculture, economic devel opment, and community affairs. Other st ate agencies such as mental health, education and labor often provide \"t ransition assistance\" to individuals and communities in distress. The diversity of programs reflects the di versity of the rural economy. This groundswe ll of activity is a natural response in trying to save a declining way of lif e, and demonstrates the strong sense of independence and self reliance rural America has long been known for. In addition to th e 700 programs identified in the 1988 study, many rural communities also have local initiatives to blunt the steady drain on their economies and citi zens. Such efforts increase the number of programs addressing rural de velopment many times, and adds to the complexity of an already confusing array of state and federal projects. RURAL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT MODEL A general model of business development in rural areas has been designed by the author while working at the council of States Government's Center for Agriculture and Ru ral Development. It draws on the U.S. Small Business Administration, Economic Development Administration a nd the Tennessee Valley Authority rural development experiences. This model is generic in nature and zero s in on rural development. Each one of the five phases could apply to a variety of key issues such as education, health care, and quality of life which pla gue progress in rural areas. Phase V and perhaps Phase II contain elements common to any type of comprehensive rural in itiatives while the other three phases have elements unique to business development. Organi zing and evaluating are weak links in the model. Many programs offer help and advice but do little to build independence and grass root level initiatives. With the exce ption of leadershi p develo pment few projects recruit, struct ure, and establish groups to carr y on after the projects termination. The impact of development efforts are usua lly measured, if at all, in soft descriptive terms instead of hard facts. There is little ev idence of effective criteria establ ishment, monitoring, and follow up. Assessing is the first step in rural busin ess development and establishes a base li ne for the following phases. In order for development to progress in an orderly fashion and ha ve maximum effect, informat ion should be gathered and analyzed to describe the business clima te. If essential pieces of community puz zles are missing expansion efforts will be retarded and many new ventures doomed to fail before th ey are launched. Once assessed and organized, a community is in position to develop a long term approach to over all business development. Several strategic, or even better a combination of strategies, can be pursued to improve local business conditions such as strengthening existing business, creating new ones, recruiting new indus tries, and retaining local money. Implementing involves transforming the plan s from an idea or concept to a realit y. In this phase actual businesses or potential businesses receive help determining feasibility, capital, in formation, training, and technical assistance. SMALL BUSINESS INSTITUTES Purpose and Scope The purpose of this survey was to determine the extent of SBI involvement in ru ral economic development. Small Business Institutes have traditi onally concentrated their efforts in th e implementing phase through one-on-one counseling to individual businesses. SB I's were originally conceived to aid troubled businesses backed by SBA financial support. Because of tightened loan requirements the number of SBI cases genera ted by the SBA has dwindled causing the SBA and some schools to start thinking in terms of broadening the SBI's scope to include community based business development. Over 500 schools provide assistance to our 7,000 small busin esses each year. These businesses are geographically dispersed throughout the county. A majority of participating colleges a nd universities are located in rural area s resulting in a di sproportionate high number of cases to be located in small communities. With the exception of a few nation ally recognized projects no organized efforts have been made by sc hools to concentrate on individual comm unities. Cases are normally chosen on an individual as needed basis rather than a planned community wide development approach. Analysis A census was made of all 520 SBI directors. Each director was sent a two page questi onnaire consisting of three sections. Section I was based on the five phases of the general rural business development model (assessing, organizing, planning, implementi ng, and evaluating). The dire ctors were asked whether th ey had been involved, were now involved, or just involved in these phases. Section II attempted to determine the scope of involvement by requesting numbers of students, teams, co st, duration, and types of business or acti vities. Section III asked for evidence of success and leads on other universit y rural development activities. Findings A total of fifty three directors returned questionnaires. Responses were received from twenty nine schools located in twenty one states who have either been involved or are now involved in rural developm ent projects. Fourteen schools in eleven states indicated that they we re not and had not been involved in ru ral economic developmen t. The result of the survey was summarized by phase: Assessin g 1.

Time Span of Projects 2.5 to 12 months In addition to the schools responding to the survey, five unive rsities had SBI programs which were identified as being involved in extensive rural economic de velopment demonstration projects. A su mmary of these projects are provided below: 1. Illinois Project School: lllinois State University Director: Phases: I, II, III Towns: 2 Students: Results: Information Not Available Teams were involved in a variety of projects which included economic analysis, attitudes of citizens, consumer studies, organizing leadership, downtown revi talization, tourism, transportation, recreation, promotion and business development. **This project has been considered by the White House sta ff for possible incorporation into national policy for rural development. 2. Wisconsin Project: School: University of Wisconsin-Eau Phase: I Students: Results: Informal Evaluation Only The project concentrated on improving th e overall business environment in the two communities. The projects were broken into four areas: a community resource profit, ec onomic analysis, shopping behavior and individual business profiles. **This project has been studies by the White House staff for policy purposes. 3. Nebraska Pro ject: School: University of Nebraska , 14 Phase: IV Students: Results: Formal Evaluation Not Available This Project has won awards from Exxon, Freedom Foundation, Joint Counc il on Economic Education and the National Association for Indus try-Education Co-operation. It has also been written up in Business Week and the Wall Street Journal. Mid-career graduate students spend two weeks in one town working to impr ove already existing businesses. 4. Virginia Project: School: James Madison University Director : Rodger Ford Towns: 1 Phases: I, III, IV Students: Results: No Evaluation To Date The project was a joint ventur e between James Madison, Virg inia Highlands Community College, and the Appalachian Regional Commission. A site sel ection process was developed for phase I whic h included criteria a nd assessments. SBI subcenters were set up at the junior co llege to deliver phase IV counseling. 5. Georgia Project School: University of Georgia Director: Rudy Kagerer Towns: 3 Phases: I, II, II I, IV Students: Results: Just Being Implemented This is part of a Kellogg Foundation grant to mobilize and network existing rural devel opment agencies. A detailed inventory of the business environment wa s developed, communities were organized to promote development, strategies were developed, existing businesses are bei ng strengthened, and new ones were created. DISCUSSION Responses to the questionnaire were recei ved from fifty-three schools located in twenty-eight states . There was a fair regional representation with gaps found in th e far west, great plains, and east coast. The level of involvement of SBI by phase followed a pattern found in previous studies of ru ral economic development: (i.e., in descending order of invol vement) implementing, assessing, planni ng, organizing, and evaluating. The number of schools providing traditional one-on-one business counsel ing out number the schools evaluating rural development programs two to one and have almost one hundred more stude nts involved in implementing than in the next closest phase, assessing. The level of funding differen t significantly from a high of $15,000 to a lo w of $100. This differential seems to be explained by the scope of the project. Pr ojects involving more students, teams, a nd greater lengths of time cost more. The government rate set by SBA, $400 pe r case, appears to be the norm for most schools. The length of time also varied but not to the extent of funding varied. Most variation was found in planning and implementing phase ranging from one to twelve months. The dura- tion was likely to be determined by either the course length or project completion date. The specific type of businesses or activities identified in each phase also varied significantly. The implementing phase was most well defined, and the evaluating phase was so rely lacking in informati on. Implementing consisted of traditional counseling involving all types of businesses and all types of servi ces speci- fied in the questionnaire. Planning activities were also well defined and si milar to those defined in the questionnaire. Traditional types of businesses were c ounseled in assessing phase but the type s of activities were only generally described. This was also the ca se for the organizing phase. Only seven SBI directors provided an y evidence of success. Most indicated that the y do not track this t ype of data. Of those reporting, 29 new businesses were created and 129 businesse s were retained. One Main Street project resulted in the creation of several new fans and significa nt reinvestment in the downtown area. Of the five SBI demonstration projects, Nebraska seems to be the most successful to date. The director identified a rural community and sends in teams of graduate students to provide trad itional SBI counseling. The work is concentrated into a time span of three to f our weeks. This project is the longest running project and has worked with most communities. It is appa rently well received by the communities served because there is a waiting list of small towns requesting help, plus it has recei ved numerous awards for innovation in edu- cation. The Illinois project covers al l aspects of rural business development with exception of evaluati ng the worth of the project. Numerous types of community data are collected, task groups are or ganized, strategic plans developed, and individual businesses are advised. Two comm unities have been helped over the last past six years, and plans are being made to work with a third town. The Wisconsin project concentrated on assessing the business climate in tw o communities and worked with high schools as well as college students to leverage. The info rmation was used by the Cham ber of Commerce and local banks to promote new businesse s, attract new industries, an d strengthen current business. The students currently are not working with any new towns. The Georgia projects also worked wi th both high school and college stude nts. Two communities have been participating and services were provided in all areas of the development proces s except evaluating. Several businesses were started at one town including one by the students themselves. A third to wn will be helped in the future. The Virginia project established an SBI program in a community college in a de pressed rural area. A selection process was used to identify the community in which to work. Trad itional counseling was provided to thirty-three businesses. An evaluation plan was developed but not fully implemented at this time. CONCLUSION The SBI is a well establishe d geographically dispersed program uniquely situated for mobilizing students throughout the country into a force which could help attack problem s plaguing rural communities. Un til recently the services provide one-on-one counseling to small business. The cases were randomly generated th roughout the school's service area. In the past five years there has been a move to focus th e efforts on communities in order to improve their business climate. The rollover effect of a holistic approach to bus iness development serves to provide greater opportunity for successful business retention, expans ion, and creation than the traditi onal random one-on-one counseling. We were seeking profiles of programs which had experienced rural economic development and did not request replies from schools that had not. Twenty-five percent of the questions were recei ved by schools who had SBI programs but did not have a small town focus. Severa l of these schools were located in ur ban areas and had an urban mission. There were, however, some attempts being made by the urban sc hools to move beyond the city into satellite towns. Most SBIs service rural areas, and many of the schools wh ich were not involved in a rural development program indicated an interest in getting involv ed. Only five schools provided an in dept h look at their programs. These programs were created to be demonstrations for illustrating the benefits and evolving and integrating SBIs into the main street of rural business development. Neither th e demonstration SBIs nor those responding to the survey provided hard data supporting the success of their programs. Further, information needs to be generated concerning what works and what doe s not, what is transferable and what is not, and how this information can be share d. It seems imperative that means other than testimonials, attitudes, and case examples be devised to evaluate success. Until now no attempt has been made to organize and integrat e SBIs into the rural development systems at the state, regional, or national level. It is bein g done at the local level in reactive rather than pro-active manner. The local programs have moved to fill gaps in the system - a loca l response to a local need. B ecause a functioni ng network of SBIs is already in-place, it could be rapi dly employed on a much larger scale of rural development. In order for this to happen, plans will have to be made, suppor t will have to be established, coordina tion will have to be developed, and fundin g will have to be secured. PREPARING SBI TEAMS TO DEAL WITH FUNCTIONAL WORKPLACE ILLITERACY Theodore J. Halatin, Southwest Texas State University Roger D. Scow, Southwest Texas State University ABSTRACT This paper describes the seriousness of illiteracy probl ems in small businesses as re ported by 134 owners and/or managers of small businesses. The focus is on the reading, wr iting, and computational abiliti es and skills of employees, customers, and suppliers. Suggestions are offered to help SBI directors a nd student teams when they encounter illiteracy problems in a client's business. INTRODUCTION SBI Directors and students on consulting teams may encounter a pro- blem th at plagues many businesses-functional workplace illiteracy (FWI). Within or associated with th e client's business there may be people who have reading, writing, or computational skills that are deficient and in adequate for the demands of the job and the business. ILLITERACY IN AMERICA Illiteracy is a national problem that adversely affects business organizations and operations. Businesses need people who can read, write, and compute, yet according to the Coal ition For Literacy, 27-million Americans can't read. (#l) Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole describe d this growing problem when she said, \"At the same time that skills levels are, increasing, you have about 500,000 young people dropping out of school each year and another 500,000 who complete high school but are functionally illit erate. About 20% of workers are functionally illiterate, and many have sk ills that are obsolete or soon will be obsolete because of the increased technology.\" (#2) The problem is even more critical as evidenced by the declining scores on the college entrance tests that gauge advanced reading skills of students hoping to enter colleg es and universities. (#3) Verbal scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test taken by students entering college in 1990, ar e down and tied for the wors t performance ever. (#4) ILLITERACY PROBLEMS IN BUSINESS Illiteracy is a major problem for many businesses. The Bottom Line: Basic Skills in the Workplace, a joint publication of the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Education, describes a major concern of business as the need for work ers with stronger basic skills to accomplish tasks in the workplace of today and to adapt to the workplace of tomorr ow. (#5) The Wall Street Journal describes American schools as \" ... producing students who lack the skills that busin ess so desperately needs to compete in today's global economy.\" (#6) The illiteracy problem is described in greater detail in many business orient ed publications. FORTUNE, in a special issue, discussed the problem and what businesses are doing. (#7) Supervisor y Management offered suggestions for supervisors. (#8) Articles on the prob lem of illiteracy in business have app eared in recent issues of Association Management and IABC COMMUNICA TION WORLD. (#9 and #10) ISSUES FOR SMALL BUSINESS While the problem and the responses by businesses are well publicized, Anderson describe s two items that are of special interest to those involved with small businesses. First, the issue of work force illiteracy is elusive in that the most of the published literature is anecdo tal relating to a few dramatic instances rather than solid data. Second, most of the data does not include small businesses. (#11) ILLITERACY PROBLEMS IN SMALL BUSINESSES The Survey Information about illiteracy problems in small business was obtained from questionnaires completed by the managers and/or owners of 134 small businesses in Texas. Participants in the study were asked to mark the blocks that best describe the seriousness of nine proble m areas for their businesses. The proble m areas, presented in figure 1, involve the reading, writing, and computati onal skills/abilities of employees, customers, and suppli- ers. FIGURE 1 SERIOUSNESS OF LANGUAG E AND MATH PROBLEMS AS REPORTED BY SMALL BUSINE SS OWNERS AND/OR MANAGERS VERY SERIOUS SERIOUS SLIGHT NO DESCRI PTION PROBLEM PROBLEM PROBLEM PROBLEM Reading abilities/skills 1 5 28 100 of employees 0.7% 3.7% 20.9% 74.6% Writing abilities/skills 28.4% 64.9% Mathematical or compu- tational of employees 1.5% 4.5% 26.9% 67.2% Reading abilities/skills 0.7% 3.7% 32.1% 63.4% Writing abilities/skills 0.7% 2.2% 27.6% 69.4% Mathematical or 0.7% 3.0% 30.6% 65.7% of customers of suppliers 1.5% 1.5% 9.7% 87.3% Writing abilities/skills 1.5% 0.7% 11.2% 86.6% Mathematical or lities/skills 1.5% 0.7% 11.9% 85.8% of suppliers Totals may not equal 100% due to rounding. The Respondents More than half (54.6%) of the businesse s were described as retail operations. The others included 2.2% wholesalers, 5.2% repair and service operations, 7.5% manufacturers, 16.4% professional services, and 14.2% with combined operations. The businesses ranged in size fr om no full-time employees to 250 full-ti me employees. Sixty per cent of the businesses reported having part-time employees. The participants included 79 males and 55 females. They ranged in age from 20 years to 60 years. Survey Results The summary of responses, presented in figure 1, reveal that illiteracy a nd innumeracy are problems for small businesses. Figure 1 presents the number and percent of respondents marking each block. Reading, writing, and computati onal skills and abilities of employees are problems for small busin esses. While nearly 75% of the respondents indicated \"no probl em\" with the reading ability/skills of employees, one in four respondents did find this to be a problem area. More than one-third (35.1%) of the managers and/or owners of small businesses indicated problems with the wr iting ability/skills of employees. Nearly one-third (32.9% ) described the mathematical o r computational abilities/skills of em ployees as a problem. Considerin g the im portance of readin g, writin g, and computational abilities/skills of employees, it is discouraging that so many managers and/or owners of small businesses describe these deficiencies as problems for their businesses. The literacy and numeracy abilities/skil ls of customers are pro- blems for a large percentage of the small business owners/managers. Only 63.4% stated that the reading ability/skills of customer s were not problems for the business. A large percentage (30.5%) reported problems with the writi ng ability/skills of customers. One-third (34.3%) reported that the mathematical or comp utational skills of customers were problems for the business. Although the literacy and numeracy problem s with suppliers are not as great as those with employees and customers, problems do exist. Problems with the read ing ability/skills of s uppliers were reported by 12. 7% of the respondents. A slightly higher percent (13.4%) reported pr oblems with writing ability/skills of suppliers with the highest percent (14.1%) indicating problems with th e mathematical or computational ability/skills of suppliers. Reading, writing, and computati onal deficiencies of employees, customers, and suppliers are problems for many small businesses. SBI directors and students on the consulting teams must be prepared for FWI problems in small businesses. PREPARING STUDENT TEAMS FOR FWI PROBLEMS The program director must be alert for reading, writing, and computationa l deficiencies of student team members. Declining SAT scores, criticisms of publ ic education, and performan ce on proficiency exams point to the possibility of language and computational deficienci es of college students who may be on the consulting team. Students with deficiencies will need special attention. Team members should be alerted to the pr oblem of FWI in small busi- nesses. The information presente d in this paper, supported with local ar ea studies, can be useful in emphasizing the re ality of such problems for small businesses. Many articles describe the signs of r eading, writing, and computat ional deficiencies. Student consultants should read industry related materials for specific examples of defici encies, efforts to hide the deficiencies, and the resulting problems for the business. While the student consul tants should be alert fo r language and computational defi ciencies, they should NOT react immediately to their observations. The observations should be professionally noted and disc ussed in privacy with the director and other team members. Student teams should be alert for language and computational deficiencies of customers and suppliers. Customers who are unable to read directions may need graphic aids. Supp liers who deliver the wrong mate rials may be causing costly problems for the business. The client may need to find new methods for working with customers or suppliers who are illiterate. Local area programs for combatting ill iteracy and innumeracy should be contac ted for information and assistance. Community education programs are being alerted to the problems within small businesses. (#12) The section \"Opportunities fo r Improvement\" in the final report can addr ess the problem of illiteracy. Local area remediation programs can be identified and described as well as the possibl e benefits from such programs. CONCLUSION Functional workplace illiteracy is a problem for small businesses. It is a problem that will not go away. SBI directors need to recognize the magnitude of the problem and be pr epared to assist the student teams when they encounter illiteracy. REFERENCES 1.

PERCEPTIONS OF RURAL SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND MANA GERS TOWARD CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE* Joe Ballenger, Stephen F. Austin State University Geralyn McClure Franklin, Stephen F.

ABSTRACT Child care assistance for employees may be one of the mo st serious issues facing employers in the 1990s. But, many employers have yet to deal with this issue. For small employers, ignoring th e issue may be detrimental to future development and survival. This paper will present the result s of a survey of rural small business owners and managers. It will also examine various forms of child care assistance, paying particular attention to viable options available for small employers. Finally, a child care assistance st rategy for small employers will be outlined. INTRODUCTION Day care was once considered a private, family decision. Th is has changed. Day care is now an issue of major concern to employers and employees. This concern is especially important for small busine ss owners and managers. Small businesses play a vital role in the economy. Small employers will continue to create new jobs in the coming years. Given the shrinking work force, sm all employers will find it more difficu lt to recruit workers to fill these new jobs. Therefore, it will be necessary for small employers to be more creative in offering compensation and benefits in order to attract and retain qualified employees. The availability of child care assistance may mean the difference between losing or retaining productive employees. The pressure on small employers to provi de child care assistance comes from ch anging demographics. According to the United States Department of Labor's Child Care, A Work force Issue (15), a number of changes have occurred and others are expected in the work force. Today, more than 70 percent of the women between ages 25 and 34 are in the labor force. Only 35 percent were employed in 1950. By the year 2000, 61.5 percent of all women will be in the work force. In addition, two-thirds of the new entrants into the labor force between 1986 and 2000 will be women. In terms of sheer numbers, women will have more influence than ever before, and many will be working in small businesses. Since more and more women are entering the work force, day care has become a ma jor employment issue. Women, however, are not the only employees to whom child care assist ance is directed. Child care has become a necessity for men as well as women, for white-co llar and blue-collar workers alike, a nd for top level managers as well as employees just entering the work force. Should employers provide assistance for child care? Those employers responding \"y es\" to this question believe that getting involved in child care helps incr ease recruiting, retention rates, productiv ity, morale, quality, and public image. At the same time, they indicated that ch ild care initiatives decrease accident rates, absenteeis m, tardiness, and turnover (2; 5; 6; 11). On the other side, those employers who say \"no\" tend to express concern over lack of demand, expense, liability, lack of knowledge, and equity (2). CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE OPTIONS Many employers feel that caring about child ren requires caring for children in onsit e child care facilities (4). An onsite facility is only one alternative. Accordi ng to the literature (2; 4; 5; 16), the four most common options include: information and referral services, flex ible human resource policies, financia l assistance, and direct assistance. Information and Referral Services Some employers opt for Information and Referral Services , commonly called I & R. This occurs when the employer provides information to its em ployees about day care providers, including in -home providers and day care centers (4; 9; 11). A com prehensive I & R service involves either an in-house consultant or an outside, contract referral a gency working closely with care givers in the area. Providing news letters and workshops for pare nts enables them to better understand the system and th e services available. The bulk of organizations that offer I & R appear to do so because it is one of the cheapest ways to assist employees (9). Some companies have received added cost savings by pooling their resources to form an I & R consortium. Flexible Human Resource Policies Human resource policies that are flexible are increasing in popularity (4; 5; 10; 13). Such policies include flextime, job sharing, work sharing, work at home, part-t ime work with benefits, flexible matern ity/paternity leave, and flexible sick leave. All or a combination of these alternatives can allow parents more freedom, more time with the family, and less conflict between work a nd family obligations. Financial Assistance Businesses are also assisting working parents by providing fi nancial assistance. Employers may consider a \"cafeteria\" or flexible benefit plan. Under the \"caf eterial\" plan, the employee chooses bene fits from a \"menu\" of options up to a specified amount. The employer ge nerally pays for a core pack age of benefits for each employee, and additional benefits are availa ble at the employee's expense (7; 16). The most popular financial a ssistance arrangement offers a \"flexible spending account\" that is funded by voluntary salary deduction (7; 16). Typically, the employee will designa te a certain amount for depe ndent care at the beginning o f the year. This amount is deducted from the employee's pretax wages and placed in the \"flexible spending account.\" During the year, the employer pays the care provider or re imburses the employee directl y. Since the amount in the \"flexible spending account\" is no longer part of the employee's salary, he/she saves by paying no income or social security taxes on the money. The employer saves on social secur ity and payroll taxes. Any money left in the account at the end of the year is forfeited. The voucher system is another type of child care assistance that employe rs are offering. In some instances, the employer makes direct payments to day care providers to secure reduced rates and priority placements for employees' children. Otherwise, direct subsidies are paid for care of the parents' choosing (1). The voucher system can be fully or partially subsidized by the employer. Direct Assistance The most serious commitment that an em ployer can make is by building a day care center onsite or near the firm's operations. A number of employers have done just this (4;5; 6; 8;14). However, this is often an expensive alternative in terms of equipment, qualified day care personnel, liability insurance, and administrative costs. Employers that want to make a commitme nt of this sort but cannot afford to on their own often team up with others with similar feelings. Thus a consortium of employers may build their own day care center or contract with a day care provider to operate a center for th e organizations involved (3). REVIEW OF CURRENT RESEARCH Several studies have been undertaken in order to determine if and how organizati ons are involved in child care. One of the most recent efforts was a 1988 survey by the Society fo r Human Resource Management (12). The results indicated that 71 percent of those organizations with less than 100 employees and 63 percent of those with 100-500 employees are \"not currently involved in child care.\" Two percent of those employing less than 100 employees noted that they are \"currently providing child care assistance,\" while six percen t of those with 100-500 employe es responded that they are \"currently providing child care assistance.\" An overwhelmi ng majority of those noting that they are \"currently providing child care assistance\" cited fl exible spending accounts and flexible benef it plans, respectively, as the type of assistance being provided. It appears that many small em ployers have not yet consider ed child care assistance program s. But, does this hold true of small employers in rural America? The remainder of this paper will present the results of a survey pe rtaining to how small busi ness owners and managers in rural America view child care assist ance. In addition, a child care assistance strategy will be developed for small employers. SAMPLE METHODOLOGY The sample for this study was drawn from a rural, Southern county's Chamber of Commerce membership list, an up-to- date enumeration of businesse s by employment size. It was assumed that th e Chamber of Commerce membership list would consist of the more progressive companies in the county. Thus, the owners and managers would be more sensitive and interested in the current human resource issues like child care assistance. This population frame consisted of 533 (N=533) members from various industrie s in the county. The sample size was 52 units or approximately 10 percent of the frame. Since thre e of the contacted businesses re fused to participate in the survey, a response rate of 94 percent or 49 sample units resulted (n=49). Using a judgment sampling technique, the field workers ch ose the actual sample units by attempting to assure representativeness simultaneous ly across several industries and employment size categories. The sample is comprised of units from the industries as indicated in Table 1. Table 2 summarizes the firms in the sample by number of employees. The questionnaires were admini stered by personal interview in December of 1989. Only the owners or managers of the sample businesses were interviewed because it was believed that these individuals woul d know the most about the day care policies in their respective businesses. _________________________________________________________________ TABLE 1 SA MPLE INDUSTRIES Industry Number % Retail Services 10 21%* Restaurants 4 8% Hotels/Motels 4 8% Building Supply/ Hardware 100% _________________________________________________________________ Key: * Cleaners, Cable TV, Travel Agent, Etc. ** Flower Shop, Sign Shop, Auto Parts, Etc. __________________________________________________________________ TABLE 2 SAMPLE FIRMS BY NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES # of Employees Number % Less than 25 30 61% 26 to 50 8 16% 51 to 100 9 19% 101 to 200 2 4% _____ _____ Total 49 100% ___________________________________________________________________ RESEARCH FINDINGS Of the 49 sample businesses, 96 percent (47/49) indicated that they do not provide child care assistance for their employees. Only four percent (2/49) pr ovide some sort of child care assistance. Both of these businesses have fewer than 25 employees. One organization provides a flexible sp ending account that is funded by voluntary salary deduction; the other has an onsite child care facility. Various reasons were given for not providing child care assistance. These are outlined in Table 3. _________________________________________________________________ TABLE 3 REASONS FOR NOT PROVIDING CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE Reason Number % No need 16 34% Financial reasons 10 22% Not enough children 6 13% Business too small 4 9% No response 3 6% No idea 2 4% Regulations 2 4% Not responsibility 2 4% Corporate guidelines 4% The number of need\" responses from Table 3 is rather in teresting when responses to ot her questions are considered. The small business owners and managers we re asked if their employees ever expre ssed a need for child care assistance. Sixty-three percent (31/49) sa id their employees have not expressed a need, while 35 percent (17/49) said their employees had expressed a need. The rema ining respondent was not aware of the needs of employees. But, when asked if their employees actually use some kind of child car e arrangement, 74 percent (36/ 49) responded affirmatively. Even though respondents cited varied drawba cks to organization-sponsored child ca re, 30 percent (15/49) indicated that child care assistance was/would be bene ficial to the business. Three specific benefits were men tioned. These were: convenience to the employees, morale of the employees, and less absenteeism. Another interesting finding de alt with the respondents' knowledge of child care assistance options. At first, the researchers felt that the respondents would be totally una ware of the various child car e assistance options, except possibly onsite facilities. Surp risingly, almost one-half (47 percent, 23/49) were either aware of one other option or seemed receptive to other options besi des onsite facilities. In f act, 26.5 percent (13/49) of the owners and managers said they would be willing to form some type of partnership arrangement with other local businesses interested in providing child care assistance for their employees. Ultimately, the 47 small business owners and managers not currently providing child care assistance were questioned about their intentions in the future. Fi fty-three percent (25/47) said they are \"not willing to provide any child care assistance for their employees.\" But, tw enty-six percent (12/47) expressed an in terest in providing child care assistance in the future. The remaining 21 percent (10/47) were \"unsure.\" IMPLICATIONS Additional research is necessary in order to uncover the amount of knowledge that rural, small business owners and managers have about child care options. Rural, small busin ess owners and managers seem to have a receptiveness toward, and at least a limited understanding of, the various ch ild care assistance options. CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE STRA TEGY FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS Although the majority of the small busine ss owners and managers surveyed indica ted that they were \"not willing to provide any child care assistance for their employees,\" a number expressed an interest in formulating a child care assistance program. Their basic comment was: How do we get started? The following strategy was developed by the authors in order to answer this question. Step One: Familiarize your self with the child care assistance options. It is important that you gather information about the various child care assistance options. Specifically, you will want to inquire about information and referral services, flexible wor kplace policies, flexible spending accounts, flexible benefit plans, voucher systems, on/off site child care centers, and a child care consortium. Information can be obtained from public and university libraries, as well as the Department of Labor. The De partment of Labor provides a compute r- based, information bank \"hotline\" which profiles the dependent care policies of American businesses. The \"hotline\" number is (202) 523-4486. Step Two: Assess em ployee needs. The best way to respond to the needs of your employees is to find out the type of child care assistance that would best meet their needs. An employee survey w ould be the best vehicle for addressing these needs. Questions that need to be addressed are as follows. How many children are represented? What are the ages of the children? What kinds of care are they currently receiving? Are employees content with this care? How many employees at tribute child care concerns to their absenteeism? How many employees attribute chil d care concerns to their tardiness? How many employees attribute child care concerns to other work-related problems? How can the orga nization assist employees with their child care needs? Step Three: Study your business. It is important that you conduct a thorough evaluation of the business. First, ex amine the demographics of your labor force. Do you have a significant number of female employe es with small children? Do you have a significant number of male employees with small childr en? How many employees, male and fema le, are single heads of families? Next, determine how much production time is lost to abse nteeism and turnover. How much of this absenteeism and turnover can be attributed to child care responsibilities of your employees? Are night shifts causing problems for employees with children? An analysis of the organizati on's resources is also required. Be sure and consider the projected savings of implementing a child care assistance program in terms of reduced abse nteeism, reduced tardiness, lower turnover, increased productivity, improved morale, and so forth. Step Four: Evaluate the community. When evaluating the community, you should obtain responses to the following questions. Do child care facilities exist? Are existing facilities adequate to the need? What do the ex isting facilities charge per we ek? What are other businesses doing about child care assistance for thei r employees? Would other businesses be in terested in a joint venture of some type? Step Five: Analyze the options. A thorough examination of the child care assistance options should be conducted. This examination should consider the results of the employee survey, analysis of the business, and evaluation of the communit y. It may be necessary to consult child care providers or experts during this stage. At this point, a cost/benefit analysis for the various opti ons is often useful. Then, the most viable option for your business should be determined. Step Six: Develop a nd implement a plan. The plan of action should specify what th e business will do to assist employees with child care and when the business will begin providing such assistance. Specifically, what wi ll the business provide? What wi ll employees have to do? When will the assistance begin? The implementation process s hould begin by communicating the plan to your employees. It is vital that employees fully understand what the child care a ssistance program entails. This understa nding can be enhanced by appointing a knowledgeable employee to answer questions about the selected child care assistance program. Step Seven: Modify the plan. At times, it may be necessary to make changes in the pl an of action. Be sure and ke ep open communication with your employees so that you can track needed changes. Encourage employees to presen t any problems they may have as well as possible solutions. In other wo rds, flexibility is the key. Ste p Eight: Evaluate the plan. A cost/benefit analysis of any business decision is inevitable . In order to conduct a proper co st/benefit analysis, be sure and set realistic goals. For instance, how is the child care assistance program to impact absenteeism? Tardiness? Turnover? Morale? Etc.? CONCLUSION Child care assistance for employees is no favor; it is an investment. An examinat ion of the financial costs involved is inevitable. But, equally important is the other side of the question: What is the cost for not providing assistance? The effectiveness of the choice is not determined by the amount of money spent, but rather by how well thought out and planned the response is to the employees' needs. Small employers have a choice. They can take initiative by developing individual innovativ e solutions that capitalize on emerging demographics, or they can ignore and thereby lose their opportunity to shape programs that work cost effectively for everyone--parents, children, and their businesses.

PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS FOR THE DISABLED : IMPLICATIONS OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES Geralyn McClure Franklin, Stephen F. Austin State Univ ersity Robert K. Robinson, University of Mississippi ABSTRACT This paper examines the public accomm odations provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. Specific details regarding compliance with the Act are provided. In addition, certain ambiguities of the ADA are discussed. INTRODUCTION The Americans with Disabilities Act (A DA) of 1990 (2) is undoubtedly the most si gnificant law in terms of potential impact on business since the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Enacted on July 26, 1990, the ADA protects the disabled (o r handicapped) individual from discrimination in employment (Title I), public services and transportation (Title ii), public accommodations (Title iii), and telecommunications (Title IV). Title V contains miscellaneous pr ovisions detailing exemptions, attorney's fees, coverage of Congress, and amendments to the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Before the enactment of the ADA, the primary federal la w addressing discrimination against the disabled was the Vocational Rehabilitation Act (VRA) of 1973 (4). However, the VRA only covers federal agencies, recipients of federal financial assistance, and federal contractors. The ADA will impose obligations that are similar in nature to those imposed by the VRA upon many more priv ate employers and businesses, as well as state and local governments. PROVISIONS OF THE ADA Under the ADA, an individual with a disability is one wh o \"has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, ha s a record of such an impairment, or who is regarded as having such an impairment\" (2, Section 3). A major life activity includes functions such as car ing for oneself, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, and working. Title I Under Title I, all businesses with 15 or more employees will be required to disr egard disabilities (or handicaps) when making employment decisions and to make special accommoda tions for disabled employees at their own expense, unless cost is too burdensome. The ADA, like other major civil rights legislati on, includes a variety of sanctions for violators, including those engaged in j ob discrimination. It follows current ci vil rights law by al lowing victims of employment discrimination to seek back pa y, reinstatement, and attorney's fees. The Equal Employment Opportunity Comm ission (EEOC), the agency responsible for processing and investigating employment charges, has 12 months in which to promul gate regulations implementi ng the employment provisions. Enforcement of employment provisi ons will begin on July 26, 1992. Title III Although the employment provisions are of concern to both la rge and small businesses, the ADA's most significant impact on small businesses is likely to emerge from its T itle III, Public Accommodations and Services Operated by Private Entities. According to John Cerret ani, Senior corporate counsel/vice president of Comerica, a Detroit, Michigan bank holding company, this section of th e ADA does nothing more than \"try to meet the expectations of a group of customers\" (1). He continues by sayi ng that \"the debate is over, business must comply\" (1) with the ADA by makin g their facilities usable and accessible. The public accommodations provisions of the ADA apply specifically to all businesses defined as \"public accommodations. \" This term is an extremely inclusive de finition and brings more smal l businesses under the Act's coverage than those required to meet the ADA's employment discrimination provi sions. As an exampl e of some of the business enterprises which would be defined as \"public acco mmodations,\" the following li st is provided: bakeries, banks, bars, beauty shops, bowling alleys, clothing stores, day care centers, dry cleaning establishments, funeral homes, gas stations, grocery stores, hardware stor es, health spas, hotels, professional offices (i.e., medical, dental, legal, etc.), restaurants, shopping centers, th eaters, and travel agencies. It should be noted that this list is by no means exhaustive. Furthermore, the proscription against discriminating in public accommodation is based on the type of business establishment rather than the size of the business establishmen t; and this applies to virtua lly all small businesses (not just those with 15 or more employees). Having generally established what firms are affected by the ADA, it is only na tural that the individual effects be examined. Under the Act, it is emphatically stated that \"N o individual shall be discrimi nated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, serv ices, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accomm odation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation\" (2, Section 302(a) ). This very nebulous legal proscription includes not only policies, practices, and procedures which deny the disabled access to a public accommodation, but physical barriers as well. Though a business's policies or procedures can cause it to incur certain legal li abilities if it is found to deny access (i.e., injunctions or a fine not exceeding $50,000 for first offens es or $100,000 for second offenses), these can, nonetheless, be readily changed once the owner/ma nager is made aware of them. The aspect of the new legislation which ca nnot be so easily remedied focuses on the physical access to public accomm odations and commercial facilities. Unless the owner/manager can show that it is structurally impracticable to make the facilities accessible to the impaired (and the ADA is particularly vague as to what is acceptable as such proof), he/s he will be held as violating this pr ovision and liable for its penalties. The place of business is expected to be accessibl e to the \"maximum extent feasible\" to individuals with a disability, \"including those individuals who use wheel chairs\" (2, Section 303(a)). This would include insuring that those confined to wheelchairs have an unobstructed \"path of travel\" in and out of the public a ccommodations. Further, the area should be altered to allow easy access to rest rooms, telephones, and drinking fountains. When making these alterations, the Act does consider whethe r or not these structural modifications are \"readily achievable. \" The term \"readily achievable\" is more or le ss equivalent to the term \"r easonable accommodation\" in the VRA. Both terms allude to the feasibility of the busine ss meeting its obligations under the Act without incurring an undue hardship in doing so. This is to imply that the busine ss can achieve the alterations without much difficulty or expense. Four broad guidelines are provided for ma king a compliance determination. First, the nature and the costs necessitated with compliance must be assessed. Essent ially, this involves determining what cha nges must be made in order to meet minimal compliance and the estimated expens es associated with these modifications. Once the costs have been estimated, the financial condition of the individual facility under investigation must be examined. Here, the overall financial res ources of the facility involved in the ac tion are ascertained. Other factors taken into consideration at this juncture are the number of persons employed at the faci lity and the impact that the cost of making the alterations will have on it s continued operation. For a single facility business, the \"readily achievable\" determination would not pr oceed beyond this point. If the business has multiple locations/ facilities (in varying de grees of compliance), then the overall financ ial resources of the entire operation will be reviewed. This would include considering the overall size of the total ente rprise. Additionally, th e number, type, and location of the individual facilities would be evaluated. Again, the organization's tota l work force size would be a factor meriting consideration. Finall y, the investi gation should examine the t ype of o peration (or operations in the case of diversified com panies ) in which the firm engages. Such an assessm ent should include the composition, struct ure, and functions of the work force. As in the previous investigations, some deference to the fi scal relationship of the specif ic facility in question to the covered business is authorized. Once the designated information is collected, the investigatin g body is to reexamine it, analyzing it as thoroughly as possible. The investigating body will then make a determ ination (on a case-by-case basis) whether structural modifications are readily achievable. Title III of the ADA incorporates remedi es available under Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (3). Thus, plaintiffs have a private right of action and the right to seek injunctive relief from a j udge. The remedies provision also gives the attorney general the right to bring an acti on in cases of pattern or practice of di scrimination or in suits of general public importance. In such cases, a judge can assess a civil penalty of not more th an $50,000 for the first violation provided the facts of the case warrant such a penalty. The judge ma y also award monetary damage s to disabled individuals affected by the discriminatory action if the attorney general so requests. PROBLEMS WITH TITLE III The problem with these guidelines is that they are unduly vague and ambiguous. In this respect, \"readily achievable\" is very similar to the \"undue hardship\" assessments contained in the VRA. Th ere is little guidance for achieving consensus between the affected pa rties. What an owner/manager perceives as a readily achievable modification may not necessa rily be viewed as such by disabled individuals or the investigating body. In an attempt to incr ease the discretion of the investigators, the ADA fails to provide clear and understandable guidance to businesses as to what is expe cted of them in making st ructural modifications. Just as important, the ADA is not explicit in informing the business community as to what circumstances exempt a business from strict compliance. If the VRA's \"undue hardship \" is a harbinger of events to come, then businesses may expect a more concise definition of \"readily achievable\" to be slowly developed through a lengt hy series of judicial decisions. It would, therefore, be reasonable to expect an increase in l itigation until this public accommodation issue is more fully resolved. CONCLUDING REMARKS The ADA has major implications for American business. Small businesses ma y find themselves particularly vulnerable when attempting to comply with the public accommodations pr ovisions of the Act. Precipitated on the assumption that smaller businesses will need time to digest the Act and to comply with its new requireme nts, Congress has delayed the effective date of the public accommodations provisions a full 18 months from the date of the ADA's enactment. Thus, the public accommodations provisions become effective on January 26, 1992.

A \"FIRST STEP\" SAFETY AUD IT FOR SMALL BUSINESS Brian McNamara, Cal State University Bakersfield James Vigen, Cal State Univ ersity Bakersfield Martin Marsh, Cal State University Bakersfield Ho ward Rudd, College of Charleston ABSTRACT The importance of health and safety progr ams for small businesses are at a critic al point. Without a health and safety program, a business could lose competitive edge. This paper pr esents a first step safety a udit which will: (1) gauge how well a small business is doing in terms of employee safety and health and, (2) sensitize a small business owner to the type of actions management must adopt to provide an effective health and safety program for their employees. INTRODUCTION In the past, it has been recognized that small businesses will not have extensive safety pr ograms. Small start-ups do not have the \"organizational slack\" of medium and large sized co mpetitors. This is exemplified in the employee safety record keeping and reporting exemptions permitted firm s with fewer than 10 employees by state and federal governments. But, current events in the area of health and safety preclude a small business from anything other than a total commitment in this area. For example, in many sm all businesses the owners may not be aware of the hazards caused by chemicals commonly used in their business. Ofte n, information con- cerning po tential hazards associated with these chemicals is provided to larg e users but may not be directly communica ted to a small business since they are considered secondary users. As stated by Bex, though it may be quite unintenti onal, information to small users may simply fall through the cracks.[l] Even without specific le gislation, it is argued that businesses have an ethical responsibility to create and prom ote a health risk program.[2] The Growing Need For Safety In Small Business It is the authors' contention that most small businesses need help in identifying what they can do to improve the safety and health of their employees, custom ers, and other persons passing through th e premises. In the past dawdling around with safety in the new venture phase may have been worth th e risk. However, recent trends suggest that the cost/benefit threshold for attending to organizational sa fety may occur much earlier in the life- cycle of the successful firm. Inability to predict costs stemming from poor safety can be catastrophic for the small business and thus, employee safety is no longer in the \"nice to have\" categor y. Some emerging trends that invite early development of safety management programs fo r small businesses include: 1. Intensification of government regulati on of small business safety. In particul ar, new government re gulations include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (O SHA) Hazard Communication Standard. This standard \"requires every workplace in the country to identify haza rdous substances on the premises, list them, and train employees in their use.\"[3] 2. Soaring costs of liability and health care insurance. The liability crisis ha s been widely recognized and documented. Nearly every small business has been rocked by traumatic increases in the costs of liability and/or health insurance. According to Huneycutt and Wibke r, \"The cost of liability insurance has b ecome prohibitive increasing by as much as l,OOO percent in one year for some firms.\"[4] 3. Growing propensity for employees and customers to sue or claim disability for illnesses and injuries acquired in and around business facilities and premises. Many law firms specialize in such cases a nd offer free services if the plaintiff receives no compensation. Juries and judges tend to be symp athetic toward the disabled employee or customer and awards often go to the party with the \"deepest pocket.\"[5] 4. Increases in reportable injuries and illnesses in service industries. In the healthcare and motel/hotel industry, workers who are required to lift mattresses and/or patients, are repor ting higher than average injury rates due to back injuries. [61 5. Vulnerabilit y of executives to criminal char ges when there is evidence of mana gerial ne gligence in on-the- job accidents.[7] OSHA has long possessed the power to levy fine s on business firms for safety and health violations. The amounts are often substantial and have, sometimes co ntributed to the end of troubled businesses.[8] Besides the threats posed by these emer ging trends, lack of attention to on -the-job safety and health can have significant impact on the bottom line. In 1986 the national aver age number of work days lo st was 63.9 per 100 full time workers. For young firms, and especially those in the new ve nture stage, the cost of replacing workers who miss work because of work injuries or illnesses will have serious consequen ces on the bottom line. Furthermore falling below the industry average for lost time due to acciden ts or illnesses can cost the small business in terms of worker's compensation insurance premiums. Firms with better - than-average accident prevention rates pay lower premiums. Finally, at least in California, a firm 's accident experience may influence th e amount of dividends distributed by worker's compensation fund. A \"First Step\" Safety Management Audit There is a myriad of safety rules and regulations applicable to small businesses. One almost needs an advanced degree in safety management to stay out of trouble. It is very easy for academics a nd government regulator s to criticize poor safety management programs;-- it's another thing to help the small busine ss do something about it . Small businesses can no longer wait to develop a sy stematic approach to the management of safety and health in the workplace. Even for \"new venture\" firms with car efully developed and implem ented safety programs, the benefits are likely to exceed the resulting cost. For a small business, the first step in developing a health and safety management program is a \"safety audit\" conducted personally by the owner/manage r of the small business. This can be done using a questionnaire designed to enable the owne r/manager to evaluate their safety a nd health program. The primary objective of the \"safety audit\" is to sensitize th e small business owner to the type of ac tions management must adopt to provide an effective health and safety program for their employees. The questions included in the questionnair e for the proposed safety audit were developed using the existing literature on the subject. Those selected represent important parame ters gauging how well a company/organization is doing in terms of employee safety and health. The questionnaire has 16 questions and the owner/manage r is given a choice of 4 responses. The remaining six questions pr ovide an opportunity for 'YES' or 'NO' responses. The first 16 questions have a score connected with their res ponse. The same is true with 'YES'/'NO' answers. These scores dir ectly reflect a business's/organization' s efforts about a health and safety management program -- the highe r the score the greater the ef fort. These scores were deve loped based on the subjective judgment of the authors. A copy of the questionnaire can be found in the APPENDIX. (An interactive version of the questionnaire will be available on diskette to attendees of this session at the conference.) Once you have completed the questionnaire, please tota l up your scores for each statement you marked. Use the descriptions given below to gauge where your business stands. 0 - 15 EMERGENCY!! Your organization/business is currently doing very little in term s of health and safety management. This is a perilous situation and you are vulnerable to all th e factors discussed. At this poi nt, it is appropriate that you apply the 80/20 rule: identify the areas where you are most vul nerable and then focus your efforts in these particular areas. That is, identify the 20% of needed changes that will bring you about 80% general improvement in your safety and health management program. It is critical at this time to use all the free prof essional and health advice and assistance you can hire a safety and health consultant to provide concrete recommendations on how to remedy your current situation. 15 - 30 PAY ATTENTION!! Your business may be jeopardized by a neglect of employee safety and health. It is important that you review the questions where your scored less than 1 and answered 'NO' and seriously consider implementing the implied recommendations within statem ents of higher value or 'YES' respon ses. In addition, use all the free professional advice and assistance you can and seek out and hire the services of a professional health and safety consultant. 30 - 40 CONGRATULATIONS!! Your compa ny/organization is doing very well in the area of heal th and safety management. Your involvement in this area will pr ovide benefits far outweighing the costs and may provide the competitive edge you require to be competitive. It is important at this time not to rest on your laurels but to keep up the good work and continually reassess and modify as required your health and safety program. Work on the questions in which you had a low score or responded with a 'NO'. D ecide whether the risks you are taking in neglecting these areas are worth the expenditures of time and money you are saving through this neglect. CONCLUSION This paper suggests that a small business may not be the safe st place to work. Recent trends, however, show that firms are running greater safety and health risks than ever before. A \"first-step\" safety and health audit is prescribed to sensitize owners/managers to the relative strengths and weaknesses of the small firm's safety and health program. The audit consists of the owner/manager re sponding to a 22 item questionnaire, designe d to bring him or her to the point where an intelligent appreciation of the problems invol ved can be made. The quest ionnaire may not fit every organization and some parts of the questionnaire maybe more important than others. Howeve r, if an owner/manager investigates the is sues presented, the small business would be very well on the way to improving workplace safety. Based on this self analysis, the owner/ manager can appreciate mo re fully the value of a he alth and safety programs. Perhaps even more critical is the realization that a health a nd safety program dire ctly effects a firm's ability to compete in today's turbulent bus iness environment.

TECHNIQUES FOR AN RESULTS OF IMPLEMENTATI ON OF AN EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT PROGRAM IN A SMALL HIGH- TECHNOLOGY FIRM Joseph C. Latona, The University of Akron ABSTRACT This paper reports the results of an employee i nvolvement program on members of a small high tech firm. The areas of behavior (commitment) of employees and attitude of these employ ees toward management are described. A technique for the implementation of such a program is presented. INTRODUCTION A Brief Industry Background The computer evolution star ted affecting instrumentation in the earl y 1970's when manufacturers incorporated microprocessors in their products to cr eated more intelligent instruments. Since that time instruments have gotten smarter, often containing microcom puters of greater power than the average personal computer (PC). This evolution in instruments can be seen even with the basic volt- ohm-meter (VOM). The first VOM was little more than a meter and switch-selected range re sistor. This simple instrument has e volved into the digital multimeter (DMM) of today. These DMM's, when interfaced with a co mputer, make a powerful da ta acquisition system. The next step in this evolution was the reducing of the DMM to a single printed circuit board that plugs directory into the computer. This eliminates the cabinet, display, sw itches, interface and power supply from the DMM. The instrument can no longer operate \"stand-al one,\" but this is a small penalty comp ared with the cost reduction achieved. Relevant Research The concept of employee involvement (EI) in the modern era was introduced as quality control circles (QC) in 1962 by Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa and the Union of Japanese Scientist and Engineers (JUSE) as a to ol to enhance quality of production by Japan's large firms involved in the manufacture of durable goods (15). In the United States the first EI program was formed in 1971 at General Motors' Tarreytown, New York asse mbly plant, grew to 300 programs in 1979, and to over 3,000 in 1980 (15)! Employee involvement beginnings can be traced to the concept of participative management and self control originated with large firms in the private sector and was first practiced by the DuPont company after World War I. By the mid 20's, Alfred P. Sl oan, Jr. of General Motors us ed the term \"Management by Objectives and Self Contro l\" systematically with great conceptual clarity. In the public sector the basic conc epts were also strongly advoc ated by Luther Gulick and his associates in the mid and late 30's in their studies of the organization and ad ministration of the Federal Government (10). Certainly today, as in the beginning, employee involvement seems to ha ve become more p opular among the large multinational conglomerates than it is am ong the smaller high-tech firms. It is mo re discussed as a tool of the large, rapidly expanding, high technology-t ype firms (1) (12) (16) (22) (26). Much of the literature on th e subject of employee involvement has been limited to big business and large gove rnment agencies with conclu sions based on a comparative analysis (1) (7) (8) (9) (16) (22) (26). Smaller high-tech firms are not implementing employee involvement for a variety of reasons which include: 1) the belief that EI is a tool that only big bus iness can understand; 2) the belief that it require a staff of specialists that only a large firm can afford; and 3) the lack of perceived need (5) (11). This article dispels the above and points out the benefits a small high-tech firm can deri ve from an employee involvement program. The objectives of this study were: 1) to generate and evaluate empirical data in order to determine what influence EI would have on members of a high tech firm in the areas of behavior (commitment) of employees (4) (6) (18) (24) (27) (30) (31) and attitudes of these employees toward management (leadershi p) (10) (21) (25) (27) (2 8) (29) (30); and 2) to report techniques that were utilized by a consultant in in troducing this EI program into a emerging high-tech firm. Employee Involvement -- A Tool of partici pative Mana gement An employee involved program is a process whereby a group of workers doing the same or similar work in the same department or work area meet regular ly and voluntarily (usually once a week on company time) to discuss problems associated with their jobs. The group's obj ective is to identify the real cause of a problem and to discover way(s) to eliminate that cause. This process implements the behavioral theories of Masl ow and McGregor with the qua lity concept of Deming. This process is a subset of the broader concept of quality of work life which links pr oductivity, motivation and job satisfaction through recognition of the im portance of the employees' perception of their individual work contributions (2) (4) (7) (25) (27) (30) (31). THE BEGINNING GROWTH OF DATA INSTRUMENTS Overview Data Instruments incorporated on April 15, 1984, with the ch arter to design and market state-of-the-a rt electronic instrumentation for the personal computer market. Data's success bordered on exceptional. It's net in come rose from -$71,000 (19 84), -$27,000 (1985), to +$130,000 (1986), +$210,000 (1987), & +$370,000 (1988). Data markets it's products to small portion of the ever-expanding personal co mputer market, joining a number of manufacturers who are in the \"personal instrumentation\" bus iness. These companies range from printed circuit broad manufacturers to system manufacturers. Data does not compete directly with any of the curr ent participants but in stead identifies and ills holes in the \"personal instrumentation\" market. The DM-100 series was Data's first pr oduct. This instrument, designed for th e APPLE and IBM user, is a printed circuit board plug-in that allows the user to make automated measurements of voltage, resistan ce,and frequency. The DM-100 is positioned between the trad itional approach of interfacing a tabletop DIGITAL MULTIMETER to a computer and low prevision plug-in boards. The DM- 100 is a unique approach to high-precision, automated measurements. The next product was a data display scrolle r. This product allows a computer us er to display data as a continuously scrolling graph on the computer's CRT while the experiment is in process. The pres ent approach is to display data using a graphics controller after all the da ta has been acquired. Since personal co mputers are not capable of efficient simultaneous acquisition and display of data, this product will re lease the computer of the display task and give the user immediate feedback. The APPLE version of this product was released in the fi rst quarter of 1985. Aversion addressing the rest of the market, including IBM, wa s released in the third quarter of 1985. Marketing The company concentrates on two majo r personal computers - the APPLE and th e IBM PC. There are presently more than 1 million of each of these machines in the field, with APPLE having the original edge due to its greater installation base. IBM has become the standard due to its greater installation base and therefore has become the industry leader. Most technical applications of personal com puters are based on one of these two machines. A realistic estimate of the percentage of these machines goi ng to technical application is 20%. Data will be profitable by placing its product in less than 1% of these machines, or less than .2% of the total number of APPLE and IBM personal computers. There are a number of companies market ing add-on data acquisition boards for PC's. They tend to be multichannel analog input-output boards typically for low to medium resolution stimulus/measurement applications. The DM-100 product is unique in the market place, providing a low cost -method of making automated, high-precision measurements of voltage, frequency, of resistance. The current alternative is a systems di gital multimeter communicating with a computer via the IEEE-488 instrument base. The cost of such an instrument is t ypically in the $1000-$2000 ran ge. Additionall y, an IEEE-488 interface must be purchased for the computer at a t ypical cost of $500, yielding a total syst em cost of $1500-$2500. Clearly, a plug-in board at $550 is a more co st effective solution. The DM-100 finds applications in any i ndustry making precise measurements of voltage, frequency, or resistance. In the analytical chemistry market, one of the major users of personal computers, the product can be connected to spectrophotometers, flourometers, PH me ters, chromatographies, and scales. Another major user of the board will be companies involved in automated test and calibration of instrumentation. This includes the manufacturers of such in strumentation, as well as many electr onic service and rental companies. APPLE computers have appeared in medi cal research laboratories, research hos pitals, and universities all across the country. These institutions are using them to automate their experiments as well as to reduce collected data. Typically, they are interested in precision measur ements taken from resistance temperatur e devices (RTD's), various flow and pressure transducers, as well as from low-level analog volta ge sources. A key requirement for applications is that the equipment be electronically isolated. Si nce most of the available data acquisi tion boards are neither isolated nor precise, this is a key selling advantage for Data's boards. The company advertises in industry tard e journals such as American Labora tory, Instruments and Apparatus News, Electronic Design, laboratory Equipmen t, Physics Today, and Byte Magazine. Leads generated from theses advertisements are followed by Data's re presentatives. Advertising consists of 2/3-pages, 2-color ads enhanced by a two-color product brochure and multi-page Product Description to provide additional product info rmation. Advertising will become more intense as sales begin to generate cash. Data has four manufacturer's representa tives under contract and is actively soli citing more to achieve total domestic representation. Key Personnel One of the principle founders of Data In struments, Inc. was James J. Flower. Fl ower developed his initial expertise in electronics while working for Gould Inc. (Instruments Divi sion) in Cleveland from 1977-1978 as a design engineer. At Gould, Flower was responsible for the design and production of a system named \"speed gage\", a multi-capacitive transducer and microprocessor electr onically controlled gaging system. Flower the moved to Gilford Instru ment Laboratories in Cl eveland from october 1978 until April 1984. Gilford manufactures and markets spectrophotometer based instrument ation. The two main categories of products are research and clinical chemis try analyzers. The design of these products utilizes the knowledge and effort of chemical, electronic, mechanical, and software engineering. Flower had total electronic responsibility for four major system s. Flower's educational background is an engineering degree from Clevel and State University in 1976. Roy W. Hart, the other princi pal founder, also developed a wide range of experience at Gould from 1976 through April 1984. hart moved through the levels of application engine er, design engineer, senior design engineer, and product manager. In the latter position, Hart was responsible for all market and business aspect s of assigned products, including market research and analysis, business planning, market ing/engineering, coordinati on, and new product introduction. Hart's education includes an engineer ing degree from the University of Da yton in 1976, and an <.B.A. from Case Western Reserve in 1983. Flower's insight into the expanding opportu nities of computer application in the instrumentation field ignited the entrepreneurial thrust that resulted in his convincing Hart to combine thei r talents in to the Data venture. Planning for the Future at Data Both Flower and Hart were pleased with positive cash fl ow in 1987, but they were concerned with maintaining, the innovative open climate among employees that both identified as Data 's competitive strength. In 1987 they retained the services of a consultant to im plement an Em ployment Involvement program. METHODOLOGY Sample The firm in this study is a high-tech company in northeast Ohio with a nnual sales of nearly $3.2 million and total employment of thirty six full-time and twelve part-time employees. Only twenty two full-time employees participated in the program and the study. These twenty two employees were with the firm at least one year which included a four month training period and the first eight months of th e employee involvement program . The remaining fourteen employees had less than one year with the firm and were not included in the training a nd/or implementation of the program. Questionnaire data were collected from the same twenty tw o members for two time periods: pre-employee involvement phase and postemployee involvement phase. All individuals we re involved in the use of EI training conducted prior to initiation of the program. Nine respondents were male and th irteen female with the brea kdown according to the three organizational levels and types of work (line - staff) as follows: two top-leve l line; one top-level staff; eight middle- level line; four middle-level staff; two lowe r- level line and four lower-lever staff. Procedure The researcher worked directly with the respondents which included a four m onth employee involvement program. The study was approved and supported by top manage ment, questionnaires were distributed by and returned to the resear cher (who had no a ffiliation with the firm) and the results remained anonymous. The model utilized for the proc edural section of th e study contained the following phases: Interview Phase During this phase the researcher attemp ted to develop a non- threatening enviro nment, thrust, confidentiality, openness, and rapport. Members were informed that all responses were anonymous; no one within the organization would see individual questionnaires; only aggregate data would be incl uded in the feedback phase; and individuals not willing to complete the questionnaire we re not required to do so. The Researcher A. Explained to employees at each level of the organization the manageme nts's goods, i.e. 1)to determine what problems existed in the organi zation as perceived by members at each level through use of questionnaire 2)to generate options 3)to recommend soluti ons 4)to implement change B. Explained the questionnaire to memb ers, responded to questions regardi ng the questionnaire, his role, etc.; C. Explained the necessity for objectivit y in responding to the questionnaire. Data Gathering Phase This was the sole responsibility of the researcher. Responde nts were instructed to complete the questionnaire at home and return by inter-office mail. Questionnaires were comple ted for the pre- employee invol vement training phase (T1 Fall 1988) and the postemployee involveme nt implementation phase (T 2 Fall 1989) by the same sixty-two respondents. Again, anonymity was emphasized; respondents were not required to sign the questionnaires. Analysis of Data Phase Conducted independently by both the researcher and members of t op management of the firm. Im plementation Phase This phase was the sole responsibility of the researcher with administrative s upport. In this study the implementation phase consisted of 12 three-hour sessions conducted over a four-month period in whic h the principles and concepts of a successful employee involvement program were explained to three separate groups consisti ng of members from all three levels of the firm. Feedback Phase Results of both the pre-employee invol vement questionnaire and the post-empl oyee involvement questionnaire were discussed individually with each participating member of the organization and the researcher. In addition, the researcher was available for open- ended types of individual sessions which were conducted in confidence. (See Figure I).

What were problems ? What changes occurred ? MEASUREMENTS OF VARIABLES A modification of the Likert que stionnaire (17) (18) per Melcher (21) was ut ilized with the scale expanded from one to nine. In addition to being used in Likert's own work, the orig inal instrument has been empl oyed in recent evaluations of O.D. Programs (13) and a human relations program (14). Beha vioral dimensions were meas ured as follows: individual behavior as measured by j ob involvement, work-goal com mitment and sense of achievement; intra- group behavior lateral (behavior among co-workers), as measured by confidence and trus t, job-related communications and cooperation patterns; intra-group behavior vertical (behavior between leader and subordinate s), as measured by trust, flow of requested information, communication screening a nd acceptance of decisions of immediate superior; inter- group relations lateral (behavior between work groups), as m easured by confidence and trust, interaction patterns and cooperation. The dimensions of attitudes of subordinates toward managers (leade rship) were measured as follows: representation (superior emphasizing eith er need os subordinates or needs of higher management); interaction (close relationships between superior and subor dinates); standards (amount of shared responsibilitie s in setting standards); goals (shared responsibilities in setti ng goals); participation (in decisions di rectly related to task performance); direction (close to no direction from s uperior); rule enforcement (strict to l oose adherence); and motivation (use of rewards vs. sanctions). FINDING/IMPACT OF THE INTERVENTION PROCESS Table I indicates that there were signifi cant changes in four of the eight dimens ions of attitude of employees toward management (leadership measured). Ch anges in one dimension, goals, was signi ficant at the .01 level and standard participation and motivation were significant at the .10 level using the t-test. Th e change in representation, interaction and direction and rule enforcement were found to be insi gnificant. Table I also indicates that there were signi ficant changes in five of the fourteen behavioral dimensions measured (all at the .10 level). Within the category of individual behavior the dimension of work goal commitment increased significantly (.10 level) from the pre- space to the post-employee involvement program . In the category of intra-gr oup behavior lateral, again only one of the dimensions, cooperation pa tterns, increased (.10 level). Of the fi ve dimensions measured within the category of intra-group behavior one was significa nt at the .10 level. This was trust upward. The changes in the dimension of coopera tion within, the category of intergr oup relations lateral, was found to be significant at the .10 level. Confiden tial trust and inte raction patterns were foun d to be insignificant. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Hopefully this paper has described, through a longitudinal appr oach, both the influence of a consultant's intervention and the use of an employee involvement program has had on a small high tech fi rm. Evidently the original climated created by Flower and Hart was very empl oyee oriented since four of the eight dimensions of attitude of employees toward management indicated any change in the post EI time period and one at the .01 level. That dimension being, not surprisingly, goals. Further evidence that the Ei climate in was unusually empl oyee oriented was the response to the fourteen behavioral dimensions. Five dimensions changed signi ficantly and all at the .10 level. Hopefully, the EI program will continue to maintain a productive climate. This study also reported techniques that were utilized by the consultant in introducing employee involvement into a small high firm; techniques that are af fordable to this type of firm. Obviously, some of the positive effects described above ar e a result of the introduction of the employee involvement program. However, there is no attempt to isolate the specific causal factors due to the limitations of the methodology utilized in this study. Of course, the findings of this research are generally limited to the research setting desc ribed; however, generalizations could be derived from more broadly-base d research settings that could support, modify or refute the findings of this study.

Clark, Xavier University ABSTRACT \"Managing Diversity in the Small Business Workplace\" disc usses how America's demogra phic revolution will effect the management of small businesses in the near future. It describes the changing composition of the American workplace, highlights the implications of these changes, and describes a rationale and a set of implementation guidelines for a small busin ess diversity program. INTRODUCTION Twenty years ago Neil Armstr ong took \"one small step for man, one giant step for mankind.\" Few could foretell the incredible impact that spa ce research would have on current technology. From microwave ovens to cordless car phones, lives have dramatically changed as a consequence of the effort to put an American on the moon. Even more revolutionary has been the impact of social trends which became visible in the 1960's: * Betty Friedan's Feminine Mystique was a manifesto for th e equality of women in edu cation and the workforce; * Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech was a clarion call for equality for Blacks. * Caesar Chavez's leadership of a succe ssful boycott of grapes brought national attention to the plight of Chicano migrant workers. * The \"Special Olympics\" highlighted th e capabilities of the handicapped. * Asian boat people began migrating to the United States looking for freedom from war and the opportunity to learn and to succeed. As the Hudson Institute's Workforce 2000 and other future or iented publications have dem onstrated, these trends are now having -- and will continue having -- significant impacts on how American sm all businesses recruit, train, retain, and promote their workers. (1) This paper 1) highlights key facts regard ing the demographic revolution; 2) asse sses the implications for small business management; 3) demonstrates why smal l businesses should develop diversity programs; and 4) outlines steps for implementing a diversity program. The Demographic Revolution 1. The 1990's will confront American small business with si gnificant labor shortages es pecially for young workers. The workforce will be growing at its slow est rate since the 1930's. John Naisbett, author of Megatrends, points out that there will be 4 milli on fewer entry level applicants in the 1990's than there were in the 1980's -- simply because there will be more people leaving the work force than will be entering it. Young people will be especially scarce, with two million fewer people aged 1624, or an 8% drop, in this segment during the 1990's. In fact, the Tower-Perrin survey indicates small businesses are already having difficulty fi lling current pos itions. (2) 2. Small service businesses will create virtua lly all of the new jobs, most of which will require higher levels of skill and eduction than ever before. Continuin g the trend of the 1970's and 1980's, virtuall y all new jobs will be created b y small business, primaril y in the service sector. Over half the new jobs will be in service occupations, administrative s upport, and marketing and sales. Most of these jobs require a bove average scores in reading, math, and language. In fact, of all new jobs that will be created over the 1984-2000 period, more than half will require some education beyond high school and almost a third will be filled by co llege graduates. Whereas today, only 22 percent of all occupations require a college degree, 30% of new j obs will require a college degree. This figure underestimates the tr end, given that many jobs currently he ld by high school graduates, such as technical salespeople and managerial accountants, will be filled in the future by college graduates. In fact, \"jobs that are currently in the middle of the skill distribution will be th e least-skilled occupations of the future, and there will be very few net ne w jobs for the unskilled.\" (3) This is disturbing given the results of a study the US De pt. of Education conducted wh ich showed that among 21-25 years old, large numbers of wo rkers lack basic skills: * 40% of Whites, 60% of Hispanics, and 75% of Blacks coul d not locate information in a newspaper or almanac. * only 25% of White, 7% of Hispanics, and 3% of Blacks could decipher a bus schedule. * only 44% of Whites, 20% of Hispanics, and 8% of Blacks c ould correctly determine the change they were due for the purchase of a 2-item restaurant meal. (4) The fastest growth categories: lawyers, na tural scientists, and health professionals require the hi ghest level of ability in reading, math, and language. 3. Not only will the labor market be tighter , it will also be more diverse. It will be more female, more nonwhite, and more mature. a. White males will make up only 15% of all new labor entrants in the next 10 years. b. The biggest impact will be \"the feminization of the work force.\" Sixty two percent of new entrants will be women, including 42% white native American women, 13% black native American women, and 9% women who have immigrated to the US. Over half of the women joining the workforce will have ch ildren at home. In fact, the ma jority of children under six will have mothers in the workforce. Most working mothers want part-time employment, flex ible hours, or stay-at-home jobs. As the Hudson Report concludes, \"If employers fail to provid e sufficient jobs with flexible working arrangements, more mothers may choose to leave the labor force during their child rearing years, further reducing the numbers of new workers entering the workforce.\" (5) c. Native nonwhite Americans will make up 20% of all new workers. d. Immigrants will constitute 22% of all new workers. In fact , two thirds of the world's gl obal migration will be to the United States. By 2000, people of Hispan ic origin will make up 20% of the tota l US population. And ci ties such as San Francisco will have Asians as a majority of their citizens early in the next century. (6) e. In addition, the American workforce will be \"middle agi ng\" in the years ahead, with the average age climbing from 36 to 39 by 2000. (7) 4. Ethnic minorities are exercisi ng increasing market power. Blacks and Hispanics make up a $425 billion annual consum er market, one that will grow to $650 billion by 2000, a market lar ger by far than our combined total ex ports to Ja pan and Canada, our two lar gest international consumers. (8) Implications For Small Business These demographic trends have important implications for small business today. Ma nagers will need to change the way they recruit talent. And they have to cr eate multicultural work environments that will allow their business to value and profit from the diversity of the new labor force mix of the coming decades. In short, small business organizations that are to be successful in the twenty-first ce ntury are going to have to be gin implementing changes now. 1. organizations will have a much more difficult time than in th e past in recruiting talent. Not only will there be fewer applicants from which to choose, but because of labor shortages, they will have to work harder to retain the employees they do successfully recruit. Compounding the problem will be the behavi or of large businesses, which will be dipping more deeply into the labor pool. This means small businesses will n eed to raise incentives to attract and retain workers, increase the productivity of existing staff, equipment, and methods, or recruit more from a pool of nontraditional applicants. They will be recruiting not only women and a variety of ethnic minorities, but also ot hers who differ from the mainstream in age, appearance, physical ability, experience, and lifestyle. (9) 2. To attract excellent tale nt, small businesses will have to impl ement successful dive rsity programs. As Burnell Robers, CEO Mead Corporati on, has pointed out, one of the biggest challenges facing organizations in the 1990's will be fostering \"the fu ndamental values of the corporation without stifling the creative and productive talents\" of diverse employees. (10) Rationale for a Diversity Program Small business leaders should view promoti ng diversity as more than a business n ecessity -- they should view it as a solid business decision -- with a positive rationale behind it. As Rosabeth Kantor show s in The Change Masters, companies with progressive human resource policies have high er longterm profitability and financial growth than their non-aggressive counterparts. (11) Done well, a diversity program can result in improved profitability because of four factors: 1) better decision-making; 2) improved ability to deal with customers; 3) better manageme nt of all workers; and 4) bett er ability to recruit the best of all talent available. 1. A diversity program leads to more cr eative and effective decision-making. For example, Nancy Woodhull, President of Gannett News Media concludes th at USA Today has been successful because readers find its format and news stories interesting because they refl ect the insights and acti ve involvement of a diverse group of employees, including women and minoritie s, both young and old. (12) 2. A diversity Program improves an organization's ability to meet the needs of customers. Business success in large part is a reflection of a superior understanding of consumers and their needs. To sustain this superior understanding of consum ers, small businesses must develop a workfor ce that reflects the demographics of its customers. And who better knows the needs of women, Black s, Hispanics, Asians, the handicapped, the dual career family, and the single parent family than women, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, the handicapped, dual career couples, and single parents? Promoting diversity can also help on the international front, an area of major opportunity for American small business. Markets both at home and abroad are becomin g more com petitive and demandin g. Therefore, it is critical that organizations develop workforces that are effective in deal ing with a diversity of cultures, not only within their own organizations, but also in terms of the workforce s of th eir national and internationa l suppliers, distributors, and customers. Speaking to this point, Felice Schwartz observed in a recent issue of the Harvard Business Review that black women often enjoy significant success in the in ternational arena, an arena which is becoming more and more important to American small bu sinesses. (13) 3. A diversity program will help develop be tter management of all company talent. Participants from all levels of organi zations have commented that diversity training has broadened their horizons and expanded their enjoyment of different people. Not only do they find that they appreciate ot hers more, they also find their coworkers appreciate them more now that they better understand each other. Diversity training also prepares managers for the reality that in the futu re they will increasingly be teachers and nurturers of highly specialized professi onals, knowledgeable workers who often w ill have more detailed knowledge of job-relevant subjects than they do. Thus, it is important to have a program to develop and reward ma nagers who can effectivel y manage people in what Peter Drucker calls \"turbulent times.\" As he points out, increasingly supervis ors must act as assistants, resources, and teachers. And the new elements in the labor force -whether they are physically handicapped, working part-time, single parents, or minorities with various ethnic backgrounds -- require differen t leadership than superv isors have traditionally been trained to give. (14) 4. A diversity program also improves the ability to recruit, develop and retain the best of all available talent. Workers will be attracted to companies in which they know they can succeed on me rit and in which their ideas will be listened to and respected, regardless of race, gender, handicap, or ethnic origin. Implementing a Diversity Program So far, this essay has discussed why, given that the workfo rce of the future will be hi ghly diverse, small businesses begin now to develop work environm ents which encourage diversity. Now it turns to the question of implem entation -- the steps smal l business organizations can take to implement successful diversity programs. 1. The first step is to gain commitment from leadership to make the development of a multicultural environment a top priority. The Tower-Perrin survey shows that top management suppor t is crucial for success. \"Among organizations where concern about labor shortages is refl ected in strategic plans, 42% recrui t nontraditional workers, such as the handicapped or elde rly and 51% apply a market ing approach to hiring. By contrast, among those that have not ye t translated concerns into specific pl ans, just 16% recruit from nontraditional sources and only 35% market to prospective candi dates.\" (15) Unfortunately, the survey also revealed large businesses were far more likely to fall into the former group and small businesses in the latter group. An initial step for top management in developing a diversity pr ogram is to inform its employees of its strong commitment to diversity. For example, top management at Pr octer & Gamble issued the following Multicultural Vision statement: Procter & Gamble is a multicultural organizati on whose members are committed to the business value of a diverse workforce. We achieve a full contribution from all segments of our workforce ad vantaging or disadvantaging no one as a result of cultural background . We fully develop and challenge each individual's talents. Our diversity has increased our abilit y to market products that give us a com petitive advanta ge. We are a model for the entire business community and proud of it. 2. The second step is to align the organization with these goals . The key to success here is demonstrating that diversity is not simply an equal opportunity co mmitment, but rather a business decision which effectively prepares the organization for the future. Diversity trai ning -- with visible top management s upport -- often is effective in gaining support for diversity programs among mi ddle management as well as admini strative and technical workers. 3. The third step is to build a diverse organization thr ough effective recruiting, an ar ea where many small businesses need to improve. Small business, in general, is far behind their larger counterp arts in this area. Companies that recruit less than 75 entry level workers annually are only half as likely as companies that hire 300 or more entry level workers annually to have articulated diversit y programs. (16) Small business managers should investigate making more inte nsive use of placement office interviews, internships, presentations on college and high school campuses, and community involvement. Successful recruiting also requires a commitment to meeting numerical targets. To be successful, small business orga nizations must set goals. Experience indicates that if an organization does not have a female minority goal, it will fi nd it does not have fe male minorities on its workforce. Recruiting, however, is only an initial step. 4. The fourth step is to provide growth and development oppor- tunities for all. The key to the success of a diversity progr am lies not simply in meeting statisti cal targets, but also in creating an environment in which people focus on sharing ideas freely on how to take advantage of business opportunities without interference from nonrelevant factors, such as race, gender, religion, or physical handicap. Thus, first class training and development opportunities must be made available to each indi vidual. Yet a great majority of small businesses are lacking in this area. The Tower-Perrin survey indicated that over two-thirds of companies, and more in the small business sector, spend less than $2000 per ye ar on any kind of training. Yet in light of the facts about the growing skills gap between what abilities new jobs wi ll require and the inadequate preparation in language and mathematical skills of many young adul ts, investing in training has become a necessity, not an option. (17) Small business organizations must also recognize and reward \"diversity champi ons,\" managers who advocate diversity and mentor employees on how to benefit from diversity. In addition, it mean s that organizations must create a corporate environment that promises involvement , commitment, recognition, and system changes which guarantee the continual improvement of the work environment. It also means tracking results and hol ding managers accountable for their be havior. Small busines s managers must document -- as part of their annual performance review -what they have done to help create a successful multicultural environment in their areas of responsibility. (18) And small business organizations should not expect their new employees to do al l the adjusting. They should work to achieve mutual adjustments, wh ere employees work together to benefit from their difference s, rather than argue about them. These adjustments include taking into account the family ci rcumstances of employees. Small business should consider a variety of techniques to adjust to changing lifestyles , including cooperation with a high quality day care center, flextime, job sharing, \"mommie tracks,\" si ck leave care for children, pregnancy leav es, cafeteria style benefits, and part time work. Part of the adjustment includes making sure promotions and salary increase s are based on contribution, with no one disqualified because of gender, race, ethnic origin, religious creed, or physical handicap. Ultimatel y, in the twent y-first centur y, leadershi p positions in small business should mirror the race, gender, and lifestyle make-up of the entire workforce. This is not to say that implementing an effective diversit y program is easy. It is not. Budget limitations, inflexible management styles, racial a nd gender biases all must be identified and over- come. In addition, managers must be trained to appreciate the att itudinal and lifestyle differences of their employees. This is significant because it means that a uniform set of respons es to employee behavior, recommended in such books as The One Minute Manager, which has proved to be highly popular among small business manage rs, may backfire. (19) For example, some Native American and Pacific Rim employees have been penaliz ed for appearing to lack leadership because they believe it is immode st to champion their own causes. Some Asian and female employees do not want to be t ouched, which they perceive as being overly personal and familiar, not the honest camaraderie the manager intended. Some women and men are uninterested in talking sports, wh ile others feel uncomfortable in highly formal settings, such as country clubs, particularly those clubs that in the past have had hi stories of discrimination. In short, because of these cultural diff erences, small business manage rs will have to adjust th eir management styles to understand and respect the feelings of each individual in their workforce. Last, small businesses will have to inve st additional effort into some employees , especially those who have excellent potential, but need extra development b ecause of social, cultural, and educati onal deficiencies. In particular, small business leaders must take the initiative to form partnerships to improve Am erica's much-maligned publ ic education system. Operational Guidelines While there are few hard and fast ru les for successfully taking ad- vantage of the opportunities a diverse business environment provides, the following key princi ples are good guides to ma nagement behavior: * Develop an environment in which no group has an advantag e or disadvantage because of gender, race, ethnic origin, religion, handicap, or lifestyle. * Gather data on progress toward diversity -- this include s having multilevel cultural task forces, meetings with minority employees, and comprehensive surveys of company attitudes. * Conduct training in divers ity for all employees. * Follow up training w ith accountability. * Make sure all employees share the burden of adjust ment, not only minorities, th e handicapped, and women. * Promote qualified people from all groups to highly visible positions. This will help reinforce th e idea that promotion is based on contribution, and not on be ing a member of a preferred group. * Work to continually improve the worki ng environment for all employees. (20) James E. Preston, president of Avon, has obs erved that the United States is not a melting pot, it is a mosaic, \"composed of many cultures, many races, many colors, many religions.\" He believes we all have to recognize that \"America's greatness is a result of the fact th at we are this beautiful mosaic, the only one in the world.\" (21) Small business managers should now move forward in creating effective multicultu ral environments that benefit from the everchan ging American mosaic. Just as the space program has revoluti onized technology from microwave ovens to nonstick surfaces to heat resistant materials, so will the social and dem ographic revolution change the way that Am ericans will recruit, train, retain, and promote its increasingly diverse workforce. Small businesses that now incorporate an emphasis on mana ging diversity as a focal point of their human resource development programs will reap the bene fits of a sustaine d competitive advantage in the American and international marketplace. 1.

Earl Thomas, Middle Tennessee State University Paula B. Thomas, Middle Tennessee State University ABSTRACT A major concern of most business organizations today is hiring and retaining quality personnel given changes in employee demographics and work/family values. This paper suggests that nontra ditional scheduling presents a viable approach for small businesses to a ttract and retain quality employees. The paper first explores the changing na ture of the workforce, both in terms of demographics and attitudes concerning balancing career/family obligat ions. Though women and/or clerical employ ees have typically been the group(s) targeted for nontraditional work schedules, evidence is presented to suggest that alternative work schedules should be available for broader groups of workers, specifi cally, men and professional/manager employees. Various approaches to nontraditional scheduling are presente d, both full-time and part-time options. Job-sharing , when two employees share one full-time posit ion, is also discussed. The paper e xplores advantages and implementation concerns that should be considered by small businesses before implemen ting a nontraditional work schedule. The authors conclude that small businesses must embrace some major shif ts in personnel policy to attract and retain quality workers. How small businesses trea t their people could be the variable that distinguishes them from their competition. INTRODUCTION A key ingredient for the success of most businesses is the quality of their empl oyees--small businesses are no exception. A major concern of most business organizations today is hiring and retain ing quality personnel given changes in the demographics and valu es of employees. Though small businesse s' personnel policies may be somewhat limited since they lack many resources available in larger organizations, the small size s hould benefit them in providing flexibility to address employee needs. The purpose of this paper is to explore nontraditional scheduling as a vehicle for small businesses to attract and retain key personnel. Specific issues discusse d include an overview of the changing workforce, employees who are likely candidates for nontraditional scheduli ng, specific approaches to nontraditi onal scheduling, and advantages and disadvantages of this approach. CHANGING NATURE OF THE WORKFORCE Evidence suggests that individuals currently entering the work force are motivated by different values than the previous generation. Many \"baby-buste rs\" (men and women born after 1964) place more emphasis on havi ng both a successful career and a rewarding personal life. This should not be construed to mean that younger employees lack job commitment--to the contrary, most of them are quite dedicated--but they tend to be less willing than their predecessors to sacrifice family and personal interest s for the sake of their career. Human re sources managers are also noting that more potential employees are asking about their businesses' family polic ies during the interview process. Considering that between a half-million and a million fewer young Americans will start to work each year through the end of the century that in the 1970's, [1] businesses ca nnot ignore the baby busters' The following quote summarizes this In the 1950s, the gray-suited, security-minded Organizat ion Man became a corporate archetype. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was the socially responsible corporate do-gooder. But specialists in management, including executive recruiters, human-resource executives and academics, say none of these changed the tone of corporate life as much as the baby-busters may change it. [2] Not only are younger employees entering th e workforce concerned with greater balance between their personal and professional lives, but em ployees a pproachin g mana gement positions are also be ginnin g to question the time commitment required for career success. According to a su rvey conducted in Canada, 57 percent of the professional employees responding would change thei r working arrangements with a proporti onate adjustment in pay. [3] More professional and management level empl oyees are balking at working a grueli ng number of hours at the expense of time spent with their family, even if it means lost pay and promotions. Thes e employees are pressing businesses for more flexibility in work options.[4] Firms who continue to only consider \"tra ditional\" individuals as potential employees will find themselves settling for less quality, because high performers will be drawn to employers who offer flexibility. TARGETED EMPLOYEES More Than a Gender Issues In recent years women have comprised a steadily increasing proportion of university gradua tes. In response to this demographic shift, many firms have ut ilized nontraditional scheduling on a limi ted basis by allowing flexibility for female employees with young children. Although this approach is a va lid start, it has two flaws. First, by targeting women, firms assume that women are the only ones interested in flexible work options. Th us they stand to lose (or never even hire) valuable male employee s who also desire more personal time.[5] T hough women have typically been the catalyst in pushing employers for more flexible work schedules, a study by Du Pont found that 25 percent of their male employees had considered seeking anothe r employer who might be able to offe r more work/family flexibility.[6] A related problem is that nontraditional scheduling may take on the appearance of a \"woman's perk.\" Firms targeting only may, intentionally or not, conclude th at women are less committed to their ca reers than their male colleagues. In reality, research suggests that there is little difference in career dedication between men and women.[7] But perceptions can often be more important than fact s; one study found that only about half as many men as women surveyed believed that women in public accounting have the same level of co mmitment as do men.[8] Firms targeting nontraditional work options primarily toward women may be unwittingly perpetuating these disparate perceptions. Although parents with young children are an obvious target gr oup, other employees may also be interested in spending less time on the job. For example, dual-career families with or without children ma y simply want and be able to afford more leisure time. Older employees who have established th eir career but want to spend more time on philanthropic or civic pursuits might welcome a nontraditi onal schedule. Another interested group, potentially either younger employees with career uncertainties or older employ ees nearing retirement, might want a fl exible schedule to pursue educational goals or non-conflicti ng business opportunities. Positions Appropriate for N ontraditional Scheduling Nontraditional scheduling frequently is discussed in the context of clerical or ot her nonprofessional positions. However, as noted earlier, professiona l and management level employees are seeking a better balance between their personal and professional lives. Accordingly, small busines ses should adopt a broad defini tion of job classifications appropriate for nontradi tional scheduling. Though success with nontraditional schedu ling in clerical positions is well documented, some businesses are beginning to report success with management empl oyees. Specifically, The Travelers Corporat ion is aggressively marketing part- time employment to its mana gement and corporate office rs.[9] Many CPA firms have also reported success with nontraditional scheduling of their professional staff. APPROACHES TO NONTR ADITIONAL SCHEDULING The phrase \"nontraditional sche duling' has varying encompa ssing many work options, both full-time and part-time. Some of the alternatives described have been su ccessfully utilized by large corporations. But they merit equal consideration by small bus inesses because most involve little or no incremental cost to the organization, yet provide si gnificant benefits to em ployees. Full-Time Options In what is popularly known as \"flext ime,\" the employee chooses his/her own hours around a designate core period of time. Obviously this arrangement is somewhat constrained by the nature of the work; i.e., businesses that require significant interaction with clients/cu stomers during regular business hours may not be able to offe r a great deal of flexibility. But many professional jobs, especially those th at are project-oriented, are viab le candidates for flextime. Another option successfully utilized by some businesses is compacting the 40-hour workweek into fewer, usually three or four days. Like flextime, the feas ibility of this approach is largely dictated by the nature of the work. A concept that has been successfully utilized in the accounting profession is the variable day, or leisure bank, concept. Employees accumulate overtime hours to be taken as time off during non-peak periods. This approach appeals to both employers and employees because it negates some of the personal sacrifices employees make during the busy seasonal periods, with little cost to the employer. An alternative gaining increasing amount s of attention allows employees to perform some work at home (flexplace). Though work that necessitates interaction wi th clients an other staff members may not appear to be well-suited for this arrangement, adequate communications access and computer res ources can render a substantial list of feasible tasks. Some combination of flextime and fl explace could provide a particularly attractive alternative for employees. Part-Time Options Other options entail less time on the job th an is considered typical. Although part-t ime possibilities will be a lure in recruiting new hires, these plans will also aid in retaini ng employees who night otherwis e leave their position because of excessive time demands into their personal life. Some employees may opt for permanent part-time positions, but many will only temporarily need to reduce their workload-- for example, while starting a family. Firms can respond to these needs by reducing either the numbe r of days worked per week or the number of hours worked per day. Another approach that some professional/service firms have successfully utilized is al lowing the employee to service some designated number of clients--the agreed upon number would be less than the employees's normal load. The employee in turn commits to handling the needs of those clients, regardless of the am ount of time required during a given period. A key ingredient in the success of this approach is accessi bility when the employee is not \"on the job.\" Communication can be maintained via phone, writte n memos, or computer access. Short duration personal leaves are also a viable option. Many firms have made a start in this direction by offering parental leaves, but the scope should be expanded to accommodate employee's othe r personal interests. Businesses with seasonal activity could offer two or th ree month summer leaves, or even offer ten-month employment to some employees. This approach can simultaneously reduce salary costs and provide a valuab le employee benefit without impairing client service. A Combination: Job Sharing Job sharing can best be described as a combination of fu ll-time and part-time employmen t; job sharing occurs when one full-time position is performed by tw o employees who each work part time. Firms with little or no experience in nontraditional scheduling could experiment with job-sharing when a current full-time employee desires to reduce his or her present workload. It is also a viable consideration wh en a staff reduction is necessary; rather than laying off employees, the employer could allow one or more jobs to be share.[10] A key factor in the success of job sh aring arrangements is coor dination and communication between the job sharing partners. It is crucial that each empl oyee is aware of all activities during hi s/her time away from the job. The job sharing partners should be responsible for overlapping to c oordinate activities. This ove rlap can be accomplished in person (perhaps over lunch ), by phone, b y written communication, or an y combination of the above. ADVANTAGES/IMPLEMENTA TION CONCERNS Advantages Retention of Key Employees. Ironically, many employees become most va luable to the firms at the same time that they may choose to reduce their workload. Nontraditional scheduling allows employers toe keep employees who might other wise leave the organization. Client Service. Though a frequently voiced opposition to nontraditional scheduli ng is the potential disruption in client service, some firms have found the opposite to hold true. Particularly in professional service organizat ions, some firms have found that servicing a reduced number of clients can actually improve client satisfaction, because wi th fewer clients to serve, the employee may be able to accompli sh client needs more quickly.[11] Improved Moral/Productivity. Many firms report that employees are happier when they ha ve greater control over the work schedules. accordingly, productivity can increase and absenteeism generally decreases. Declines in abse nteeism are particularly marked for firms with part-time employees, because employees have more time for personal affairs/errands when they are off the job. Since flexible scheduling (especially the full-time al ternatives) does not impose any significant new cost on employers, gains from work schedule flexibility are \"cheap\" benefits from the company's perspective. Advantages Specific to Job Sharing. Though job sharing enjoys the above bene fits of nontraditional scheduling, it also has unique benefits of its own. 1. Job sharing can improve the quality of work performed; synergism is operating. Particul arly if the employees have complementary strengths, the employer benefits more than when only one employee fills the slot. Additionally, job- sharing partners typically exhibit less burnout than thei r full-time colleagues. 2. Job sharing increases flexibility and job coverage. Duri ng peak workload periods, both employees may be able to work. And if the employees are flexible enough, one employee may be able to work full time during the illness or vacation of the job sharing partner. Addi tionally, if one partner quits, the other pa rtner should be able to fill in until a replacement can be found. 3. Effectively, job sharing can be describe d as part-time work, but it typically presents less administrative problems for the employer than creating part-time positions. Implementation Concerns The previous section cited strong support for the use of nontraditional scheduling. But nontraditional scheduling, particularly the part-time vers ion, is not pr oblem-free. Work Environment One of the greatest pitfalls of nontraditi onal scheduling is the climate that resu lts when supervisors do not embrace the new option. Many employees now in supervisory pos itions were required to work \"regul ar hours,\" and thus they may resent the new flexibility available to younger employees. Unfortunately, there is abunda nt anecdotal evidence of employees who did not utilize a flexible plan because they feared that it would be the \"kiss of death\" for their career as well as employees who did take advantage of an option only to return and find that their carer ha d in reality been derailed. Businesses must guard a gainst thinkin g that time s pent in the office e quals job commitment. Most im portantl y, this cannot be merely a written policy --it must be a reality at al l levels of the organization. Women have frequently faced this per ceived lack of job commitment because traditionally they have had primary responsibility for child-rearing. But the threat maybe ev en more serious for men b ecause many individuals and organizations do not consider it \"norma l\" for men to be involved in family c oncerns. Recent studies indicate more \"stress equity\" between the sexes; men in the workforce re port a growing amount of stress as they attempt to mesh career and family obligations.[12] The workplace must come to ac knowledge the importance of the socialization process. Family roles and responsibilities that were in place when business owners/managers came of age no longer prevail. Though small business owners/managers may be resistant to ch anging a system that has always worked for them, they must acknowledge that the traditional \"Ozzie and Harriet\" styl e family of the 1950s is becoming extinc t. The climate of the firm must be conducive for employees to balance their personal and career aspirations. Small business owne rs and managers must be willing to accept that personal time is not a gende r issue--it is a broad- based personnel concern. Supervisory Issues. As practical matter, supervising employees who are not on a traditional schedul e may create new problems. Management must also ensure that the compensation, promoti on, and benefits structure is equitable for both full-time and part-time employees. Specifi cally, policies on issues such as raises, prom otions, and health care coverage for part- time employees must be formulated. Supervisors also must be careful to proportionally reduce the workload of empl oyees who are working less than full- time. Some employees who report dissati sfaction with going to part -time positions note that the workload reduction was not commensurate with the reduction in compensation. Thes e individuals felt that their supervisors still tended to expect the same amount of wo rk to be performed.[13] Adequate Communications A recurrent theme throughout businesses who have successful ly employed nontraditional sc heduling is the importance of adequate communication when the employee is not at work . Particularly for job- shar ing arrangements, adequate communication between job- shari ng partners is crucial for smoot h operations of the business. Customer Service A key issue in the success of any personne l policy is meting customer/client dema nds. Further, client needs should be met without undue hardship on traditional employees. If a part-time professional employe e's client encounters an unexpected crisis, that employee must be flexible enough to ensure that client se rvice is not impaired. Enough Employees? A major practical obstacle to adopting non traditional scheduling is availability of personnel. How can employees work fewer hours while the pool of quality employees is shrinking? Depending on the business size, one solution is to form a reserve pool of temporary/part-time work ers, possibly from former employee s and retirees. One CPA firm reported hiring former employees for a specified number of hours per week during busy season to relieve the burden on the regular staff. But a long-term objective is that firms utilizi ng nontraditional scheduling will attract more quality employees, thus making the plan feasible. This contention ha s been verified by some firms who report that applicants for \"shared\" jobs tend to be better qualified applicants. CONCLUSIONS AND RE COMMENDATIONS If small businesses are to prosper in an increasingly competitive environment, attracting and retaining high-quality employees is imperative. Flexible scheduling is one vehicle for accomplishing this goal. Although it is not an easy task, small businesses must embr ace some major shifts in personnel policy. This undertaking will be further com plicated because most owners and mana gers came throu gh the ranks \"the hard wa y\", when traditional scheduling was essentially th e only available avenue. Nonetheless, experts agree that employers will increasingly offer employees more options to balance their work and family obligations. While many firms offer these benefits purely for business reasons, othe r employers contend that he lping employees cope with family responsibilities is worth the cost, no matter how high.[14] Retaining the status quo is much easier, but small busines ses who do so may find themselves without needed human resources. By accommodating employees in need of nontradi tional scheduling, firms are de veloping a viable, long-term relationship that simultaneously keeps the firm competitive. How small busin esses treat their people could be the variable that distin guishes them from their com petition. CONTINGENCY PERSONNEL PLANNING FOR SMALL BUSINESS: A LOOK AT FAMILY LEAVE ISSUES Kathleen C. Brannen, Creighton University George W. Mc Nary, Creighton University Te rrence M. Begley, Creighton University ABSTRACT An increase in women in the work force is projected for th e 1990's, with a subsequent incr ease in women who will be working during their child bearing years. Even small busine sses will encounter employees who will need family leave time. Federal legislation has been rein troduced, and many states already have le gislation in place. Small businesses were polled to determine the types of policies that are in pl ace, and plans for dealing with future requests for family leave. Results show that a redivision of labor and th e employment of temporary workers are the mainstays of maintaining work flow. INTRODUCTION The need for contingency personnel pla nning for small business can be illustrated by two distinct yet related personnel areas, due to recent events and the di ctates of the current employment mark et. American business was taken aback recently when employees serv ing in the military reserves became subject to call up by the government. For the first time since 1968 some employers have had to respond to personnel on military leave (11). News reports indicate that the business community was unprepared for the loss of personnel to military service (6). In the meantime, the changing composition of the labor force has made planning for the employee who has childr en or who may have children a new concern, with the need for leave time for birth or illness in the family beco ming a growing reality. Since World War II the age of the youngest child of working women has continued to decline; curr ently 50% of the women with a child under one year of age are in the workforce. The purpose of this paper is to info rm small business owners and SBI Dire ctors who consult with small business owners of the growing need to include personnel planning in the formulation of stra tegic plans, particularly contingency plans for workers requesting fa mily leave. This paper will: a) Summarize the family leave activity at the state and federal level, b) Discuss why small business will be invol ved in family leave activity, c) Provide results of a survey which polled a sample of small and large businesse s to determine current policies and how they respond to family leave requests, and d) Provide recommendations for planning and acco mmodating family leave in the small firm. A LOOK AT THE LITERATURE There is a growing literature on the emerging activity relate d to family leave (7;23). Articles which review federal legislation activity include Clay and Fein stein (5), Kovach (13), Radigan (26), a nd Samuels, et.al. (27). Other articles review state government activity such as Nelson's (20;21;22) annual review of st ate labor law changes, and articles by Smith (28), Spivack (29), and Oberst (24) in publications targeted at state legisl ators. Personnel journals help with the design of policies (14;15;17;25) and prac tices (10). Policies in place in the largest firms have been documented by Catalyst (4) and others (9;12;18). Research has begun on the policies and practices of small firms (2), such as the study by Worthington (33). Trade journals bri ng news of family leave activity to their readers (1;3;8;19;30). FAMILY LEAVE ACTIVITY AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL There are four major antecedents to \"family leave\" as re presented by the Family & Medical Leave Act of the 101st Congress: 1. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA). The PDA introduced the concept that pregnancy be treated like any other disability. The point is that if an organization has a disability policy, pregnant women were entitled to as much time off while di sabled as any other employee who was disabled for another reason. 2. California Legislation. The law requires up to 4 months of unpaid maternity leave. The concept is that women should have time off from work fo r childbirth. a. The legislati on was challenged by the district court, but, b. Was upheld by the U.S. Su preme Court in the case of California Federal Savin gs & Loan Assoc. VS Guerra. 3. Federal legislation. Author of the Ca lifornia legislation, Howard Berman, b ecame a representative in the U.S. Congress from the Los Angeles Area. Le gislation was first introduced during th e 99th Congress which called for job- protected parental leave. The parental leave concept is that an employee should accrue time off for the birth of a child. Originally only a woman's issue, under pressure to treat bot h sexes equally, the equal treatment model would have the concept childbirth cross over from the woman's agenda to the family agenda. This has resulted in expanding the concept of parental leave to include either parent. 4. Changing Demographics. Changing demographics create pr essure in the workplace for revised personnel policies and alternative ways to meet productivity demands. Small business will be involved in family leave issues whether or not they come under federal or state legislation becaus e of the reality of demographics. The concept of family leave became a pa rt of proposed legislation in the 100th Congress. That is, eligibility for job- protected family leave should include birth of a child, a doption, serious illness of a child, spouse or parent. The addition of leave for illness required a tr ansition. As originally defined, pregnanc y was to be treated the same as any other disability; but that brought about a conflict about how disability ought to be defined. H.R. 20 20 defined disability as the total inability to perform a job, a notion of disability that the disabled rights advocates had been struggling for years to overcome. H.R. 202 was revised and \"medical leave\" was substituted for \"disability leave\" (26). This change allowed the family leave concept to move forward with the support of disability rights advocates. An additional concept is that of job-protected leave, the fede ral legislation mandates the right to retu rn to your job (or a similar job). Paid leave, a form of job protected leave, is not under consideration at this time. Legislation the Federal Level President Bush vetoed the family le ave legislation on June 27, 1990. Congress wa s unable to override. In response, a new bill, the New Employee Leave Bill, H.R. 5500, was in troduced August 3rd, 1990 by Re presentative John LaFalce (D-N.Y.), Chairman of the House Comm ittee on Small Business (See Table 1). TABLE 1 PROPOSED FEDERAL LEGISLATION Unpaid Maternity/paternity leave for newborn or newly-adopted children: 8 weeks per year Leave to care for seriously-ill ch ildren: 8 weeks every two years Leave for seriously-ill employ ee: 8 weeks every two years Additionally, employees would have to util ize available disability, si ck leave, vacation or pe rsonal time before this leave. Time taken with such available other leave would count toward the time limits. Cont inuation of health insurance by the employer during the leav e would be optional. Employers with work sites of less than 50 employees would be exempt if the total number of employ ees of that company within 75 miles of the worksite is less than 50. Legislation at the State Level Legislation has been increasing at the stat e level with nearly 50 percent of the st ates having some type of family leave. In a number of states the legislat ion affects firms with a limited number of employees. See Table 2 for examples. TABLE 2 STATE LEGISLATIO N REQUIRING LEAVE COVERAGE FOR SMALL FIRMS Connecticut b/a/si/s/p/e 16 weeks All firms by 1993 Louisiana b/ 16 weeks 25 employees Maine b/a/si/s/ p/e 8 weeks 25 em ployees Minnesota b/a 6 weeks 20 employees - one site New Jersey b/a/si/s/p 12 weeks 50 employees by 1993 Oregon b/a 12 weeks 25 employees Rhode Island b/a/si 13 weeks 30 employees Vermont b/ 12 weeks 10 employees Wisconsin b/a 6 weeks 50 employees Wisconsin si/s/p/e 2 weeks 50 employees (birth/adoption/, serious illness of child, spouse, parent, employee) Why Small Business Will Be I nvolved In Parental Leave Proposed federal legislation would cover 39 percent of all employees. Although not covered di rectly, due to their size, small businesses will be involved in family leave becaus e of the demographics of the labor force. Women and minorities will dominate projecte d additions to the labor force in the 90's. Current labor force demographics show that: * 57% of all American women work, * 80% of them are of childbearing age, * 90% of whom will be pregnant sometime during their working lives. * 50% of mother s of children under 1 are employed. * 59% of mothers of children under 3 are employed. * 64% of moth ers of children under 5 are employed. A SURVEY OF FAMILY LEAVE POLICY The Survey Sample Respondents to the family leave survey do business in tw o large midwestern cities. The sample is a convenience sample and is not necessarily representative of the local ar eas, other geographical areas, or of the nation as a whole. The sample includes two groups of small businesses. The first answered a questi onnaire distributed at a meeting of the small business council of the chamber of commerce, the s econd was drawn from small bus iness owners involved in a task force to promote small business growth and developmen t. A third group was composed of larger businesses drawn from firms who were recognized for their support of communi ty service organizations (United Way). It was assumed that the larger business organizations represented proact ive firms who would have pr ogressive personnel policies including family leave provisions. Seve nty three percent of the larger bus iness firms returned a completed questionnaire and eighty one percent of these respondents included a copy of their leave policy. Twenty percent of smaller firms included a copy of their policy. Questionnaires A total of 41 questionnaires were completed representing 25 small firms and 16 large fi rms. Although the sample was small, the primary goal of the sample was to fund out what kinds and how these firms responded to employees on leave. Survey Results Significant findings (at the .05 level): 1. 66% of the responding firms have a leave policy to deal with serious personal illness. Type of business is a determinant for having a polic y. Service and financial businesses are more li kely to have a policy than manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers a nd construction firms. Size of firm is also a predictor for havin g a leave policy for serious personal illness with policies almost universal for the firm with more than 50 employees . Nevertheless, 52% of firms with 35 or fewer employees had such a policy. 2. 63% of the respondents have a leave policy to deal with ch ildbirth. Again there is a signi ficant difference by type of business, with service and financial businesse s more likely to have a policy in place. Size of firm is also a predictor for having a leave policy to de al with childbirth with policies more likely in the larger firm. Ninety four percent of the firms with 35 or fewer em ployees have such a policy. 3. 54% of the respondents indicated that the maximum time off for childbirth. Size of th e firm is a predictor of maximum time off. For firms with 35 and fewer employees, time off ranged from 6 weeks to 12 weeks. The small firm with the most liberal benefit has only 5 employees, but is a franchise participating in a common franchise policy. Time off for the largest firms range from 6 weeks to more than 26 weeks. 4. 37% of the respondents have a leave policy to deal with il lness in the family. Firm size is a predictor for having a policy with only 30% of the smallest firms having a policy compared to 63% of the largest firms (over 1000 employees). 5. 76% of the respondents replied that an employee has take n an extended leave. Whether that leave was provided by a stated policy or by an arrangement varied by firm size. A larg e majority (65%) of such leaves in the smallest firms was by special arrangement, where as 100% of the leav es in the largest firms was by stated policy. 6. 85% of survey respondents have a leave policy that includes some paid leave. The length of paid leave for serious personal illness, childbirth, or illnes s in the family differs significantly ac cording to firm size for managers. Disability insurance is a factor in 29 % of the responding firms. Non-insured pa id time off ranges from two weeks or less to the entire length of leave for serious illness with la rger firms more likely to grant more than 12 weeks of paid time off. Maximum paid time off for childbirth is 26 weeks unle ss serious disability occurred. Minimum pa id time off is 6 weeks for the larger firms with smaller firms having as little as 2 weeks or less. The length of paid leave for serious pe rsonal illness and childbirth differs signifi cantly according to firm size for non- managers. Disability insurance for non-managers is a factor in 22% of the responding firm s for serious personal illness, but 15% for childbirth. Maximum leave time of 12 -26 weeks for serious personal illness is more likely in the large firm. Thirteen percent of the small firms gran t a leave of 2 weeks or less, 9% cover from 7 to 12 weeks. The childbirth leave for the non-manager is more likely to be four weeks or le ss in the small firm, while larg er firms have a minimum of 6 weeks paid leave. 7. 73% of those taking a leave in the responding firms have the right to return to the same or comparable job following a leave. When an employee with rights to reinstatement is on leave there is a si gnificantly greater variety of measures used to maintain work flow. Using other employees to cover some of the work is used uni versally by firms granting job retention rights. The most popular combin ation is other employees covered and te mporarily hired (34%). Work is also postponed and some employees take work home. Excerpts From the Questionnaires 1. 66% of the respondents have found some practical way to deal with employee absences while still maintaining the work flow of the organization. For example: *Turnover is high; just replace and by the time they come back another opening will have occurred. *Small enough that others fill in. Most jobs can be replaced by temporary workers. *Short term absences are covered b y other em ployees increasin g their work load, work postponed and increased hours. *The employees in our section work as a team and ca n, to a certain degree, pick up each others work and responsibilities. Each try to share with the others what they are working on. *We all pitch in and do their work on a short time ba sis- long term we have not had to deal with. *Someone helps within the staff in their area a nd a temporary employee fi lls in where needed. *The affected department's employees cover for each othe r some overtime involved. *Other employees cover - which often creates overtime pay. Ex tending part-time hours; i.e., students. Call in retirees - temporary assignments. *We have a temp. service within our or ganization; use temps. from several agencies; and have hired individuals (college students, teachers in summer break) as temporary help outside of agency referrals. 2. 54% of the respondents indicated that prior arrangement s to handle employee absences had been satisfactory. 3. 5% of the respondents indicated that re sults had been unsatisfactory; the remai nder did not comment. # It is survival. # Yes, we approach each case flexibly. # Th e biggest difficulty is to have an ope ning for the person when they return if a new employee has been hired. # Not satisfact ory for a long time, but keeps things going. Relevant Statistics 1.20% of employees gave more than 30 da ys notice before taking a leave. 2.32% of employees gave less than 30 days notice before taking a leave. The remainder varied or no policy. 3.56% of responding firms tie leave elig ibility to length of service. 4.15% require one year of serv ice for leave eligibility. 5.10% require six months of service for leave e ligibility; the remainder varied or no policy. 6.76% of responding firms have fringe benefits protected during the time a person is on leave. 7.73% of responding firms include the right to return to the same or comparable job. 8.32% grant job protection for leav es of six months or less. 9.2% grant job protection for leaves of 6-12 months. 10.37% checked \"other\" for job protection time limits; this includes both longer periods and special arrangements of some \"no policy\" firms. Future Guidelines No business can afford to ignore personn el planning. Because the probabilities pr edict that the small business owner will be faced with employees who will need leave, it becomes a question of wh ether the firm will be prepared or unprepared when an employee takes a leave. Employee expect ations develop as the resu lt of awareness created by media discussion (16;32). A good example is the Business W eek (110 cover story describing the best companies for women and telling how to make your company woman-fr iendly. In the long run, the workforce will be more experienced and loyal if providing for needed family leave be comes an integral part of the family planning process. Every firm should have a family leave policy, even if it ca n not directly compete with the more comprehensive policies of big business. The small business is characterized by its flex ibility, and that capability should also be utilized in the famil y leave area. Here are some thin gs to consider when formulatin g a policy: For the organization with standard bene fits, there are several key issue to c onsider when developing a family and medical leave policy: 1.An organization with medical leave must specify that is job-protected leave. 2.The maximum additional unpaid job pr otected leave must be specified. 3.An organization creating a fami ly and medical leave policy would consider: a) the amount of paid family and medical leave. b) the maximum term of additiona l job-protected unpaid leave. c) the le ngth-of-service eligibility for such a leave. d) eligibility affected by part-time job status. e) el igibility affected by job rank. 4Will vacation and sick leave be used to provide some paid family leave. 5.Determine which benefits will continue, and who is respons ible for premiu m payments. 6.Determine the procedures for reinstatement. Ways to Improve Productiv ity During Leave-Time: 1.Schedule reentry over time beginning with work at home or part time work. 2.Provide cross-training of employees. 3.Establish a relationship with tem porary help services who understa nd the requirements of your firm. 4.Use the leave-taker as a trainer to improve the performance of the temporary replacement. 5.Hire the replacement we ll in advance. 6.Provide written instructi ons to the replacement. 7.Designate and employee(s) to be th e advisor to the replacement(s). 8.Increase participatory decision maki ng and staff autonomy to achieve employe es who are better prepared for the increased responsibilities that come when employees on leave result in a temporary redist ribution of work assignments or more unsupervised work. 9.Acquire working relationships with child- care referral services for well baby and sick baby day-care services in order to minimize time-off when child care arrangements deteriorate. 10.Implement flex-time and/or job sh aring to help employees balance work and family responsibilities. 11.Foster an organizational climate which invites dual-ca reer job employees to thrive in the organization. It takes time and energy to plan for maximum productivity during any leave. The Catalyst (4) study concluded that a company's first step should be to communicate that pregnanc y and the short-term absence of valued employees is an expected, natural and manageable event.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP, PERSONALITY TESTS AND SMALL BUSINESS BY Dale Krueger, Ph.D. Mi ssouri Western State College ABSTRACT In recent years research using personality traits attempted to identify those persons that start businesses. This paper utilized a DISC Test to identify small business owners thr ough personality traits and then requested the owners of these small businesses to provide reasons for st arting their business. The results indica te that classifying entrepreneurs and small business owners by personality traits remains a difficult and elusive area of research. The results indicate that no one personality emerges to explain why a person starts a business however people start businesses for a variety of reasons. INTRODUCTION Review of the literature abounds wi th different definitions for entrepre neurship, but several definitions for entrepreneurship standout. For example, Joseph Schumpter not iced that entrepreneurs cr eated new ideas and created different combinations of resource s which spurred economic activity.(1) Peter Drucker focused on defining entrepreneurship from a corporate and bur eaucratic viewpoint, here resources must be allocated to opportunities rather than problems.(2) Ten years later in 1974 Dr ucker noted that \"an entrepreneur has to redirect resources from areas of diminishing results to areas of high or increasing results. He has to slough off yesterday and to render absolute what already exists and is already known. He has to create tomorrow.(3) These definitions define certain situations . In recent years entrepre neurship has focused on individuals that play critical roles in changing stagnant bureaucracies into decentralized, adaptive and creative forms.(4) Although these definitions are note worthy, they do not explai n the reasons for starting a small business nor do they purport to attempt to classify small busin esses and personality characteristics of their owners. In fact, most of the literature on entrepreneurship emphasizes the exceptional success stories. J. C. Penney's, Apple Computer, the Marriott Corporation, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Ford and others. These successes have spearheaded research on what characteristics does an entrepreneur possess: self-confidence, creativity, initia tive, optimism, knowledge of the market and many others.(5) Others have attempted to provide a novel functional personality theory to explai n different types of entrepreneur. One of the approaches creates four categorie s of entrepreneurs based on an extensive list of personality traits. These four categories are finders, binders, grinders, and minders. Briefly, finders create new products and services or processes; grinders generate a new use or a produc t or service; minders replicate an ex isting product; and bi nders synthesize a number of ideas. To explain th ese categories major corporati ons heads are then identified with these categories.(6) Another approach to ca tegorizing entrepreneurs has been the use of DI SC tests and models wh ich measure behavioral tendencies of individuals. For example, D means to dominate; I means influential and persuasive; S means stable and relationship oriented; C indicates complian t and detailed. For a listi ng of some of the four st yle behavior grid training and consulting models see the 1982 November issue of Tr aining Magazine. Other models have developed more extensive assessment scales such as acumen.(7) Today most research concerns the use of these instruments to ascertain the behavioral te ndencies of managers in the corporate structure.(8) However, few researchers have attempted to measur e the behavioral tendencies of small business owners and the reasons for their entry in the comp etitive world of business. Th ese are the purposes of this paper. Why do people start businesses? David Si lver suggests that entrepreneurs star t their own business because they are dissatisfied with their careers and their organization. Also, they had a clear visi on and a single minded determination to succeed. Another writer, Albert Shapiro observed an incr ease in new ventures when unemployment rose.(9) This suggests that many people that start businesses were forced to find an alternative means to earn an economic livelihood. Furthermore, as corporations adapt to a changing envir onment many employees have been faced with pursuing other employment alternatives. Merger acquisi tions and decentralization and the lean and mean structure has dumped some highly educated and hi ghly skilled people into the job market. Some of these dislocated mana gers start new businesses based on new ideas, new market niches, or new services and products that add value to so ciety. Others begin businesses because of their professional ba ckgrounds, their vision, and a determ ination to be independent. PURPOSE OF SURVEY Their paper attempts to determine why pe ople start businesses. First, in survey ing owners of small businesses in St. Joseph, Missouri, an open ended survey was utilized to as certain the reasons why owners of small businesses decided to start their venture. Second, the owners of the small businesses were tested using The Personal C oncept Test - DISC marketed by Jack Mohler Associates.(10) The DI SC test was derived fr om Marstons four factor theory.(11) Marston's four factor theory has four major dimensions: Peopl e are classified into four categories which are briefly e xplained below. Dominant Qualities Hard driving and re sults oriented Achievement and goal orie nted Assertive and active Creative or judgmental Confident and a risk taker Influential Enthusiastic-can motivate ot hers Approachable and people oriented Op timistic and confident Wants to lead Avoids details by socializing Te ndency to be disorganized Steady-Relationship Predictable and de pendable Organized and systematic Fr iendly and helpful Good listener and patient Avoids risks Conceals emotions Compliant-Detailed Thorough and well pr epared Factual and technically compet ent Reliable, accurate, systematic Sensitive and detailed oriented Likes rout ines and procedures Not a risk taker The implications associated with the Ma rston' theory allow us to formulate some interesting observations about why people start businesses, an about thei r personality characteristics. Forty re sponses were received for compilation purposes. The results and the reasons for beginning a bus iness were analyzed by the type of business: RESULTS Types of BehavioraL Tendency Businesses Responses D I S C Restaurants 3 1 2 Computer Electronics 6 2 1 1 1 Barbers/B eauty Salons 4 2 2 Autos 2 2 Accounting/Attorneys 3 2 1 Miscellaneous includes: Types of Behavior al Tendency Businesses Responses D I S C Pet Store 1 1 Flower Shop 1 1 Bike Shop 2 2 An 1 1 Fitn ess Center 1 1 Educational supplies 1 1 Gift Shop 1 1 Swimming Pool Shop 1 1 Handicap Braces 1 1 Music Shop (Partners) 2 1 1 Antiques 1 1 Flower Shop 1 1 Other Corporations 1 1 REASONS FOR BEGINN ING BUSINESSES Responses D I S C Hobby 4 2 1 1 Desire for Independence 8 1 2 3 2 Fam ily History 2 2 Previous Experience 10 2 3 3 2 Job Satisfaction 2 1 1 Few Alternatives or no other oppor tunities 3 1 2 Preference for spouses career 1 1 IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS The literature has suggested that those that begin businesses would exhibit certai n personality characteristics such as dominance. For example, High D's are consid ered entrepreneurial types. \" However, the results of this sample indicates that people who open small businesses have no specific behavi oral tendencies based on Mars ton's four factor theory, but there are some interesting reasons for opening a business. A desire for inde pendence, previous ex perience, and an a ppropriate o pportunit y produced are the most prevalent reasons for going into business. Next hobbies, no other economic alternatives, family history, and j ob satisfaction produce the second set of reasons for starting a business. However, no specific pers onality traits could be traced to any specific reason for beginning a business. Considering the results of the sample, no single personality trait emerge s as a determining factor that explains why people start a business. Therefore, tests that sc reen people as entrepreneurs should not be used or seriously considered in attempting to determine the possible success of prospective entrepreneurs. Personality traits and the reasons for beginning a business suggest a complex interp lay that requires more research. The value of the DISC test and other personality tests may lie in the mix of empl oyees that a prospective business owner will hire. Sales personnel should be dominant or influential. Customer serv ice personnel should be relationship or steady while the maintenance of inventory records and books require a detail oriented individua l. Furthermore, forming appropriate teams within the business may help impr ove performance. Th e ideal team represents one person from each category of the DISC test, but other combinations can be construc ted based on the situation and the environment. These applications of Marston's four fact or theory could be the more impor tant application of his theory. REFERENCES 1.

Aalberts, Louisian a State University-Shreveport Harvey W. R ubin, Louisiana State University-Shreveport ABSTRACT The purpose of this article is to provi de a risk management anal ysis of the prevailing thoughts on the subject of drug abuse and testing as they potentially aff ect the small business owner. The analysis will emphasize two critical steps in the risk management process: id entification and measurement. INTRODUCTION Few issues in recent memory have stirred the American p ublic as passionately as drug abuse. In the workplace, drug abuse is a particularly vexing problem which businesses are now fighting with increasing ferocity. Indeed, a recent Newsweek article estimated th at educating and testing programs implem ented to detect employee drug use have become a $250 million industry.(8) The reasons for such an expenditure are undeniably compelli ng. It has been estimated that drug and alcohol abuse costs U.S. industry $30 to $60 billion a year in absenteeism, lost productivity, accidents and health care. More specifically, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce states th at a recreational drug user is a third less productive than other employees and in all probability is four time s likelier to be involved with injuries on th e job. The drug user is also three times more inclined to be tardy, twice as likely to request early leave, and two and half times more proba ble to be out eight days or more.(4) It is no wonder that employers are being vigorous in their attempts to root out drug users through drug testing and other means. In March of 1989, the U.S. S upreme Court issued two important and far -reaching decisions on drug testing in the workplace. The cases, Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Association(9) and National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab(6) dealt with two drug testing schemes, one for ra ilroad workers and the other for U.S. customs workers. The implications of these cases appear to give certain employers both large and smal l, even in the private sector, greater latitude in testing workers for drugs. Employees, on th e other hand, including unionized workers who thought they were contractually protected, may have legitimate concern that thei r privacy rights are eroding away. IDENTIFICATION: THE SKINNER CASE - GOVER NMENT ACTION IN TH E PRIVATE SECTOR Generally speaking, federal constitutional protections afforded workers in the publ ic sector from illegal governmental conduct do not apply in the private sector. Th is means that a government worker at al l levels, federal, state and local, is protected from unreasonable searches and seizures as define d in the Fourth Amendment. These protections include how drug testing can be conducted. Furthermore, a government work er would be protected under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fifth Amendmen t from illegal government conduct.(2) In Skinner, however, the issue of what constitutes governmental conduct necessary for Constitutional pr otections, has become clouded. In Skinner the Court ruled that the railroads .... \"must be viewed as an instrument or agent of the government.\"(9, p.1411) The implications of this ruling are very important. That is since the Federal Railway Administration (FRA) regulations now pre-empt state laws under the Constituti on's Supremacy Clause plus supersede any private agreements, federal law including the Fourth Amendm ent and other relevant C onstitutional provisions, woul d necessarily apply to the railroad's drug testing scheme. This holding becomes cr itical since the railroads' drug testing sche me, discussed later in the opinion, was ruled to be constitutional under the Fourth Amendment. The Departments of Defense (DOD) and Transportation (DOT), among other fede ral agencies have , like the FRA, issued regulations(5) that are somewhat similar to those that were ruled on in both the Skinner and Von Raab cases.(7, p. 125) These regulations will affect the many contractors who do busine ss with these government al entities or are subject to their regulations. T hose businesses, as agents of the government would, like the railroads, be controlled by the Fourth Amendment and interpretations of it as enunciated in both Skinner and Von Raab. IDENTIFICATION: LEGAL IMPEDIME NTS TO DRUG TESTING - THE VON RAAB CASE TAKES A NEW DIRECTION Three of the most controversial and thus major legal and ethical impediments to drug testing have been: (1) should drug testing be permitted when there is no perceived or documented drug problem in the targeted workplace?; (2) are the testing methods reliable? and (3) does a positive drug test need to prove th at there was on-the-j ob impairment?(10) As will be explained, the Von Raab case has answered all three of these questions. Can a Workplace Be Testing Without a Perceived or Docu mented Problem? As mentioned, one major problem with im plementing drug testing programs has been the absence of specific evidence that there is a drug problem grave enough to warrant the justif ication of intruding into a workers' privacy. Indeed, in the U.S. Customs Service, only five out of 3,600 employees tested positive under th is program. Such an insignificant number, in the opinion of the Treasury Employees Union, gi ves rise to a \"suspicionless search\" that is not a \"sufficiently productive mechanism to justify [its] intr usion upon Fourth Amendment interests.\"(6, p. 1394-1395) The Supreme Court was not moved by the Union's argument. The Court instead ruled that even though only a few were innocent of drug use, that fact did not impugn the program. Th e Court's rationale was that since drug use is one of society's most serious problems there is l ittle reason to think that any workplace is immune from it. And since detection of drug use is difficult it becomes necessary to use such a program so long as it advances a government policy. The Court further contended that such a pr ogram is similar to susp icionless housing code insp ections(3) and stopping of motorists at checkpoints,(ll) both of which are legal. How Reliable Does the Tes ting Methodology Have To Be? The Supreme Court in Von Raab also discu ssed the issue of the reliability of drug tests. In effect the Court sanctioned the drug testing procedures promulgated by the Depart ment of Health and Human Services (HHS)(13) and implemented by the U.S. Customs Se rvice in its testing program. The Supreme Court found the procedure as used by the Customs Service, quite satisfactory because the \"collection and analysis of the requisite samples do not carry the grave potential for arbitrary and oppr essive interference with the privacy and personal security of individuals that the F ourth Amendment was designed to prevent.\"(6, p. 1394) The Supreme Court's strong ratification of the HHS drug testing procedure may have important implications to the small business owner. The reliab ility of drug testing had, in the past, been a target of complaints which were often warranted. Indeed, cases of mishandli ng, false positives and other procedur al problems, cast serious doubts on the efficacy of urinalysis.(2, pp. 317 -321) Such doubts had a chilling effect on ma ny employers desiring to implement drug testing but fearful of lawsuits by disg runtled employees. Those employers who use these guidelines now may point to the apparent reliability of this approach if legally attacked, in particular, if th e employer is in the public sector or is deemed to be an \"agent of the government\" in the private sector. Is Proof of On-the-Job Impairment a Prere guisite to a Valid Dr ug Testing Program? A third, ongoing issue of drug testing has been whether it is necessary to prove the connection or \"nexus\" between urinalysis and on-the-job impairment. Urinalys is cannot, for instance, prove that a person who tests positively fo r the THC metabolite found in marijuana, is presentl y intoxicated or had ingested it days or ev en weeks ago. Hence, the tests may punish and stigmatize a person for off-the-job usage that have may no effect on how the wo rker performs on-the-job. The Von Raab case, by implication, indicated that this dilemm a is no longer an impediment to drug testing. The Court, although not grappling directly with the i ssue, stated that the Customs Service ha s a \"compelling interest in preventing the risk of life of the citizenry posed by the potential use of deadly force by persons suffering from impaired perception and judgment.\" Similarly, the Court felt that having physically fit employees with \"unimpeacha ble integrity and judgment\" were compelling interests the Custom s Service should ensure as well.(6, p. 1386) In the fore going pronouncement, however, the Court ma de no mention of the \"nexus\" problem and as such did not distinguish between on-the-job and off-the-job drug use. I ndeed, the Court's statement that there are compelling interests in having a \"physically fit\" employee with \"unimpeac hable integrity and judgment\" infers that drug abstinence is an ongoing duty imposed on certain workers and thus not protected from the in trusion of drug testing. In the Skinner case, moreover, the Court stated that drug use, regardless of when it may have occurred, is important information and therefore relevant. As an illustration, the Court stated that \"[ E]ven if urine test results disclosed nothing more specific than the recent use of controlled s ubstances by a covered employ ee, this information would provide the basis for further investigativ e work designed to determine whether th e employee used drugs at the relevant times.\"(9, p. 1421) MEASUREMENT: A STANDARD FOR DETERMINING THE REASON ABLENESS OF DRUG TESTING COMPELLING GOVERNMENT INTERESTS VS. TH E EMPLOYEE'S PRIVACY EXPECTATIONS Arguably the most important implication of the two cases was the emergence of a new standard for determining the reasonableness of drug testing. As mentioned, the Four th Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures by the government or its agents of their employees in the public sector has often been the most critical legal hurdle to overcome in a drug testing pr ogram. The new standard, discussed be low, may now lega lize many types of drug testing programs which formerly would have been legally risky. In general, a search is reasonable and therefore legal if a warrant is issued upon proving the existence of probable cause. However, as explained in the V on Raab case, \"neither a warrant nor pr obable cause, nor, indeed, any measure of individualized suspicion, is an indispensa ble component of reasonableness in every circumstance.\"(6, p. 1390) Consequently, the Court stated that \"where a Fourth Amendment instrusion serves special governmental needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcem ent, it is necessary to bala nce the individual's privacy expectations against the Government's inte rests to determine whether it is impractic al to require a warrant or some level of individualized suspicion in the particular context.\"(6, p. 1390) Thus, to a pply this test on a case-by-case basis, it is necessary to articulate the special gove rnmental needs or compelling interests and then weigh these needs against the employee's privacy expectations. If the governmental interests outweigh the priv acy expectations then a search, even without a warrant or individua lized suspicion, would be deem ed reasonable and legal. MEASUREMENT: IMPLICATIONS OF SKINNER AND VON RAAB TO THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER In light of the discussion of these case s and their implications, wh at might all this mean to the small business owner? One very important inquiry is what busi nesses like the railroads under the FRA, will be considered agents of the government. Private businesses, such as airlines, trucking and others that are more pervasiv ely regulated businesses, fit into the category of agents of the government under the Skinner analysis, especially in light of regulations issued by the Department of Transportation. Moreover, whatever private sector businesses which are deemed to be agents, the relevant federal laws will preempt confli cting state laws as well as labor agr eements and arbitrations. For those which are less reguated, it remains to be hammered out in the courts their status as agents with important implications either way. If a business is not an agent of the government, a worker would have to rely on traditional common law actions in tort, such as invasion of privacy(1) or defamation or possibly state statutory(12) or constituti onal protections(2) to fight an employer's drug testing policy he/she feels is illegal. Secondly, if a business is considered to be an agent of the government, it no longer has to ponder what were once considered impediments to drug testing. Thus, proving that there is a drug probl em as a prerequisite to a testing program, wrestling with the reliability of the testing procedure, and determining if the positive results have a direct impairment effect or \"nexus\" on the wo rksite, are no longer important issues. Thirdly, to legally justify any type of drug testing approach (i.e. tests whic h are random, mandatory, announced or after an accident etc.) it will be necessary to prove that there ar e compelling governmental intere sts and then to demonstrate why they outweigh the employee's privacy expectations. Thes e interests include integrity, public safety and protecting sensitive information. Whether more interests will appear in th e future, of course, remains to be seen. In any case, these interests must be weighed against an employee's expectations of pr ivacy. Furthermore, those employees with jobs which incorporate any of these interests, will be deemed to have considerabl y diminished privac y expectations. However, the connection or \"nexus\" between the employee's job and the interest (s) must be direct and therefore not so broad as to include other employees with only an indirect or incident al connection to the interest. The bottom line, assuming a private business is an agent of the government, is that business can potentially justify even a random, mandatory drug testing now. The business would first ha ve to articulate characteri stics in its workplace such as public safety to warrant such a procedure since it is unlik ely that integrity or protection of top secret information in the context of the Von Raab case would be present in many private businesses. Again, businesses such as the airlines and trucking would fit neatly into this category. Pilots and truckers would also have diminish ed privacy expectations due to the direct implications their drug use could have on public safety. CONCLUSION The testing of employees for drug use is becoming pervasive in both th e public and private sectors. Two recent Supreme Court decisions, Skinner and Von Raab may help clar ify the parameters of drug testing, particularly in the public sector, but possibly in areas of the private sector as well. In either case, as more lower court decisions continue to illuminate employers on what they can and cannot do, employers can concentrate th eir efforts and resources on eliminating the well documented effects of drug use in the wo rkplace and less on concerns on whether they are treading on the legal rights of their employees. Employees, on the ot her hand, must grapple with the realization that the legislative, executive and judicial bran ches at all levels of government are a ggressively pursuing a public policy aimed at purging drugs from the workplace. Th e eventual outcome may be a sacrifici ng of privacy rights, especially for workers in certain industries.

Justis, Louisiana State Univ ersity Peng S. Chan, California State University - Fullerton Ben L. Kedia, Memphis State University ABSTRACT Many changes have taken place in franch ising organizations during the last quar ter century including the compensation practices for franchisors and franchisees . This article investigates the compen sation systems which are generally used in franchising organizations. This paper covers the reward and incentive policies which may be used by franchisees and franchisors for different level managers in promoting and motiva ting their employees. INTRODUCTION In today's rapidly changing world, over one-third of retail sales in the Unite d States are handled through franchising outlets. Over 20% of our gros s national product is attributed to franchising operati ons. Franchising has become the fastest growing method of doing business in the world today. Franchisors and franchisees both depend upon highly motivated and dedicated employees to help run and operate their business pr actices. The compensation policies which are used in a franchise organization need to be solely tail ored for that franchise organi zation. Traditional compensation systems which are found in well-establish ed or bureaucratic organiza tions often hamper the desired performance levels in franchising organizations. One exampl e, the seniority- based compensation sy stems, while being very useful and beneficial for manufacturing firms, of ten are detrimental or send a poor message to em ployees in franchising organizations. In this article we review the compensation policies which can be used to encourage and develop proper attitudes and behaviors of franchising employees. Characteristics of a Fr anchising Organization There are specific characteristics which differentiate franchising organizations fr om other traditional organizations. The main differential is found in the part nership which exists between the fran chisor (headquarters corporation) and franchisee (local store). The franchisor is looking fo r growth through enlarged number of units being opened and larger sales volumes per unit. The franchisor is interested in selling franchises a nd developing company-owned stores on as rapid a basis as possible. The franchisee, on the other hand, is looking to utilize an establishe d system to establish their own business units. The franchisee want s large sales and improved profits. Franchisees act as entrepreneurs in that they are individua ls who establish a new business for the purpose of developing profit and growth. This entrep reneurial trait is characterized by the innovative behavi or of the franchisee. Franchisees have a tendency to use strategic mana gement practices as they search fo r growth and profit opportunities. Key Employees The key employees of both the headqua rter organization and the franchisi ng organization are concerned with profitability, innovation, creativity, cooperation, and a desire to have a highly successful franchise outlet. The compensation policies established for these employees shoul d be developed by the franchisor or the franchisee to properly inform these employees that their behaviors are re sponsible for the success and profits of the organization. Proper attitudes and behavior s hould be properly rewarded. There are two different groups of individuals in franchise operations which need specific reward strategies based on their performance. These two groups include: (1) the headquart er organization staff responsible for the operations and sales of franchise units and (2) the managers and assist ant managers of the individu al (franchisee) stores. ORGANIZATION LIFE CYCLE The organization life cycle is an important concept which allows us to relate the compensation policies (including incentive programs) to the business strate gy and practices of the franchising orga nization. The organization life cycle as adopted by a franchising organization consists of four orga nizational stages including: (1) start-up, (2) growth, (3) mature, and (4) decline. The or ganization life c ycle can illustrate the develo pmental sta ges of a franchisin g organization with the sales revenues and size of the organization (see Figure 1). The organizational life cycle matrix shown in Figure 1 relates the organi zational characteristic s with the different compensation packages and incentive programs for both the he adquarters organization staff and the franchisee staff. Start-up Stage. The growth rates for most beginning franchis ing organizations is often very slow during the start-up phase. This slow start-up is generally coupled with a sma ll number of units actually sold and opened during the first few years of operation. The central focus of the franchising business is generally aimed at developing financing for the organization and controlling costs. It is dur ing this stage of business that risk is very high and it is difficult to attract employees and provide them with sufficie nt pay and incentives to encourage them to join the franchise operation. Growth Stage. The growth stage is shown during a rapid expa nsion. It is quite often durin g this time period, often from two to ten years, that the franchise will expand from twenty to more than a hundred stores. As stores begin to open, other people begin to realize the impact these stores may have and the opportun ity for personal and financial success. The focus of the business is centere d around increasing the numbe r of stores sold and opened. The focus of the compensation program is around recruiting, training, and retaining key employees. Th e risk factor is moderating during the growth stage and success is on the horizon for the hea dquarter's franchising operation. It is important during this stage that key employees receive compensation for their severa l skills. Employees need to be recognized for their sales efforts as well as for handli ng new start-up franchises. Mature Stage. Generally the mature stage will occur after the franchise has been operating for six to ten years and the number of units have increased to ove r one hundred throughout the United States . Sales revenues have increased from mediam to large and the growth rate continues moderate to strong. The main focus of the business is generally around profitability and the risk factor has de clined to being low. The pay and incen tive side is generally focused on the consistency or motivation of the key employees. Decline Stage. If a franchising corporat ion begins to decline, it is primaril y because the franchisees have become disgruntled with the franchisor due either to lack of sale s or services provided from th e franchisor to the franchisee organization. The growth rate may begin to decline and become negative and earni ng power of the business will also be declining. The risk factor is becoming hi gh and the central focus of the business be comes survival rather than profits. The pay and incentive focus is often around cutbacks and lay-offs. However, it is important to retain key employees if the business is going to tu rn around and recover. Compensation Policies for the Headquarter's Staff The beginning franchising orga nization is generally divided into three different executive offices including: (1) president's office, (2) director of sales, and (3) director of operations. These th ree offices form the executive staff of most beginning franchising organizations and constitute the main creative, innovative, and driving force in the development of the franchising program. The base salary and benefits of these three key individuals is often the below the market level initially, but as the organization expands and develops through the growth stage, th e salaries and benefits should be raised to a competitive market level. As the organization evolve s into the mature stage, these individua ls are often above the market level of compensation. Many of these key employees are initia lly brought on board because of incenti ve programs including initial stock options with broad participation by this very select number of people. As the or ganization will grow, the stock options would become more limited to key em ployees, and finally during the mature stage a stock purchase program may be initiated as an additional incentive for a limited stock option program to other employees. The short-term incentives are generally in terms of stock or cash bonuses based upon performance of the key employees. For key employees, the stock option may be the strongest in centive or inducement for join ing the beginning franchising corporation. Stock options are a great attraction and incentives for a new empl oyee. These options also have the tendency to hold on to top talent as they see the organizat ion grow and develop. The most common stock options would include incentive stock options (ISO), non-qualified stock options (NQSO), and restricted stock. With the ISO, the employee receives an option to purchase stock at a specific price at the time the option is granted (generally the book value or market value ) and would have u p to ten years to exercise such o ption. With the ISO, no tax is paid when the grant is exercised: however, the gains on selling the stock will receive cap ital gains treatment. The non-qualified stock option, wh ile similar to the ISO, does require the employee to pay taxes when the option is exercised as well as when the stock is sold. The restricted stock option generally remained with the company for a fixed period of time, usually three to seven years. Stock options have become mo re and more valuable in attracting employees both initially and during the growth stage. As th e company grows, the eligibility for stock options becomes more restricted with only the key execu tives and specially target ed employees being able to participate during the growth and mature stages of the business. The director of sales and sa les staff may often receive commission of $500- $2000 for each franchise sold. This commission incentive is gene rally based on 3-15% of the in itial franchise fee. Cash bonus systems may also be developed for the operations manager and his staff, generally based upon the sales increase of franchise and company-owned stores for which they have dir ect responsibility. Compensation Policies for Franchisee Units The franchisee generally has two major classifications of employees who receive salary and pay incentives. These generally include the store manager and the assistant manager(s). The salary structure for managers and assistant managers is generally very competitiv e within local markets and franchise stores should try to ascertain what the competitive base salary is competing stores. A franchisee is generally responsible for the success and profita bility of the franchising unit. Therefore, the franchisee wants to bring on board the best managers and assistant managers available to in sure the success and profitability of the business. The initial benefit package for managers and assist ant managers is generally be low the market level because of limited finances available in franchisi ng. It is important that the base salaries be competitiv e for initial managers and assistant managers. Several first time managers of franch ising operations are recruited from compe titive firms and promoted from assistant managers to store managers. The mana gers and assistant managers from a specific unit are generally quite young and don't have a lot of experience in manage ment or operations. The l ong-term incentives for these individuals are often provided through travel and pr ofit-sharing programs. Travel programs ha ve been very successful for franchise managers and assistant managers and should vary from year to year, while profit-sharing may often be anywhere from 3% of the sales of the franchise unit. Figure 2 illustrates the incentive or cash bonus system which may be used for store managers and assistant managers in franchising outlets. The short- term incentives are ofte n based on cash bonus systems. Many managers or assistant mana gers develop an incentive system base d on sales or percent of increase of sales or a previous period of time. Fi gure 2 illustrates how a manager with a 13% increase over the previous year's quarter would receive a $1000 bonus with two assistant managers. This bonus could rise to $6000, assuming expected increases in business sales. Also shown are different travel incentiv es for store managers and assistant ma nagers who have been able to obtain expected sales levels for a gi ven period of time. There is ge nerally a differentiation in re ward structures between the store manager who may be going to Honolulu and the assistant store mana ger who is sent to Orlando, FL. Combining the cash bonus system with the employee profit-sha ring program and travel plan provides a generous base- salary and benefits package for the managers and assistant managers in the franchisee stores. This system should allow the franchisees to recruit, train, and retain the necessary key managers in a franchising operation. CONCLUSION Both franchisors and franchisees need to be able to recrui t, train, and retain top qualit y executives to manage and run their respective operations. Many franchisors fail in provi ding appropriate compensation systems both in a short run and long run, and are unable to keep their key executives for a long period of time. We have identified in this article specific compensation policies which would help both the cor porate headquarters organization as well as the individual franchisee units. We have reviewed the choice pay ince ntive systems based upon the development stage of the franchise life cycle. Key executives are the strength of the franchising system. To be able to retain these executives a fair and proper compensation policy needs to be developed for the key execu tives and the headquarters or animation as well as the mana gers and assistant mana gers in the individual franchise units. Both lon g-term and short-term incentive packages need to be developed and used to in sure success of the franchising units.

INCREASING THE PARTICIPATION OF MINORITY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES Nathaniel Barber, Winthrop College Darrell Parker, Winthrop College ABSTRACT The problems of the minority business comm unity represent an important challenge in the promotion of small business enterprises. This paper presents a coordinated appro ach for identifying and incorporating minority owned small businesses within the business communit y. The development program includes th e establishment of a minority business incubator, needs assessment through a Chamber of Commerce Minority Business Task Forc e, and the initiation of a Minority Business Loan Pool. INTRODUCTION Minority owned small businesses often face problems that effectively leave them out of the mainstream of the business community. Greene (2) discusses some of the problems associated with small bus inesses and reviews the literature on minority business problems. Butler, Neves, and Sanyal (1) fo cus on the capital problems of small businesses, review this literature and provide a study on innovation within the minority community to overcome these financial problems. This paper builds on the literature a ddressing the problems of the minority owne d small business by explicitly focusing on the participation of minority owned bus inesses and proactive strategies to identify and incorporate these businesses within the mainstream business community. The most apparent example of the rela tive isolation of the minority busine ss community can be seen by attending a local Chamber of Commerce meeting. The mi nority business community is typically not well represented in this type of organization. Another example of isolation that contributes to the failure of small bus inesses involves the banking relationships of minority owned small businesses. Without an established banki ng relationship it is more diff icult to obtain the financial help needed. In the most extreme case, the isolatio n of minority owned small businesses fo rces them into the underground economy. In this extreme, the business owners do not have tradit ional advertising, checking accounts, or official business relationships. The Winthrop College Small Business Deve lopment Center in concert with the Rock Hill area Chamber of Commerce and local lending institutions have engage d in a multifaceted effort to identify minority owned businesses address their problems and bring them into the mainstream business community. The minority community efforts include the establishment of a minority sm all business incubator program using funding from the Economic Developmen t Administration. In addition, minorit y owned businesses were surveyed through the work of a minority business ta sk force of the Chamber of Commerce. One survey instrument explicitly addressed financial needs within the mi nority business community. This survey was done in cooperation with local lending institutions to serve as a gui de for the type of lending pool needed to support the needs of the minority community. PROBLEMS OF MINORITY SMALL BUSINESSES The Region of South Carolina that includes York County a nd the City of Rock Hill ha s not been a fertile economic spawning ground for prosperous minority owned small busin ess enterprises. Therefor e minorities are not well represented in business organizations in the region. For example, minorities do not participate in Chamber of Commerce activities -- t hus, depriving the Chamber of important resour ces and depriving the minority community of a voice and active participation in economic de cision making. However, there are many more minority owned businesses than the records indicate. Most of these are solid, \"underground\" businesses that have been operated for years without a business license, a business telephone, or, in man y cases, even a business name. Workers in these enter prises do not en joy fringe benefits such as insurance, workman's compensation, unemployment insurance, or membersh ip in the social security program. Consequently, they have little long term security. Owners of such minority businesses do not develop banking re lationships. They operate on current cash flow and often do not purchase the equipment necessary to improve performa nce. For example, if heavy equipment is needed, it is rented on a daily basis. Over a short period of time, the mi nority business owners will pay the rental agent many times over the cost of owning and maintaining the equipment. Many minority underground business owners have attempted to legalize their opera tions but have been frustrated by procedural obstacles and ceased such efforts and continue to rely on traditional practices. The most often mentioned frustration is with the banking communit y. Banks require detailed financial re cords by businesses seeking assistance. They want records that the minority entrepreneur has not kept and cannot generate from memory. A chai n of failed relations with banks has developed in the minority business communi ty. These business people have come to expect and accept that they cannot be successful in borrowing from banks. A mechanism is needed to assist these existing and new mi nority businesses in overcoming the obstacles which prevent their advancement. Services such as information retrie val, business planning, basic record keeping, management assistance, and marketing assistance would gr eatly benefit the minorit y business community. In addition, an \"incubator\" is needed to provide such ba sic assistance as a telephone answering service, message service, bookkeeping and other accounting services, and manage ment consulting services. Such an incubator program has been initiated, funded in part by a grant from the Economic Devel opment Administration. MINORITY SMALL BU SINESS INCUBATOR The minority small business incubator was initiated with the mission to serve ne w minority owned business ventures in the three county area of York, Lancaster, and Chester Counties in South Carolina. As a result of the incubator it is anticipated that new minority owned business ventures in this three c ounty area will be able to begin operation following sound business principles. This will be evidenced by a decline in the failure rate of minority owned small businesses. Prior to the initiation of th e incubator program the failure rate had been estimated at 90 percent over a five year period. Further more, existing businesses in the service area, whic h did not begin operation pr operly or are having problems legitimizing their businesses, would be a ssisted with incubator services. one majo r focus of the incubator program is to encourage underground businesses to pay ta xes, insurance, social security, and to fully legitimize their business. The end result will be an increase in the three c ounties tax base, more employ ment opportunities, and more participation by minority owned fi rms in the business community. The small business incubator was concep tualized as providing basic assistance through a telephone answering service, message service, bookkeeping and other acc ounting services, tax adviso ry services, legal advice, secretarial and other office services, and mana gement assistance. Each small business client is assessed a varying fee based upon his or her ability to pay. The incubator attempts to attract it s clients from underground businesses as well as new business formations. The incubator attempts to get these clients operating in a fully le gal manner as quickly as possibl e. That is, they purchase a business license, withhold taxes and social security payments from employees' pa y, file tax returns, and perform other functions that are required of legitimate businesses. The incubator also actively s eeks expanded business opportunities for its c lients. Larger contracts, contracts with government, and longer term contracts f or services could result. Increased growth, profitability, and long term survival is an expected outcome. FINANCIAL NEEDS OF MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES In order to determine the needs of the minority busine ss community, a task force of the Rock Hill Chamber of Commerce was formed on minority business. This task for ce determined that a survey was needed to assess the financial position of minority owned businesses. This inform ation could be used to design an appropriate financing vehicle for the minority community. The survey instrument is included in Appendix A. The population for this survey was a list of 91 minority businesses identified through the Winthrop College Small Busine ss Development Center and the Minority Business Incubator program. A sample from this list was selected and a total of 17 business owners responded. This response rate actually represents more than 17 businesses, since some entr epreneurs were engaged in more than one venture. The survey was designed to obtai n information on the owner's hom e and business as well as their loan experience and needs. SURVEY RESULTS The following three points hi ghlight the survey findings: 1. The financia l needs of minority business owners are primarily for business loans not home loans. 2. Since minority businesses in this region ar e primarily in the service industry, any program targeted to this se ctor must recognize the lack of extensive collateral. 3. The role of the Small Business Development Center to assist in the preparation of loan applications did not meet with any serious objections. Home Ownership This sample of business owners were also home owners, wi th 15 of the 17 owning their ow n home. Further, one third of those who owned a home stated that it was currently paid for. Only two members of the sample expressed interest in a home or home improvement loan. The concerns of these business owners (and their financia l needs) were directed toward their business. Business Assets The businesses surveyed have a median of 8 years experience with a range of 1 to 40. The orientation is toward service industries with a median net income of $25,000 and a me dian value of business a ssets in the $22,000-$25,000 range. (On the high end, net income and business as sets ranged to $200,000 and $500,000 respectively.) One implication from the current level of business assets is that a relatively smal l loan pool could have a major impact on the minority business community. Excluding the largest co mpany, other businesses reported a combined level of business assets less than $400,000. Banking Relationships Although 15 of the 17 businesses reported that they had applied for a loan, many re ported difficulty in obtaining funds. Consequently, fewer than one half of the businesses in our sample reported that th ey had received a loan (8 of the 17). For those who had obtained loans, half attributed their success to their banking relationship. The Chamber of Commerce received th e above summary of the survey re sults and recommended that bank representatives meet to discuss the financial needs of the minority comm unity that were indica ted. A primary focus of this meeting was the potential to establish a financing vehicle for minority businesses. A FINANCING VEHICLE FOR MINO RITY OWNED BUSINESSES There are seven major commercial banks th at lend in the Rock Hill area. Represen tatives from these banks were invited to a meeting with representatives from the Small Business Development Center to discuss the potential for targeting loans to the minority business communit y. The plan discussed would involve eac h financial institution contributing a specified amount to a loan pool dedicated to this use. The banking representatives were particularly interested in th is proposal since a lending arra ngement of this type could be considered as supporting community development as specified in the assessm ent factors used to evaluate their com pliance with the Communit y Reinvestment Act. CONCLUSION The original proposal to initiate a minority business incubator was put forth in June of 1988. This project has now passed the start up phase of identifying its potential client base and is beginning to expand operations. The Chamber of Commerce Survey of Minority Owned Businesses was conducte d by the Minority Business Ta sk Force in late August of 1989. By late September of 1990, an agreement on the composi tion and nature of the financing vehicle for minority businesses is almost in place. A loan pool of $20,000 was decided upon. A detailed set of criteria were developed that expressed the qualifying loan purposes, the information needed in the loan packet, the loan criteria, and the application process. A breakdown of the loan criteria by type of loan is available from the authors. The outreach to the minority business community contai ns three important elements : 1. The Minority Incubator Program; 2. The Chamber of Commerce Mi nority Business Task Force; and 3. The Minority Business Loan Pool. Combined these three components represent a program designed to increase the pr esence, participation, and profitability of the minority business community.

Cook, Fort Lewis College Jeryl L. Nelson, Wayne State College ABSTRACT Providing employee health-care be nefits began as an outgrowth of paternal istic gestures by early industrialists and eventually became a common part of many benefit packages in response to governmentally imposed wage controls during World War II. American workers have grown accustomed to receiving h ealthcare benefits and now consider adequate coverage to be a ri ght rather than a benefit. Although a great deal has been written a bout providing health-care benefits to pr ivate sector employees, there appears to be a void in examining how small businesses are continui ng to provide this popular bene fit to their employees in a changing environment. This paper helps to fill that voi d by providing useful informati on to both academicians and practitioners on the causes and possible solutions to coping with the rising costs of pr oviding health-care services. Cost-Related Issues in Providing Employee Health-C are Benefits Both providers and users of health-care services are being challenged to cope with an upward spiral in health-care costs. Health-care costs continue to ri se and are projected to increase by perh aps as much as 20% in 1990 (2). By the end of 1989, the average employer's medical benefit costs had increased to more th an 13% of payroll, as compared to 5% of payroll just ten years ago (10). In a survey of mo re than 1,750 private and public employers with a total work force of 12.5 million, the Princeton, New Jersey, benefits cons ulting firm, Foster Higgins, found that the average cost to employers of providing heal th-care benefits increased by 20.4% per employee in 1989 (3). The primary reasons for increasing healthca re costs are an oversupply of hospital be ds and facilities' higher labor costs, and the intensity of service including the widening availab ility of expensive medical technology, the increasing number of AIDs cases, drug treatment programs, an aging popul ation, and surgical transplants of human organs (1; 4; 6). Physicians have also been shown to provide some unnecessary a nd ineffective medi cal care in an attempt to avoid malpractice law suits adding to the overall health-care costs (4; 10). Although customarily paying more per employee for their heal th benefits coverage than larger companies, small companies are still more likely to pay the full cost of health insurance premiums fo r their employees. A 1987 study by the Small Business Administration found that almost three-fourths of firms with less than 100 employees paid 100% of the employees, health insurance premiums and 87% of family premiums. A 1989 survey of small-and mid-sized northeastern companie s revealed that 40% had made no attemp ts to control health-care costs (10). There are several explanations as to why small companies pay more for insurance coverage than large firms. These include 1) the higher administrative cost s per individual for the insurance carrier when working with small numbers; 2) higher costs of medical underwriting; a nd 3) the inability to self-insure or participate in he alth-maintenance organizations (HMOs) or pref erred-provider organizations ( PPOs). Small companies are also less likely to incorporate other cost-savings ideas such as pr eadmission certificati on, second opinions, outpatient su rgery, concurrent review, discharge planning, and high-co st-case management (10). Legislative Issues in Providing Employee Health-C are Benefits In the last 20 years, almost 800 laws have been passed in th e United States, mandating cove rage for specific conditions and certain health-car e providers. State mandated benefits vary wi dely, but typically require coverage for psychologists, optometrists, chiropracto rs, alcoholism-treatment, newborns, th e mentally and physic ally handicapped, and conversion privileges for separated workers. The end result is that these requirements prove to be very co stly and are paid only by those companies that 1) are forced to purchase regulated insurance, 2) have adequate financial re sources, and/or 3) have the de sire to continue to provide coverage for their employees. These same requirements have forced some busin esses to either limit or eliminate covera ge alto gether unless the y are lar ge enou gh to self-insure which exem pts them from state mandates as set forth in the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974. Gail Jensen, an economist at Wayne Stat e University, has determined that le gislative requirements have been the primary reason 16% of small businesses offe r no health benefits coverage. In response to these restrictions, some states are suspending mandated coverage require ments to enable small businesses that currently have no employee insurance to provide low-cost policies (7; 8). Under health-care contin uation rules contained in the Consolidated Om nibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, better known as COBRA, employers ar e required to allow former employees, di vorced and widowed spouses of employees, and former dependent children to cont inue health care at group rates. Empl oyers are also required under COBRA to provide notice of these cont inuation privileges to separated employ ees. The provisions under COBRA have been expanded since the initial passage requi ring employers to provide coverage for former workers who were excluded fro m initial coverage due to medical cond itions. In addition, the length of time that continuation coverage must be provided has been expanded from 18 to 29 months (9). Potential Solutions to the Problem of Providing Health -Care Benefits Faced with both rising costs and cumbersome legislative re quirements, employers are beginning to re-examine health- care benefit provisions. If health care costs continue to rise as projected, immediate a nd significant savings could be accomplished through several availa ble cost control approaches. * Increase front-end deductibles to at least $100 and perhap s as high as $500 per employee and/or dependent. * Require employees to pay a portion of their own and/or their depe ndent's insurance premiums. * Limit the maximum benefit payments available to employees and/or dependents. * Implemen t or increase employee co-payments for medical services e.g. a 90/10 or possibly an 80/ 20 split while adding a stop-loss provision to limit an employee's total liability (typically $2,000 or less per employee). * Change insurance carr iers in order to obtain more attractive premiums and negotiate for a minimum two-year contra ct to avoid having premiums raised on an annual basis. * Assume a portion of the risk of providing health-care covera ge by self-insuring high cost first dolla r payments and contracting for Third Party Administration (TPA) of claims. Caution should be exercised before using any of these alte rnatives. Due to potential ta x and regulatory implications, consult with your accountant a nd/or legal counsel prior to implementing any changes. Since any of these cost control options would have a noticeable fi nancial impact on the employ ees due to cost shifting, it is recommended that firms consider providing flexible spending and reimbursement account s in conjunction with the implementation of any of these alternatives. Flexible sp ending and reimbursement account s not only lessen the actual employee costs for out-of-pocket payments but also aid in attempts to educate em ployees about the true cost of medical services and make them more conscious of these expenditures. Flexible spending or reimbursement accou nts were first introduced in 1974, but have been slow to catch on. Flexible spending or reimbursement accounts allow employees to pay fo r health-care services, deductibles, and co-payments not covered by their employers' plans with pre-tax dollars. Either the employee or both the employee and employer may make contributions to these accounts. Multiple administrative actions which can be classified as \"managed care\" approach es are also available to small firms in the search for alternative mean s to control health-care costs. * Require preadmission certification and utilization reviews prior to hospitaliza tion in order to establish medical necessity, appropriate care, and length of hospital stay. * Require second opinion s in order to verify the need for elective surgery. * Utilize discharge planni ng. * Coordinate dependent benefits to encourage dependents, especially working spouses, to seek and use coverage available thr ough their employers. * Require more outpatient care including preadmission testing and surgery. * Provide coverage for hom e health care or hospice care to avoid the high cost hospitalization. Small businesses located in lar ger metro politan areas should also co nsider more formalized a pproaches to \"mana ged care\" such as: * Encouraging employees to join Health Maintenance Organi zations (HMOs) where availabl e since these organizations are designed to cover an employee's entire medical needs. * Utilizi ng the services of Prefer red Provider Organizations (PPOs) where medical pr actitioners provide serv ices at a discount. Small businesses should also explore the opportunities of requiring medical underwriting of individuals prior to acceptance in group plans, and joining with similar comp anies through purchasing groups to obtain pooled insurance coverage. Small firms can join together in Multiple Employer Trusts (METs) e ither on a local basis or through national and regional associations in order to obtain health-care insurance premiums at costs similar to larger employers. In addition, the potential cost savings available through l ong-term preventive health-car e measures should also be explored. * Employee wellness programs which encourage employees to ch ange unhealthy behaviors, monitor health conditions, and engage in preventive health care can be designed and implemented. * Presenta tion of employee education programs including information about the costs and effective use of health-care benefits. * Externally administered Employee Assistance Programs (E APs) designed to assist em ployees and their dependents in finding help for alcohol, drug, emotional, family, emotional, and other personal problems. Employee Assistance Programs may only be available on a cost-effective basi s to companies located in larger metropolitan areas, but any firm can establish effective wellness and education programs. Realizing that new and more restrictive legislation may be enacted and costs ma y continue to rise, small firms should explore currently available opportunitie s to reduce their health-care cost burden while providing employees with adequate coverage and financial prot ection. As decision makers investigate both the costs and problems of providing health-care coverage to all employees , there is a critical need to exam ine and develop cr eative solutions. SUMMARY In the face of rising health-c are costs new approaches to controlling these costs as well as adequate utilization of presently available cost control technique s must be explored. Since most employees consider health-care coverage to be a right, accurate information about the cost and cost c ontrol alternatives of providing these benefits must be communicated in order to deve lop a greater appreciation of th e benefits being provided.

Welsch, DePaul University Earl C. Young, DePaul University Abstract As women are becoming more independent and starting their own businesses, it is interesting to investigate what factors are associated with this au tonomy. Do more autonomous women beha ve differently than less autonomous women? What characteristics are associated with au tonomous women entrepreneurs? How do autonomous women entrepreneurs from diffe rent groups behave differently? Two groups of women entrepreneurs (n = 128, n = 55) from the same geographic area, but with different cultural backgrounds were tested to see if cultur e played a significant role in the relationships. Several major differences were found. Conclusions and implications are discussed. Introduction In recent years the growth in the number of U.S. women en trepreneurs has been spectacul ar, from 1. 9 million owners in 1977 to 3.7 million (28% of all U.S. businesses) in 1985. If this rate were to c ontinue, by the year 2000, women would own and operates approximately 50% of all U.S. busines ses (37). Their influence is even more keenly felt in service industries, the most rapidly growing segment of the economy, where women own the vast majority of the businesses (37, p. 286). At first, women entrepreneurs were concen trated in retail establishments, where they currently own fi fty percent of the businesses, and in service companies, where they own se venty-five percent of the fi rms (37, p. 286). They are now entering non- traditional industries such as computers, information services, financial services and high technology firms. While the numbers are impressive -- women are star ting their own businesses at twice the rate of men--their revenues lag substantially. Several factors have been cited to account for these lower revenues, including discrimination, ineffective gover nment programs designed for women, inadequate data to assist pol icy limit access to credit, and lack of training, devel opment and technical assistance. However, the lack of growth in revenue and in other key dimensions of business success requires a more fundamental explanation. It is not sufficient to cite external factors as being the major impedi ment to growth. The lack of growth is at least equally likely to be due to the characteristics of the en trepreneur herself. From this perspective, it is possible to formulate an equally impressive set of f actors that explain the lack of growth and revenue. A partial listi ng of factors might include, for example, a lack of bus iness experience, and/or knowledge of business discipline, limited objectives, a pa rt-time effort; family obligations, lack of drive, commitment to the business, and willingness to risk, a nd a preference for sma ll scale operations. Of these factors, one of the more fundamental to or embedded in the make-up of women entrepreneurs (or any entrepreneur, for that matter) are those relating to personality characteristics. it is recognized that there is increasing criticism of a trait approach to entrepre neurship, i.e., although valuable work in the area of vocational testing resulted, the view, was largely one of a static individual in a static world (4, p. 394). However, the primary shortcomings of personality trait analysis lie in the tendency to construct universal traits without sufficient regard to intervening variables and the failure to design inst ruments which operationalize and unambiguou sly measure the initial construct. With this reservation in mind, this paper focuses on a part icular personality trait analysis as the starting point. Accordingly the following research que stion can be formulated: What charact eristic(s) of female entrepreneurs correlate(s) significantly with key asp ects of entrepreneurial activity? Consider able Montanari (32) reviewed narrow the list of traits relevant to entrepreneurial research. The six personality characteristics they selected were achiev ement, autonomy, dominan ce, endurance, order, and locus of control. Of these, they f ound support for autonomy in three of the studies they reviewed (11; 24; 36), as well as for achievement in three (31; 25; 36). In this paper only autonomy was selected for more extensive analysis, since it appeared to lead to new insights and understanding of the women entrepreneur, in view of the strides women have made in shedding traditional roles, the women's literation movement, establ ishing new career paths, and creating structures to enable them to realize th ese roles (i.e. , day care centers, female mentors, and professional networks) . The Traditional View of Autonom y as It Relates to Entre preneurshi p Autonomy has long been thought of as a major characteristic of entrepreneurs. The pers on who did not \"fit into\" the corporate environment or who was resent ful of the supervision and control of a possibly capricious boss often long sought for the day that he or she could start their own business and not be under the \"yoke\" of someone else or a bureaucratic \"straitjacket.\" Shapero (38) describes the \"uncomfortable ,, entrepreneur who is dissa tisfied with his or her job or position, waiting for the chance to become \"free\" and start their own business. Collins and Moore (11) suggest that the entrepreneurial personality is characterized by an unwillingness to submit to authority, an inability to work with it and a consequent need to escape from it. The boss is seen as someone who must be rejected because he is a 'drunkard and a fool\" (11, p. 69) who place s him in situations of insecurity a nd danger. He thus abruptly cuts the situation of his life and begins a ne w enterprise in which he can use hi s own energies to create a world more tolerable to himself. \"This world is his new business, and from it, he rigidly ex cludes all those superordinate figures that have betrayed and injured him in the past\" (11, p. 69). This behavior is based on Maslow's need for autonomy which Collins and Moore define as \"the condition of having full direction in one's life\" (11, p. 251). Mescon and Montanari (32) provide a list of adjectives which define a person with a high need for autonomy (see Table I below). Schwartz (36) made one of the early studies identifying a hi gh need for independence among women entrepreneurs. More recently Chaganti (9) and Sexton and Bowman-Upton (37) utili zed autonomy in describing entrepreneurs in their research. Hi lls and Welsch (22) found a strong re lationship between independence and entrepreneurial intentions among 2000 university students. Table I Characteristics of Autonomy Description of High Scorer Tries to break away from restra ints, confinement, or restrict ions of any kind; enjoys being unattached, free, not tied to people, places, or obligations; may be rebe llious when faced with restraints. Defining Trait Adjectives Unmanageable, free, self-reliant, i Evolution of Autonomy Among Women Entrepreneurs The women entrepreneur is a fairly recent phenomenon which has only receive d concentrated attention since the 1970's. Earlier in the 19th and 20th century the \"romanticist \" version of the woman dominated which located her proper sphere in the home and held her nature to encompass domes ticity, selflessness, submissive ness, purity and piety (29). Aldrich, et al (1) suggest that women are more likely than men to have access to a limited range of jobs, be shunted to jobs with little chance of pr omotions to positions of significant responsib ilities and to experience tokenism in upper level jobs. Since women are expected to be more \"caring,\" \"self -less\" and \"passive,\" they are more likely to be tied to the family, have limited work opportuniti es and have interrupted careers. When one also considers the \"tokenism\" of women represented in executive positions, it is no small wonder that women turn to entrepreneurship with its enhanced freedoms as a career. In a more recent ar ticle Berlin and Johnson (3) describe the traditional woman's lot to \"preserve the simple virtues, nurture her chil dren, and soothe her husband by providing him with a haven from the heartless world of industry and commerce\" (3, p. 80). They contend the modern reconstitution of the woman question was to make \"romantic woman\" into a female version of \"ec onomic man.\" \"All of the traits of nurturing and domes ticity that had previously been viewed as constituting the essential nature of woman were now seen as products of bad socialization that needed to be undon e, leaving her free to 'do her own thing,' e.g. dress for success, climb the corporat e ladder, be assertive, and take respons ibility only for herself\" (3, p. 80). The woman has sought out an independence and autonomy based on the concept that she is responsible to herself first in a maturation process that empha sizes growth and development. Given the growth in numbers of women entre preneurs it is safe to sa y that amon g them are a substantial number with independence-related characteristics. In fact, Sexton and Bowman-Upton (37) f ound that females scored significantly higher on autonomy scales than men, util izing a modified Jackson Personality Inventory and Personality Research Form E test instrument. They concluded that growth orient ed females tended to prefer ve ntures that provide new and different experiences with fewer restri ctions. Other studies suggest similar levels of autonomy between women and men entrepreneurs (18; 21; 9; 17). More recently, Reynold and Miller fou nd \"autonomy/independence\" to be the major personal objective (44%) when comparing it to \"challenge/pursue idea \" (22%) and \"income/estate for family\" (20%) among white females. These data were quite similar for minorities and white males in Minnesota and Pennsylvania. Hisrich (23) suggests that in contrast to men, women entrepreneurs tend to be motivated by inde pendence and achievement aris ing from job frustration where they have not been allowed to a dvance and perform at a higher managerial level in spite of their capabilities. The concept of autonomy or independence suggests some ki nd of detachment from indi vidual's or groups around the woman entrepreneur. This detachment can take place at several stag es in the development and 'career life-cycle of an individual. The first detachment can take place during adolescence and young adulthood when the young girl separates herself from her family and establishes her own identity. The second detachment may take place on her job as she recognizes that she needs to have more control over her destiny in her career and may leave a confining and limiting position. The constraints upon her autonom y are often a motivating factor in starting her own business. Miller (33) and Gilligan (15) stress th e centrality of affiliation and interper sonal connections of women which they contrast with autonomy, suggestin g that they are at different poles conflicti ng with each other. By dichotomizing them, they suggest that autonomy has no meaning for women but is something beneath them, beyond them or unnatural to them. This is the view of \"hostile autonomy\" (3) which reflects uncaring disconnection and as the degr ee of hostility increases, oblivious insensitivity, neglect and abandonment. On the other hand, \"f riendly autonomy\" represents respectful recognition of the interests and abilities of the other and th e self. Expressions of autonomy may lead to isolation, but not necessarily if the person works to keep the lines of co mmunication open, i.e. a person can still be autonomous. In fact, Berlin and Johnson contend that ignoring autonomy can subvert relati onships by eliminating their free, generous giving and receiving aspects. Lack of autonomy can be harmful to relatedness in unders coring the absence of both freedom and warmth when care giving takes pl ace from a submissive position. The Autonomous Hispanic Woman Entrepreneur The concept of autonomy by itself is rather meaningless without identifying and documenting its context. This study therefore attempts to identify those contextual factors which modify or are modified by the level of autonomy of women entrepreneurs. In short since single trait analysis is inadequate by its elf, it must be buttressed with a variety of variables to see how autonomy works in conjunction with these. The variables include a variety of demographic, psychological attitudinal items, small business problems and a variety of info rmation sources utilized by the woman entrepreneur. The model was tested among white women in a large industrial city. As a control for the major contextual variable of culture, the same model was tested among a group of Hispanic wome n entrepreneurs from the same city. The Hispanic women have been exposed to different culture and socialization backgrounds. This design is intended to demonstrate that cultural forces im pact differently within the two gr oups as they relate to autonomy. Hispanic women had a slightly lower au tonomy score (13.35) than non-Hispanics ( 15.09) but were not considered to be significantly different from each other. Differences were expected to show up in behaviors and attit udes related to the autonomy variable which represented the divergent cultural factors to which the groups were exposed. The research questions are: \"Are there significant di fferences in the factors which correlat e with autonomy in different cultural settings?\" \"What is the impact of entrepre neurial autonomy in two cultural settings?\" The concern in this study is more with finding hypotheses that can be furt her tested in greater detail taking into consideration cultural and contextual variables rather than te sting particular hypotheses as the final result. In this study the primary set of cultur al values which might be expected to modify relationships among selected variables and autonomy relate to the stil l predominant traditional role of women. This traditional role is not unique to any particular culture; at an earlier time man y, if not most, U.S. women were stron gly influenced by these more narrowly -structured traditional mindsets. In any case, it is postulated that U.S. Hispanic women en trepreneurs will be more likely to be influenced by the following cluster of cultural predispos itions which, in turn, would lessen the relationship with autonomy: - Dependence on others for support. - Deference to ma les - especially macho ma les; subservience. - A re luctance to disagree. - Acceptance of authority and the status quo. - Accommodation to exis ting arrangements. - Interdependent with others for support. - Focussed on th e primacy of the family The impact of these cultural forces will be discussed in the analysis of results. Individual and Contextual F actors Related to Autonomy The model of the autonomous women entrepreneur is broken into two parts: 1) those factors which contribute to autonomy, and 2) those factors which are affected by autonom y, as shown in Figure 1. Charact eristics which contribute to autonomy were chosen based on the fact that they are relatively stable, inhe rent and not necessarily under the control of the woman entrepreneur. Factors bein g affected by autonomy were chosen on the basis of outcomes of a series of entrepreneurial behaviors. These include d the frequency of small business problem s which the entrepreneur often had a direct hand in creating, controlling and solving. The second set of factors affected by autonomy was the selection of informat ion sources which were made under the deliberate control of the entrepreneur. It was felt that the entrepreneur had a grea ter freedom of choice and was able to enact some discretionary behavior on the formation, identification, anal ysis and outcomes of these variables, i.e., they were less \"given\" and \"inevitable\" than the initia l factors which predict the occurrence of autonomy. Of the demographic variables, age and e xperience in the field are expected to be positively related to autonomy. As the women entrepreneur gains success and a heightened sense of achievement her options become more numerous. Her independence is enhanced as she is able to pick and choose from a variety of business projects from which she is able to identify the \"plums\" based on her expertise and experience. As she adds more employees, she is in a position to free herself from delegatable tasks and is ab le to focus on activity where she is able to exercise her discretion. However, adding additional family members to her staf f may constrain or limit he r autonomy especially if th ey feel that they have \"earned\" the right to influence the entrep reneur. Therefore, it is expected that there is a negative relationship between the number of family members work ing in the business and autonomy.

These are elements that allow the woman to work hard, take some calculated chances and mani pulate herself into a well res pected position of accom plishment and achievement. Once in this position, she can regard herself in a positive light in her own mind and does not require others to reach her goal. In fact, she may shy away from adulation and honors from the outside because she has already proven her selfworth to herself. As a result, she insulates herself from others and does not seek them out for affiliation. As a se lf contained unit, the entrepreneur is not beholding to anyon e and is confidant that her way of solving problems is the best. In fact, she ma y distrust others as being less competent, resourceful and envious of her success. Thus, it would be expected that ther e is a negative relationship be tween both need for affiliation and trust with autonomy. The prof ile of this entrepreneur is thus of an experienced woman who has worked hard and made something of herself and is now mi strustful of others who may want to at tach themselves to her. She resists relationships and remains independent. Autonomy may also be the source of some problems that the woman entrep reneur encounters. Being somewhat autonomous may be associated with a lower need to co mmunicate with employees w ho may become resentful and develop poor employee attitudes. If the entrepreneur doe s not communicate with her em ployees and spell out her expectations in terms of te lling them how to do their job, problems of training and development may arise. The entrepreneur may feel th at she is independent or aloof from her employees and insulates herself from them. This lack o f communication and information sharing can also lead to coordination problem s and heavy operating expenses. Being small and relatively independent, the entr epreneur may be unwilling to cooperate with other ow ners to take advantage of economies of scale in purchasing larger lots at lower pr ices. Her independence thus prev ents her from entering into these cooperative arrangements. Overall, a positive relati onship is expected between autonomy and the frequency of these problems described. Being more detached and insulated from others, the autonom ous entrepreneur will most li kely not be receptive to various information sources available. She may be satisfied with her curren t method of operation and outcomes and reject these information sources as an interference or dist urbance to her peace of mind, fre edom or mode of thinking. Methodology Three-hundred and thirty-three (333) non-Hispanic women busine ss owners who were memb ers of a large business women's organization, were surveyed, and 150 responded (response rate - 45%). Minor omissions on the returned questionnaires reduced the number of usable responses to 128. A variety of types of businesses in a large midwestern city were surveyed, including retail, distri butor/wholesaler, manufacturing, and service. Fifty-five Hispanic women entreprene urs were administered the questionnaire in person. Thirty-one of those were preceded by structured and unstructured in terviews and six of the respondents to the questionnaire were also included in a focus group. These additional research activities were conducted to explore th e business environment and cultural background of Hispanic entrepreneurs in greater detail to provide additional insight and understandi ng in the interpretation of the analysis of questionnaire data. The means of demographic variables for the two samples are shown in Table 2. The profiles of the two sample groups are remarkably similar with respect to age and experience in the same field. However, non-Hispanics have on the average a higher level of education and more years of busin ess. In both groups fifty perc ent of the entrepreneurs had fathers who were entrepreneurs, while the Hispanics had a higher proportion of en trepreneurial mother s. Hispanics also had a higher proportion of ownership, but lower ratio of family members (full time) in the business. The ratio of family members in the business part-time and the ratio of family members in the business is about equal in the two groups. More employees were added and dropped in the non-Hispanic firms indicating a higher level of mobility but not necessary grow th and development. Percent of equity in bot h samples is very high and about equal. In summary there are general similarities in the two samples, but with large differences in some of the contextually driven relationships. The key variable \"autonomy\" was measured using five indicators to form a scal e. These indicators were developed by Steers and Braunstein (40) and have an Alpha Cronbach of .699. Since the emphasis in this paper is on how autonomy itself is differentially imp acted in two cultural settin gs, other psychological variable s were measured using only individual item indicators. This hel ped to insure sensitivit y to the cultural values that im pact on autonom y. In contrast, macrolevel variables focus on ps ychological variables per se. The sources of th ese micro-level scales (indicators) is as follows: Risk taking Self-e steem (2) Affiliation (40) Perseverance (19) Trust (28) Machiavellianism (10) Small business problems were identified primarily from an analysis of 300 cases counseled in a Small Business Institute as well as from the business literature (14; 20; 41; 42). The sources of information utilized by entrepreneurs were identified by the authors. These sources were categoriz ed as follows: consultants, vendors, personal, association, catalog, newspaper, magazine, and government institutions. The Statistical Package of the Social Sciences was used in analyzing the data (1988). Results Surprisingly, opposite results occurred between the Hispanic and non-Hispanic women (see Table 3). The predicted relationship held for Hispanic wome n (older/more autonomous) but not fo r non-Hispanic women. The younger women among non-Hispanics apparently feel more freedom and au tonomy. Respect for age may be more prevalent in the Hispanic culture. Similarly, less experi enced non-Hispanic women feel more au tonomous, i.e., they may have more choices and alternatives careerwise than their more experi enced counterparts. As Hispan ic women add more employees and family members to their business, they experience more autonomy. The Hispanic entrepreneur is in a position of enhanced autonomy now that additional hum an resources are at her disposal, ev en if they are family members.

Perhaps this schedule allows them to do other things and enjoy additional a dvantages. Non-Hispanic women who often beco me wrapped up in their work feel more autonomous perhaps because they chose to become more engro ssed in this manner, i.e., they love their work and pursue it as a matter of personal choice. All three risk-taking indicators were positively related to autonomy for non-Hisp anics, whereas only one indicator of the Hispanic women was significantly related. This indicates th at non-Hispanics are in a position to take more risks and the Hispanic woman will be cared for by her family upon retir ement and does not need to make such provisions early in her career. A stronger relationship existe d between feelings of adequacy and aut onomy among Hispanic women. Their variety of experiences undergone in a strange and new country have allowed them a ri ch and varied response to new situations. In contrast, the more autonomous non-Hispanic women need to prove their worth and excellence. Th is may be due to acceptance of the norms of the more competitive culture in which th ey have chosen demonstrate their competence. Non-Hispanic women do not activel y seek help from others and believe th eir own way is best. This indicates an emphasis on self-reliance as a method of attaining autonomy and independence. These relati onships were not verified for Hispanics, probably demonstrating a st ronger need to affiliate based on their more socially oriented culture. Non- Hispanics further demonstrate their det achment by a lack of trust in others and by their unwillingness to let relatives know what they are doing. These relationships hold for both Hispanic and non-Hispanic autonomous entrepreneurs. Finally, Non-Hispanic autonomous entrepreneurs believe that people do not wo rk hard unless forced. This relationship did not hold for Hispanic entrepreneurs perhaps due to a cl oser-knit relationship between entrepreneurs and workers. The only small business problem with a positive relationship with autonomy was coordination of activities (see Table 4). Three other problems were negatively related to autonomy (only for non-Hispanic women). In the case of Hispanic women, fewer training and development problems result ed from autonomy, indicati ng stronger ties between entrepreneurs and workers despite thei r autonomy. They may have a strong sens e of responsibility to train their employees. In terms of the consequences of autonomy, the more au tonomous the non-Hispanic wome n entrepreneurs, the more they tend to avoid the use of information sources (all of ei ght relationships with information categories are significantly negative as shown in Table 4). In contrast, among Hi spanic women entrepreneurs, only one relationship was significant. Apparently, the no n-Hispanic's high need for autonomy implies either the desire to demonstrate an independence from traditional sources or th e lack of a perceived need to use such sources. In the case of Hispanics, they are presumably willing to use these sources based on their cultural patterns of accepting more traditional institutions while maintaining their autonomy. These patterns are further demonstrated in Table 5, in which there were 29 of 34 inverse significant Pearson correlations between autonomy and speci fic information sources for non-Hispani c women entrepreneurs. At the same time, of 33 relationships shown for Hispanic women entr epreneurs, five are significantly negative and three significantly are positive. Also, it should be noted that among Hispanics, there is positive correlation with reading the Wall Street Journal. The autonomous Hispanic women entrep reneurs also have a very strong inverse correlation with the use of the Internal Revenue Service as an information source. Neither of these correlations holds for the non-Hispanics. Implications for.Small Business Development Administrators The results of this study emphasizes a well-known general observation among smal l business administrators, but one which is frequently overlooked in designing such services; na mely, entrepreneurs differ ma rkedly in their acceptance and use of small business informa tion and assistance services. For example, in the case of non-Hispanic autonomous women entr epreneurs it is easy to se e that information services do not play a very important role in thei r external assistance needs. While furthe r investigation of th ese findings are in order to determine the causes, this type of finding i ndicates the following measures could be helpful: 1) Surveys of potential users of small business services should include analys is of preferences and previous utilization patterns and their relation to various entre preneurial t ypes. 2) Alternative \"packaging\" and \"delivery systems\" to interface with different type s of entrepreneurs should be tried on a pilot basis. 3) The effectiveness of various liais on personnel with various entrepreneurial types should be measured and evaluated. 4) The degree of acceptance (or rejecti on) of traditional norms, at titudes and behaviors is a key factor. The more an entrepreneur rejects tr aditional modes of doing business, the more it may be necessary to consider new methods of communication and support system design. These and similar cons iderations will be incorporated in future studies by the authors.

FRANCHISING: AN EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT Robert T. Justis, Louisiana State University Gary J. Castrogiovanni, Louisiana Stat e University Peng S. Chan, California State University - Fullerton ABSTRACT Franchising, as an American busines s method, has become the most rapidly growing method of doing business throughout the world today. Franchising, as an educational opportunity, is just beginning to develop in the United States. This article reviews the opportuniti es and methodologies available to teach fr anchising at the collegiate level. INTRODUCTION Franchising, as a method of doing business, is growing rapi dly throughout the world. Today in the United States over 1/3 of all retail sales are developed th rough franchising organizations and this figur e is expected to rise to 50% by the year 2000. Franchising continues to grow and build as a very unique method of servin g customer needs quickly, conveniently, and economically (9). Franchising also acc ounts for approximately 20% of our Gross National Product and continues to grow and expand into new i ndustries and different areas of business. While franchising is widely known and r ecognized, it is not well understood (1). While franchising is not suitable for all types of businesses, it is appr opriate for many businesses who may easil y replicate or duplicate their business operation into new localities and geographi cal areas. Franchising is a costly, comp licated, and at times, a risky method of expansion and should only be undertaken and entered in to after thorough research and understanding of its methods and legal requirements. Franchising Education There is an opportunity for franchising education in the Unite d States. As franchising con tinue to grow and its method is adopted by more industries, students and practitione rs need to acquire knowledge and understandings of the principles and operations surr ounding franchising organizations. Franchisi ng education should be able to sweep the country in the 1990's as did en trepreneurship and small businesses in the 1970's (5). Franchising is currently taught at several major universitie s as well as small colleges. The opportunity for franchising education is readily availabl e through franchising textbooks (5) and severa l articles and pamphlet s which have been developed for franchising education. The International Franch ise Association also has a li brary of resources available for franchising education. INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISING The development of franchising cont inues throughout the world. In 1988 th ere were over 350 U.S. franchisors operating in over 32,000 outlets in many c ountries around the world (7; 8). While American franchisors continue to expand internationally into many foreign countries, there are other franchisors who are now invading the United States in the development of their franchising program, such as Fast Frame from the United Ki ngdom. Many foreign countries have found a rising demand for franchising operations becau se of a demand for quality consumer goods, services, increasing technology, improvi ng mobility, increasing disposable income , expanding urbanization, and a shift of emphasis toward servicing convenient products (11). Canada, Japan and Eur opean companies are rapidly expanding their franchising operations. There are many different ways for these firms to expand internationally including joint ventures, using master franchisors, company owned operations, and even franchising to single individuals. Many franchisors will use more than one method during interna tional expansion. The joint venture operation is probably the greatest method of expansi on currently being used. Individuals studying franchising should r ealize and understand the se rious problems associated with local customs, laws, and regulations of foreign count ries. Franchisors entering foreign count ries should generally adhere to the following three steps: 1.) obtain trademar k registration for each foreign country, 2.) deal only with the most reputable and competent companies or individuals, and 3.) review and learn about all appl icable laws (12). Many countries will limit the re patriation of monies back to a forei gn countr y as well as re quirin g local ownershi p or local workers to run and operate the business. Certain nations also will limit different businesses from foreign countr ies into their home markets (10). The international role of franchising continues to in crease in popularity and should be expected to grow even stronger in European markets with the unifi cation of the European community in 1992 (9). EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES The study of franchising is a very new and exciting opportunity for st udents to learn about one of the most remarkable methods of doing business in the United States and throughout the world. Franchising education is a close fit with other entrepreneurial studies such as small business start-up and entrepreneurial classes. The franchising experience al low hands-on opportunities fo r students to learn more about business start-ups, growth and development in the real world. The 1970's saw small business and entrepre neurial classes emerge across the na tion while students and business people cried out for help in the establishmen t and development of business endeavors. The 1980's continued with the growth of entrepreneurial courses throughout this country. Almost every business college in both large universities as well as the community college level began teaching students how to develop business plans and analyze entre- preneurial opportunities. The 1990's provide an opportunity for a new form of entreprene urial education - franchising education. It is anticipated that franchising educati on will emerge as a main focus in entr epreneurial endeavors. While franchise ownership is not designed for everyone, there are close to 3,000 franchisors a nd some half-million people who have decided to become franchisees in the United States (4). Classroom Methods The study of franchising is a very unique opportunity for stud ents. This educational experi ence provides the students an opportunity to grasp one of the fastest growing methods of doing business in the world. The franchising methodology which has been adopted by several universities throughout th e United States includes the use of a franchisor or franchisee business plan or feasibility study (see Figure 1). The business plan/fea sibility study provides the student with an opportunity to develop and analyze the proper operations of a franchising organization. The study would include the major areas of: executive su mmary, marketing, management, finance and accounting, and le gal aspects. The students should be able to incorporate and inte grate all the components of a franchising organization into th is overall plan. Figure 1 THE FRANCHISE FEASIBILITY STUDY/BUSINESS PLAN Names of Group Members Na me of Business:_________________ _____________________ _____________________ Final Grad e:_______ ____ A traditional lecture method is insufficient in teaching a fran chising course. There is a need to develop a franchising course around the business plan/feasibility study and to use different guest speakers from both the franchisor and franchisee business world. Students should be able to inquire and gather information about developing proper marketing plans, site selection, advert ising programs, promotion programs, pric ing, product/service development, sales, and management programs. Students would al so be required to develop a franchisor prospectus which could be used as an advertising tool to encour age prospective franchisees to join the franchisor's family. The business plan/feasibility study needs to also include a brief outline of the operation manuals, training manuals, sales manual, grand-opening manual, and advertising manual for the franchising operation. Students should be able to identify all the important components of these manuals, and pr ovide at least an outline form at, or a brief description of the overall operations. Students will also be required to develop organizational structures for bot h the headquarters (franchisor) operations and the entrepreneurial or indivi dual (franchisee) operations. A PERT chart need s to also be developed for the franchisor and the franchisee so that they may both understand the step s necessary to take to secu re and start the franchising operation. The finance and accounting sect ions will provide financial information fo r the both the franchisor and franchisee. Forecasted financial statements for the both the headquarters and franchisee organizations n eed to be developed with a monthly cash-flow statement indicating a three to five year projection of the sales, revenues, and expenses for the franchising operations. These forecasts should then become th e budgets for the first year of operation of the franchisor and/or franchisee. THE FRANCHISOR Franchising was originally developed to allow the franchisor to expand existing businesses in a rapid fashion. Franchising is designed to replicate or duplicate a successful enterprise in a di fferent location or setting (6). It is important, however, before the franchisor decides to franchis e that they perform a self-e valuation analyzing relative strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats involved to individuals and to the business itself. Prospective franchisors need to also determine if the company has su fficient financial support to expand and develop through the franchising method (3). A franchisor ch ecklist has been established to allow the franchisor to review and honestly perform a self-evaluation as we ll as evaluate the business opportunity (see Figure 2). The franchisor/franchisee relationship is one of the major causes for the success or failure for the franchising operation. It is important that the franchisor realize the necessity of developing a proper communi cation program with the franchisees and to provide them wi th continuous value throughout the franc hising experience. One of the major opportunities in franchising is for an i ndividual to enter into a business which has the benefit of an established product service name or a method of doing business, and where the franchisor continuously provid es on-going value or a value added for the franchisee (2). Franchisor s will continue to help their franch isees and provide improved products and services for the franchisee. Growth occurs for the franchisor and the franchisee as the franchisee increases his sales and revenues through improved se rvices and products.

The following checklist is one which has been developed to he lp beginning franchising organi zations (see Fi gure 3). This checklist is simply referred to as a parent company (fra nchisor) development checklist. This checklist has been designed to help a new franchisor unders tand the activities which they need to become involved with before actually starting the franchising operation. It is important for th e franchisor to have an attorney who is familiar with franchising and its complexities draw up these documents to insure proper compliance with the FTC disclosure rule. Future Franchisee One of the main keys to developing a successful franchis ing system is the acquisition of strong franchisees. The development of a strong franchisor/fran chisee relationship will ge nerally bring about the greatest success in a franchising operation (2). A franchising package should be develope d for the franchisee which generally includes a pamphlet containing a lot of information about the franchising operation and an application to become a franchise e. This brochure or pamphlet is a strong advertising document of the franchisor to encourage fu ture franchisees to sign the franchise agreement. If the franchisor believes the franchisee to be very interested an d appears to be a strong candidate for becoming a franchisee, then the franchisor should send them the franchise disclosure document as well as the franchise agreement so that they may know all the information relati ve to becoming a franchisee. The first meeting between the franchisor and franchisee is ge nerally considered a \"qualifying\" meeting for both parties. Durin g this time both the franchisor and franchisee are often tr ying to sell themselves to each other. The franchisor is seeking those individuals who would make a good \"fit\" within the franchising sy stem and the franchisee is looking for a franchisor with a good background a nd a strong service support system. Entrepreneurial students have a great need to be exposed to the world of franchising. Franchising has become the fastest growing method of doing business throughout the world. Franchising educa tion will provide the knowledge for both students as well as prospective franchisees about the strengths and weaknesses of developing a franchise unit. CONCLUSION Franchising education will probably beco me the entrepreneurial e ducation program of the 1990's. Franchising is the fastest growing method of doing busine ss in the United States and now th roughout the world. Educational programs have now been developed to allow franchis ing to be taught at all levels of uni versity and college involvement. Teachers and professors are joining the excite ment of franchising by providing student s with new curriculum and education opportunities through franchising courses.

Hunt, Rockhurst College David C. Adams, Marywood College ABSTRACT This paper deals with the anomaly that the Type A persona lity, characterized by strong personal drive combined with disorganized and unfocused behavior, is often highly produc tive. The research forwards a more complex personality profile of the Type A personality link ed with individual propensity toward s monitoring envir onmental cues as explaining such successful performance. Empirical data from a sample of mi dwestern small business owners support hypotheses that these are independent pe rsonality factors and businesses run by individuals high on both factors will outperform businesses run by owners wi th other personality combinations. Implications for SBI consulting are discussed. INTRODUCTION Past research has shown a positive rela tionship between Type A behavior on the part of the small business owner and success of the business as measured by return on investme nt and growth in sales re venue (Boyd, 1984). In this study, we will consider whether such results reflect simply Type A behavior, or whether there is a more complex personality cluster present, which, while it includes the Type A profile, is not solely impacted by Type A. We will also consider the implications of such a personality cluster for how we, as SB I consultants, may provide the best levels of assistance to our clients. Type A behavior is defined as \"individuals which exhibit enhanced hostility, ambitiousne ss and competitiveness, and are often preoccupied with deadlines and with work (Che sney and Rosennman, 1980). Ever ly and Girdano (1980) have identified four measure of T ype A behavior, they are: 1. Hostility - defined as a person who is excessively competitive 2. Time Urgency - defined as a pe rson who races against the clock even when it is not necessary 3. Polyphasic Behavior - defined as a person who tends to unde rtake two or more tasks simultaneously, even when it is inappropriate to do so 4. Lack of Proper Planning - defined as a person who rushes into work without first deciding on a plan to accomplish the desired task On an intuitive level, we would be hard pressed to understa nd how such an individual,, high in Type A characteristics,, could perform successfully in a business environment, ex cept through sheer effort. However, there may be an additional mitigative personality factor that makes sense of this seeming contradiction. A personality factor that has been posited as critical to th is personality/environment intera ction is the recognition that individuals may vary significantly in th eir level of reaction to the various messa ges or signals that the outside world sends them. Individuals characterized as \"high self -monitors\" are very sensitive to these environmental cues and adjust their behavior according to the expectat ions of their relevant external environment; in contrast, individuals characterized as \"low self-moni tors\" are often oblivious to these external data and therefore tend to maintain similar patterns of behavior irrespec tive of situational demands (Snyder and Campbell, 1982). Since responsiveness to external demands is an important contributing factor to business su ccess, (i.e. without satisfie d customers there is little likelihood of survival) we would hypothesize that \"high self-monitors\" will be more likely to lead their businesses to higher performance levels than will \"low self-monitors\". In terms of our roles as SBI consultants, we will likely find significant difference s in terms of the degree of inherent receptivity of our clients as a function of \"hi gh\" versus 'low self-monitorin g\". We ma y have to make si gnificant adjustments in the ways that we de al with these different people. Is there a possible interaction effect between Type A and \"high/low self moni toring\"? If the highly driven Type A individual is also sensitive to the outsi de world, it is quite possible that the bus iness person will be higher on hostility, polyphasic behavior, and time urgency due to a recognition of more relevant exte rnal factors to deal with. However, such an awareness may sensitize this individual towards pla nning, which is contrary to the Type A profile. It appears that a mixture of Type A and high self- monitoring behavi ors might prove to blend into a combination that would enhance performance. Hypothesis to be Tested Hypothesis 1:Companies run by individuals who are high on Ty pe A characteristics will outperform companies run by individuals who are low on Type A characteristics. This hypot hesis is consistent with previously reported findings (Boyd, 1988). Hypothesis 2:Companies engaged in high er levels of internal performance evaluation will outperform companies engaged in lower levels of performance evaluation. Hypothesis 3:There will be a significantl y higher level of internal performance evaluation ut ilized by companies run by individuals who are high on Type A charact eristics as compared to companies run by individuals who are low on Type A characteristics. If hypothesis 1 and 2 are supported and this hypothesis is not supported, this would suggest that the strong possibility of an additional explan atory variable for predicting success. Hypothesis 4:Individuals who are high on Type A characteristics will be more likely to be \"high self monitors\" than will individuals who are low on Type A characteristics. The hypothesis is forwarded to te st the degree of independence of the two personality variables. If th is hypothesis is rejected, this suggests that they are independent personality factors. Hypothesis 5:Companies run by individuals who are \"high self - monitors\" will e ngage in higher leve ls of internal performance evaluation than will companies run by individuals who are \"low self-moni tors\". This is consistent with the theoretical discussion. Also, if Hypothesi s 3 is not supported and this hypothesis is supported, this suggests that \"high selfmonitoring\" may be a si gnificant factor in explai ning company performance. Hypothesis 6:Companies run by individuals who are \"high self - monitors\" will out perform companie s run by \"low sel f monitors\". This will especially reflect itself in terms of the trend in the cha nge in performance from one year to the next. Hypothesis 7:Companies run by individuals who are both high on Type A and high on self-monitoring will be more likely to engage in internal performance evaluation than will companies run by individuals who are high on only one of these; in turn, the lowest level of inte rnal performance evaluation will be in those companies run by individuals low on both Type A and self monitoring. Hypothesis 8:Companies run by individuals who are high on bot h Type A and self-monitoring will be more likely to out perform companies run by individuals who are high on only one of these; in turn,, the lowest level of company performance will be in those companies run by i ndividuals low on both Type A and self-monitoring. Hypotheses 7 and 8 merge those individua ls who are high on Type A's and \"low self-monitors\" with those who are low Type A's and \"high self-monitors\". We will also test if there are significa nt differences in company performance between these groups. If such differences are found, this woul d suggest that one or the ot her of the two personality variables plays a more dominate role. METHODOLOGY To test our hypotheses, we utilized a questionnaire previously developed fo r a study of Canadian business owners (Adams, 1988). A stratified (by type of business), random sample of 1000 small busin esses in the Kansas City area was generated b y Sorkin's Director y (a private com pany that s pecialized in maintainin g a com puterized, current comprehensive directory of businesses in several major cities). Questionnaires were mailed to this sample; 211 responses were received with 165 judged as usable. our respondents averaged 25.3 employed, with a range from 1 to 101. A comparison of the response rates for various types of businesses with their prevalence in the original sample shows that the responses are reasonably re presentative of the initial sample. Prevalence in Type of Business initial sample ------------------- ----------------- ------------- Retail 16% Wholesale 13% Construction 10% Manufacturing 16% Service 45% Prevalence in usable Type of Business responses ------------------- ----------------- Retail Service 52% The measures used in this study are as follows: (1) Type A/B - questions originally de veloped by Everly & Girdano (1980) meas ured the 4 submeasures (time urgency, hostility, polyphasic behavior and lack of planning). An overall Type A/B scor e was generated (range = 0-14), with higher scores indicating stronger tende ncies towards Type A behavior. (2) \"High/Low self-monitor\" traits - Respondents were asked fi ve (Likert scale) questions dealing with the degree to which they monitor both the behavior of their customers and competitors. The five responses were combined into a standardized score for each respondent. (3) Internal Performance Evaluation Res pondents were asked five (Likert scale) questions dealing with the degree to which they developed business plans a nd strategies, reevaluated existing pl ans and analyzed ongoing financial and performance data. These variables were combined in to a standardized score for each respondent. (4) Company Performance Respondents were asked to indicate the percentage increase in sales for their company for 1987 versus 1986 and 1988 versus 1987. We cr eated an additional variable compar ing these two figures to determine whether 1988 performance improvement wa s larger or smaller than 1987. The statistical analyses of th ese data included: Spearman co rrelation between variables, t- tests for differences between 2 categories of respondents, and ANOVA for diff erences between 3 categor ies of respondents. RESULTS Hypothesis 1 - partially supported A t-test comparison of company performance between comp anies run by high versus low Type A leaders showed the following: 1987 improvement High Type A 14.6% Low Type A 7.4% Stat. Signf. p<.10 1988 improvement High Type A 17.3% Low Type A 7.4% Stat. Signf. p<.01 Difference in 1988 vs 1987 improvement High Ty pe A 2.7 Low Type A 0 Stat. Signf. ns This hypothesis is supported in 1988, with partial support in 1987. It is interest ing to note that companies run by high Type A personalities not only outperform companies led by low Type A personal ities, but show an upward versus stagnant trend line (albeit the percentage im provement is not statis tically significant). Hypothesis 2 - strong partial support Correlational analysis shows that in both 1987 and 1988, improvement in company performance was positively related to higher levels of internal performance evaluati on (1987, r=.19, p<.05; 1988 r=.23, p<.0l); these findings support hypothesis 2. However, there was a negati ve correlation between the level of in ternal performance evaluation and the difference between the 1988 and 1987 level of im provement (r=-.19, p<.05), which partiall y rejects the h ypothesis. Hypothesis 3 - rejected A t-test comparison of the level of internal performan ce evaluation of companies run by high versus low Type A personalities shows no significant diff erences (1.8 versus 1.1, t=.61, ns. ) . This rejection of hypothesis 3, when combined with the results of hypothesis 1 and 2 suggest that a consideration of an additional explanatory variable is warranted. Hypothesis 4 - rejected A t-test comparison of high versus low Type A personality lead ers shows that they are not significantly different in the degree to which they are self-monitors (. 15 versus -.11, t=l.ll, ns). Thus, we are free to proceed with the assumption that Type A and self-monitoring are two i ndependent personality variables. Hypothesis 5 - accepted A t-test comparison of companies run by \"high\" versus \"low self-monitors\" shows a signifi cant difference in the level of internal performance evaluation (3. 44 versus -.33, p<.001). This stands in marked contrast to the lack of significant differences seen in Hypothesis 3. Hypothesis 6 - strong partial support A t-test comparison of companies run by \"high\" vers us \"low self monitors\" is summarized self-monitor 10.1% Lo w self-monitor 12.2% self-monitor 8.8% Stat. Signf. p<.10 Difference in 1987 self-moni tor 5.4% Low self-monitor -3.4% Stat. Signf. p<.01 run by \"high self-monitors\" made signi ficant improvements in 1988 versus 1987, while \"low self-monitors\" actually declin ed in terms of relative improvement. Th ese findings suggest that \"high self - monitors\" are making on-going adjustments to further nce their companies perfor mances, while \"low self- monitors\" may be likely to be less responsive to changing conditions, and hence the-downward-trend. Hypothesis 7 - supported ANOVA analysis shows the following results: Low on both Type A & Self- Monitoring Mean scor e on Internal Perfor mance Evaluation -1.27 High on either Type A or Self- Monitoring Mean score on Internal Performance Evaluation 2.30 High on both Type A & Self- Monitoring Mean score on Internal Performanc e SIG Evaluation 2.89 p<.05 Here we can observe that the differen ces between being low on both and high on at least one of the personality factors is far more pronounced than is the differenc e between high on one ve rsus high on both. Hypothesis 8 - strong partial support ANOVA analysis show s the following: Low on both Type A & Self- Monitoring % Impr ovement in Company Performance '87 8.16 High on either Type A or Sel f- Monitoring % Improvement in Company Performance '87 12.66 Hi gh on both T ype A & Self- Monitorin g % Im provement in Com pany SIG Performance '87 12.55 NS Low on both Type A & Self- Monitoring % Impr ovement in Company Performance '88 2.03 High on either Type A or Sel f- Monitoring % Improvement in Company Performance '88 14.66 High on both Type A & Self- Monitoring % Improveme nt in Company SIG Performance '88 18.45 p<.0l Low on both Type A & Self- Monitoring Diff erence in % Improvement 1988 vs 1987 -6.13 High on either Type A or Self -monitoring Difference in % Improvement 1988 vs 1987 2.00 High on both Type A & Self- Monitoring Differen ce in % Improvement SIG 1988 vs 1987 5.90 p<.05 These results suggest that companies run by individuals w ho are a combination of a high Type A and a \"high self- monitor\" personality profile will ul timately outperform companies run by i ndividuals high on only one of these dimensions and will definitely out perform companies run by individuals low on both of these dimensions. Companies in the latter category show a trend towa rds declining performance. It would be interesting to track these companies over an extended time frame. As discussed earlier, we also performed a t-test compar ison of the level of company performance between companies run by high Type A/\"low self-monitors\" ve rsus low Type A/\"high self-monitors\". The results of these analyses were nonsignificant, which suggest that neither personality factor is the dominant factor; rather, we can conclude that while both may play an important role by themselves, they ar e especially significant when found in combination. DISCUSSION The results of this study strongly suggest that we need to examine not only whether an en trepreneur is a Type A or Type B personality, but must also consider whether the pers on is a \"high\" or \"low self-m onitor\". The results of this study strongly suggest that individuals w ho are high on both of these personality variables will lead companies that, over time, tend to outperform companies led by individuals who are only high on one or the other, and especially companies led by individuals who ar e low on both personality factors. What we are seeing is very simple: drive combined with direct ion will result in higher levels of success than will drive without direction or direction without dr ive. It appears that the gap will like ly grow over time. The most interesting phenomenon seen in this study is that of comparing 1987 and 1988 levels of improvement. When we view the trend line from 1987 to 1988, we see the di fference between vibrant companies on the upswing and companies that are starting to stagnate. Future research might consider tr acking companies over an extended period of time (e.g. five years) to determine whether these diff erences become especially pronounced. What implications do these findings have for SBI consultants? In simple te rms, we are likely to see both high opportunity and high frustration. On the oppor tunity side, sensitizing present and pot ential business owners to the need to be aware of the messages being sent to them by the outside world will help us to help them enhance their chances of success. On the frustration side, often those with the greates t need for this advice are t hose least likely to listen. However, we may still be able to pa rtially deflect this tendency by point ing out business options such as (1) franchising, or other affiliation strategies where th e business person depends on other companies run by more externally sensitive individuals to perform this function, or (2) taking on a partner who will f ill this gap. The key to our success as SBI consultants will be to (1 ) recognize that these different personality profiles are significant in terms of business success, (2) recognize the potenti al difficulties in dealing with \"low self -monitors\", and (3) be prepared to adjust advising our methods to f it the needs of our clients.

Cook, Fort Lewis College ABSTRACT Training for many small business manufacturers represents a major capital investment in human resources. How well entrepreneurs allocate their limi ted training dollars can make or break the enterprise. This pape r proposes that small businesses account for their training cost s by employee and track revenues generate d from training by strategic training units. A \"five-star\" approach is suggested for an accounting of training related to the cust omer, statistical process and quality control, product development, manufacturing and distribution. INTRODUCTION There exists a need for comprehensive training strategies in small businesses. What ar e the hidden training costs of firing, hiring, promoting, or retiring an employee? Who knows? As one operation' s manager said, \"I don't think I want to know.\" The definition of traini ng here extends to informally organized on-the- job training, as well as formally organized programs of training. Full attention to tr aining costs by employee and revenue centers offers several direct benefits: (1) bases for adjustments to the training progr ams, (2) changes in the pricing of tr aining-related products and services, (3) more complete record of the investme nt in personnel, (4) better organizati on and operation of revenue centers. (5) coordination of training with capital i nvestments, (6) support for added compen sation to and a targeting of training costs for revenue centers and (7) retention of skill-rich employees. These benefits more than justify \"the need to know\" from an accounting perspective fo r the true cost of training. STRATEGICALLY TARG ETED TRAINING Without a strategically targeted traini ng program, a small business si gnificantly reduces its chan ces of success (2). The best trained employees quickly become obsolete at an accel erating rate as technology changes (8). Just the mandated increases in the minimum wage, implemented in 1990 and sc heduled for 1991, require that small businesses generate ever-increasing sales and profits to pay fo r these wage increases. The rising costs of benefit packages--especially health care which is projected to increase at double digit rates into the foreseeable fu ture (4)--all require grea ter profits to fund benefits. Training programs which are self-funding generate the needed re venues to pay for these programs. Yet self-funding training programs present other problems. On the one hand, traini ng which is profitable both for the company and employee increases the value of that employee to the company. On the other hand, this value-added calls for added compensation to retain ski ll-enriched employees. Top performers expect adequate merit pay, for they are most likely the first to receive lucrat ive offers from competitors. Replacing th ese \"heavy hitters\" proves at least as costly. Not only will a new hire usually comma nd a higher wage, but new hires also require orientati on and on-the-job training. With the ill-prepared group of workers who are begi nning to enter the workforce, more small businesses must invest in additional training and deve lopment to adequately prepare these workers. Moreover, for well-trained employees pay becomes a potential dissati sfier (5), particularly if training enhances the \"marketable\" skills of employees. Pickle and Abrahamson (9) make note of the dilemma faced by small busine ss owners, who must accept training as a continuous process. Cont inuous training is needed to upgrade sk ills in a changing and competitive environment. However, this training also presents empl oyees with increasingly more challenging opportunities for advancement. The alternative to skill enhancement is make-work training. To make training cost effective, small business managers must id entify their \"top performers\" in a timely manner. Part of this identification involves an accountin g for trainin g costs b y employee, rather than just a line-item ex pense on the income statement. While one might be tempted to keep deta iled records of training only on the top performers, much is sacrificed by slighting the ski ll development of other employe es. Ellig (1) points out the need for viewing employees as investments, since in the foreseeable future the number of personnel reaching working age will drop significantly. The ever present potential for dissatisfacti on with pay and/or benefits can turn even the best employee into a \"bad employee\" (7). Most any employee, once turned bad, can quickly offset the efforts of key \"top performers.\" Therefore, slighting training hurts the entire co mpany. In addition,, as Marshall and Br iggs note, \"As technology becomes more pervasive, people who want to improve their incomes and productivity must acquire le arning, thinking, and problem solving skills not traditionally a pa rt of their jobs (6, pp. 212-213). Small business owners may be lulled into a false sense of complacency by asking themselves the following question, \"If my competitors neglect training, why should I invest in it?\" That attitude ignores training strategies employed overseas by the Japanese, South Koreans, Germans and other potential competitors. Presen t-day barriers to skilled- labor movement are rapidly dissolving, as world-class companies loca te and import skill-rich employees. Just as capital moves through currency markets, so too are employees crossing national labor poole. As Marshall and Br iggs comment, \"Countries with limited physical resources, like Germany and Ja pan, have enjoyed superior economic pe rformance because they have been forced to develop their human resources\" (6, p. 211). STRATEGIC TRAINING UNITS To meet this world-class competition for skilled labor, smaller manufacturers need to establish centers of revenue creation, based on the ability of training to generate revenues. The authors refer to these revenue centers as Strategic Training Units (STU's). How does the training of personnel gene rate revenues? The answer to this question requires an assessment of one's business li nes and how training enhances productivity in these lines. An example of STU's comes from a rapidly growing manuf acturer in Monroe, Louisian a, Sunbelt Plastics. In only fifteen years, this company has grown from nothing to the largest single facili ty producing blown film plastic products in the U.S. The \"Five Star Program\" at Sunbelt is indicative of the STU approach. This program pl aces a balanced emphasis on benefits derived from customers, st atistical process and quality control, product development, manufacturing and distribution. The \"five stars\" in the progr am designate centers through which traini ng dollars generate more revenue to fund continued training and growth. Whil e each small business is unique, these fi ve-Star centers serve as a model for manufacturers wishing to grow through a stra tegically balanced approach to training. Training at Sunbelt cuts across mana gement levels, product lines and seni ority. The training function operates independently of other functional, hierar chical, departmental and strategic designa tions in the organi zational structure. What may seem as an extreme, quality assure personnel de velop skills in making customer calls and assisting with sales closings. Customer contacts even originate from exec utives discussing products and problems with operators to discussions with customer s during plant tours. Statistical process and quality control training also gene rates revenues. Close behind, a commitment to training for quality, are innovations which increase th e quantities and revenues produced. More products of higher quality mean higher revenues to cover more training. Product development training gene rates product innovations in quality assurance, customer sales, operator insights, and even in training decisions themselves. As the head of R&D surveys the shop floor from his office overlooking the plant, product devel opment training continues as an integral, nearly indistinguishable component, of the ma nufacturing process. Production and trai ning blend in such a way that new product development training almost seems to function as a training program. Sustainable revenue generation also orig inates from other training closely ti ed to the manufacturing process. The blending of scheduling, inspections and operations afford s unique opportunities for on-t he-job training and revenue generation. Training affords person nel at all levels learning op portunities not traditionally in corporated into their work. These learnin g opportunities also re quire em ployees to develo p problem solvin g skills not t ypically a part of their jobs. For example, product delivery presents endless opportuni ties: Who knows what drivers may learn while delivering products? What if a purchasing agent expresses an interest in other sunbelt products? Do es the driver know how to respond to the customer's needs? ACCOUNTING FOR STRATE GIC TRAINING UNITS Will the driver ignore the comments, brush off the customer , or in the attempt to avoid problems say, \"I don't think I want to know\"? Accounting for costs and revenues has revealing outcomes. Perhaps, distribution is not taken seriously as a distinct STU. Treated as a stepchild, no one can identify reve nues associated with TABLE 1 TRAINING LEDGER CARD 2,000 \u00b3 6 mos. besides \"safet y trainin g.\" Accountin g by STU identifies those areas either lacking or over-endowed in training-related revenues. Not yet addressed is the possibility of losing top performers. Facing issues of compensation imbalance and inequities requires an accounting for training costs by employee. While the STU is the unit of revenue generation, the employee is the unit of training and training costs. A ledger of training costs looks similar to a fixed asset ledger. Does this mean that employees are no better than mach inery? Hardly. It does mean, however, th at employees and training costs in a training ledger receive the same attention as would an e xpensive piece of machinery in a fixed asset ledger. The procedure suggested, here, is an simple but workable approa ch to bringing equal attenti on to both capital investment and skill development essential for orga nizational growth (1). The costs per em ployee of formal and informal training can easily approach or exceed capital in vestment in machinery per employee. THE TRAINING LEDGER Spreadsheet programs such as LOTUS allow a two-dimensional accumulation of training costs by employee and STU. A basic ledger card demonstrates how si gnificant even a conservative estimate of training costs can be. A hypothetical forklift operator at Sunbelt, Joseph Spul erra, exemplifies how rapidly training costs accumulate. As Table 1 shows, these costs include a merit raise of $1/hour on June 30, 1989. Conservative ly, these costs accumulated to almost $60,000 in his first 17 months of employment. TABLE 2 SHORT-AND LONG-TERM MON ETARY EFFECTS OF TRAINING MONETARY BENEFIT SHORT-TER EFFECTS LONG-TERM \u00da\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4 \u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c2\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4\u00c4 could describe each entry on the ledger, amounts left off the ledger are of gr eater impact. The costs of interviewing prospective employees is not allocated. Recruitm ent costs are significant when the wages of interviewers are included. The costs of replacing employees can become formidable for small business owners. On the average, companies spend $1,668 to hire office workers and $887 to hire production workers (3). In Table 1, straight-line amortization of these hiring and training costs for 1988 and 1989 probably unders tates the real costs. In practice, the value of training decays in keeping more with the double-declining balance method, which would approximately double the annual costs for 1988 and 1989 (8). Using the double-declining convent ion, STU revenues may not cove r training costs in the in itial years. Present value analysis by STU of revenues and costs would enable small business managers to select training programs based on anticipated financial returns. One might think only sel f-funding training programs should remain. But not so. Another costs not shown on the ledger is the costs of customer dissati sfaction and lost sales if em ployees are poorly trained. CONCLUSION Assuming then that small manufacturers are willing to account for training by em ployee and STU, what might be some short-term and long-term objectives of training programs? The \"bottom line\" objectives would seem to be training which monetarily benefits both employer and employee. Tabl e 2 shows how companies can be at odds with their own employees without a carefully orchestrat ed training program. In the short-term (row 1, column 1) training margins mi ght contribute to current o perations but be inade quate to fund raises. In the lon g-term (row 1. column 2 ) a com pany-takes-all-approach covers expenditures for new technologies, but does not have f unds to adjust prior year compensation for inflation. Employee earnings erode. Small businesses under this scenario are technology rich and employee poor. Under the short term with the employe e takes-all approach (row 2, column 1) training margins only cover current employee raises. Management must find additional capital or erode its current position to fund operations. In the long- term (row 2, column 2) if employees ta ke all, training margins only fund wage in creases to cover inflation. Worse yet, training generates little or no money for purchasing the new equipment and tools needed by personnel to use their new- found skills. The goal of maximizing traini ng benefits through STU accounting should be in the mutual interest of both small business owners and their employees. Why leave these benefi ts to chance? By using training ledgers for costs and revenue analysis, managers could make present value project ions of future revenues and training costs by STU. As these projections of training ma rgins materialize, both short-term and long-term benefits are realized (Table 2, row 3): (1) Short-term, training generated funds compensate employe es for performance-based increases in skill levels. (2) Short-term, training margins provide f unds to cover current operating costs. (3) Long-term, margins from training allow wagesto increase for inflation. (4) Long-term, training enable s small businesses to purchase or leverage the equipment needed by employees to use their training. This accountability for a stra tegically viable training progr am reveals financial realitie s previously hidden from view. Understandably, then, small business owne rs and personnel/human-resource managers might still say, \"I don't think I want to know.\" But having said this, the benefits to manufac tures and their employees more than justify the added work of accounting for these training margins.

THE LEADERSHIP EQUATION: HOW THE SBI CAN HELP SMALL BUSINESS REGAIN ITS COMPETITIVE EDGE Michael D. Ames, California State University, Fullerton ABSTRACT This article discusses the conference theme and concludes th at leadership is at the core of what we refer to as \"competitive edge.\" The author argues th at, perhaps, the single most important thing that Small Business Institute directors can do to help restore the competitive edge of Am erican small business is to t each leadership as well as management. This article explores the elements of the leadership equation, and expresses it as 25 practical tips concerning how to lead. It recommends a mini-bookshelf of seven works on leadership that can be added to an Institute's small business library for less than $150.00. This article ha s been abridged due to sp ace limitations. A copy of the complete article is available from the author upon request. INTRODUCTION We live in an era of economic challenges. It is an age of increasingly scarce resources and world markets. Enterprises face increasingly fierce comp etition not only from down the street but from enterprises halfway around the world that have access to cheaper labor , less expensive raw material s, or better technology. In the 1950s and 1960s Americans made about one-quarter of all the manufactured goods in the world market. (16, pp. 5-6 and 24-26) Then our competitive edge started to slip. En tire product areas that used to be dominated by American industry are now challenged by foreign produ cers. Our trade deficits are now enor mous. Our domestic deficits are also. What can we do, as SBI directors, to help turn this situat ion around? What is the single mo st important thing that we can do to improve our counseling efforts and help restore the competitive edge of our small business client base? The focus I recommend is teaching leadership. CHALLENGES FOR THE 1990'S AND BEYOND As with any complex situation, many factor s can be argued to have contributed to the slippage in the United States' competitive edge. Still I suspect our main challenge for the 1990's and beyond may be found in the words of in the words of Gerald Marks, Robert B. Reich and Malcolm Baldrige. (16, p.24-25) Marks said, \"When the Un ited States sobers up to th e situation, more Americans will realize that our trade deficit had been Made in Amer ica ... Business executives and politicians shout for a level world playing field. But that is no substi tute for playing the game better.\" Reic h said. \"The soluti on lies within us. If foreigners can do something better and more cheaply, we ought to learn to do it as well. If our competitor s are willing to sacrifice... for the future, then we had better make similar s acrifices if we hope to stay in the game. \" Finally, analyzing the slippage in the United States' competitiv e edge, Malcolm Baldrige conc luded, \"We were simply out managed. There is no excuse for that, and there is no one to blame but American management.\" IS MANAGEMENT WHAT IS LACKI NG, OR IS IT LEADERSHIP? Small business owners are obviously the t op managers for their businesses and th e SBI program has been dedicated to improving the management skills of entrepreneurs, present and future. In th is sense we have been dealing with the issues raised by Marks, Reich and Baldrige fo r some time. But can we improve our focus? We need to move beyond the skills commonly taught in core c ourses in business schools. Important as these skills are, we need to redirect our focus towards the essential ingredie nt required to put these skills to work -- leadership. As Warren Bennis and Burt Nanus have expr essed it, \"The problem with many organi zations ... is that they tend to be overmana ged and underled. There is a profound difference between mana gement and leadershi p, and both are important. \"To manage\" means \"to bring ab out, to accomplish, to ha ve charge of or responsibility for, to conduct.\" \"Leading\" is \"influencing, guiding in di rection, course, action, opinion.\" The distinction is cruc ial. Managers are people who do things right, and leaders are people who do the right th ing. The difference may be summ arized as activities of vision and judgement -effectiv eness versus activities of managing r outines -- efficien cy.\" (2, p.21). As SBI directors, we can know what Benni s and Nanus mean. In our dealings with our case clients over the years, we have seen repeatedly that good management is needed to make a small business efficient; but, above all, good leadership is needed to make it succeed. Leadership is at the core of what we refer to as competitive edge. The SBI program will definitely in crease its impact if each of us teaches leadership as well as management. IS THERE EMPIRI CAL EVIDENCE? Do our students and our clients need lead ership education? There is a considerable body of evidence that suggests they do. First it is clear that something is not working. Small Bu sinesses fail frequently. For example a recent study funded by the Small Business Administration indica tes that 37.3 percent of small businesses survive the first six years after start- up. (17,pp.24-25) In this fiercely competiti ve age, we cannot afford a 37% su ccess rate. The SBA and the SBI must continually improve efforts to strengthe n the small businesses that form a vita l part of our economic system. We know action is called for, but is leader ship education a top priority? Research on reasons for small business fail ures hints at inept leadership, but us ually cites poor management as a prime reason for failure. (20) Of ten it is not clear from these studies wher e poor management ends and poor leadership begins. This means one must view this body of literature inc onclusive simply because a clear distinction has not been made between effective management and ef fective leadership. Making this distinct ion is not all that easy. Required are elaborate, expensive, and interview-intensive research designs which must address a population reluctant to reopen fresh wounds. It is not surprising that the results of busin ess failure research isolates mismanagement factors and only raises strong suspicions a bout leadership factors. Research on what it takes to be a succe ssful small business owner also suffers fr om a lack of clear distinction between management and leadership. Fort unately, there is one big difference. Everyone seems eager to talk to the successful to try to learn the secrets of their success, and the successful enjoy talking about how they became successful. As a result the popular press is full of success storie s with titles like, \"Tips from the T op,\" \"Today's Leaders Look to Tomorrow,\" and \"Business Lessons from Billionair e Ross Perot.\" (3, 18, and 13) While an ecdotal, many of th ese articles are painstakingly compiled from extensive interviews. And what do the highly successful tell us? Their message is that effective leadership is critical to success. I suspect that serious researchers of small business failure a nd success already have the empiri cal evidence to prove that effective leadership is at the core of competitive edge. All th at is required is a different pe rspective -- a reanalysis of raw data already collected by car eful research designs, this time with leadership in mind. This reanalysis, combined with new studies designed to separate management factors from leadership fa ctors, will probably confirm what successful leaders have been telling us all along. THE SPECIAL ROLE OF THE SBI IN LEADERSHIP EDUCATION Bennis and Nanus argue that business schools are focusing on the wrong thing. They feel we should be teaching the principles of effective leadership rather than simply management skills. We should be helping our business students begin the li felong process of internalizing these principles. \"The major problem is that what mana gement education does do moderately well is to train good journeymen/women managers; that is, the graduates acquire technical skills for solving problems. They are highly skilled problem solvers and staff experts. Problem solving, whil e not a trivial exercise, is far remove d from the creative and deeply human processes required of leadership. What's needed is not management education but leadership educ ation.\" (2, 219-220). By its ver y nature the SBI program has great potential for overcomin g the criticism Bennis and Nanus level at business school education in general. The dynamic, real world nature of th e student team counseling process and the tutorial nature of the instruction i nvolved are two reasons why. The SBI program can train people to be leaders in addition to training them to be managers. The vast majority of instructors involved in the SBI are good at teaching management and are aware of the need for leadership even if they have not taught it explicitly. All most of us need to do to improve our programs is to adopt a new perspective -- a new focus. We can do this by bringing the critical leadership equation to the surface duri ng the consulting process and helping our students assimilate it. THE LEADERSHIP EQUATION The first thing students and client s must realize is that the leader has a job to do just like everyone else in the enterprise. Using a systematic leadership approach improves the probability for success, just as it does for any other type of job. There are four critical steps for doing any job: PLAN, DO, CHECK, and ACT (PDCA). The steps are repeated over and over. The key point that st udents and clients must realize is that for best results, no matter what the job, you cannot just DO it. You must PLAN it first. Once you do the j ob, you must CHECK on the outcomes. Then you must ACT to better achieve the hoped for results. As the cycle of effort, analysis and improvement is re peated over and over, the job holder becomes increasingly ef fective and more competitive. The four elements of the PDCA cycle combine synergistically to create a competitiv e edge and to continuously hone it. The PDCA cycle can be defined for st udents and clients both in terms of the continuous impr ovement of work (management cycle), and in terms of what it takes to be an effective leader (leaders hip cycle). I call this latter definition the leadership equation. We need to focus on teaching the leadership equation and on how to continuously improve leadership effectiveness. The leadership equation refers to the j ob of leadership. It goes beyond mere effi ciency. It also deals with issues of effectiveness. It is a people equation. As such it may appear \"soft\" or \"impressioni stic.\" However, it can be stated in terms of practical tips which helps stude nts and clients realize its real world pow er. These tips are also useful to you because they are teachable. TWENTY-FIVE TIPS ON HOW TO BE AN EFFECTIVE LEADER I have broken down the four major elements of the leadership equation into 25 teach able tips on how to be an effective leader. I use these tips to focus student thinking on leadersh ip issues. They were derived from a number of writings on leadership. (2, 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 19) The twenty five tips are presented in Table 1. Most of the tips given in Table 1 sound pretty easy, but they are not. You can anticipate that your students and clients are going to need some-help from you as they try improve th emselves as leaders. Studying the books listed in the next section will prepare you for providi ng the help they will need. TABLE 1 TWENTY-FIVE TIPS ON HOW TO BE AN EFFECTIVE LEADER PLAN Tip #1.Decide what it is you really care about. You cannot lead anyone anyw here until you know where you want to go. Tip #2.Think big. No goal is impossible to achieve if it is really worhtwhile. All you need to do is find the right people to help you. Tip #3.Focus on giving not gett ing. Tip #4.Know the work. Ti p #5.Commit yourself. Often the actions required for accomplishing great things are quite simple. The tough part is maintaining the self-discipline to actually do them. Tip #6.Accept responsibility for accomplish ing the goal. You can always find excuses for failing, you can always find someone else to blame. Don't do it. Ti p #7.Accept responsibility for your group. You are responsible for their behavior and for their well being. Tip #8.Involve others. You don't have to PLAN, DO, CHECK, or ACT on your own. In fact it is smart not to. You can get a lot of help by asking for it. The smart leader trains all her people to be leaders. DO Tip #9.Select your people rigorously. Tip #10.Get people excited about your goal and the PLAN. Tip #11.Have high expectations for yourself and your group. Tip #12.Take charge. If you want it, you must make it happen. You must lead b y saying, \"follow me\" and settin g a good exam ple. Ti p #13.Don't just give orders and ex pect people to follow them. Tip #14.Move forward. Once you have set goals and gotten people excited about them you, must make progress. When an obstacle arises, don't stop to blame anyone , take action to get it handled. Tip #15.Keep at it. There will be problems, setbacks, disappointme nts, and failures along the way. A lot of mistakes will be made. Focus on learning from the mistakes. Encourage everyone to keep trying. Tip #16.Build lean team s that know how to do the whole job. Focus on building your team. Be picky in memb er selection. Train and cr oss train aggressively. CHECK Tip #17.Keeping score is very im portant. Tip #18.Be there. You can't CHECK and ACT prop erly if you DO by remote control. You need to be there, look and list en, and follow up. Tip #19.Have a winning attitude. No matter how bad things get, keep your mind focused on the good thin gs that will result when you and your people reach the goal. Keep up the desire to finish first. Smile and be cheerful. Tip #20.Say what you mean and do what you say. Never lie, cheat, or steal. Do not associate with or tolerate anyone who does. When you make a promise, keep it. If you are not sure you can keep the promise, don't make it. Your pe ople's promises are your promis es. You can't pick and choose who to play it straight with. Tip #21.Have a bias for action. Put things in priority order and do the most important first. Do it now! When in a crunch, remember that you will get more results with, \"r eady, fire, fire, fire\" than with, \"ready, aim, aim, aim.\" Tip #22.Give credit when it is due. Y ou cannot reach your goals on your own. Make your people feel important. Tip #23.You open the door to the future by challe nging the way things are now. Ask yourself, \"What do I believe is impossible to do in my field, but, if it could be done, would fundamentally ch ange my business?\" Ask it of everyone, over and over. Tip #24.Coach your people or replace them, but don't ignore them. If you have a worthwhile goal, it must come first. You cannot afford to have a nonperformer on your team. Don't use firing as an easy out, a cover up for the fact that you didn't do your job as a leader. If you have been a good coach then you have the right to replace when they don't work out. Tip #25.You succeed by helping others succeed. If you want to be a success you must help those around you succeed in their lives. You must coach, counsel and teach.

CONCLUSION This article has addressed the issue of how the Small Busi ness Institute program can help small business return our nation to a position of leadership in world markets. Leadership is, in my view the ke y word. It is at the core of what we refer to as \"competitive edge.\" I have argued that, perhaps, the single most important thing that Small Business Institute directors can do to help restore the competitive edge of Amer ican small business is to teach leadership, in addition to simply teaching management. Once you focus on the need to teach l eadership, you will become aware of the frequent opportunities to teach leadership occurring during the small busin ess counseling process. You will be surp rised at how easy it will become to teach valuable leadershi p lessons without being didactic or consumi ng large blocks of pr ecious class time.

Saunders, University of Central Arkansas Scott Markham, University of Central Arkansas ABSTRACT The development of facsimile technology has been rapid during the decade of the 1980's with early application toward large business firms. However, during the later years of th is decade, the emphasis change d with faster, smaller, and lower cost fax machines better meeting the needs and budgets of small business firms. This study found that a majority of small business retailers are accepting the fax system as an inte gral part of their business operation. INTRODUCTION The development of facsimi le technology has brought small business a swift method of exch anging information. Although its development for small business is still in its in fancy, its use to the small business retailer rests upon ease of implementation and has become affo rdable for small business usage during the last 2 or 3 years. The basic requirements for its use is a telephone link or (of more r ecent developments) a fax board for a personal computer. Facsimile technology (commonly refe rred to as FAX.) provides a system of sending documents, photographs, diagrams, blue prints, drawings and stat istical information to any location that has a telephone line. Purchase orders from buyers to suppliers represents a breadthrough in allowi ng the small business retailer to order merchandise on short notice and receive small lot shipments at short intervals. The relatively inexpensive cost of sending written material via fax, and receiving it in timely fashion, makes a more salient bottom line with delivery service budgets being reduced. During the last 2 or 3 years, the make rs of fax equipment have undergone a change in marketing strategy. The earlier philosophy of distributing fax systems only to large companies, (which, at the time seemed already saturated), was replaced with the development of machines targeted to the needs and budgets of smaller companies. A continuing change in technology developed fax units that are smaller, faster and sell for a lower price. A growing emphasis of marketing toward the small business retailer has found sales rapidly increasing in firms al l the way from medium size firms to \" mom and pop\" operations. In addition to the lowe r cost units, the short turnaround time has been important. What used to require a 10-day turnaround time via the mail has been cut to less than four hours via fax. The simple exchange of fax data (of a few pages) may requi re only minutes. Delivery of timely information to a designated fax machine often results in a higher degree of precision and understanding often lost when using the U.S. Mail or overnight delivery. The rapidly developing use of the fax m achine by small businesses has led to netw ork applications. Networks extend to regular supplies, branch or home offices, or a hub machine a nd relayed to another office. Such features as delay and transfer sending of data reduces cost. A network of compatib le fax machines allow the user to employ similar machines from a vendor to effect greater time and money savings by taking advantage of proprietary transmission speeds. For smaller firms sending frequent messages to remote locations, a machine with de layed operation allows the data to be sent at a later time to take advantag e of lower telephone rates. Even though you may not plan to send a high volume of faxes, you may find you'll receive many more than you ever anticipated. Already, fax ha s been linked with a voice- processing system which allows businesses to accept and send fax documents through a touch-tone phone. Besides allowing users to review voice and fax messages from remote locations, the system can forward a fax message to another machine at a specified time. New developments incl ude resident memory or memory add-ons for storage of a large number of pages. Thus, opportunities exist for me mory- to-memory transmission and data-base storage. Broadcasting capabilities, auto-dial, auto matic page feeders, and the use of pl ain paper are among th e current features requested for fax systems. Additional security features ar e on the drawing board for those who desire more private communication when faxing data from one source to anot her. Confidentiality is assu red by personal mailboxes which are password protected. Due to developing misuse of fax ma chines such as non-business users for faxing lunch orders to the deli or sending letters to relatives thousands of miles away, concerned managers will request features built into their units that will make co ntrol and tracking possible. Small business retailers are be ginnin g to acce pt the fax s ystem as an inte gral part of their business o peration. Frequently, the owner/manager of a sm all business retail firm depends largel y on the recommendations of the sales person in selecting an appropr iate fax system for their firm. Many are fi rst time buyers and purchase the fax system primarily based on price. However, the small business retailer is quick to recognize the improvement of service to the customer as a result of faster order entries and return of merchandise. The faster turn around of ordering and receiving merchandise allows the smaller retailer to maintain a smaller overall inve ntory yet provide a va ried assortment of desired goods for the customer. SURVEY This study was undertaken in trying to, determine the use of facsimile technology by small bus iness retailers. The small business retailer is fast becoming th e focal point of the marketing effort by the makers of fax equipment. A sample of 2000 retailers was randomly drawn from a nati onal list of small business re tailers. A pilot study was conducted initially in Little Rock, Arka nsas, in seeking major questionnaire def ects or biases that might adversely affect the survey results. A two-page questionnaire was mailed to the selected fi rms with a cover le tter explaining its purpose. The questionnaire contained some questions pertaining to demographic data and questions of fax equipment used by the participating small business re tailers. A total of 252 questionnaires were returned for a total of 12.6 percent. This percentage was lower than we desire d but it was felt that the wide base of the study (national in scope) reflects meaningful implications in considering us e of fax machines as well as types of machines purchased for use by the small business retailers. This study is descriptive and may or may not be a sample that is truly representative of the entire population. STUDY 1. Does your company currently have one or more fax machines?

A major step in leading to the general acceptance of fax systems by small business reta ilers was the faster, smaller, and lower cost machines. The small business retailer is becoming a focal point of the marketing effort by the makers of fax equipment with over 67 percent of the retailers now owning and using a fax system. Retailer knowledge of the types and use of fax equipment seems to be minimal with a ge neral lack of concern for a special br and of fax system. Sharp and Canon were the top companies listed in the survey. The limited number of \"times used per day\" indicate s a lack of awareness of the increasing features that are being added to the current fax sy stems. The number of \"times us ed per day\" should increase considerably during the decade of the 1990's as additional feat ures are added: i.e. delaye d sending and storage of data, review messages from remote locations, memory to memory transmission of data, auto dial, and personal \"mailboxes\" which are password protected for securi ty of confidential information. The study indicated a strong pref erence for continuing use of the fax system and probably will increase the number of fax machines per firm in the future. It is expected that with an increasing number of fax units per company in the future, an increased number of tr ansmissions will occur daily. The study revealed that few users of fa x equipment are aware of the current usage of fax equipment operated through a computer. As a computer add-on, the fax system should be availabl e at a lower cost while still providing the rapid transmission of data. The use of the fax system seems to be in its infancy when we consider the number and types of features that have been added to the basic fax system. It is antici pated that the small retailer will utilize additional fax features as they are being added to the fax systems that will result in improved se rvice to the customer while reducing inventory levels yet providing a varied assortment of goods fo r timely delivery to the customer.

SMALL BUSINESS FAILURES: A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYSIS Troy A. Festervand, Middle Tennessee State University Jack E. Forrest, Middle Tennessee State University ABSTRACT This article examines the myriad factors often cited as c ontributing to small business fa ilure. Based upon a review of the literature addressing small business failures, three general problematic area s are identified: finance, management, and marketing. Within each of these th ree problematic areas, numerous specific difficu lties are identified and examined. Building upon this three area framework, a diagnosti c checklist is presented which may be used by a small business to identify existing, as well as potential difficulties. INTRODUCTION Small businesses are vital to a strong economy. As evidence, consider that in 1980 small businesses represented 9.4 of the 9.8 million total businesses in the United States. Furthe r, small businesses annually account for approximately 40% of the U.S. gross national product (5) and 60% of the nation's work force (10). Despite their importance, many small busin esses fail each year (3). According to the Commerce Department, of every ten small businesses that are opened, seven will survive their first year, three will surviv e after three years, and only two will remain after five years (7). Given the desirability of improving ba sic understanding of and response to the problems faced by small bus inesses, the purposes of the pres ent effort are the following: 1. Review the small business fail ure literature. 2. Identify the most problemat ic causes of failure. 3. Develop a self- assessment questionnaire or checklist. LITERATURE REVIEW The causes of small business failure have been extensively documented. While a revi ew of the literature yields an array of pitfalls, it is both desirable and possible to re duce and group these problematic areas by function. Such a categorization is presented in Ta ble 1. The results of this proce dure indicate that finance rela ted difficulties appear most frequently as reasons for small busine ss failure, closely followed by manageri al problems. While important, marketing related difficulties ar e less apparent. Finance Finance related issues appear to be the number one cause of small business fa ilure with three specific sub-problems frequently contributing to small business failure. An estimated 80% of all new business fails due to under capita lization (17). The inability to secure adequate long term financing and/or the high cost of such must be regarded as a serious pr oblem. Furthermore, small firms typically require more frequent refinanci ng and are more highly leveraged, thus exacerbating the problem (4). O'Neil and Duker (14) report small busine ss firms that fail have an excessive de bt. As a result, debt management is a time consuming and expensive task. Financ ial institutions charge a higher rate to the small enterprise (i.e., 2-3 points) to compensate for the greater risk (6).. O'Neil and Duker (14) suggest that small busines s owners spend considerable effort in debt planning and developing working re lationships with financial institutions (3). Cash flow problems also proliferate. Since cash flow represents the life blood of the organization, prolonged inadequacy of such flow lowers a firm 's performance and/or leads to its de mise (8). The cash flow problem often appears to be managerially based (8; 20); management simply doe s not realize the critical nature of cash flow. Because management often tends to unde restimate start-up and opera ting costs (19), cash flow becomes a problem even before the firm opens its doors. Williams (20) suggests first achieving financial stability by developing a financial plan, even if these skills must be acquired commercially. This in cludes pre-planning overall debt structure, operating capital and accounts receivable, as the latter area tends to be problematic for small business (11). The ability to control costs contributes to small business failure. Exce ssive spending inevitably leads to financial problems, especially during periods of high inflation (9). Contributing to the cost control problem is management's fiscal irresponsibility. Manage ment either does not exercise prudent cont rol or ignores fiscal reality. The optimal strategy to follow in this situation may be \"simply to spend smarter.\" This in cludes tightening up on routine expenditures and collection procedures wh ile critically examining costs, purch ase options, and accou nting procedures (11). Management Managerial problems rank as the second leading cause of sm all business failure. Three sp ecific managerial concerns described below appear to contribute heavily to small business failure. Opening a small business requires the desire to be in business and the possessi on or ability to posses a given amount of practical skills. Unfortunately, many new owners seem to discount the value of business knowledge and/or experience. Without prior experience, trai ning or education, the new owner is normall y ill-equipped to manage a business (20). A logical skills solution is for the pr ospective owner to gain e xperience by working for someone else in a similar business. This allows the would-be enterpriser to learn something about practices and operations before setting up shop. Other alternatives include low or no-cost counseling provided by SCORE, ACE, SBDC, SBI, and others as well as the development of managerial expertise via self -study or some type of programed learning (13). Planning is critical for the small busine ss (12) to insure profitable operation (1 4). The absence of planning may leave a business operating on a day-today basis, reducing its ability to ut ilize resources. Long range planning should allow the firm to anticipate and prepare for the future better. Howe ver, unclear, inadequate or nonexistent long range planning on the part of most small businesses is usually the rule rather than the exception (3). According to Peterson and Lill (15), the keys to small business success ar e the development of managerial expertise and adherence to a master plan. They concluded that unpro fitable firms lacked goals an d clearly defined policies and objectives whereas successful firms tended to posses such di rection. It is critical for a small business to prepare and adhere to a comprehensive business plan consisting of financial, managerial, and marketing components. Unfortunately, many owners and managers ar e not willing or do not have the time a nd/or expertise to create such a tool, even though assistance in preparing planning instrument s is usually available at little or no cost. Growth planning also tends to be pr oblematic. Unplanned growth can tran sform a successful operation into an unsuccessful venture (18). By not havi ng properly considered and planned for expansion, an organization is caught unprepared (financially and managerially), often leaving the firm wi th a critically tight cash flow (8). Human resource management problems cont ribute to small business failures. A lack of qualified personnel often leaves a firm ill prepared to deal with a business' demands. Apparently, personne l costs are perceived by small business managers as being prohibitive even though the benefits offs et the cost of implementing a human resource program (16). Family members often become members of the small bus iness firm. However, family members are assigned to positions where they do not perform effect ively and represent an additional fixed cost (2). Therefore, recruiting, hiring, and retaining qualified pe rsonnel is essential for small business success (3). Marketing Marketing related problems also pose a serious threat to the small busine ss. While not as conspicuous as financial problems, failure to address marketing issues will lead to business difficult ies or failure. Three specific areas of difficulty have been identified. The product line offered should oc cupy a position of central impor tance. However, this often is not the case. The failure to cultivate and offer an attractive product line is a prime problem facing the small firm . A business may be started without adequate thought given to pr oduct line consistency. This creates de mand problems for the product and related services as well as the demand for related products (1). Another product line difficulty is the fa ilure to review product performance and mix periodically (15). Successful firms regularly evaluate and prune their product lines, elimi nating lower performing products (14). This allows them to utilize their resources more effectively via the timely addition of new products (3). Few organizations operate in a competitiv e vacuum. Therefore, failure to consider and/or plan a new firm's competitive position may result in major problems. Ma nagement often fails to recognize with whom it is competing or simply proceeds on the assumption that it has no co mpetition, or competitiveness is less intense than actually exists (3). The importance of competitive strate gy cannot be overstated. The small busin ess owner is advised to conduct a competitive audit, frequently, if not perpetually, to determine consumer per ceptions of his/her business viv-a-vis competition. Product and/or competition problems may result from inad equate market information. Because many small business owners often stake their future on their business' success, ma rket information is critical . Indeed, market information may be more important to the small firm b ecause of its sm aller resource base (11). Franklin and Franklin (7) recommended the periodic conduc t of a market analysis. This analysis should supply information pertaining to a firm's target market which is useful in the evaluation of competition, product line, and customers (3). In addition to primary research, simply listening to customer s and observing marketplace activities may prove to be invaluable sources of information. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Based upon the literature reviewed, fina ncial problems, closely followed by mana gement issues, should be of greatest concern to small businesses. Although cl osest to the customer, marketing probl ems rank third in overall failure. Examination of specific problems indicates that cash flow difficulties and the la ck of proper or adequate planning are key concerns along with human resources. Cost control failures and excessive de bt burden also are major concerns. The aforementioned problems and/or causes of small business failure are not all inclus ive. The intent of this review and synthesis is to provide the small business person with a broa d, yet specific, understanding of th e difficulties that may be encountered. Using the proposed self-admin istered checklist (see Table 2), these individuals can monitor, review or examine each area to ascertain a firm's current or projected status. In doing so, it is hoped that effective and actionable plans may result.

GIS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES Barbara Fuller, Winthrop College Darrell Parker, Winthrop College ABSTRACT Small business owners have many uses for demographic data but often do not have the background or resources to obtain and utilize this type of information. It is the purpose of this paper to a ddress the uses of business demographics that are appropriate for analysis through a Geographic Info rmation System (GIS). GIS products that address small business problems and opportunities have th e advantage of being easy to interpret by the business owner. Thus, even if the owner must purchase the GIS study, he will be able to use the information without th e assistance of external consultants. THE GIS PERSPECTIVE Small business owners account for a si gnificant portion of the economic activit y in the country. Therefore the success or failure of each business wi ll affect not only the individuals running them but also the economic condition of the city, the state, and the country of which they are a part. This paper focuses on using business demography together with computerized geographic information syst em (GIS) technology as a t ool for analyzing consumer behavior in the small business environment. The key to helping entrepreneurs is in demonstrating to them that demogra phic data can be obtained relatively inexpensively or at no cost, that it can be manipulated wi thout a high priced consultant and that the information is useful and important in making business decisions. Combin ing the business demographics with the technology of the computerized GIS technology can be used to solve many of th e entrepreneur's problems and to identify potential areas of opportunities not presently bein g utilized by small businesses. Pol (3) indicates that small business owners operate their stores substantially different from larger stores. The entrepreneur operates his or her busines s with different goals such as \" ... c ontrol of action, evidence of ownership, community recognition, personal challenge , and leadership\" (3, p. 232). His mode of operation is often considered irrational to larger businesses who opera te with one goal in mind, profit. The fact is that small businesses of ten tend to ignore business practices that are common place or normal operating procedures in larger institutions. These procedures or practices are ignored becau se many of the entrepreneurs lack the knowledge skill and/or desire to inco rporate them. Typical small business pr oblems include: 1) making business decisions on incomplete and often imprecise information, 2) a lack of expertise in many areas of busine ss, 3) a lack of regional and local information rather th an national statistics and trends, 4) a lack of familiarity with the value of demography in their business, 5) a lack of knowledge or interest in historical sale s trends or sales fo recasting, and 6) a tendency not to engage in strategic planning based on mark eting research because of lim ited financial resources and more pressing day-to-day problems (3). However, by not addressing the above issues the entrepre neurs are unable to answer many questions facing them on sales forecasting, business decline or grow th, store image, location, customer prof iles, availability of new markets, labor force supply, or demand issues (3). These questi ons can be addressed using business demography and GIS technology with relative simplicity. Th e geographic information system has been compared to a visual computerized spreadsheet (1). Thus the same information seen in the spread sheet is presented in a geographic format that is easier to read and visualize, therefore it can be absorbed more qui ckly and used effectively in making business decisions by individuals who have not been trained to analyze data. Pol (3) indicates that small business probl ems and opportunities can be classified in to five categories each of which can be addressed using a demographic perspect ive. These categories are: consumer prof iles, site selection, identification of market area(s), demand and sales forecasts, and market share estimation. In this paper site selection and identification of market area(s) are combined because they have many commonalities and rely heavily upon each other in data analysis. Each of the now four categories will be looked at in relation to business demography and utilization of GIS technolo gy to hel p small businesses answer im portant questions. Consumer Profiles Small business owners starting a new firm or ones that have been in operation for a while are interested in the characteristics of the people who buy from them now and people who might potentially buy from them in the future. They want to know why people purchase or do not purchase goods and services. There are several ways to get demographic data needed to identify customer profiles . Currently demographic and expenditure information is collected and published by th e government and other privat e agencies. These sources provide information about population size, number of hous eholds, income distribution, educational levels, age distribution, etc. They include the Cens us of Population and Housing, the Ec onomic Census, the Census of Retail Trade, Survey of Buying Power, Editor and Publishe r Marketing Guide, and Bure au of Labor Statistics. There are many ways this secondary data as well as internal company info rmation can be used by small business owners. If internal data is available it can be used to profile current customers. Info rmation from credit card holders, checks, customer lists, and buying behavi or can be analyzed and plotted on a GIS system. This will tell retailers where customers are geographically. For example, one can divide customers into good, be tter, and best categories and provide special privileges for the best. Custom ers can be identified by any demogra phic variable (such as income above $25,000) and special media messages de signed to meet their needs. If internal data are not available, then customer spotting technique s can be used such as lic ense plate surveys to find household locations by block, city, county, and state of indivi duals shopping at a particular store or shopping area. This information can then be used to construct a base of custom ers. The demographic data associated with the block, census track, or zip code of the customer can then be used to profil e the customer. This is not as accurate as having an internal data base, but it does supply small retailer s with information that is useful and th at can be collected with little time, effort, money and with no in ternal record keeping. A more ambitious retailer could survey customers asking th em demographic, psychographic, and attitudinal questions which later can be combined with purchase behavior. This would help the small business man to clarify who his strong customers were and understand th e attitudes of these i ndividuals. The survey information can easily be combined with current demographic data using GIS technol ogy to: 1) identify areas that would offe r market potential in the sense that they match the customer characteristics but are presently untapped, 2) anticipate changes in the market that may affect the customer base, 3) identify the best prospects to be place d on a direct mailing list, and 4) tailor selling messages to the best prospects needs and lifestyle. All of the above application can be mapped using GIS technology. Coverages w ith different characteristics can be made to match the needs of the business. Decisions makers can see in color and/ or symbols any particular characteristic or combination of characteristics. This visual geographic represen tation makes it easier to analyze problem areas and market opportunities. Each can be easily identi fied and dealt with in a timely manner. In the example above, different customers good, better, and best can be plotted in different colors for easy identification. High vs low income cust omers can be plotted using color and symbols. This makes analysis easy. Criteria that may have been hidden in a table or difficult to see may suddenly be sending off signals loud and clear. The data is presented in a meaningful visu al way that leads to efficient and sophi sticated analysis without the aid of a business consultant. The analysis is no longer a mystery, but instead a clear pi cture is drawn upon which decisions can be made. What may have been a missed marketing opportunities can easily be hi ghlighted on a map. The target market objectives of the business can be presented visually to employ ees at any level of the company and be easily and clearly understood. Identification of market area(s)/Site Selection These two areas are considered together since one must fi rst locate the strongest market area before deciding on the best site within these markets. Many small businesses are particularly interested in site selection because of the feelings associated with the old adage that the three most impor tant things to remember in opening a small business are location, location, and location. Some criteria that are not demographic in nature are important in site selection such as cost factors. However, demographic info rmation is essential in deciding the op timal site for a small business and the GIS s ystem can hel p in this anal ysis. The definition of a trading area is based on customer origin mapping that s hows the store's ability to attract customers. Ghosh (2) indicates that data for this mapping can be gath ered by three survey methods: 1) customer interviews, 2) customer records, or 3) license plates. By which ever method collected, the data is then plotted on a map to visually see the customer distribution. Customer orig in maps can be used for may types of analysis. Ghosh (2) outlines five applications: 1) deli neating trade areas into primary, secondary, and fringe areas, 2) discovering customer characteristics to better meet customer needs, 3) targeting advertising and promotion through th e appropriate media using the proper campaign, 4) gauging competition by identifyi ng overlaps in trading areas and oversaturated markets, and 5) planning expansion so as not to cannibalize existing stores. Each of these applications include combining business demographics with GIS t echnology to answer complex questions in a simplistic easy to dige st visual format . Trading areas can be designed by a radius out from the store based on a variety of criteria: 1) primary, secondary, and fr inge trade area definitions, 2) milage distances set in 1/2 mile, 1 mile, 1 1/2 miles, 2 miles, etc., and 3) actual drive t ime or distance to the store following the road patterns calculated and plotted on the screen through a network routi ng package. This last option would take into account the natural and man-made barriers that would effect time and distance factors and thus influence patronage. Using GIS technology, trade areas can be designated by different colors. Cust omers can be designated by different symbols depending on various characteristics. For example, the primary trade area could be blue, secondary yellow, and fringe red with circul ar symbols representing those people wi th incomes under $25,000 and square symbols representing those people with incomes of $25,000 and over. The map would then visually indicate the composition of each area by income level thus helping the store owner s ee the composition of his/her customer trade area. Other variables can be substituted for income su ch as age, education, or expenditure patt erns. In addition, these characteristics can be combined on the map for a more detailed analysis of the data. The competitive environment is a major ar ea of interest to small retailers. The map overlays of the trading area of one store with competitive stores' trading areas show areas of intensive competition in the marketplace. At times stores may have trade area overlaps from more than one competitor indicating that relocat ion or aggressive promotion may be necessary to compete in this area. GIS mapping is particularly useful for e xpansion decisions. The trading areas of new stores can be superimposed on the same map to evaluate overla pping areas. Large overlapping areas indicate the location is an inappropriate site for consideration of a new store. Potential new store sites can also be overlaid with competitors. Large overlap of competitors with each other or with a proposed new store lo cation may indicated that the area is overstored already and another site would be preferable. When choosing a store location the charact eristics of various trading areas need to be evaluated and compared. With GIS mapping population density, household si ze and population changes can be combined on one map to help make a decision on the most appropriate site in th is particular situation. This method can visually take into account not only the factors listed above but also show the size and shape of a number of trading areas at one time. Using these maps small business owners can easily target the markets that offer the highest concentration of their best prospects. Demand and Sales Forecasting Forecasting is an area that is generally overlooked by small business retailers. It is considered to be to complicated and costly to engage in for practical purposes. However, some rather simplistic forecasti ng can be accomplished through linking incidence rates to consumer project ions (3). For example, divide sales from the Census of Retail Trade for a particular product, such as children's apparel, by the number of households of a specific type, such as families with children. Now, multiply that factor by the number of households with children in a particular census tract and the result is the estimated sales of children's apparel in that census tract. Future sales are adjusted by projecting changes in households with children and adjustments in the consumer pr ice index. Profits can be projected by subtracting out cost of goods an expenses. By linking project ion for the market area to incidence rates, forecasts can be produced. Another popular simplistic forecasting me thod that can be used by small busine sses is the analog method (2). This method uses a similar store in terms of size, store service, priding, merchandi sing policies, level of competition, and site characteristics th at is already in operation. By using customer spotting and seconda ry sources of information trade area and market penetration information are determined for the present location. The analog then serve as the basis for develo ping sale forecasts for the new store. To do forecasting it is first necessary to identify the targ et market and trading area. Th is type of information is necessary to develop the incidence rate and market penetration. Mapping can be done to show projection information for the market area, incidence rate, market penetration, or the overall sales forecast. Areas can be identified for expansion, consolidation, or reposit ioning of existing faciliti es market by market. Businesses can evaluate their current product positioning and iden tify which consumer markets to target this year, next year, and five years from now. Changes in the market can be anticipated and a ppropriate planning can be done to meet the challenge of changing consumer needs. Market Share Estimation Market share estimation is another ar ea seldom attempted by small businesses. Market share is calculated by dividing company sales by sales of the area (censu s track, county, city, state). For example, company sales may be compared to sales in the city. The company sales figure comes from intern al company records. The city sales figure may come from economic censuses, Census of Retail Trade or County Business Patterns (3). In addition, smal l retailers will find that following market share figures for th eir business over a period of time provide s good baseline information to show a pattern of growth or decl ine in the marketplace. Market share can be mapped not only in quantity but also by location. Over a period of time geographic shifts in market share can be observed. CONCLUSION This paper addresses the use of a Geographic Information Sy stem to provide relatively inexpensive studies that the owner can use without the assistance of outside consultant s. In particular, we discu ss the use of GIS products for analyzing consumer profiles, identificati on of market areas and site selection, de mand and sales for ecasting, and market share estimation. The use of demographics can assist the small business owner in understanding his business environment, and hence, improve profitability and performance.

SUCCESSION IN THE SMALL BUSINESS HOW SMALL BUSINESS INSTITUTES CAN HELP Roger D. Scow, Southwest Texas State University Ch arles W. Hubbard, Southwest Texas State University ABSTRACT Over the years, much has been written about succession pr oblems in small and large businesses. Less has been written about practical ways for small business owners to \"solve\" succession problems. SBI Teams and SBI Directors can play a vital role by helping clients in this im portant area. This paper offers an approa ch for SBIs to use in assisting clients with succession planning. An underlying them e of the paper is that the principl es of good succession planning are the same whether successor ownership/leadership comes from wi thin or outside the family, or even from outside the company. INTRODUCTION The succession issue is a very important one: We are often re minded that small businesses create most of the new jobs in our economy. But we need to also realize that the most enduring contributions to our economy are made by the relatively few small businesses which su rvive infant mortality, particularly t hose firms which grow over the long run, beyond the tenure of their original founders , and become entities in and of them selves. It is when a company \"breaks through\" the succession barrier and becomes a sustaining orga nizational force that its most important and lasting contribution to the ec onomy is realized. Succession planning is integral to stra tegic planning in the small firm (7). St rategic planning is meaningless in most small companies unless succession plans are considered. Becaus e strategic planning is a prerequisite for operational and functional planning, successi on becomes part of the picture in any SBI planning project. For ex ample, an SBI team doing a business plan- ning, facili ties planning, or human resource planning ca se (or any other proj ect having long-term implications) must inevitably concern its elf with the client's long-run intentions ; That is, what are the long-range plans for this company, and is it intended that the firm c ontinue to exist beyond the te nure of its ow ner-founder? THE PROBLEMS OF SUCCESSION - A DICHOTOMY? Small, pre-breakthrough businesses face sp ecial succession problems (3). The things they \"should\" do are not always do-able, and the founder's pride and affinity for power may predispose him/her against succession planning (7). If a company is well-regarded and clearly viab le, potential acquirers (ma ybe competitors) are likely to approach the founder with attractive offers, possibly prior to retirement time. But founder/owners of less attractive companies are faced with less attractive alternatives : Trying to keep the firm in the family (and face a new subset of probl ems) or initiating an attempt to dive st (another subset of problems). In the short run, these seemingly divergent se ts of problems are easier not to think about. The SBI team and the workers in the client firm may see the need for succession planning, yet have serious difficulty in getting the owner's attention. But is there-a real need for an early choice between inside and outside successo rs? Both inside (family or employee) and outside (acquisition) buyers will really be asking themselves the same question: \"If I buy into this firm, 1: What's in it for me right now?, 2: What's in it for me later on?, 3: Is this the best place to invest my money and my time?\" Bypassing this apparent dichotomy can gr eatly simplify the job of the SBI T eam and may make succession planning a more palatable topic for the owner. Rather than be immedi ately concerned with one \"opti on\" or the other and wrestle with seemingly mutually exclusive quest ions like: \"Will Baby Jane be interest ed in taking over when she grows up?\", \"Will John Employee be willing/able to buy the firm?\", \"Wil l BIGCO be interested in acquiring the company?\", the Team and the client can concentrate i mmediately on ways to make the company attractive for ANYONE to take over at any time, be they relatives, employees or outsiders. As stated by one res pondent to a 1989 survey on the status of succession planning, \"I develop all my businesses with plans to sell after fully developed\" (3). Another ar gument for a universal a pproach to succession plannin g is this: Famil y members trul y capable of takin g over and successfully running the firm are bound to be as smart (and as di scerning) as the average outside buyer, and maybe more so. With their inside knowledge of th e firm, they are not likely to buy \"a pig in a poke\". They have seen the dark side of company ownership; thus founders who seek a successf ul turnover to family members or insiders need to SELL the company to them (and keep it sold), just as they would to outsiders. COMPANY PREREQUISITES A ND SBI TEAM OBJECTIVES For an insider OR outsider to be seriously interested in taking over a company, several conditions need to exist: 1. Obviously, the company should be PROFITABLE, currentl y or potentially... Certain buyers may have uses for a currently unprofitable company, but are unlikely to pay a pr emium for it. SBI Teams typical ly work to help owners achieve profitability; thus succession potential is enhanced by their efforts. 2. The company should be easy to acquire and operate. It s hould be available on win-win terms, beneficial to both seller and buyer. It should present itself as an easy comp any to take over and to run: i.e., now running smoothly; documented, understandable organization and pr ocedures; not overly dependent on one individual; well-qualified, skill-balanced workforce loyal to the company and not just to the previous owner; seller available if advice needed but not disposed to compete or interfere. (These desi rable characteristics can be created or enhanced by SBI Team end-pr oducts such as organization charts, position descriptions, operations manuals, and human resource management guides). 3. Potential new owner(s) must know the co mpany is or will become available. Even if th e founder's exact plans are indefinite, his/her ultimate intention to insure the firm's survival by passing it on to others should be made known. SBI Teams can help by insuring that successi on planning is part of any business pl anning or strategic planning project. Team recommendations can be us ed by the client to let people know about succession planning. HOW TO HELP CLIENTS PR EPARE FOR SUCCESSION SBI Teams should help client s establish time frames for grooming, selecting, and making commitments to successors (2). For example, if the client plans to stay in char ge until 2010, why commit to Baby Jane in 1990? Maybe Employee John or BIGCO will be better prospects when the time comes. In any case, why let Baby Jane become complacent - or Employee John become alienate d by choosing prematurely? BJ and EJ are free to leave at any time, and should be willing to place their bets on advancemen t prospects in the client's company just as they would in any other company. The team and the client can be sure that BIGCO doesn't make twenty -year commitments, even to people on the \"fast track\". Transfer of leadership has been likened to a relay race: The receiver of the baton must be on the track and \"up to speed.\" The baton must be passed BEFORE the first runner sl ows down; then the first runner must get out of the way (1). This suggests that the client can and should gr oom and develop BJ , EJ and other promising people for advancement; then as transition date dr aws near, tilt toward (and let others dis cern) the future successor by beginning a gradual, systematic transfer of executi ve functions. When the client formally announces the successor and the effective date, few insiders will be surprised and mo st will find their expect ations confirmed . BEING PREPARED FOR CONSEQUENCES When a client chooses a successor from among two or more candidates, the losing candida tes may decide to depart. Clients can minimize unpleasantness by be ing open, tactful, and helpful (e.g. by assisting with \"outplacement\"), and should have replacements in mind in case of such an occurrence. Client s may be reluctant to be \"coldhearted\" in dealing with long-time employees and/or \"their own flesh and blood\", but all pl ayers should be aware that family and business seldom mix perfectly: Rules and realities about succession should be established and understood in advance. In any case, it may not be wise or be neficial to allow family members or l ong-time employees to use the firm as a refuge from the outside world. If BJ and EJ ar e not qualified to take leadership responsibiliti es or willing to stay on as employee(s), use family resources to induce BJ to seek another career. If EJ elects to leave, help him to find another position. Teams can advise clients on ways to keep players informed and how to plan for severance pa y, placement assistance, and re placements if needed. The client will then have done ever ything BIGCO would do; Ma ybe more. LAST-MINUTE SURPRISES (B EST-LAID PLANS, ETC.) 1. What if the founder comes down with a dread disease or is hit by a truck BEFORE ul timate succession choices are made (or made known)? What if a forced succession decision comes early and the founder is unable to participate in making the decision? Just as each of us should maintain a cu rrent will and \"letter of instructions\" to guide the executor (BJ gets the Jaguar; Junior gets the silverware), the client should maintain a current procedur e, known to all players, spelling out who would temporarily assume what executive functions in case the client should be temporarily sidelined. In a sealed annex to be opened in case of permanent incapacity, the clie nt should designate what leader ship actions should be taken for the long run and why. The \"why\" sec tion is needed because the survivors may or may not do as the owner would have wished; this method will at least make them aware of the reasoning which underlies the succession plan. The team should establish procedures for the client to update this annex frequent ly and for access in time of need. 2. What if an internal successor such as BJ or EJ reconsiders at the last minute? What if a last-minut e problem arises in connection with funding? Should the client step in to fill the gap? As one survey respondent stated, \"In a service business, the value is the owner's ability and personality. That's not good collateral if the seller holds the paper\" (3). The SBI Team can help the client to impr ove odds that potential successors will be able financially as well as willing to take over the firm, by recommending ways to get them fi nancially involved in compa ny operations early on, through ESOPs or other forms of financial part icipation. For succession and other reasons , the client should communicate with them OFTEN to be sure they have not lo st their company orientation or developed other interests. If all measures fail, the client must be ready on short notice to contact BIGC O (or SMALCO, or a broker or an auctioneer). Contingency plans may never be needed, but can be very useful when primary plans misfire. SBI te ams can help clients develop contingency plans and have a valuable l earning experience at the same time. CONCLUSION Succession planning isn't an enti ty in itself; Succession planning is strategic planning with an extra important small business dimension. While your SBI Team is helping a client to look for opportunities and threats, devise strategies, set goals, and do operationa l and functional pl anning, its members should think not merely from a compa ny viewpoint, but with employee, famil y, and the client's personal interests consciously and firmly in mind. This approach will not guarantee smooth company succession (or success), and no SBI Team can do all the things outlined above in the course of a single seme ster, but by keeping succession factors in mind, the team can contribute greatly to making both things happen.

Ibrahim, Ph.D., Concordia University ABSTRACT There are many sophisticated concepts of strategy formulation offered in the st rategy literature. However, the large majority hold little promise for small firms. This research is devoted to exploring the concept of strategy in small business. In particular, this research intends to, first sugge st a model of strategy formulat ion in small entrepreneurial firms, second discuss different strategic directions relevant to small business th at has been described in the strategy literature and finally offer some guidelines on how to develop a strategy for the small business. The Concept of Strategy Hofer and Schendel (1) define strategy as a pattern of objectives, purposes or goals defining what type of business you are in, or should be in. Michael Porter (2) distinguishes between two types of strategy: competitive and corporate strategy. Competitive or business strategy refers to the dist inctive competence of the firm . Corporate strategy on the other hand refers to the firm's mission a nd what business the firm should be in. Strategy Formulation in Small Entrepreneurial Firms There are a number of factors which shap e the formulation of strategy in the small business. The firm's external environment, including economic trends, industry structure a nd competition is important in deciding what course of action the organization should pursue. The internal capacity of the organization is an equally important factor in shaping the strategic decision, including the small firm's resources, skills, stre ngths and weaknesses. In general, its distinctive competence. However, the internal and external capabilities of the orga nization are not the only ingredients in the small business strategic decision making process. Entr epreneurs and small busine ss managers are heavily influenced by what they personally want to achieve. In other words, the internal and external capabilities of the small firm is filtered by the entrepreneur's perception as well as his personality, values a nd expectations. The follow ing model (see Figure 1) describes the strategy formulati on process in small business. As can be show n in the figure, the strategic decision is a choice of the entrepreneur or the mana ger of the small firm. Therefore one wa y to study strategy formulation in small business is to study the entrepreneur, his personality, values and motivation (3). Henry Mintzberg (4) tracked strategy form ulation of a retail chain over a period of 60 years. He found that strategy in the entrepreneurial mode tended to be more intuitive, based on the entrepreneur's judgment, wisdom and vision. Strategic Directions for Small Business There are a number of strategic directions in the strategy literature that coul d be of greater help to entrepreneurs and small business managers. Let us discuss each briefly. Porter Generic Strategy. Michael Porter (5 ) identified three types of generic stra tegies that can be pursued by almost any organization. These strategies help the organization achieve, build, defend and sustain its competitive advantage. A firm builds competitive. advantage by such different means as cost leadership, superior product and technology, quality and reliability of service. Studies have shown that smal l firms must build competiti ve advantages to compete effectively in the market place. For example, C.R. Stoner (6 ) studied areas of distinctive competence for small firms, and the extent to which they form a competitive advantage. The common areas of distinctive competence identified in the study include experience a nd knowledge, uniqueness of product or service, better than average service, location, low cost and price, quality of product, variety of products, friendly atmos phere, reputation and unique method of marketing. The first generic strate gy identified b y Porter (7) is focus (niche ) strate gy. This involves concentratin g on a s pecific market, group of customers, product or se rvice. The firm pursuing a focus strate gy creates a competitive advantage in a narrow and well defined niche to avoi d head-on collision with large competit ors. A study by D. Watkin (8) has shown that focus strategy is very effective for small firms. The second generic strategy describe d by Porter (9) is cost leadership. This st rategy implies that the firm intends to be a low-cost producer. Thus this strategy st resses cost efficiency which can be achi eved by economies of scale, experience curve and capacity utilization. Indeed cost efficiency is a strong competitive advantage if the small firm is able to sustain it over a long period of time. This requires an indepth study of the sm all firm's cost structure as well as an efficient cost control system. In a recent study, E. H ughes (10) found that the us e of process technologies (improvement. in the manufacturing process rather than resear ch on new product development) is of little risk for small companies and results in reducing cost and thus building a strong competitive advantage. The third generic strategy is differentiation which involves offering a unique product or service that allows the small firm to charge a premium pric e. A small business can differentiate its produc t or service by such means as improving product design, features, appearance, reliab ility, durability, quality, fa ster or free maintenanc e and repair service and warranty. A study by Cooper, Gary and W oo (11) found that differen tiation strategy is as effective as a niche type strategy in small firms. This was conf irmed by Sandberg and Hofer (12) who repor ted that differentiation type strategy could be more effective than focus type strategy. Miles and Snow Typology. Miles a nd Snow's (13) classic rese arch identified three types of strategy that may be effective for a small business to pursue. These ar e the defender, the prospector and the analyzer. The defender type involves developing a na rrow product/market niche and erects barriers (i.e., compet itive advantages) to protect it. In this type, the firm does not do any environmental scanning in search of windows of opportunities. The owner/manager exercises a tight control over the firm and a high degree of cost efficiency. Unlike the defender type, the prospector is constantly scanning the environment for ne w opportunities, be it a new product or service or a new market. In order to be able to sc an the environment, prospector s are highly flexible in every aspect of operation. Indeed R&D act ivities are extremely important. Finally, the analyzer type is a combination of a defender a nd a prospector. That is, while part of the organization is defending its niche, the other part is scanning for new opportunities. A study by Davig (14) reported that sm all firms pursuing either defender or prospector types achieve better performance compared with analyzer types. R ugman and Verbeke (15) found that prospecto r-type strategy is the most pursued strategy followed by the defender type. The authors concluded that Miles and Snow's strategies are more appropriate for small business that Po rter's generic-type strategies. Stages of Growth. The small firm may also pursue a strategy based on i ndustry stage of growth (growth, maturity, decline). Chaganti (16) found growth stage industries to be more attractive for small firm s simply because the learning curve presents an opportunity for the small firm to build a competitive advantage. Chaganti (17) also reported that differentiation-type strategy is more effective for the small firm duri ng decline stage of industries. Developing- a Strategic Direction for the Small Business The following is a step-by- step approach to developing an eff ective strategy for the small business. Step 1 - Setting Your Objectives. The firs t step is to define clearly your objectiv es or what you want to achieve. That sounds almost patronizi ng, however a large number of entrepreneurs and small business managers do not have a clear idea of what they want to achieve. For some entrepreneurs, it is maximizing their profit and/ or a large market share. For others, it is building long-term security, a legacy for their fa milies, or even acting out a fantasy. Indeed this step may take some soul searching, but in the process can whittle many fuzzy and una chievable objectives. Step 2 - Defining Your Mission. The second step in developing a strategic directi on is to define what kind of business you should be in. Drucker (18) noted that the key question fo r small business is who they are or what their mission in the business is. Step 3 - Assessing Your Capabili ties: The Situation Audit. This step involves assessing the firm's real capacity to carry out the intended mission successfully. The si tuation audit allows the entrepreneur or manager to assess the internal and external capabilities of the small bus iness. The internal assessment incl udes assessing the firm's strengths and weaknesses in different functional ar eas such as marketing, production, acco unting and general management. The external assessment includes scanning the environment for windows of opportunities or areas of threats. Step 4 - Selecting a Strategic Dir ection. Having identified your objectives , defined your mission and assessed your capabilities, you should be able to identify different strategies, be it a niche stra tegy or cost leadership. To select an appropriate strategy, Rumelt (19) suggested the following criteria. First, the st rategy must be internally consistent. Second, it must provide a fit between the fi rm and its environment. Third, the strate gy must be feasible in light of the firm's resources. Figure 2 is a strategic alternat ive matrix that allows you to position your fi rm strategically. Figure 3 is a comprehensive checklist for developing strategy in the small business. SUMMARY We have attempted in this research to explore the concept of strategy formulation in the small entrepreneurial firm. A model of strategy formulation was offere d. The model focuses on the entrepreneur 's perception, personality and values. We have also attempted to provide a lit erature review of differen t strategic directions available to small business. Finally some guidelines for en trepreneurs and small business managers on how to deve lop a strategy for small business were offered.

Sonfield, Hofstra University Robert J. Barbato, Rochester Institute of Technology ABSTRACT This paper focuses on the specific concept of enabling di splaced workers to become self-employed through the use of assistance programs which comb ine entrepreneurial trai ning and development with credit or equity support. Previous research is reviewed, existi ng American and European programs are surveyed , and an especially effective program in Washington State is analyzed in detail. From this analysis a set of assistance factors which appear to correlate with entrepreneurial succe ss is presented. INTRODUCTION Previous research by the authors has focu sed on workers displaced from their jobs due to plant layoffs or closings and the concept of training these persons to become entrepreneurs.(1) It was recogni zed that entrepreneurial propensity is often a factor of personality traits. After administering th e Miner Sentence Completion Scale - Form T to several groups of displaced workers who had part icipated in ten week entr epreneurial workshops it was concluded that these displaced workers tend to have lower th an average entrepreneurial propensity. T hus, any efforts to enable them to become self-employed should rec ognize that some self- employment is more en trepreneurial than others, and that these displaced workers will have a better chance for self-employment success in non-entrepreneuri al small business ventures, including one-person businesse s operated from one's own home. One of the conclusions resulting from th is study was a suggestion that short-term grants or loans be given to these displaced workers to start basic small bus inesses that would provide income. These small grants or loans, it was argued, would be in lieu of money spent on tr aditional entrepreneurial programs. At the time, this alternative seemed ra ther far-fetched, but subseq uent research by two of the authors indicates that some programs of this nature do exist and may indeed be a viable alternative to the more traditional approaches to assisting displaced workers. This paper will analyze this concept, survey some existing programs including one that appears to be especially effective, and develop conclusi ons and recommendations with re gard to the effectiveness of both this type of alternative and to tradit ional entrepreneurial development programs. ANALYSIS Self-Employment and MicroEnterprises The promotion of self employment is a basic but minor component of economic de velopment and social policy in most developed countries and in many less-dev eloped nations. In conjunction with a wi de variety of public assistance and \"welfare\" programs, self-employment is recognized as one means of bringing a pe rson into the mainstream of society as a productive and contributing individua l. A sizable portion of the American population (6.7%) is self-employed, and this percentage is higher for lower-income persons than fo r those with higher incomes.l. Furthermore, the number of self-employed persons in the U.S. ha s grown considerably in the past tw o 3 decades (up 45% since 1970).(3) Also, the significance of tiny \"micro-enterprises\" or very small businesse s (often home based one person operations), which have often been characterized as insignificant in te rms of their economic impact, are now being recognized for their to micro\" rather than \"macro\" ef fects. Although such businesses have litt le positive impact on the local economy and rarely create new jobs, they do provide one person with employment and self - sufficiency at a minimal cost to society. And they sometimes mark the start of a path to more significant entrepreneurial act ivity in the future activity that does impact the economy and create jobs for others.(4) Self-employment programs exist throughout the United States and in many other nations. They are aimed at a variety o f target groups, including existing micro-entrepreneurs, the unemployed, welfare recipi ents, and poor women. Although public and private funds dedicated to such programs are still relativel y minimal in com parison to more traditional income maintenance and welfar e programs, the attraction of such programs to those who control social policy is that they help people to help themselves, and that they have the potential to eventually benefit not only the individual recipient but the larger community as well. Of course, not all disadvantaged persons are appropriate recipients of such programs. A 1988 study conducted in Maine provides some indicative data.(5) In a random survey of ten percent of the st ate's welfare recipients (with a 25% response rate), 60 percent said they were interested in running a sm all business, could name one or more business ideas, and had a realistic understanding of the difficulties of starting one's own busin ess. Eighty-five percent of these respondents cited lack of money as the major reason k eeping them from becoming sel f-employed, while 45% cited their limited business knowledge and experience (most cited more than one reason). Clearly, th ese data indicate that a sizable portion of our disadvantaged population may be benefitted by self employment programs. Our focus, however, is specifically the displaced worker, a phenomenon which has become a significant problem in our society.(6) Such an individual ha s by definition work experience and should be more likely to be both interested and to benefit from such a program. Thus the study of such programs is even more meaningful in the cont ext of this current research. Credit and Equity Support As discussed previously, most existing programs aimed at assisting displaced and unemployed workers to become entrepreneurs or small busine ss owners through training, workshops, etc. have two major weaknesses. First, the typical displaced worker has a low entreprene urial propensity and would probably pe rform better as an employee in a hierarchical environment. Second, it is the lack of capital that most freque ntly keeps a person from becoming self- employed. Therefore, the addition of credit and/or equi ty support to existing training activities would increase the effectiveness of most self-emp loyment development programs. That lack of capital is so fr equently a barrier to self employment is esp ecially frustrating becau se the amount of money needed to start a small business is gene rally quite minimal. Microenterprises and small businesses can be defined in capital requirements of from $500 to $100,00 0. U.S. census data show that half of all small business owners started their firms with less than $5000.(7) Some self-employment programs in this country do include capital support co mponents in their total assistance packages, although most do not.(8) These pr ograms usually have loan funds from wh ich credit is supplied to qualified program participants. The purpose is to provide credit to new small business owners or entrepreneurs who would be considered too risky by the traditional credit sources, such as banks and other lending institutions. Of course, the goal is to enable these business owners to eventually beco me satisfactory in the eyes of potential lenders. Loans in these programs are relatively sm all, and often provided in steps- a se ries of increasing short-term amounts, dependent upon the repayment of the previ ous step. In order to spread the programs' funds available for credit purposes as far as possible, these funds are also used for purposes othe r than direct loans, such as for loan guarantees which will convince traditional lending instituti ons to provide th e actual loan. Some existing self-employment program s have set up peer group lending progr ams, where small business owners established with the assistance of direct loans from the pr ogram are then encouraged or required to provide credit to other program participants. These programs substitute peer pressure for collateral and foster group support for entrepreneurial effort. The biggest problem that thes e programs face is, not surprisingly, a lack of funding for themselves. Loans of this nature are inherently very risky, and few of these lending programs are self sufficient. Even though most programs provide credit rather than equity assistance and thus receive th eir funds back in time as loan repayments, there is always a percentage of loans that is not repaid, and addi tional funding of the programs is periodically required. Yet equity assistance is preferable to credit assistance. Small start-up businesses generally have weak or poor cash flow situations for a period of time, often for more than a year. The difficulties and pressures facin g a new business owner are always very formidable, and an obligatory and totally structured loan repayment schedule can often be a fatal factor. Thus, although obviously more diff icult to fund, a self-employment devel opment program which includes equity support rather than credit support is more likely to creat e a greater number of successful new start-up businesses. The issue of program funding then becomes a critical one. A number of European countries have met this challenge by instituting \"tra nsfer payment diversion\" programs.(9) These programs all in some manner allow the government to pay out unemployment benefits in single lump sums to qualified displaced workers who wish to start their own businesses. The first of these programs, France's Chomeurs Crateurs, was instituted in 1979, and Britain's Enterpri se Allowance Scheme followed in 1983. Over 700,000 persons have participated in these two programs to date, and some seventeen other countries have instituted similar programs since. Working within the existing unemploymen t benefits programs, these equity support programs generally require the prospective small business owner to develop a business plan and in other ways s how that he or she has a real chance for success in the proposed venture. In most programs, the en tire amount of unemployment bene fits that would normally be paid out over the maximum allowable pe riod of time is paid out in one lump sum, specifically for use to start a new business. In some countries the displaced worker receives the money as soon as the business plan has been approved, while in other countries the business must be started (with personal funds or borrowing) before the government transfers the entitled funds. Most programs also provide management assistance, training, workshops, etc. in conjunction with the equity support. Most of the businesses resulting from these programs are home-based microenterpr ises, but about ten percent turn into real growth businesses. One set of data indicates that for every one hundred businesses started, about 130 new jobs have been created. As more of these programs reach a maturity stage, hopefu lly these data will be come more concrete. However, it is important to recognize that all of these transfer payment dive rsion programs overcome the funding issues raised earlier in this paper by simply divert ing funds already available and to which the recipients are already entitled. Thus , there is less political or pract ical opposition to these programs. The Washington State Program While most equity support programs involving transfer payment diversion ar e found outside the United States, one program recently initiated in the state of Washington is worthy of an in-depth analysis (10). Modeled after the European programs, Washington's version is being run on a li mited one-year trial basis. One thousand laid off workers are receiving a lump sum payment of their unemployment be nefits, averaging $4,100. As in Europe, the program is for only a small percentage of all unemployed people. In selected trial cities, all newly unemployed persons are advised of this new program. About five percent of those notified indicate any interest and perhaps three percent actually complete initial applications for the program. Candi dates are then required to take a four day, 20-hour se ries of business classes, perform market research, and then deve lop a detailed business pl an (including financials) that is acceptable to a counselor. Since these people are alrea dy receiving their weekly unemployment be nefits during this period, there is pressure upon them to complete this portion of the program qui ckly so as to leave as much of their total benefits available for the lump sum payment. Upon final qualification, the displaced worker receives the full payment and is assisted in the business start-up and subsequent operations by a personal bus iness counselor from the program. As of mid-August 1990, 477 people had enrolled in the program and 178 businesses have actually been started. Only three of these businesses have empl oyees other than the proprietor. Success Factors Our analysis of these various self-employment development programs, and a subsequent series of personal interviews with directors of both the Washington State and other progr ams, have led us to develop a number of conclusions regarding those factors that ar e likely to lead to the success of these equity support programs, and to the success of other types of self-employment deve lopment programs as well. (11) * The \"open admissions\" policies of most of the European programs indicate that th ere is more small business ownershi p potential in a wider ran ge of the population than previousl y thou ght. * Early intervention is very important. Th e program must quickly recruit, scree n, and select participants as soon as possible after their being laid off. * It is important to focus the initial part of the pr ogram on confidence building. Many people in these programs are middle aged and are scared of the pr ospect of starting out on their own, usually for the first time. * It is preferable to steer the clients toward business pr oposals which make use of skills which they already possess, often based on the jobs from wh ich they were laid off. * All unemployed people should be made aware of these progr ams. Since only a very small percentage reach the actual assistance programs, the greater the init ial applicant pool the better the quality and chances for success of the final client group. * For transfer payment divers ion programs, since the amount of the lump sum payment is limited by the traditional stream of unemployment benefits, it is important to run the program quickly, leav ing the lump sum payment as large as possible. Since the total lump sum tends to be small ( Washington average = $4,100) relative to the startup needs of even a microenterprise, every ex tra dollar can make a difference toward the chances of success. * Support groups are of value. In Seattl e an Entrepreneurs Club of program part icipants has been established, holds monthly meetings, has published a memb ership directory, and provides a netw ork for these budding business people. * Success rates in these programs seem to be higher for those participants who ar e older, male and married, who have had more recent and higher levels of work experience, a nd who have more of their own funds to invest in the new business venture. Yet success is also attained by persons who do not meet these profiles. * Recent federal legislation requiring most larger companies to provide ad vance notice of plant closings should allow self-employment programs to intervene and assist even before a person is actually laid off. * The most successful programs provi de a continuum of self - employment development and support services. They start with a speedy but rigorous client selection process and follow up with a fu ll range of flexible, client-responsive, and business-oriented assistance. These programs continue to serve the clients after they start their businesses. CONCLUSIONS Although previous research has shown that displaced worker s tend to have below average entrepreneurial propensity, self-employment is still a viable opti on for these persons. Self-employment deve lopment programs can be effective and successful in this context if we recognize that micro-ente rprise ownership rather than entrepreneurship or growth business ownership is a more appropriate goal and path for displaced workers who can not find new employment. While self-employment development progr ams that do not include credit or equity support can assist people in initiating small business ownership, those which do incl ude such support have a greater chance of succeeding. Furthermore, equity support is preferably to credit support, and the tran sfer payment diversion model can overcome the funding problems inherent in ot her equity support models. Analysis of a wide variety of self-e mployment development programs leads to a series of conclusions regarding program success factors, and these have been presented a bove. Clearly the concept of self employment development should be pursued in the context of displaced workers, and greater emphasis should be pla ced on the inclusion of credit and equity support compone nts in such programs.

TENURE IN THE YELLOW PAGES Eugene L. O'Connor California Polytech nic State University San Luis Obispo ABSTRACT How many small businesses fail and in what time frame? Numbers like 50% in five years, 50 % in one year, 90% in five years, etc. are quoted in press releases, textbooks and sp eeches. Alpander, et al quot e Siropolis \"Approximately 55 percent of all new ventures fail during th e first three years\".(1) Th is paper tries to find out what the approximate tenure is for 83 Standard Industrial Classificat ion Codes. The study is of businesses in San Luis Obispo County, California. The length of time for the study was nine years. INTRODUCTION & METHODOLOGY The population of San Luis Obispo County is about 214,000, wi th an increase of about 30,000 from 1979 to 1988. Its major industries are government, agriculture and tourism. Sa n Luis Obispo is the largest city and the county seat. A nearby university increased from 14,000 to 17,000 students during the period studied. The city has increased in population from 35,000 to 40,000 during the same period. One of two major north-south California highways bisects the city and the county. Two major touris t attractions, a Californ ia mission and Hearst Castle are in the county. Most of the businesses in the co unty are retailers, service firms and government entities. During the period 1980-88, the unemployment rate ranged from 3.2% to 4.8% in the county. The author's rationale for the study was prompted by th e apparent high turnover of reta il firms in San Luis - Obispo city. Shapero determined the tenure of small firms using a count of businesse s entering and exiting the Yellow pages. (2) This study tries to approximate the same methodology. Th e reason for using the Yellow Pages is the belief that listed businesses are serious about being in business. The Yellow Pages declined to participate in the study citing privacy records. Using telephone directories for the ye ars 1979-1989, a count of new businesses came by noting new names in each annual directory. Exits counted if prior names did not appear in the new di rectory. Firms that had been in business before the years studied counted as exits if they exited later. National ch ain outlets were not considered but franchises were if the owners were franchisees. The study did not include farms. SIC code selection was upon the author's knowledge of the comm unity. Professionals such as attorneys or dentists are not included in the count. Where it was known, transfer of ownership without changing the name of the business counted as continuing firms. If the firm changed owners and changed the ma jor activity of the business, the firm was counted as a new business. The number of years in business was a f unction of a firm's entry into, or dele tion from, a directory. Tenure was in whole years regardless of st arting or closure dates. LIMITATIONS Some businesses do not list by choice. Some home busine sses do not list th eir phone as a business phone. Other businesses miss the deadline for listing. Some return sporadically because they are not certain of the effectiveness of the medium. Other limitations are multiple listings for the same firm forcing guesses about the major emphasis of the business. Scrambled merchandising is very common, particularly in smaller communities. Other firms employ the tactic because the original thrust of the business, or the target market, has changed. The author screened all citati ons to try to cull out as many duplications, wrong classifications, etc. as possible. The original sample size of 3,308 fi rms and the consistency of findings shows that the limitations are not serious problems. FINDINGS NEW BUSINESSES Listings in the 1980 directory that we re not in the 1979 directory counted as new businesses. San Luis Obispo County retailers and service firms dominate the business economy. Listings in the 1979 di rectory that were not in the 1980, or later, directories counted as closures. Each annual directory followed the same procedure. 1,056 (39%) firms of 2,711 continued operations during the period.(Fig. 1) 1,655 closed their doors over the same period. Attrition rates were sli ghtly lower for the first three years of opera tions totaling 49.1% (Fig. 2) compared to the 55% mentioned earlier. Figure 3 shows the percentage of firms th at continued after starting in the years 1980-89. After the fifth year, there is a pattern of about 27% continuing in business. Continuance of these firms may occur barring death, illness or large national or regional companies moving into the area. In fact , two large department stores have entered the San Luis Obispo County trading area. Two more have extended into the extended area. There is likely to be a hi gher attrition rate among woman's clothing stores and other specialty shops. The most active industries for new starts were restaurants (a ll dining establishments), beau ty salons (hair cutting, hair styling and nail care) and antique de alers. The attrition rate for these three industries was 63.1%, 53.2% and 70.8% respectively. The retention rate by years of operation fo r restaurants is shown in Table 4. Eati ng establishments varied from fast food to elegant restaurants. The number of new starts was nearly twice that of beauty salons. An expanding population could account for some of the activity but not the bulk of it. The au thor estimates that about fifteen restaurants, as opposed to fast food places and pizza parlors, dominate the market. Na tional franchises/chains domin ate the fast food market. About half of the beauty salons went out of business over the pe riod examined.(Fig. 5) There are very few of these firms with more than four employees in the county. Scrambled merchandising t actics grew during the period as firms added nail care and tanni ng facilities to their service offerings. Firms closed before 1980 in nearly the same proportion in various industries as did those that started after 1979 and then closed. Table I lists industries with an attrition rate over 50%. The first half of the table lists firms that have ease of entry. The high turnover of these kinds of businesses produces lower pr iced equipment for resale. Antique dealers take items on consignment. Some firms need little more than a telephone and a post office box. The second half of Table 1 lists indus tries where inventory and equipment ne eds are large but financing may be available using second mortgages. DISCUSSION The local university is polytec hnic in nature and encompasses architecture, civil engineering, agriculture, printing, computer science and business majors along with many others. Graduates and students in the majors listed above try to apply their knowledge to a business. This is particularly true where little capital is necessary and there is a strong desire to stay in the county. The area is seen as a very desirable place to live. Many graduates, ex-st udents and others from out of the area have made a commitment to living in the area. To make a liv ing, many people start their ow n businesses. The area has traditionally had a low unemployment rate and a surplus of stude nt labor. Industries with ease of entry attributes attract the people mentioned above. In the author's opinion, this is the reason for so many new businesses such as gardening, auto detailing and computer retailers. Birch, quoted in Bates & Nucci, speaks of \"a foundation of massive, continual failures\".(3 ) The term \"failures\" is interpreted to mean failure to stay in business, whatev er the reason. Bates & Nucci ca ll these failures \"a great volatility\". They maintain that businesse s with five and over employees closed at an annual rate of less than 3%. They claim that man y discontinuances occur amon g firms with small gross sales (4) and the y argue that new and younger firms with a small group of empl oyees account for most of the discontinuances or \"failures\".(5) Perhaps this is the reason for such a high attrition rate in San Luis Obispo County. No information about numbers of employe es per firm was available. The aut hor's knowledge of some firms suggests that the bulk of the firms had, at most, three or four employees. Brockway & Mangold argue \"Assessing the economic health of a market area is the first step in identifying retail market opportunities for small business. \"(6) The author's personal experiences with many small businesses in the county found that few new businesses do a market analysis. Fe wer yet make a business plan. This is perhaps another reason for the many business \"failures\" in the county. In some instances, the entrepreneur is unaware of the long hours, hard work, and pressure placed upon them. This may happen despite their experience in the industry as an employee. In all probability, closure wi ll happen if they have no experience in the field. CONCLUSION The number of \"failures\" in San Luis Obispo County, shows a high attrition rate among th irty-one of the industries studied. The rate for al l industries was also high. High is defined as greater than 50%. Howeve r, not enough is known about number of employees nor total sales per closed firm . The county is a unique macroeconomic entity in a rural setting. similar findings may oc cur among some of the severa l industries in other areas. The findings raise more questions than answers. Is there a ca usal effect between the higher attrition rate of an industry and higher interest rates for bank loans to long established firms? Does th e rate intensify reluctance on the part of financiers and poten tial investors? Lack of a market analysis, lack of a business plan, lack of business expertise and/or insu fficient starting capital are commonly thought to be major factors in business failures. If the findings of Bates and Nucci are accepted, should that group of would-be entrep reneurs who are likely to \"f ail\" be assisted and how should this be accomplished? SBI's can be one part of the answer. There is a market for educating would-be entrep reneurs before they start a business. REFERENCES (1) Alpander, G. G., K. D. Carter and R. A.

F. Southern, Mercer University Robert G. Schwartz, Mercer University ABSTRACT Measures of economic development gene rally are not utilized to calculate th e contribution of the Small Business Institute (SBI) program to the economy. The objective of th is study was to quantify the SBI's role in providing an economic return for the federal and stat e support provided to this SBA program. SMALL BUSINESS INSTITUTE The SBI program was begun in 1972 to provi de a formal university/industry interf ace. A number of studies of the SBI have been done but these have been desc riptive in nature, lending little to knowledge regarding the economic impact of the program. It was not until 1983 that a major na tional evaluation study was published (S olomon and Weaver, 1983). This study indicated that client fi rms achieved some increases over non-clients in their various fi nancial ratios, but no statistics were offered. From 1983 to 1990 no papers were found which dealt with the subject of the economic efficacy of the SBI program. In 1990 Lorette et. al. were calling for the re structuring of the SBA to cure the purported support of marginal business. The objective of this study was to quantify the SBI's role in providing a financial return for the federal and state support provided to this SBA program. METHODOLOGY The Sample Frame The sample frame consisted of the 250 (o f 500) randomly selected SBIs listed in the current SBA list of SBIs (1989) representing the United States, Guam, a nd Puerto Rico. All 250 SBIs were mailed individual signed letters and surveys. The Questionnaire A questionnaire was developed which sought de scriptive data relative to the demogr aphics of the SBI, its director and its clients; including sources of new cl ients; types of businesses served, scre ening of potential clients, success and failure data for clients, and economic im pact of the SBI on the local economy. Non-Response Bias Forty-six or 18.4% of the 250 responded to the questionnaire, represent 20 states. Twenty- one of the respondent SBIs were located near or in a city of less than 50,000 popul ation, eight less than 250,000, five less than 500,000, three less than one million, six over one million, and three failed to provide the information. FINDINGS The demographics of the respondent SBIs are shown in Table I.

A large number of responses were provided, which were extremely diverse, like ly reflecting both the nature of the local economy and the inherent diversity of business. Economic Impact Respondents were asked to provide information relating to the impact of the SBI on th e local economy's business and jobs created, diversification of the economy, change in pa tent estates, and number of minorities, female and handicapped run businesses helped. Table III reports the number of businesses and jobs created. TABLE III LONG TERM RESULTS (n=46) Since Inception of SBI: Mean Resp.

SBI Age and Business and Job Creation Should older SBIs have been re sponsible for creating more businesses and jobs , ie. do these variables co-vary with age? Older SBIs were found to produce more business (sign. 0.002) and more jobs than their younger counterparts (sign. = 0.001). This result is different than that found in compani on SBDC and business incubator studies, ie. older programs were found to be less productive in terms of creating businesses and jobs (Schwartz et. al, 1990; Southern and Schwartz, 1990). This may be the result of the SBIs being more selective in term s of clients and more productive in the use of their time. SBI Location and Business and Job Creation Perhaps urban SBI programs crea ted more jobs than their rural counterpa rts. Rural SBI programs accounted for less new business created (sign. 0.078), but th e rural locations were newer (sign. 0.105) . Urban locations also accounted for greater numbers of jobs created, but th e relationship was weak (sign. =0.114). CONCLUSIONS Impacts of the SBI program on the econom y could not be calculated due to the low response rate to the questions related to economic issues. Thus, while almost twenty years old, the SBIs do not track return dollars in the same way their client firms do. Business incubato rs appear to be somewhat more account able (Schwartz, et. al, 1990). However, the SBI program appears to be more pr oductive in terms of age and firms a nd jobs produced than their SBDC and incubator counterparts. The effectiveness of the SBI program re lating to the creation of patents and the assistance to female, minority, and handicapped run business is unknown.

EVALUATING AN SBI'S REAL CONTRIBUTION TO SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE A CASE STUDY Harriet Buckman Stephenson, Seattle Univer sity Elizabeth L. Konarski , Seattle University Davi d Phillips, Phillips and Associates ABSTRACT An Accredited School of Business in the Pacific Northw est sought to assess what impact the SBI program had by conducting an extensive review of it s Small Business Inst itute program. The university had been a par ticipant in the SBA sponsored program sin ce the program's inception. To identify the impact of the SBI experience to par ticipating firms, a survey of those co mpanies who participated between 1978 and 1989 was undertaken. Client per ceptions, the most frequently utilized m eans of evaluating the effect of student consulting, were basically positive. Sales had increased for ma ny of the owners and a percentage of that increase was attributed to student consulting. In half of the cases in wh ich students undertook feasibility st udies, the owners actually started the businesses. While some companies reported an increase in the number of employees between the initial consulting and the present, other compan ies reported a decrease. Perhaps the grea test added value is derived from the educational component of the client experience for the business owner. Programs that contribute to enhancing the learning and self training of small busin ess owners provide a needed competitiv e edge. The SBI appears to be such a program. INTRODUCTION The 1980's hosted a resurgence of new entrepreneurs. Eighty percent of all new jobs created in the United States during this period were generated in the smal l business sector, yet this tremendous gr owth was accompanied by an increasing number of business failures (12; 9; 13) co sting billions of dollars in investment capital. This indeed was an expensive way for entrepreneurs to get a business education (15). Is it possible to cut down on business failures? Could the causes of business failure be is olated? Could the success factors be isolated and those then transmitted to or learned by the business owners? What makes a small bus iness successful? If those factors ar e identifiable, what impact does the SBA's SBI program have on a business ow ner and the business, success? This case study in an AACSB Accredited University of 10 years of an SBI program explores just what the nature of the SB I consulting impact may be. The task of identifying success factors has not been co mpleted. While Garsombke & Garsombke (11) discussed the influence of technological change on sm all-medium size firm pe rformance, Roitman & Emshoff (23) listed the inadequacy of the financial and human resources needed to implement product id eas and market strategies as major ba rriers to the entrep reneurial firm's success. Bracker & Pearson (1) identified firm size, type of product, industry maturity, and the age of the firm as significant to the student teams: this achieves two purposes (1) increases the te am credibility and (2) brings industry- specific expertise to the group (i.e. increas e the student's technical competency). Furthermore, it is evident that students must develop stronger consulting skills such as: active listening and feedback; sensitivity to client needs; meeting more frequently with clients; develop great er professionalism (make sure work is thorough, complete, relatively free of erro rs, etc.); learn decision-m aking and problem solving techniques; learn how to sell themselves and their ideas. OBSERVATIONS AND SUMMARY From the client self-reports to the su rvey, it appears that some owners had c oncerns about the tec hnical competence and consulting skills of the SBI students. C lient perceptions hinged upon the consultant's ability to earn and sustain client confidence based upon the consultant's professional competence. And, earning and keeping client trust (and, therefore, a positive evaluation) involved everything from continual demonstration of i ndustry related expertise to listening between the lines, to providing a conduit for networking, to scouting resources, while keeping open lines of communication with clients. Occasionally, clients will complain about a consultant's ineffectiveness in direct relation to the technical competence of the consultant. Such defensive behavior manifests itself in complaints that the consultant 's approach is too narrow, uninformed, academic, impractical, or inappropriate in the situation (19). Some of the negative client self-reports from the SBI survey seem to match this phenomena. Such complaints included: \"They need to grope for reality ... come down to earth a nd [experience] things from a person in [my] shoes.\" \"As it applied to [XYZ], the student program was too much a textbook exercise, the content of which was prepared more for the effect on the instructor than for its applicability to the business.\" \"They had very theoretical advice that di dn't really apply to our business.\" It is difficult to tell whether some of the negative fee dback was motivated by an objecti ve desire to improve the SBI program (clients were potentially overall satisfied), from clie nts whose real needs may or may not have been met, or from the \"addicted\" small business owne r unable/unwilling to hear the advice of outsiders and do what was truly necessary to save the business. From the previous discussion, it is evident that consulting is a very complex process that demands close integration between technical and re lational expertise. This study went back more than a year or two to solicit input. Most research inquires upon completion or six months to a year after the consultation experience. M easuring short-term impact versus long-t erm needs to be explored further. If an owner goes out of business is that a failure? This evaluation study of a decade of SBI consulting at one major SBI school has demonstrated that while measurement of the contribution of the program is a complex task, there is clearly perceived added value to the business owners. As Max Douglas and Steve Lamb (7) found in their national survey: \"With minor program refinement and facult y-student-client cooperation, th e SBI will continue to play a key role in the field of experiential education.\" We would suggest that the SBI plays a key role in the field of education for students and the business owner/entrepreneur by cont ributing directly to the owners intern al capacity to manage the business in the future. Rather than a one-time problem focused cons ultation, the SBI experience c ontributes to management awareness for the long term providing a hi ghly desirable competitive edge. The role of university students as learners and business owners as co-learners in the education/learning pro cess is a valuable contribution too long overlooked. It is collaborative learning at its best. Research must continue to identify and quantify success factors, methods of measurement of accomplishment, and ways of establishing causal re lationships between consulting and benefits. A nd certainly, if adding value is to be the measure, more interaction between stude nt and client during the consulting process and clar ified expectations and perceptions up front should go a long way to increasing perceived value of the e xperience for both owners and students. Moreover, the value of building internal capacity for making better business decisions among present and future business owners must be acknowledged. REFERENCES (1)Bracker, J. and J.

Rose, Central Missouri State University Calvin Wong, Central Missouri State University ABSTRACT A survey of 200 SBI directors yielded 124 returns which descri bed their case load, personal experience in the SBI, and how they spent the income received fro m the Small Business Administration for completed case studies. While some correlation was found between types and size s of institutions, the experience of th e director and the case load of the school, the predictive value of these factors was ne gligible in determining the use of the funds. No universal use of the funds was found and, although several major ca tegories of expenditure were evident, individual institutional differences and need seemed to dominate th e way the funds were spent. Each school used its own priorities, emphasizing a few uses rather than spreading out the funds ov er many possible purposes . Travel for SBIDA meetings and student case expenses were the most co mmon use but some schools placed a higher value on office expenses, purchase of equipment, faculty supervision of student teams, director 's salary, and gene ral fund expenses. Suggestions follow for use of the data and for future research. INTRODUCTION The broad diversity of SBI pr ograms is evident to anyone attending a nati onal meeting of SBI directors or reading about the unique characteristics of approaches used in case studies published in a variety of journals. This study was designed to see if there were commonalities between the control of moni es received from the Small Business Administration for case studies and the way the m oney earned is spent because of the type of institution involved, the number of cases completed, or the experience of the director. A se cond purpose was to see if the control element affected the way in which the case money was used. THE SAMPLE Questionnaires were sent to 200 SBIDA members on a random basis. The information presented and conclusions reached in this study are based on 124 useabl e returns or 62% of the possible return s. This high rate of return is even more gratifying when it is realized that the membership list from which the sample was taken includes types of individuals who are not directors that would be inclined to answer the quer y. Administrators who attended a national convention as well as faculty members and graduate students who were required to join the organization in order to present a paper at the preceding convention are included on th e membership roster without identification as to their status with SBIDA. The returns represented 43 states, all ten SBIDA regions, and a wide di fferential of case loads in institutions ranging from small liberal arts colleges to la rge state universities. Both public and private colleges and universities were represented by SBI directors w hose experience spanned a continuum from newc omers to veterans of twenty years work with SBI programs. CASE LOADS There is certainly no uniformity in the al location of case loads to colleges and universities, nor is there any reason for such an allocation. Variables are suggested under the secti on of the study concerning expe rience levels of directors which may explain the differences that are found. The range of cases reported in the samp le varied from 1 to 80 with a median of 14. Some 36% of the institutions completed ten or less cases and 14% more than thirty case s. These large case loads were found in ten states throughout the country but with only SBIDA regions 4, 6, and 7 repor ting three or more such heavy commitments of SBI funds. These heaviest users were, as might be expected, from larger ce ntral and regional state universities and a few large private institutions. Only one state coll ege reported a large case load and none of the smaller colleg es and universities received 30 cases or more. Conversely, the smallest loads tended to be found in the sm aller institutions although se veral exceptions of large universities with small loads were not ed. The small loads (of fi ve or less cases) were found in all regions and 27 different states. It was not surprising to find a direct re lationship between institutional size and case loads nor the community size from which the cases can be drawn. The institutions with five or less cases had a median student enrollment of only 2,775 and a median community size of 28,000. By comparison, the la rge case load schools had an average student enrollment of 11,600 and were located in cities with a median population of 174,000. The experience level of the SBI Director seems to have a direct correlation w ith the number of cases awarded. In the high case load group, the majority of the directors had over ten years experience and none less than four years experience. No director in thos e institutions with 5 or less cases had worked with the SBI for more than three years. The type of university or college also seem ed to bear little relevance to case si ze, i.e., whether a central state university, a regional state university, a large private university, or even a state college did not seem to affect the case loads. The small - private schools and colleges were different only in the fact that none of them had a large case load. SPENDING CONTROL There also seems to be little relationship between the expe rience level of directors and the control of case funds received from the Small Business Admi nistration. The funds of the majority of the programs (77%) are controlled by either the director alone or with the director sharing the control with a department chairm an or dean. Academic administrators have absolute control of some 18% of the programs and 5% of the schools have some predetermined use of the money dedicated to de partmental, school, or college general funds. The one noticeable difference was that the large central state universities and large private universities had less director control or input into spending patterns than the regional universities a nd smaller schools. Since it is apparent that mo st SBI directors have absolute or at least partial control of the SBI money, other fa ctors rather than experien ce are likely res ponsible for the control factor. It may well be that the strength of indivi dual personalities, the breadth rather th an length of experien ce, and the strength of the preceding director in t hose many schools with short tenured directors, dictates how SBI funds will be spent. Since such factors were not considered in this study, however, their impact cannot be determined. While there was some slight tendency for academic administr ators to control the use of funds in schools with medium sized case loads, no statistical importan ce is attributed to that information. EXPERIENCE LEVEL OF DIRECTORS The experience of directors vari es from zero to twenty years with a mean of 10.4 years. Seventy one percent, however, have ten or less years and over 12% have two or less years, indicating a relatively high turnover of SBI leadership. Table 1 shows the relationship of experience to the number of cases handled on an annual basis. The data shown in the table indicates a positive correlation between the experien ce level of the director and the number of cases assigned and/or completed by th e institution. The narrow spread, howev er, indicates that the correlation has little predictive value and is undoubtedly influenced by other factors as well as that experience. Such factors could include: (a) the dedication and commitment of the dire ctor and administrato rs of the program (b) the personality of the director and his or he r influence with the regi onal office of the SBA (c) the size of the service area of the college or univers ity with the attendant needs of the business community and potential number of cases available (d) the size of the institution and the potenti al number of student counselors available (e) whether or not the credit for the SBI course meets graduation re quirements or is a free elective ma y affect the number of student c ounselors available (f) how well developed and how long the program ha s been in place can both impress the SBA and business community Turnover of faculty, administrative support or lack thereof, background of the direct ors, salary adjustments and/or load adjustments are examples of factors which could affect the relative short term tenure of SBI directors. EXPENDITURE ANALYSIS Analysis of the data related to spending patterns of the funds received from the SBA can be studied in two ways as to what functions receive the largest portions of least some of their funding for such purposes. A slightly different view is noted when expenditures are classified as a portion of all reporting schools in the following table. CONCLUSIONS AND RE COMMENDATIONS The range of how case monies are expe nded does not fit a pattern but denotes a high level of local priorities and needs as far as individual institutions are conc erned. Over half the respondents to the su rvey allocated about a quarter of their case income to each of the categories of student expenses, SBIDA travel and office expenses for the director or program. In terms of aggregate expense allocation of all schools, SBIDA travel accounted for the most money used with student case expenses close behind. Expected solid correlation of spending and control with such variables as director expe rience, type of institution, geographical distribution, or number of case s contracted did not materialize or were of less than a si gnificant level of magnitude. Other variables not considered may well be better predictors and shoul d be investigated by future studies. It is suggested that schools allocating no SBA monies for the most used categories carefully reexamine their priorities and intended use of the funds. A prime example would be thos e schools that do not send th eir directors to regional or national meetings for the supposed reason of lack of travel funds. Overworked directors might take note of the schools that set aside funds to pay other faculty that help supervise the student counseling teams. Schools that spend all their funds might well consider a reserve for future c ontingencies. Since SBI funds are not usually kept in general fund accounts, they can be held ove r for the next year while other budgeted accounts may well disappear at the end of the fiscal year. Each school that does not have input fr om the SBI director on the use of the funds generated by the program should re- arrange their system to at least allow for such input. The SBA might well gather data on expenditures of funds for use in appropria tion requests - i.e. , that not only do small businesses profit from SBI consul ting but that the case funds are being used efficiently by higher e ducation institutions in their training of future business managers. Finally, it is suggested that another st udy be conducted that would determine how the Federal monies should be spent rather than how they are presently used.

In this pape r, ethical and value positions of Small Business Institute clients of one university are compared with thos e of senior undergraduate business SBI consultants. In general, little difference was found in et hical stands between the stude nts and small business owners, although particular situations ma y foster differences. Implicat ions are discussed for enhanc ing the effectiveness of the consulting relationship. INTRODUCTION Over 6,000 small business owners ar e being exposed to at least 15,000 students a year through Small Business Institutes. Are students and SBI clients \"ethically compatible\"? Do the two gr oups share the same ethics and values regarding what is right and wrong be havior in the business arena? There is a lack of information about the ethical values of SBI clients compared with thos e of student consultants, and this study is an attempt to fill that void. We are questioni ng whether there are differen ces in the ethical position undergraduate consultants and SB I clients perceive others have. Also, are there differences in the ethical positions between consultants and SBI clients them selves? We are concerned about these issu es because if there are difference, these differences may impact the effect iveness of the consulting process. The turmoil of the business environmen t during the seventies and eighties wa s a nurturing environment for business schools to add ethics to the curriculum. As a result, most accredited business schools have either added an ethics component to the curriculum through ethics courses and/or in corporated ethics into each of the functional areas (2), although the assessment of the impact of ethics education for business students is mixed (3; 5; 6; 11; 13; 14; 16). The emphasis by the AACSB on ethical covera ge in the curriculum (2) raises the issue of how similar or dissimilar the ethical postures of the SBI consultants are to the clients with whom they work. The mo re dissimilar the values, the more difficult it may be for a consultant to communicate and/or gain cred ibility with the small bus iness clients. If the fundamental ethical va lues of the student consultants and small business owners are mark edly different, the two groups may find little in common regarding how a business should be ope rated and/or how to interact with various entities in the environment. Furthermore, the perceived or actual valu e differences may also account for some perceptions that possibly the students may not have the necessary age and maturity, technical e xperience, or background and knowledge, to do quality c onsulting (10; 15; 20). Results of prior studies that have compared the ethical st andards of business students a nd business practitioners have been mixed as to simila rities or differences (e .g- 4; 7; 12; 18; 19). In addition to being inconclusive, all of the cited studies have measured the ethics of corporate ex ecutives and not those of small business owners. One study pertaining to small business was a survey of subscribers conducted by In c. The survey instrument contained four vignettes about small busin ess/entrepreneurs. In genera l, respondents said they woul d act in an ethical manner, since it seemed to be practical to think of the long-term conse quences of their actions (8). METHOD Sample The null hypothesis that we are testing is that there is no difference in ethical values between the student consultants and the SBI clients (SBI'S) with whom they consult. To te st this hypothesis we administered a questionnaire to student respondents who were a census of the en tire graduating class of Bu siness students in an AACSB accredited university during the last quarter of their ye ar of graduation (See Table 1). Questionnaires were administered in-class to 112 students. All of them had used SBI consultin g cases as their learnin g methodology, and they had all had the same instructor for th eir SBI consulting course. The same questionnaire was sent to all the SBI clients that had worked with the school in th e past one and a half years. Eighty eight questionnaires were sent and 28 usable ones were returned for a response rate of 32% for the clients. There is a greater proportion of males in the student population than the SBI population, ages are different with the students in 20 to 30 range with the clients being in 31 to 50 ra nge. Almost all of the SBI clie nts had no ethics course in their background while over ha lf of the student populati on had a specific course. Questionnaire Eight vignettes from the business ethics scale developed by Clark (9) were used. Where necessary the scenarios were updated to reflect current times. For each vignette the re spondents were asked to assess whether the person in the scenario would take a certain action or not and whether they themselves would or would not take the action. Vignettes, or short descriptions of a person and/or situation, have been found to be a more reli able, less biased method of measuring human attitudes and values than abstract questions attempting to direct ly probe the construct of interest (1; 9). Another question, also from the Clark study (9), asked re spondents who they would prefer to work with: One individual who adheres strongly and st rictly to ethical commitm ents (\"non-compromising\") or another individual who is sensitive and responsive to the values of coworkers (\"flex ible\"). This question was include d to determine if there is any difference in the preference of ethical conduct of business associates between the students and SBI's. A final set of questions, also from Clark (9). asked responde nts for their level of approval to five ways that business ethics could be improved. Data Analysis Data were coded and analyzed using SPSS-X. Chi-square was used to test for statistical ly significant differences between SBI's and students on their responses to the eight vi gnettes and the question pertaining to the coworker. T-tests were used to determine if there were any statistically significant differences be tween the two groups on how they feel business ethics might be improved. FINDINGS Ethical Scenarios Questi ons 1-8 (See Appendix) When asked what the person in the scenario would do in res ponse to the ethical dilemma th ey are facing, the responses between the SBI clients and the students ar e not significantly different in seven out of eight scenarios. (see Table 2.) The one question that elicits a response di fference at a statistically significant le vel (P = .001) is Q5(a). The SBI clients felt that Boldt Manufacturing would i ndeed give advanced notice to its employees of the upcoming plant shutdown whereas the students felt the comp any would keep it a secret unt il the day of dismissal. The responses to question 8(a) , though not significantly differe nt, suggest that there was vi rtually no question in SBI's minds that the Vice President of the co mpany would send Christmas gifts to th e customers (96%), whereas only 80% o f the students felt that th e VP would send gifts. When comparing what SBI clients and students felt they th emselves would do in each of the situations, again only one of the scenarios was able to generate a statistically significant di fference in responses. (See Table 3.) In question 2(b) none of the SBI clients said they would supplement their in come with unauthorized persona l expenses whereas 17% of the students would (significant at .04 level). And on QB(b) a higher percentage of the students responded that they themselves would send gifts to the buyers if they were the company vice president than woul d SBI clients if they were the VP. Table 4 compares the self described act ion choices of only those SBI's and stude nts who felt the person in the scenario would make the less ethical choice. There are no significant differences alt hough clearly some directions are indicated in Questions 1, 2, 4, and 8. In question one, on the issue of using insi der information to purchase stock, 63% of the SBI's who thought the person in the scenario would buy stock would buy the stock themselves but less than half of th e business students would. In question two not a single one of the SBI's would pad the expense account even if they thought the person in the scenario would, whereas 25% of the st udents would. In question four there wa s a somewhat greater tendency for the SBI clients who felt the company would discharge older workers to say they th emselves would disc harge older workers than for the students. In the gift scenario of Question ei ght there was a greater tendenc y for the business students who felt the person in the scenario would send gifts to also respond that they would send gifts than for the SBI's. Another interesting finding is that for question five. The clients and students had differed in their perceptions of what the person in the scenario would do (Table 2), yet the fact they felt the person in scenario would keep the planned shutdown a secret did not af fect their own strong belief that they th emselves would inform the employees. A greater percentage of the students (43% ) preferred to work with the more fl exible White than did the SBI's (29%) although this was not signi ficantly different. Both students and SBI's preferred to wo rk with the noncom- promising Easton. Ways of Improving Busine ss Ethics (Question 16) Both the SBI's and students seemed to approve of at l east three ways of improving business ethics (Table 6): developing principles of bus iness ethics, having ethics courses in busin ess schools (most favored by both groups), and having industry codes of ethics. The differences were not significant in wh at the SBI's and students approved of. Th e SBI's were less favorably disposed to legislating stronger legislation than business students although neither group was particularly in favor of that option. An even less appealing option was to get religious leaders mo re active in business. The gr eatest differen ce, still not significant however, was in the religious leaders getting involved with students disapproving ev en more than SBI's. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION There is not much difference in self described values betwee n SBI clients and students. Th e one scenario reflecting a significant difference in respon ses might be reflective of the attitude - \"if everyone else is doing it, why not.\" (17). In the case of padding the expense account and sending gifts, the students tend to be more inclined than the SBI's to do it themselves. This is leaning toward holding a more \"flexible\" situational definition of ethics which is also reflected in a greater percentage of the students prefe rring the more flexible White (Table 5) as a coworker than the SBI clients preferred. What impact having exposure to bus iness ethics classes has is certainly not clear. Are ethics classes geared to making students act more ethically? Woul d this group have preferre d less ethical postures if they had not had the ethics class they did have? More important than differences between SBI clients and student consultants may be the tendency in both populations to feel that though they would act in an ethical way - th e person in the scenario would not. This was especially prevalent in Q1 (Table 4) with forty of the business students feel ing they would not buy stock with insider information although they felt the person in the scen ario would - 7 of the SBI's responded th at way also. Forty nine (75%) of the students who thought the person in the scenario would pad an expense account, would not themselves. On Q4, of the business students thinking the person in the scenario woul d discharge older workers, 36% thought they themselves would discharge the younger workers. on Q8, 44% of the SBI's who felt the person in the scenario would send gifts, they themselves would not. On the surface, it looks like more communication would be necessary among SB I's and or among students as well as between groups to get a better understandi ng of what people think and why. And, a lthough it does not appear that there are significant differences in values of student consultants and the SBI clients at least at the university in this SBI program, an individual client's values could differ greatly from any individual student or groups' values in certain situations. How did self selection of SBI respondent s affect findings - were those who res ponded representative of the entire SBI population at that universit y? Will this findin g hold also for MBA consultants? Does the gender of team members influence the outcome? What about the gender of the SBI clie nt or the gender of person in scenario? What impact do the faculty, mentors/guides, and SBI direct or have? Are the faculty's values differ ent from students' and/or clients\". Do the values differ from SBI type client s to big business clients? Just what role do percei ved value differences or similarities play in effectiv e consultation experiences for the SBI program? What impact does age of participants have on the findings? Will these findings differ with different parts of the country ? Internationally are business people's values perceived differently? What impact does size of business have, if any, on outcomes? What impact is there of required ethics courses? What impact does experience in workplace have on valu es? What impact does the industry or type of client have on these findings? Does the compositi on of majors make a difference - i.e., would marketing students have values more similar to certain types of business clients than would accounting students? This preliminary cross disciplinary study ha s just scratched the surface. The actual differences in values/ethics between students and SBI clients is possibly not as important an issue as the general issue of being aware of individual perceptions within groups - the one SBI cl ient a team has. Clarifying the indivi dual's goals/objectives of the business must be done from an individual's fram ework - not a class or group. Effective SBI consulting wi ll start from where an individual small business ow ner feels he or she is, not where the consultant thinks that person is.

The role of the Small Business Institute program is one of the most effective ve hicles for management assistance based on the results of a variety of past re search efforts. Therefore, a better understanding of th e Small Business Institute programs will provide added insight fo r their development and continued cont ribution to the success of the small business sector in the U.S. economy. This study is based on a survey mailed to all Small Business Institute Directors. The st udy examined the reasons small businesses request counseling, as well as the role of other information s ources such as SCORE, SBDC, and advisory committees. The role of the SBI Direct or, course pedagogy, budget control, and number of cases were also assessed. The demographics of the institution, as well as the director were also examined. INTRODUCTION The continued emphasis on small business as a major component of our economy and, in particular, as one viable element in national and regional economic growth and development suggests conti nual attention. In many areas of the country where economic conditions have reflected a downturn, it has been consis tently recognized that the future prospects for economic growth can be enhanced by the role of small business. Small busine sses are an integral, indeed a major economic institution in the ec onomy of the United States. Estimates as high as 60 percent have been made concerning the nation's work force whic h is employed in the small business sector. Small businesses account for approximately 40 percent of the country's Gross National Product (11). Consistently, ec onomic development studies recommend that small businesses are areas where growth, innovation and expa nsion provide a real opportunity for responding to ever changing environments (9). Unfortunately, the failure rate for small business within the fi rst year approximate s one-half while es timates run as high as 80 percent within the first three to five years (1). Th e obvious question is how to protect against the economic and social costs associated with these conditions which is most often a result of poor management. The role of the Small Business Institute (SBI) program is one of the most eff ective vehicles for small busin ess assistance based on the conclusions of a variety of past studies. These programs he lp to improve operations and/or reduce the rates of failure with subsequent effective utilization of their limited resources (12;10;8;3). Al though a constant effort has been made through research and analysis in both education and governme nt, many issues remain unres olved regarding the present and potential role of small business (13;6;14;7;5;2;4). The need remains for a better understandi ng of the SBI program as an effective tool in assisting small businesses to continue their contributions to the economy and at the same ti me to fulfill their role as the foundation for all business, since all businesses were once small. PURPOSE The purpose of the research is to ex amine the SBI program and obtain a more comprehensive appreciation of their activities and to establish a contemporary posture of these programs. Additi onally, this research w ill provide a clearer definition of the role of SB I programs and examine methods to improve their contributions to small business by assisting .owner/managers in a more efficient allocation of th eir human and financial resource s. In order to meet these objectives, specific research questions are as follows: 1. What are the ma jor reasons small businesses re quested counselin g in 1989-90? 2. What supporting services are offered through SBI programs? 3. What percent of SBI's are affiliated with SBDC'S? 4. What is the nature of the SBI course and student's grade? 5. What proportion of cases are co mpleted per year and what proporti on of those are not funded? 6. What is the normal teaching load for the SBI Director , and does the individual have a reduced teaching load? 7. Which university office controls the budget for the SBI program? 8. What sources other than SBI Director s are used for advisory assistance? 9. Do SBI programs have advisory committees, a nd what is the nature of such committees? 10. What are the characteristics of the SBI institution as well as the director? METHODOLOGY A complete universe data base was used which comprised a ll SBI directors. This data base was derived from the 1990 official roster of me mbership of Small Business Ins titute Directors' Association (S BIDA). The universe of 516 was reduced to 501, since some programs were fo und to no longer be in existence. This study is based on a survey mailed to 501 directors on August 24, 1990. After a follow-up mailing, a total of 300 co mpleted questionnaires were returned which resulted in a response rate of 60 percent. The research was undertaken to develop a current profile of SBI programs and to establish a foundation for analysis and subsequent measur ement. Data for this paper was requested from al l SBI's in the United States. Figure 1 is a map which shows the ten U. S. regions according to the Smal l Business Administration's designation. The following two sections provide a summary of computat ions from the results of the study. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF SM ALL BUSINESS INSTITUTES The following section describes aspects relating to the organizational structur e of SBI's such as demographics of SBI institutions and directors. Also, geogra phic location, size of the institutions, a nd relationship with the Small Business Development Center (S BDC) are examined. Demographics of SBI's Table I illustrates the approximate number, 501, of SBI pr ograms in the United States segmented by SBA region. For instance, the largest number, 98, or 20% of the total 501, ar e located in Region 5. Also, 68 out of the 300 responses were from this region which accounted fo r 69% of the SBI's in that region. Th e region having the lowest return was Region 1 with only 28% of the directors responding. Geographical Location Figure 2 shows a breakdown of the SBI directors responding to the study according to the geographic location of their institutions. For instance, 32% of the responding SBI's were locate d in the Midwest United States. Size of Academic Organization Over 60% of the institutions responding were colleges and uni versities with enrollments of less than 10,000 students. In fact, a pproximatel y 40% were institutions with less than 5,000 students as observed from Fi gure 3. Demographics of Directors Some 97% of the SBI directors held advanced degrees and ha d served in the director's pos ition for a number of years. For instance, some 57% held the doctorate, and only 36% had se rved 4 years or less. The majority of the SBI Directors responding, 86%, were male, while female directors accounted for 14%. The majo rity of the directors' academic specialization was in the fiel d of management which accounted for almo st one-half of the to tal respondents. The directors reported numerous types of business and professional experience. As may be noted in Table 2, consulting experience was mentioned most often by approximately one-half of the responding di rectors, while sales, retailing, and production followed with smaller proportions. Relationship SBDC The organizational structure for assisting small businesses appears to reflect a traditional patter n of continuity. That is, the survey responses clearly indicate over 80% of the SBI programs have direct access to SBDC. Based on 59% of the responses, the location of the SBDC is housed in the same location as the SBI program as depicted in Figure 4. OPERATIONAL BEHAVIOR This section describes certain areas of operational behavioral associated with th e SBI program such as the nature of counseling, supporting services, and case load. Also, teac hing responsibility, budgetary authority, and sources of management assistan ce are analyzed. Nature of Counsel The major area of requested counseling wa s in the functional area of marketing; i.e., sales, advertising and general marketing. Following marketing were marketing res earch, start-up advice, accounting, and fi nancing as major reasons as observed in Table 3. Few respondent reported requests for assistance concerning legal issues. Supporting Services Observable from Figure 5, Small Business In stitute programs also offer supporting se rvices in addition to their primary role of manageme nt assistance. It is noteworthy that over 21% of the respondents indicated they had offered seminars; additionally, another 11% of the directors had held conf erences. Further, 10% of the respondents offered other supporting services, such as indi vidual counseling and research. The Nature of the Course A significant number, 82%, of the res ponding directors reported that the SBI program was offered through an elective course, rather than a course which was required. Only one fo urth of the respondents stated that the SBI programs were a part of a required course. The course mentioned most often was the ca pstone business course entitled, Business Policy/Strategy. Figure 6 clearl y conveys the importance of the counseling project as a partial requirement for the course. Over half of the directors indi cated that the SBI consulting project enco mpasses more than 75% of the grade. Funded and Non-Funded Cases The largest number of cases completed during the academic year, 1989-90, as reported by 72% of the directors was within the range of 1-9. The median nu mber of cases was computed to be 12. Only 11 percent of the institutions completed 30 cases or more in th is period as shown by Figure 7. More than half, 54%, of the directors re ported that they completed more cases than the Small Business Administration funded in 1989. The median number per in stitution of non-funded cases for this period was 4. Therefore, through extrapolation, a figure in the vicinity of 2,000 cases a year are the directors counted the project three fourths of the course grade. The average number of cases completed per SBI program during the acad emic year, 1989-90, was 12. Over 72% of the directors completed a range of 1-9 cases. Over one half of the directors comple ted more cases than were funded by the SBA; the average number of unfunded cases was 4. The majority of the directors, 74%, were fulfilling the role of the SBI director in addition to, a full teaching load at their respective institutions. Only 34% were permitted a reduced teaching assignment, which was typically three semester hours. The budgetary aut hority for the SBI program was at the director's level in 52% of the responding institutions. In addition to the director, the faculty of each institutio n were relied upon as a major information resource for small business client manageme nt assistance. Also, 32% of the directors ut ilized the experience of SCORE personnel. Over 80% of the directors did not have an advisory committee. This situation ma y be an avenue to pursue as a means o f obtaining additional management assistan ce with a minimal cost of providing service to the small businesses. The survey findings reveal that busin esses requested many types of counseli ng. it would appear directors should continue to seek outside resources for this additional assi stance. Since directors reported they possessed a variety of business and professional expe rience, it would suggest th at overall the SBI's are furnishing valuable management assistance to their communities at low cost.
