The number o f applications received has grown every year, thus increasing the competition for awards and making the criteria and point system even more important. A ll the articles paid for and published so far have been p laced in the KU ScholarWorks institutional repository under \"Open Access .\" Included in this report are the statistics for FY 20 20 in the following tables: Table 1. Numbers of applications and awards Table 2. Total amount spent and a break down by campus We've also included appendices covering the fund from Inception (Oct. 2012) through June 2020: Appendix A A Short History of the First Six Years of the Open Access Author Fund Appendix B Cumulative Statistics Appendix C Trends Appendix D Full List of Published Papers Funded by the OAAF Appendix E Applications Received by Unit 2 KU Open Access Author Fund Annual Report, FY 20 Table 1. Statistics for FY 20 20 When compared to the figures from the previous fiscal year (July 201 8-June 201 9), there was an 31% increase in the number of applications received , which led to an increase in applicants rejected due to limited funds . The number of awards that were offered and paid were similar . FY20 FY19 1. Applications Received 68 52 2. Applications Rejected * 33 21 3. Awards Offered 35 31 4. Awards Paid ** 23 20 Note: Seven of the authors who were offered awards in FY 20 haven't used them as of July 31 , 2020, so the number of \"Awards Paid\" might still go up. The n umbers in Lines 2 and 3 above add up to the total number of applications received (Line 1). Line 4 is a sub -set of Line 3. * Main r easons why applications were r ejected 1. Other applications received higher point totals and there wasn't enough money to fund all eligible applicants during that month's competition. (By far the most common reason.) 2. The au thor, journal, or publisher did not meet the OAAF criteria. ** Main r easons why awards were not u sed 1. The manuscript was rejected by the editor / editorial board of the journal. 2. The author did not use the award before it expired (4 months from the award notification date). 3 Table 2. Financial Statistics for FY 20 20 Amount allocated for FY 20 $25,000 Awards not redeemed in FY 19 $11,597 Total amount available in FY 20 $36,597 As of the end of FY 20, we had $ 239.90 remaining in the fund , which was rolled over to FY 21. As of July 31, 2020, there is $ 8,432 in rese rve for awards made during FY 20 for articles still in the submission process. The portion of those funds not used before the four -month expiration date will be returned to the OAAF for use in FY 21. Awards by C ampus (as of July 31, 2020) KU Medical Center (All Locations) $17,426 62.4% KU Lawrence / Edwards $10,500 37.6% Total Expenditures $27,926 Note: Total does not include $ 8,432 for awards offered but not used. Dollar amounts have been rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Percentages have been rounded to equal 100% Amount Paid per Award in FY20 (as of July 31, 2020 ) Highest $1,500 Lowest $550 Average / Mean $1,214 Median $1,365 What Publishers Charge Authors The amount of money publishers charged authors applying for awards this year ranged from a high of $5,000 to a low of $ 180. Thirty -six of the sixty-eight charges were over our $1500 maximum award amount. Highest $5,000 Lowest $180 Average / Mean $1,583 Median $1,595 4 Appendix A A Short History of the Open Access Author Fund at KU The One University Open Access Author Fund (OAAF) at the University of Kansas is administered by the OAAF Review Team composed of library staff at the KU campus in Lawrence and at the KU Medica l Center's Dykes Library in Kansas City. Oversight is provided by the sponsors who support the fund - KU's Provost, KU's Vice Chancellor for Research, and the KU Medical Center's Vice Chancellor for Research. Detailed criteria and eligibility standards, an online application form, a list of awards made, and additional information is available at this URL: http://library.kumc.edu/authors -fund.xml . The OAAF began its first two -year pilot program in October of 2012 with $50,000 allocated equally by the Lawrence campus and the Medical Center. During that first pilot, whic h closed at the end of June 2014, applications were reviewed on a first -come, first -served basis. This resulted in the entire years' worth of funds being dispersed within four to six months of the opening of the fund. To ensure that money would be available for an entire fiscal year during the second pilot phase (2014 -2016), the OAAF Review Team solicited the advice of the members of the Faculty Consultation Group. Additional criteria, new eligibility standards, and diffe rent review periods were developed. In the redesigned competitive process, all the applications received during one month are now reviewed within the first seven business days of the next month. Various levels of weighted priority are now assigned as follo ws: A. Author 's status (graduate student, pre -tenured faculty, early career research staff, etc.) B. Author's access to grants or other funding C. Author's record of previous OA awards received This second phase of the pilot began in November 2014 with a new all ocation of $50,000 to cover 2014 -2016. Awards were made using the new criteria and procedures. The fund has subsequently received $50,000 in July 2016 , July 2018 , and July 2020 . The fund will continue to distribute awards through June 20 22. The number of f und applications has ranged between two and nine each month, out of which an average of one to three are approved. All of the articles that are paid for (at least in part) by the OAAF are now available for viewing at the O AAF website here - http://library.kumc.edu/oa -fund- awards.xml . The same articles are also added to KU ScholarWorks , the institutional repository of the University of Kansas at: https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/11673 . The OAAF is marketed to faculty and graduate students through our website, social media, email, and group presentations. Future Plans The O AAF provides important assistance to help KU's faculty/researchers and students publish in reputable journals that a llow for open sharing. One possible action we might take is to conduct an environment scan of other universities' OA fund policies and procedures. We would also like to evaluate article metrics to determine the impact of our OA funded articles from the inception of the fund. 5 Appendix B Cumulative Statistics Totals, Inception - June 20 20 The following tables document the outcomes of the OAAF applications and awards process from the inception of the fund (Oct ober 2012) through the end of the eight year ( June 20 20).
