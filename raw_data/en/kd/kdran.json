The organs that make up this system are the skin, glands, nails, hair, and sense receptors. In addition, the skeletal frame is superficial to the cutaneous membrane in the human body. The reduced skin temperature cause relative levels of body cooling, which lowers the muscle temperatures. Consequently, the muscles weaken and result in impairment of the neuro-muscular function, which cause most of the skiing injuries. In addition, the drop in temperature can result in cold injury. Cold injury occurs in the exposed body parts like the feet, hands, and face, due to formation of ice crystals, freezing of tissues, or vasoconstriction which limits blood flow to the exposed body part, which results in ischematic cold injury. For this unit discussion assignment I picked \" To Build a fire by London Jack \" because this story is very interesting and to learn from.About the decision that we make in life and it consequences especially when we ignore the advice of the elders. We divided all of our experiments into three sections; the first category's experiments are aimed at the survival of Axis military personnel. The second category tests pharmaceutical products and treatments for injuries and illnesses that people experienced in the field. The third category is to spread Nazi ideology. We have been using the prisoners, such as homosexuals, Jews, and Soviet prisoners as test subjects for our experiments. The experiments are going to be conducted under the supervision of Dr. Sigmund Rascher at the camps of Dachau, Birkenau, and Auschwitz. The biggest impediment to achieving target temperature is shivering. The shivering reflex is triggered when the core body temperature drops. Shivering increases metabolic rate oxygen consumption, heart rate, and respiratory rate. If left untreated, shivering may negate any benefit of temperature management. Evidence-based protocols for temperature management must include shivering prevention (Presciutti, Bader, & Hepburn, 2012). The Bedside Shivering Assessment Scale which measures from 0 being no shivering, 1 is mild with shivering to neck and/or thorax, 2 being moderate with shivering including the upper extremities, and 3 being severe with shivering all over the body. Treatment ranges from skin counterwarming, Acetaminophen, Magnesium Sulfate, Dexmedetomidine, Propofol and lastly a (Presciutti et al, 2012). A therapeutic hypothermia checklist guideline helps to keep everything in check any up to When a medical team deliberately reduces the core body temperature of their patients, they are using a technique called induced hypothermia. A human's healthy, body temperature will typically hover around 98.6 degrees fahrenheit; however, once hypothermia consumes the patient, their body will reduce to a temperature between 89.6 and 93.2 degrees fahrenheit. Today, there are technologies that will use cooling blankets or cooling catheters, which contain cold saline and are inserted into the femoral vein, to rapidly drop the patient's body temperature. The ultimate goal of induced hypothermia is to prevent neural and cell damage in the brain after traumatic brain injured patients. Typically, the brain will not survive without oxygen for The hypothesis proposed was that the heart rate would increase when the individual was indirectly affected by cold temperature and which would decrease the pulse delay time. Based on the results obtained from the experiment, the hypothesis was supported. The increase in heart rate by indirect contact of cold temperature increased the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is the part of the autonomic nervous system which is responsible in increasing the heart rate. Metabolism is the sum of all anabolic and catabolic reactions within a living organism to sustain life. The energy required to perform these reactions is provided by oxygen in the form of ATP, therefore the oxygen consumption rate can be measured to determine the metabolic rate. Since oxygen is obtained through respiration, the efficiency of an organism's respiratory system affects its metabolism. Previous studies have shown that caffeine affects the human respiratory center and occasionally dilates bronchus. It can thus stimulate human respiration and increase the metabolic rate (Haggins et al, 1915). If you 're anything like me, your dog is your furbaby, and you 'll do anything to protect him or her. But protecting your dog from the elements, particularly from the heat, could not even be on your radar, and it should be. Homeostasis is the body's method of keeping internal stability no matter what external influence disturbs its normal functioning (Anna, 2011). And the respiratory system is one of the systems in the body that helps to maintain homeostasis by maintaining pH and regulating gas exchange. The main function of this system is take in oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. This system has external respiration and internal respiration. External respiration is a mechanical process that exchange of gases in and out of the body, while internal respiration is the chemical process that breaking down nutrients with oxygen to produce energy. Lung volume and lung capacity are two measurements of respiratory health and measured during pulmonary functions tests. It is show the physical condition of the lungs. Pulmonary ventilation, or breathing, is the process of air flowing into the lungs during inspiration (inhalation) and out of the lungs during expiration (exhalation). Air flows because of pressure differences between the atmosphere and the gases inside What is the impact of the distribution of skin receptors in different areas of the body? Talking about skin aging is a sensitive topic these days as no one would like to actually picture the whole process of their skin losing that youthful appeal after a few years. However, it is essential to know that our skin is like any other part of our body. To be more scientific, skin is the largest organ of the human body. This organ is the first layer which serves as the line of defense and prevents the entry of harmful microbes as well as harmful particles. Apart from this, the body temperature is regulated and the moisture content in the body is also regulated to a certain extent by the skin. The skin is the largest organ. It covers the whole body and is water-resistant. The skin consists of two layers; the Epidermis and Dermis (under which lies the subcutaneous or fatty layer). The human body provides the ideal environment for the microbes such as bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi to enter the body. Thus, it is the jobs of the immune system to keep them out by protect the body from the harmful substances. Immune system is when the networks of cells and tissues work together to defend the body against the foreign invaders.(Menche,2012 and National Institute Health,2003). According to the Latin word, immune come from the word immunis which is free or untouched. So it is mean that our body must free from the all pathogens that can lead to the diseases. The immune system also can recognize all the millions of the foreign invaders by attacking them and prevent them from enter the body, thus The human body is an amazing thing made up of many different parts. These parts are cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems. For starters, one type of cell makes up one type of tissue. Next, two or more types of tissues make an organ. Then, a few organs working together make an organ system. Each of the organ systems in your body have a certain function, or job. Working together, all of these organ systems make up an organism. In other words, cells make up tissues, tissues make up organs, organs make up organ systems, and organ systems make an organism. "}
