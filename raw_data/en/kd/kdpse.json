No, not the massive Masonic temple adorned with a pair of stone sphinxes and an eerie ziggurat. (The temple's certainly odd, but D.C. residents quickly stop noticing it.) Rather, what caught my eye was the scene in front of the temple: On the wide steps, beneath the sphinxes' unnerving gaze, there sat a bright blue, NASCAR-style race car, looking entirely out of place\u2014as though it had magically teleported to this spot from some tobacco-stained test track in North Carolina. On the car's hood\u2014where you'd expect to find the logo of a famous brand, like Home Depot or Budweiser\u2014there was a painting of an eagle with two heads. On the car's side was a strange little glyph: a [drafter's compass crossed with a set square](http://altreligion.about.com/library/glossary/symbols/bldefsmasoniccompass.htm). On the rear bumper was written \"ScottishRite.org.\" The [Scottish Rite](http://www.scottishrite.org/ee.php?) is a worldwide organization of Freemasons\u2014the centuries-old fraternity that is sometimes accused of controlling \"like, everything, man,\" and counts among its members several founding fathers and a slew of presidents (including George Washington, both Roosevelts, and, more recently, Gerald Ford). The Rite's global headquarters are housed in [that giant, intimidating temple](http://www.scottishrite.org/where/hq.html) on my street. The compass with square is a traditional symbol of Freemasonry. None of which answers my real question: Why on earth are the Masons advertising on the hood of a stock car? I called up Stan Dodd, who manages public relations for the Scottish Rite. (Yes, even the notoriously secretive Masons have a PR guy.) \"Like a lot of other civic groups,\" he said, \"we've seen our membership get a little older, and we've seen some retraction in our numbers.\" Dodd says the Masons' median age right now is in the 60s. \"We need some younger members.\" Enter NASCAR. Driver Brian Conz (who competes in NASCAR's Busch Series races) is a Mason and helped engineer this deal between his race team and the Scottish Rite. By appearing on the hood of Conz's car, the Rite will reach millions of viewers during ESPN's race coverage. (Up to 30 million \"impressions\" per race\u2014a figure that calculates the number of people watching, and the number of times a portion of the car appears on screen.) \"The NASCAR demographics fit our demographics,\" says Dodd. When I ask him to be more specific, he just says, \"Men.\" (I'll leave you to draw your own conclusions about what other attributes the NASCAR demographic and the Scottish Rite demographic might share. Dodd says the only previous major promotion he's done is with a Masonic country singer who writes songs with titles like \"The Masonic Ring\" and \"The Rite Stuff.\" I should also note that there is a separate, [much smaller division of the Scottish Rite](http://www.supremecouncil.org/), which holds jurisdiction over 15 northern and northeastern states\u2014this crowd might be less likely to exhibit a passion for NASCAR and country music.) Why choose now, after decades of very low-key or nonexistent membership marketing, to suddenly chase ESPN-level visibility? \"The culturalists we've talked to,\" says Dodd, \"tell us there's a window. Young people these days are looking for ways to give back to their communities.\" While the outside world likes to picture the Masons as a shadowy cabal of power brokers, Dodd describes them simply as \"men with like interests\" who do good works. He says Masons donate about $2 million a day to charity, pointing out projects like the Scottish Rite's efforts on behalf of children with hearing and speech pathologies, or the free hospital care famously provided by the Shriners (another Masonic group). Dodd says that Masons have gotten some bad press lately\u2014he takes issue with The Da Vinci Code, which [portrayed the Masons](http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/fiction/davincicode.html) as part of a vast, globo-religio-historical web of intrigue\u2014and he feels the NASCAR affiliation is a way to counter those negatives and promote the Scottish Rite as a crew of kindhearted Samaritans. But don't worry, pie-eyed conspiracy theorists. There's fodder in this story for you, too. What's the Scottish Rite paying for all this national television exposure\u2014plus the exposure at promotional events in which the Scottish Rite car appears at malls and such, plus the Scottish Rite logo showing up on the team's souvenir merchandise at the track and online, and so forth? Nothing. Dodd says the Rite's only contribution is \"some staff support.\" Dodd also acknowledges that buying placement on the hood of a Busch Series car would generally cost, for a commercial sponsor, up to and over $2 million per season. I called Joe Hill, head of public relations for Brian Conz's racing team, and asked him to explain how he expected to make up this missing money. What is the team getting from the Scottish Rite in lieu of all that cash? \"We're aligning ourselves with a dynamic, worldwide organization. We expect access and introduction to their members, who will assist us in meeting executive-level corporate leaders interested in getting involved with racing.\" Presumably, these rich and important men (because there are no female Masons, after all) will prove useful in sponsoring race teams down the line. So, Brian Conz and his race team seem to share at least one belief with the conspiracy theorists: That Freemasonry is a path to great access and influence. The existence of this notion is a boon for the Masons, as evidently it convinces some people to forgo great sums of money just to get on their good side. Grade: It all depends on how well the team does. If the car is leading races for dozens of laps at a time, the Masons will get obscene amounts of airtime. If it's lagging at the back, not so much. Either way, there's no doubt this ad buy is easy on the marketing budget. (Not like the Masons need it. They recently [sold some real estate](http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20060712/ai_n16527925) they owned in Chicago for more than $50 million.) It would be impossible to write a \"Bad Advice\" column about investing without discussing Jim Cramer. I have been through several stages of feelings about Cramer. My initial belief was that the former hedge-fund manager, host of CNBC's hit show Mad Money, and author of several books about speculating was perhaps the worst thing to happen to the financial security of average Americans since the crumbling of the Social Security system. I developed this theory in the early Mad Money days, when Cramer's stock-picking track record\u2014if on-air shouts, blurts, and Tourette's-style tics can ever be called a \"record,\" which, in a serious context, they obviously can't\u2014remained close enough to market averages that Cramer was not laughed out of town when he suggested with a straight face that he was giving good advice. His claim, of course, was ludicrous: Over short time frames, even orangutans have about a 50/50 chance of beating the market, especially when ignoring risks and costs, so his pointing to a several-month record as evidence of good advice was absurd. In 2006, however, when the performance of Cramer's ravings relative to the market went south, he downplayed the idea that he could help viewers whip Wall Street, and, instead, said that he had \"just one goal in mind\u2014to help you make money.\" According to one observer, [he apparently failed to clear even this low hurdle last year](http://madmoneymachine.com/portfolios/), despite nearly every major equity market on earth being up between about 15 percent and 30 percent. As readers of this column and the \" [Wall Street Self-Defense\" series](http://www.slate.com/id/2105036/) know, when investment gurus start patting themselves on the back for \"making you money,\" they are condescendingly presuming that you know almost nothing about investing. When you own a diversified portfolio of stocks, it is rarely the stock selections that make you money but the performance of the stock market overall\u2014which, thankfully, usually goes up. What a truly talented stock-picker will do is select stocks that beat the market, after costs, without exposing you to more risk than the market. Because the vast majority of stock-pickers can't do this, you are almost always better off in a diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds. Properly constructed, such a portfolio will, over decades, make you more money, with less risk, than even an above-average stock-picker (let alone a chair-throwing, self-aggrandizing clown). But the more I thought about Cramer, the more I realized that pointing out that he gives terrible investment advice would be like pointing out that the sun rises. Worse, I would be dismissed as a wet blanket who didn't get that the point of Mad Money was just to have a bit of ironic fun. I mean, of course [Jim Cramer gives terrible investment advice](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#2158568)\u2014we all know that, right?\u2014and we only watch the show because, well, because he does possess a certain bizarre type of market and entertainment genius\u2014if there's a pundit out there with more opinions about more stocks, I've never seen him\u2014and he's irreverent, madcap, and, yes, even brilliant, in an idiot-savant, freak-show sort of way. (Moreover, Cramer is mesmerizing reality TV. Admit it: You watch because you wonder if this is the night he finally has a heart attack, kills someone, or explodes in a tirade of expletive-laced slander.) Reviewing the list of common Mad Money show segments (Stump the Cramer, Am I Nuts?, Pimpin' All Over the World) and sound effects (squealing pigs, a wrecking train, a toilet flushing, a screaming man falling out a window and then crashing on the ground), I realized that, yes, I was taking Jim Cramer waaaaaay too seriously, that his nonstop comedy routine about being a brilliant and respected investor and making everyone rich is just shtick, and that there couldn't possibly be a Mad Money viewer who actually believes that he provides intelligent advice. There is, of course, another James J. Cramer\u2014the one who graduated from Harvard Law School, writes an often [sober and astute column](http://nymag.com/news/businessfinance/bottomline/25990/index.html) in New York magazine, and might actually have put up decent numbers at a hedge fund in the 1990s ( [impossible to say for sure until we can evaluate year-by-year relative returns, risk profile, standard deviation, etc.](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#2158569)). That Cramer is a smart man. Smart enough to have read decades of conclusive research about the lousy odds facing all speculators\u2014especially amateurs; smart enough to understand the crippling impact of research, transaction, and tax costs; smart enough to know that when a stock tip is delivered on national television it is no longer of any use (because everyone else now has it); and smart enough to write, in 1999, about an excellent book by a true hero of individual investing, John Bogle, that \"After a lifetime of picking stocks, I have to admit that Bogle's arguments in favor of the index fund have me thinking of joining him rather than trying to beat him.\" The two Cramers\u2014brilliant James J. and vaudeville comic Jim\u2014embody the essential conflict in the American financial industry: the war between intelligent investing (patient, scientific, boring) and successful investment media (frenetic, personality-driven, entertaining). Return to [article](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#back2158568) I want to be clear what I mean when I say Cramer gives \"terrible investment advice.\" I do not mean that Cramer's \"picks,\" such as they are, have underperformed the market\u2014although at least one observer concludes that, in 2006, they were left in the dust. (The Mad Money Machine calculated that [Cramer's picks returned 0.2 percent in 2006 versus 22.5 percent for a portfolio of passive index funds](http://madmoneymachine.com/portfolios/).) I also don't mean that Cramer doesn't occasionally say smart things about companies, stocks, and investing. What I mean is that, once the poor odds of speculation success are considered (even mutual-fund managers have, at best, a one-in-four chance of beating the market), and once one notes that Cramer's \"stock-picking\" advice suffers from several additional hurdles (below), it seems extremely unlikely that Cramer's basic investment strategy, \"Watch TV, Get Rich,\" could ever be intelligent for an unsophisticated individual investor. These hurdles include: In short, my definition of \"bad investment advice\" is a recommendation that is likely to make you less money or expose you to greater risk than would a diversified portfolio of low-cost passive index funds. I am highly confident that, once costs are taken into account, Cramer's advice is, by this definition, terrible. Return to [article](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#back2158569) Despite Cramer's assertion in his CNBC bio that he has \"one of the best records in the [hedge-fund] business,\" I am aware of no independent analysis that has confirmed this. To confirm it, one would have to evaluate not only the performance of Cramer's hedge fund for the period in question (the late 1990s) but the performance of the overall markets during the same period (extraordinary). One would have to assess whether the fund was taking more or less risk than the market (more risk usually equals higher returns). Lastly, one would also have to understand exactly how much of the fund's performance Cramer was responsible for (he doesn't say that the fund had one of the best records in the business\u2014he says that he does). In short, it may well be that Cramer put up excellent numbers during his career as a hedge-fund manager. But we don't have enough information to confirm this. I seem to be a moron times two. First, [my lazy speculation](http://www.slate.com/id/2156086/?nav/fix/) that \"the circle of the earth\" means the Israelites thought the earth was round caught the attention of geometricians, historians, and cartographers\u2014and not in a good way. Many, many, many of you observed that a circle is not a sphere. A circle is flat. Lots of ancient peoples believed the earth was shaped like a pancake (or, in the Hebrews' case, a latke). For a speedy tutorial on this, read [Chris Johnson's e-mail](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#2157615). I'm apparently soft-headed about child sacrifice, too. [I pooh-poohed the idea](http://www.slate.com/id/2156086/?nav/fix/) that any civilization, including Israel's enemies, ever ritually murdered its own kids. Readers bombarded me with articles, books, and Web pages about child sacrifices around the globe. (There's practically enough for a Travel Channel special: The 10 Hottest Spots for Kid Killing!) In particular, they directed me to strong evidence that the Carthaginians offered large numbers of their children to Baal. Let's get back to the Bible, and a new book ... The Book of Jeremiah Like [Isaiah](http://www.slate.com/id/2156086/entry/2156089/), Jeremiah is not a kittens, rainbows, and spring flowers kind of guy. These two let-it-bleed prophets share a style (emphatic, metaphoric poetry) and a sensibility (gloom). But they're not identical twins\u2014more like first cousins. Isaiah is bipolar, prone to wild mood swings, delightful when pleased, and a holy terror\u2014truly, a holy terror\u2014when angry. But he is also funny, in a vicious sort of way. You might not always like Isaiah, but he'd often be entertaining company, especially if you could get him to rip on the Babylonians. Jeremiah, on the other hand\u2014not the life of the party. (They don't call them \"Jeremiads\" for nothing.) He's plenty smart and eloquent, but he's a priggish prophet. He doesn't share Isaiah's occasional fondness for black irony. [Chapter 1](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/1.html#S1) to [Chapter 3](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/3.html#S1) A century or so after Isaiah, God summons Jeremiah to serve Him. (When God orders Jeremiah to work, it surely marks the first use of this phrase: \"Gird up your loins.\") Like Isaiah, Jeremiah's chief responsibility is to hector, nag, badger, noodge, and otherwise harass the increasingly unfaithful people of Judah to return to God's side before it's too late. Jeremiah ultimately fails, of course. He's living during the darkest of times\u2014the final few years before Babylon conquers Jerusalem and exiles the Jews\u2014and no one could have stopped the disaster. What's most remarkable about Jeremiah is the depth of his rage, which can be explained by the hopelessness of his cause. His people don't share his sense of urgency, and it infuriates him. Jeremiah has the flaws that all whistle-blowers have. Almost without exception, whistle-blowers are mean, self-righteous, and resentful. When they turn out to be right\u2014and boy, does Jeremiah turn out to be right\u2014everyone regrets not having listened to them to begin with. But the reason no one listens to begin with is that the message is so unpleasant and angry. Put yourself in the shoes of a Jerusalemite, sixth century B.C.: Would you pay attention to the cantankerous rageaholic shouting doom in the bazaar? In Jeremiah's first speech, he unloads on the wild, heedless idolatry of the Israelites, describing them as: \"a lustful she-camel, restlessly running about.\" Now I personally have never seen a lustful camel\u2014of the she or he variety\u2014but, wow, that is one vivid image! It's not just the lusty camel that occupies Jeremiah's thoughts. Much more than Isaiah, he has sex on the brain. Wherever he turns, he sees it. Whenever he opens his mouth, filth spews out. A few verses before the she-camel, for example, he says that Israel \"recline[s] as a whore.\" Chapter 3 begins with him frothing about Israel's \"whoring and debauchery ... you had the brazenness of a street woman.\" In Chapter 5 he inveighs against the Israelites as \"lusty stallions.\" (Are they camels? Are they horses?) A few later, they're harlots. A few chapters later: \"I behold your adulteries, Your lustful neighing Your unbridled depravity, your vile acts ... \" His combination of scorn and sex is very Church Lady\u2014at once prudish and obsessed. [Chapter 4](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/4.html#S1) God's disappointment with us only increases, because we are not merely unfaithful, we're also morons. \"My people are stupid ... They are foolish children. They are not intelligent.\" This may be Jeremiah's cruelest cut of all, since [we know how much the Lord values intelligence](http://www.slate.com/id/2141712/entry/2142225/). God always rewards brainy people, even when they're wicked. This is the first time He has ever wondered if His people lack smarts. His disillusionment is somehow more disturbing than His dismay over idol-worshipping. Infidelity He expects, but stupidity He can't stand. [Chapter 5](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/5.html#S1) and [Chapter 6](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/6.html#S1) Jeremiah suggests that his readers search Jerusalem for a righteous person: \"You will not find a man; There is none who acts justly.\" Since the city is empty of worthy people, God has no reason to spare it from conquest. This hearkens back to Genesis, doesn't it? It is essentially the same discussion that [Abraham and God have about Sodom and Gomorrah back in Genesis 18](http://www.slate.com/id/2141712/entry/2141827/). God is planning to destroy those cities, but Abraham argues with Him, eventually persuading the Lord that He can't wipe out the towns if there are even 10 innocent souls in them. (Of course it turns out there are no innocents, so God offs the cities.) Jeremiah takes on the role of God here in the retelling: Because there's not a single just person in Jerusalem, the city deserves its doom. (I wonder if the story of [Diogenes and the lamp](http://millionsofmouths.com/diogenes.html) is ripped off from Jeremiah. Diogenes supposedly roamed the streets of Athens, carrying a lamp in broad daylight, searching for an honest man.) [Chapter 7](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/7.html#S1) Here's a disheartening moment. The Lord tells Jeremiah to not even bother to pray for the people anymore because they're so unapologetically idolatrous. You know things are bad when God Himself gives up! [Chapter 8](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/8.html#S1) and [Chapter 9](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/9.html#S1) Jeremiah laments the terrible fate of his countrymen. He's heartbroken, dejected, desolate about their suffering. He asks, looking out for his own misery: \"Is there no balm in Gilead?\" Yet Jeremiah's histrionic mourning for His people is somehow suspicious. He promises he would \"weep day and night\" for his people, moans at how heartsick he is over their suffering. But think about how much delight he takes in enumerating their sins and threatening them. He's clearly thrilled to be the bearer of bad tidings to Israel. So it's very disingenuous when he starts talking about how bad he feels about Israel. He's like the gossipy classmate who, with a long face and a big hug, tells you that she saw your boyfriend making out with your best friend. You can be very sure that her glee outweighs her sympathy. Jeremiah's world is terrible for a new reason. It's not simply that the bond between man and God is broken. The bond between man and man is broken too. When you abandon the Lord, according to Jeremiah, you also unravel all that holds society and family together. In a society that has quit God, you must: \"Beware of your neighbors, and put no trust in any of your kin.\" This is natural law theory taken to its utmost extreme. All manmade laws and all social bonds are tenuous, dependent on faith and God's will. There's no such thing as innate human decency, or innate family love\u2014it's all contingent on the Lord. [Chapter 10](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/10.html#S1) and [Chapter 11](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/11.html#S1) More of the usual idol chatter\u2014those \"no gods\" are worthless, they didn't make heaven and earth like I did, etc. [Chapter 12](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/12.html#S1) Jeremiah interrogates God like a lawyer on cross-examination: \"Let me put my case to You: Why does the way of the guilty prosper? Why do all who are treacherous thrive?\" Great questions, prophet! Will the witness please answer? So, dear Lord, why do the good and faithful often suffer while the wicked grow fat and rich? As Jeremiah and Isaiah make clear, God will deliver his comeuppance eventually either on earth (Babylon sacks Jerusalem) or later. But that is not the answer God makes to Jeremiah's question. If I am untangling the metaphors in Verse 5 correctly, He says He's making life tough for the faithful to harden them. This life is just boot camp for a more rigorous world to come. You'll thank Drill Sgt. Jehovah later. [Chapter 13](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/13.html#S1) A curious episode in which God orders Jeremiah to buy a loincloth, wear it for a while, and then hide it in a rock by the Euphrates River. Jeremiah is instructed to return to the loincloth some days later, at which point he discovers it is ruined. This loincloth, God tells us, is Judah. It was supposed to cling to God, the way the cloth clings to the loins\u2014no boxer shorts back in the day, I guess\u2014but because it has been ruined by sin, it's now just a worthless rag. The Judahites can't save themselves from their terrible fate because they have become evil to their core. God asks, famously, \"Can the Cushite change his skin or the leopard his spots?\" This is another example of a famous Biblical phrase that isn't quite what I remember it to be. Did you know that the leopard was paired with a person? I didn't. Cushite is a Biblical term for Ethiopians or Nubians. The reference complicates the passage for modern readers. It's not that referring to Cushites means the verse is racist\u2014it's clearly meant to be descriptive of skin color rather than derogatory. But it does muddy it. I'm not surprised that the phrase that we use today only includes the leopard. Can you imagine saying \"Can the Ethiopian change his skin color?\" in conversation? It would be awkward to explain. \"Blogging the Bible\" takes a hiatus next week. I'm going on a work trip to Israel. I'll try to snap some pictures of famous ancient spots\u2014\"Photographing the Bible\"\u2014and post them when I return. Thoughts on Blogging the Bible? Please e-mail David Plotz at plotzd@slate.com. (E-mail may be quoted by name unless the writer stipulates otherwise.) My [Israel trip](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#2158375) turned out to be less biblical than I had hoped. I learned an awful lot about the [West Bank security barrier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier) but very little about the walls of Jericho. (There was one delightful Bible-blog moment, which occurred during a meeting with [former Prime Minister Shimon Peres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Peres). ( [Click here for Book of Jeremiah [Chapter 14](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/14.html#S1) through [Chapter 16](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/16.html#S1) Anyone who's ever been in a bad relationship knows the Doctrine of Pre-Emptive Cruelty: Before you go through the torture of dumping a boyfriend, you act meaner than you feel toward him. (This usually goes on at an unconscious level.) Boyfriend understandably bristles and retaliates. This makes the actual leave-taking much easier. You get to lighten your own guilt by blaming the dumpee for being such a jerk. This appears to be God's strategy. As He prepares to hammer Judah with the Babylonian invasion, He gets more and more rageful. It's anticipatory cruelty\u2014trying to make the breakup a little bit less traumatic for Him. (Remember, this is a thousand-year-old covenant he's ending!) He spends a lot of these chapters, and much the whole Jeremiah book, making Himself out as the victim\u2014betrayed by idolatry, false prophets, sexual misbehavior. This helps Him justify the punishment He's about to deliver. It's unfair to say He's taking pleasure in the impending doom. But He's dwelling obsessively on the details. (How they'll be attacked by swords, dogs, birds, and wild animals; how some will starve, some will be enslaved, some will die in battle\u2014and there shall be no mourning for the dead.) It's almost as though He's thinking out loud, trying to explain Himself to Himself. He's half-triumphal, half-heartbroken as He declares, \"I have destroyed my people ... their widows became more numerous than the sands of the sea.\" [Chapter 17](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/17.html#S1) As I mentioned [last time](http://www.slate.com/id/2157587/?nav/fix/), one of the key themes of Jeremiah is that there is no intrinsic human morality. We are capable of goodness and love only thanks to our faith. This Jeremiac view contrasts with other parts of the Bible, particularly Genesis, where moral behavior can exist in parallel with faith, not dependent on it. (The most vivid example is [Abraham rebuking God for his eagerness to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah](http://www.slate.com/id/2141712/entry/2141827/).) Anyway, there's one sentence in this chapter that beautifully, and starkly, encapsulates that challenge to humanism: \"The heart is devious above all else; it is perverse.\" (Human emotion is fickle and untrustworthy\u2014unlike God!) God dispatches Jeremiah on the first of several prophetic suicide missions. Like Charlie in Charlie's Angels, or M in the James Bond movies, the Lord is sending out his most capable warrior against impossible odds. Here, the Lord tells Jeremiah to stand at the gate of Jerusalem and harangue the king and others about the Sabbath, reminding them if they don't obey it, they'll be destroyed. Later, God will send him to harass the king in his court, barge into the Temple, and badger all the kings of the region. In each case, Jeremiah risks his life by preaching this horrible message: You're doomed, and nothing you do can save you. Random question: Why was [Jeremiah a bullfrog](http://www.lyricsdownload.com/creedence-clearwater-revival-ccr-jeremiah-was-a-bullfrog-lyrics.html)? [Chapter 18](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/18.html#S1) through [Chapter 20](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/20.html#S1) New mission: to take a clay jug to the gates of Jerusalem and announce that God is going to \"make this city a horror,\" and that the Jerusalemites will \"eat the flesh of their sons.\" Then shatter the jug, because this is what God will do to Jerusalem. The top priest, unsurprisingly, is perturbed and throws Jeremiah in the stocks. This does not deter Jeremiah one bit. He curses the priest, telling him he will die in captivity. Jeremiah is curiously ambivalent about his job. On the one hand, he delights in denouncing the priest and cursing Jerusalem and foretelling death and destruction. On the other hand, he's genuinely hurt that no one likes him. As soon as he finishes damning the priest, he chants a self-pitying lament, cursing the day he was born. He moans that he has become a laughingstock (\"everyone mocks me\"). He complains that whenever he's around, he hears people whispering, \"Let us denounce him!\" C'mon, Jeremiah! You must be kidding! You show up at capital city, tell everyone they're going to be cannibalizing their kids in a couple years and that there's nothing\u2014nothing\u2014they can do to prevent it. And then you're surprised that they don't like you! [Chapter 21](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/21.html#S1) and [Chapter 22](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/22.html#S1) King Zedekiah asks Jeremiah to intercede with the Lord against the Babylonian invaders. \"Perhaps the Lord will perform a wonderful deed for us.\" Jeremiah, rather than offering Karl Roveian strategic advice or even a few kind words, disses the king. There's no chance the Lord will intervene, Jeremiah says: Jerusalem will be sacked\u2014some will die from plague, others from violence, and others will be enslaved. Oops, I just spilled a Fresca on my Bible. [Chapter 23](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/23.html#S1) I must admit that Jeremiah is not the jolliest way to spend an afternoon. The string of major prophets\u2014Isaiah and Jeremiah, with Ezekiel on the horizon\u2014is the Bible's Murderer's Row. Their books are dreadfully long\u2014longer than the entire Torah, in fact! They're also repetitive, gloomy, and very hard to read. I need some encouragement. Please tell me it gets better when I'm done with these guys. Along comes a funny scene to brighten things up. God is irritated by the false prophets who are contradicting Jeremiah's morbid predictions. These prophets, like President Bush's Iraq war advisers, see only the bright side: God still loves us! The Babylonians will be defeated! (Actually, they're exactly like Bush Iraq advisers, who also insist the Babylonians will be defeated.) The Lord knows they're selling a bogus product\u2014a counterfeit DVD of prophecy. God challenges the prophets who claim to be delivering His words, sarcastically mocking them for saying He came to them in a vision. \"I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, 'I have dreamed, I have dreamed!' \" (Can't you just hear God doing a little falsetto as he mimics the false prophets?) [Chapter 24](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/24.html#S1) and [Chapter 25](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/25.html#S1) The Bad Food and Drink section. Chapter 24 is all about bad figs. (Metaphor alert: bad fig=bad Jerusalemites). In Chapter 25, Jeremiah forces all the kings of the world to drink from the Lord's \"wine of wrath.\" Not just drink, actually, but chug it. \"Drink, get drunk and vomit, fall and rise no more.\" This wrath-wine bender represents God's judgment against earth. [Chapter 26](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/26.html#S1) through [Chapter 28](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/28.html#S1) Jeremiah's most alarming adventure yet. The Lord instructs him to wear a yoke and visit the kings of Moab, Tyre, Edom, and Judah. There he tells them that they must submit to the yoke of the Babylonians, or else be annihilated. Let's linger on this for a minute, because this is the passage where I finally recognized why Jeremiah bugs me so much. He's a [Quisling](http://www.mnc.net/norway/quisling.htm), a [Tokyo Rose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Rose)! Jeremiah feels no loyalty to his land or his people\u2014he's so traitorous that he's prodding them to surrender to their mortal enemy! He's doing it for God, of course. (In this way, he reminds me of the extreme, ultra-orthodox rabbis who, for scriptural reasons, believe the state of Israel is an abomination that is preventing the return of the true Messiah. They're so nuts that they do things like [attend the anti-Holocaust conference in Teheran](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6171503.stm).) In hindsight, Jeremiah proves to be right. The Babylonians did sack and slaughter, and the Jews were marched off into exile. The lesson in his betrayal of his country is this: All our quotidian bonds\u2014to family, nation, and tribe\u2014are nothing compared with our connection with God. (God made this point emphatically back in Chapter 16 when He denied Jeremiah a wife and children.) But this doesn't comfort me! I am not strong enough in my faith to set aside family and country for God. And I don't want to be. Jeremiah is a righteous prophet, but I can't help feeling that he's also a terrible traitor.

The Book of Jeremiah [Chapter 29](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/29.html#S1) From Babylon to Brooklyn, Inquisition to pogrom, Jews have always managed to prosper. It's pretty remarkable: No matter where we are, and no matter what dreadful conditions we're living under, Jews have thrived as traders, shopkeepers, bankers, doctors\u2014without losing our distinct identity as Jews. ... Why is the religion so mobile? Let me offer three theories (all made up on the spot, so don't hold me to them). First, necessity: When you're being exiled and pogrommed, you learn to adapt fast. Second, culture: Because it's a religion based on writing and argument, Jews have always had high literacy rates and well-developed analytical skills, which served them in business and the professions. And, third\u2014well, third is right here in Chapter 29. Maybe this mobility is a tenet of the faith. Read this extraordinary passage, pulled from Jeremiah's letter to Judeans exiled in Babylon. \"Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they produce. Take wives and have sons and daughters. ... Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.\" This is very powerful advice, and runs against modern victimology theory, which teaches that you can't move forward until you avenge a past wrong. Jeremiah is saying, essentially, get over it, and find a new way to live for God. The passage perfectly predicts the next 2,500 years of Jewish history. Jews have always found ways to be at home away from home, to be at once Jewish and American\u2014waiting for Zion, but living for today. [Chapter 30](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/30.html#S1) and [Chapter 31](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/31.html#S1) God loves to play the dozens. He has a way with the put-down, mocking His own Israelites for their cowardice: \"Can a man bear a child? Why then do I see every man with his hands on his loins like a woman in labor?\" On the upside, after He finishes taunting, He renews His promise to redeem them from exile. God promises a new covenant. It will be just like the one He used to have\u2014the one we broke\u2014except this one will last forever. A theological question: Has that new covenant started yet? I imagine that Christians believe Christ establishes that covenant, right? Do Jews believe it has started? If not, what are we waiting for? A Messiah? A U.S. victory in the World Cup? Also, a puzzling theological-scientific sidebar. God doesn't say the covenant will last \"forever.\" He says it will last until \"the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be explored.\" He presumably means forever, assuming that such measuring and exploring would be impossible. Now, I'm no astronomer, but my sense is that universe-measurement is pretty well-developed science. And geologists are investigating pretty deep down below, too. I know, I know\u2014it was a metaphor! But that's one of the glories of living in a scientific age: Our knowledge is reaching beyond the limits of our ancestors' imaginations. (Before anyone bites my head off, I also recognize that knowing the size of the universe in light years doesn't prove or disprove anything about the true nature of God.) [Chapter 32](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/32.html#S1) Sick of [Jeremiah's glum, traitorous prophesies](http://www.slate.com/id/2157587/?nav/fix/)\u2014which he persists on delivering in the midst of a Babylonian siege\u2014King Zedekiah finally chucks the prophet in jail. There's also a sublime exchange between God and Jeremiah. An Israelite asks Jeremiah if he should go through with a real estate deal involving Israelite land\u2014a chancy proposition given that Babylon is about to overrun the territory and enslave the entire population. But the Lord instructs Jeremiah that the land sale should proceed. Jeremiah is befuddled by this. The prophet lavishly, excessively, sycophantically praises God for his wisdom and greatness\u2014a suck-up that goes on forever\u2014and then at the end of it, Jeremiah asks, essentially: What the heck are you talking about? Why should the Israelites do land deals when they're about to get obliterated? The Lord, sounding a bit like I imagine James Brown did, first replies, \"Behold I am the Lord. ... Is anything too wondrous for me?\" God goes on to tell the prophet that, yes, Jerusalem is about to be obliterated, but this will signify only a brief interruption in the Israelites' time in Zion. This land purchase should go through, because when God's done with the Babylonians, when He has laid them to waste, the Israelites will return to their land, and all their old contracts and land arrangements will apply. If you're seeking scriptural support for Israel's divine right to land, it doesn't get any stronger than this. Even more than God's original grant of land to Abraham or the conquest of the Promised Land after Exodus, this passage guarantees permanent, divinely authorized inhabitation in Zion. No interruption\u2014whether Babylonian or, presumably, Arab, whether 70 years or 700 years\u2014cancels Jewish ownership. [Chapter 33](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/33.html#S1) and [Chapter 34](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/34.html#S1) God is furious at His people for a whole new reason, and this time it's hard not to sympathize with Him. If you remember from way back in [Leviticus, Chapter 25](http://www.slate.com/id/2145574/), God orders the Israelites to free all Israelite slaves every 50 years. (Yes, the Israelites enslaved one another.) In the middle of the disastrous war, King Zedekiah calls for such a slave amnesty, presumably to reduce domestic turmoil. But as soon as the bondsmen are set free, their masters immediately round them up and force them back into slavery. This not only makes a mockery of God's law, it's also pretty stupid public policy. No wonder He redoubles His commitment to sack Jerusalem. [Chapter 35](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/35.html#S1) A big, obvious metaphor. [Chapter 36](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/36.html#S1) More than any other, Judaism is a religion of books, Torah, Talmud, Midrash. ... The Bible often celebrates the strength of the Jewish attachment to the text. [Remember back at the end of 2 Kings](http://www.slate.com/id/2154876/)? King Josiah rediscovers the book of Deuteronomy and is so moved by reading it that he rededicates the entire kingdom to God. Chapter 36 is another such episode. At God's order, Jeremiah writes a scroll of all his prophecies, then has his sidekick Baruch read it aloud to a crowd at the temple. The king's advisers seize the scroll, and the king orders it read to him. As each page is finished, the king tears it out and tosses it in the fire. Bad move, king! Jeremiah, unbowed, simply rewrites the scroll. This is a profound notion: No matter what kings may do, the book will survive. God's word endures, stronger than fire. [Chapter 37](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/37.html#S1) and [Chapter 38](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/38.html#S1) Jeremiah, out for an errand, is arrested by guards who believe he's trying to defect to the Babylonians. He is thrown into solitary. But King Zedekiah, who is clearly something of a masochist, asks for his advice again. As with all the other times King Z asked for counsel, Jeremiah tells the king that Jerusalem will fall and the king will be captured. A little later, Jeremiah encourages everyone to surrender to the Babylonians, which really infuriates the king's court. He is arrested again and chucked into a cistern, where he starts to sink in the mud\u2014a bad way to die. An Ethiopian eunuch rescues him, with the king's help. The king requests his advice again. Jeremiah tells him to surrender. The king ignores him and asks him to pretend that they never had a conversation. The relationship of king and prophet is perverse and fascinating. The king's advisers loathe Jeremiah and want him dead. But the king can't help himself. He recognizes Jeremiah's holiness, but not enough to actually follow his instructions. So Jeremiah is constantly barraging the king with bad news, the king is nodding gravely, and then failing to muster the courage to act. (It's rather like presidents and Social Security reform. They know the problem is real, and they know they should do the right thing, but they just can't pull the trigger.) [Chapter 39](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/39.html#S1) What happens to the feckless king? Jerusalem is sacked. He and his family are captured. His sons are executed in front of him. Then the Babylonians blind him, fetter him, and ship him off to Babylon. By contrast, Babylon's King Nebuchadnezzar orders Jeremiah treated like a VIP\u2014further evidence that the Babylonians considered him an ally, and thus he was [a traitor to his people](http://www.slate.com/id/2157587/?nav/fix/).

The Book of Jeremiah [Chapter 40](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/40.html#S1) and [Chapter 41](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/41.html#S1) The Judeans are offered one final chance to stay in the Promised Land, but they blow it. When the Babylonians conquer and sack Jerusalem, they leave a Jewish regent, Gedaliah, to run the place. He promises the few Judeans who haven't been exiled that they will keep farming and thrive. Things are looking up in God's country. But Gedaliah turns out to be a fool, laughing off reports that sinister Ishmael plans to assassinate him. Of course, Ishmael promptly murders him, then plunges Judea into a sad, brutal civil war. Ishmael pointlessly slaughters pilgrims on their way to the Temple and tosses their bodies in a cistern. Finally, noble Johanan rallies the army and overthrows Ishmael. (I love this story because I have a beloved uncle-in-law named Johanan, who would also rally an army against a tyranny, given half a chance.) [Chapter 42](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/42.html#S1) and [Chapter 43](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/43.html#S1) Then the Judeans make their terrible mistake. Johanan asks Jeremiah make an inquiry to God: What should the Judean remnant do now? Should they stay in Zion under Babylonian rule or flee? Jeremiah prays for 10 days, at the end of which God tells him that the Judeans must stay in the Promised Land. God promises that if they remain, He will \"rebuild\" them and make them a great people once again. Then God does something astonishing, something He has never done before: He says sorry! He concedes that the Babylonian invasion\u2014the overthrow of the Israelites He had planned for so long and with such evident enthusiasm--was actually a big mistake. (Hmm. Does that sound like another Iraqi invasion we've heard a lot about recently?) God announces, with as much humility as the maker of the universe can muster, \"I regret the punishment I have brought upon you.\" I always thought that being God means never having to say you're sorry, but apparently even the big guy is prone to regret. Question: Is this the only time God apologizes in the Bible? It's the only sorry I can remember, but my memory is a sieve. Usually He just brushes off mistakes and starts over\u2014even when He really overdoes it, as with [ the flood](http://www.slate.com/id/2141712/entry/2141827/). After all, He can tell himself that it's never His fault. We have always screwed up and deserve the smiting. So, why would He start feeling sorry now? Anyway, back to the mistake. The Lord urges Johanan and his people to remain in Zion and threatens horrible punishment\u2014famine, war, pestilence\u2014if they run off to Egypt, Babylon's main rival. All of God's contrition goes for naught. Johanan simply doesn't believe Jeremiah is speaking the truth. \"You're lying,\" he tells the prophet. He's sure that Jeremiah is fabricating God's word. Johanan suspects that Jeremiah is setting him up for the Babylonians, that as soon as Johanan tries to remain in Judea, the Babylonians will slaughter and exile him and his small band of followers. So, Johanan and his remnant disobey Jeremiah and the Lord, and escape from Judea to Egypt, leaving the Holy Land empty of Israelites. After all that work of Exodus and conquest, the last Jews in the Promised Land are returning to Egypt! How sad is that! This is an important missed opportunity. We have to ask ourselves: Why would Johanan dismiss Jeremiah as a liar and assume the prophet was actually setting a Babylonian trap for him? The answer, I think, is once more the troublesome personality of Jeremiah. The superficial lesson of this episode is that Johanan doubted God's prophet and disobeyed Him. But I think the more profound lesson concerns the tragedy of Jeremiah. He's a terribly ineffective prophet, not because he's wrong, but because he doesn't know how to sell his message. He doesn't know how to win friends and influence people. He has been so negative and so unpleasant with the Judeans that he doesn't have any social capital. He has no buddies, no allies, no supporters. Is it any surprise the Judeans view him with suspicion? So what if he's always right? He's just rotten to deal with. Moreover, [he has a long history of siding with the Babylonians](http://www.slate.com/id/2157587/entry/2158489/), so it's understandable that Johanan suspects him of being a double agent. The Book of Jeremiah is supposed to be about our failure. Really, it's about his. God is infuriated that Johanan rejected his order and vows to wipe out the Judean Egyptian colony. Now that His chosen people have been scattered to Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon, He decides that only the Babylonian Jews will survive and return to Israel. The others will disappear, lost to history and to the Lord. [Chapter 44](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/44.html#S1) The Egyptian refugees especially tick off the Lord by worshipping a new goddess, the Queen of Heaven. This is a moment of tragicomic sexism: Only the wives are worshipping the Queen of Heaven. The husbands are fecklessly doing nothing to stop them. Jeremiah, who seems to have sojourned down to Egypt with Johanan's crew, tells the Queen worshippers that they've made their final mistake. He advises them, Go ahead, worship your Queen of Heaven, and see if she helps you! But don't come crying to the Lord when she ignores you. The Lord is finished with you\u2014you picked the wrong god. The Babylonians invade Egypt and capture the Pharaoh. In the grimmest possible coda, the Judeans who fled to Egypt end up being conquered by the Babylonians after all. This is what we call cosmic irony, or a cruel Godly joke. The Judeans went to Egypt to escape a Babylonian conquest. But instead they fall victim to the Babylonian sword in Egypt. That's what you get for flouting a direct order from the Lord. [Chapter 45](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/45.html#S1) One of the shortest, and also one of the least interesting, chapters in the Bible. [Chapter 46](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/46.html#S1) through [Chapter 49](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/49.html#S1) Jeremiah prophesies the ruin of the Egyptians, Philistines, Moabites, and Ammonites. (Oh, and the Edomites, too. Don't forget the Edomites!) You know the drill: \"laid waste\"; \"the hour of their doom\"; distressing cry of anguish,\" etc., etc. The most interesting detail: It describes Moab as a man. Nations are always women in the Bible. Why would Moab be male? [Chapter 50](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/50.html#S1) and [Chapter 51](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/51.html#S1) Another bad-news prophecy, this time for the Babylonians. Big Jer also prophesies the return of the Jews to Zion, which will follow the Persian conquest of Babylon. There is one particularly spectacular metaphor, in Chapter 50:17, describing the earlier defeat of the Israelites: \"Israel are scattered sheep, harried by lions. First the King of Assyria devoured them, and in the end, King Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon crunched their bones.\" Crunched their bones\u2014that's a phrase to remember! The Lord's rage against Babylon is something fierce. The prophecies against the Moabites and Philistines were a Cabbage Patch picnic compared to his molten anger against Babylon. He hates them more than He hates anyone. Here's one verse: Babylon shall become rubble, a den for jackals, an object of horror and hissing, without inhabitant. Now imagine 64 such verses, and you get a sense of His fury and of how grim these chapters are to read. Mitch Albom, it ain't. [Chapter 52](http://aol.bartleby.com/108/24/52.html#S1) Jeremiah wraps up by duplicating a chapter from 2 Kings about the Babylonian conquest. I am so glad to be done with this gloomy prophet. On to Ezekiel, where things may perk up. According to several reader e-mails, Ezekiel's Chapter 23 is the sexiest in the Bible! Thoughts on Blogging the Bible?

I'm not a \"historian, archaeologist, or scientist,\" but I am a cartography enthusiast, and I think I can answer the question. Mapmakers of the ancient world (see Wikipedia's entry on \"History of cartography\" at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cartography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cartography)) usually depicted the earth as a flat disk, like a dinner plate, with the ocean around the rim. Kinda like Terry Pratchett's Discworld, but without A'Tuin or the elephants. It's most likely that this flat disk is the \"Circle of the Earth\" the prophet is referring to. The basic round shape of the earth (whether flat or spherical) could be inferred by observing the earth's shadow on the moon during an eclipse. The Greek Eratosthenes (second century B.C.) may have been the first with empirical evidence of the spherical shape of the Earth (see the first episode of Carl Sagan's Cosmos for a nice demonstration). Others like Pythagoras (sixth century B.C.) and Aristotle (fourth century B.C.), also believed the earth was spherical. However, this Isaiah lived well before all these highfalutin' Greeks.

Although it is not uncommon for big families to produce a rebel or two along with the chip-off-the-old-block offspring, there are few that can lay claim to as much dissension within the ranks as the aristocratic clan of Mitford. This gaggle of wayward sisters (six in all, with one brother, Tom, who was killed in combat in 1945 at the age of 36) included Diana, the family beauty, who married the dastardly Oswald Moseley, head of the British Fascist party; Nancy, the family wit, whose novel The Pursuit of Love kick-started the proliferation of novels, memoirs, and biographies that would come to be called the Mitford \"industry\"; and the family madwoman, Unity, who went bonkers for Adolf Hitler and put a pistol to her head when Britain declared war on Germany. Of these exotic renegades, none was more proud of going against the grain than Jessica, a black sheep who flouted everything her virulently xenophobic parents stood for by embracing communism over Blue Bloodism and then, adding insult to injury, the United States over England. Throughout her career, Decca (as Jessica was nicknamed) exhibited an undeviating delight in going against the grain\u2014an \u00e9pater-le-bourgeoisie instinct which seems less a testament to a fiery social conscience or to deeply felt beliefs than a lifelong habit of enfant terrible-ism. How you feel about the woman once dubbed \"the Queen of Muckrakers\" for her scathing indictments of everything from a correspondence course for aspiring scribblers (Bennett Cerf's Famous Writers School) to a posh women's spa after reading Decca, a fat volume of her correspondence ably edited by Peter Y. Sussman, depends on your tolerance for a certain kind of d'haut en bas approach to human mystery that eschews compassion for brisk vigor. It is symptomatic of her less-than-cuddly approach that she appears in these letters to be more moved by the plight of Miranda, a pet lamb from childhood that she last saw a half-century ago (\"I suppose that by now she must be dead? ... Miranda was the light of my life\") than she is by the bipolar disorder her son Benjamin suffered from, the symptoms of which she characterized as \"dreadful, absurd, disgusting manic episodes.\" Decca grew up in an imposing house named after the Cotswold village in which it was located; she refers to it in her first memoir, Hons & Rebels, as \"a private lunatic asylum.\" She was schooled at home by her mother and then a series of inept governesses. Both her parents had whims of iron: Her father, Lord Redesdale (referred to as \"the feudal remnant\" or \"the Old Subhuman\" and sometimes as \"Farve\" or \"the Male\"), was given to bursts of rage against Huns and artists, and believed in the efficacy of unpasteurized milk, as well as the unchecked power of the House of Lords. \"Muv\" had her own pet peeves\u2014Jews were among them\u2014and odd affections (chicken-farming), and was firmly against medical intervention when anyone in the family took ill, being of the belief that ailments were best left to \"the Good Body\" to take care of on its own. Jessica, the second-to-youngest daughter, emerged from this proudly insular background (outsiders, including other people's children, were shunned) with a durable feeling of entitlement; she first learned to make a bed after she was married and staying with her friend Virginia Durr in Washington, D.C. In 1937, after spending a finishing year in Paris, followed by a sightseeing visit to a Nazified Munich with her mother and sisters (this detail was elided from both her memoir and her letters), and coming out in the 1935 debutante season at Buckingham Palace, Decca shocked her family by eloping with Esmond Romilly under their ever-watchful noses. She had been squirreling funds since the age of 12 in a \"Running Away Account\" at Drummond's Bank in London expressly with an eye toward such a contingency. (According to Decca's memoir, her mother, upon learning of the account, murmured vaguely cautionary words in response: \"Well, darling, you'll have to save up a nice lot; you have no idea how expensive life in London is these days.\") In the congenially interwoven way of the British upper classes, Romilly was Decca's second cousin and the nephew of Winston Churchill, who was widely rumored to be his father. Mitford had fallen in love with Romilly\u2014whose exploits she had been following ever since he had grown notorious as a pacifist \"Red Menace\" while still at boarding school\u2014practically within minutes of meeting him at a weekend house party given by her cousin Dorothy. From the moment she joined forces with Esmond, Decca adopted his sense of outrage at social injustices and his impassioned political commitment. Decca became a member of the Communist Party in the early 1940s, and although she left it in 1958, she did so more out of boredom than disillusionment with its underlying principles (\"I did find the so-called 'discipline' a bit confining and tiresome\"), and claimed until the last to find it preferable to other systems. All the same, she was happy to draw on the cachet of her and Romilly's crested backgrounds when it suited her purposes after they came to live in Washington, D.C.\u2014paving the way to invitations from Washington Post publisher Eugene Meyer to stay at his lushly appointed home in Mount Kisco, as well as to a long friendship with his daughter Katherine Graham\u2014just as she sedulously played down her aristo credentials when she thought they would prove troublesome. (She presumably did not let her many radical friends in on her blue-chip origins or the fact that she had inherited a share of her family's private island retreat off the coast of Scotland upon her brother's death.) In 1941, at the age of 23, Esmond was killed when the Royal Canadian Air Force mission he was on was shot down over Bremen. Within short order, Decca, who was left to grieve in her adoptive country with a baby daughter, Constancia, was being courted by Robert Treuhaft, a lawyer with impeccable Jacobin credentials. The two married in 1943, and in 1947 they moved with their growing family\u2014Decca had given birth to a son, Nicholas, and Benjamin came along three years later\u2014to a largely black neighborhood in Oakland, Calif. Although her richly detailed letters are full of charming anecdotes about her children, Decca described her parental style as one of \"benign neglect\" and was resolutely undomestic, preferring to expend her energies on picketing, leafleting, and generally raising a ruckus about whatever misdemeanor caught her ire. In 1958, she published an article on expensive funeral practices called \"St. Peter, Don't You Call Me\" in a small magazine called Frontier that would eventually blossom into her 1963 expose of the funeral industry, The American Way of Death. The book, which became a best seller and made her name, was the first sustained example of Mitford's \"poison penmanship\" (the title she gave to the 1979 collection of her take-no-prisoners investigative pieces). As was true for much of her journalism, Decca took an ends-justifies-the-means approach to securing information; she posed as a bereaved widow in order to gain access and was spared by her husband from having to view an actual embalming before describing it in full gory details. Over the years, Decca's reverse snobbism led her to embrace the disempowered and even the bien-pensant rich, with their \"super-plush\" houses, but never, ever the irredeemably middle-class\u2014the sort of people, as she sniffingly characterized them, who sell \"USED CARS for a living.\" Her upper-class English background was successfully eradicated to the point where she felt comfortable hosting Leadbelly as a houseguest. But traces of it lingered in her aesthetic judgments and visceral responses\u2014in her description, for instance, of Knoxville, Tenn.: \"The Haley ranch,\" Sally Belfrage, one of several younger friends Decca counseled and shared confidences with, \"is a dream/nightmare of marvellous comfort and incredibly hideous d\u00e9cor. I shared a cottage ... furnished with fake Louis IV things & false flowers & false ferns.\" Despite her lifelong nose-thumbing campaign against all her family stood for, Decca remained very much a champagne socialist. She was her parents' daughter in matters of taste both small and large, someone who had certain \"U\" standards bred into her bones (such as never resorting to paper napkins or furniture of inauthentic provenance) and who was \"brought up never to cry in front of other people.\" These letters are rarely less than amusing, colored by a salubrious scorn for the pieties and deceit of the status quo and marked by Decca's gimlet eye for the maliciously telling detail. All the same, it can become taxing to spend long periods of time in the company of someone playing so incessantly for laughs. Did Decca experience a moment of sadness, doubt, or vulnerability in her life? With the exception of her correspondence with her grandchildren and the young, which features a more closeted, lovelorn part of her, one would have to conclude that mockery always had the upper hand when it came to anything to do with feelings, especially those she deemed unseemly. (\"You know those absurd expressions,\" she wrote, \"'Wounded,' 'Pained,' 'Hurt' ?\") Vitriolic archness was her first and last defense, abetted by an almost compulsive lack of self-reflection. Openness about the more shadowy corners of experience was one of the many things, along with psychiatry and religion, that Decca simply didn't \"go in for.\" Her lapses in empathy are disturbing, especially toward people of pallor and privilege, as opposed to people of color and penury, and although one can admire her for her stoicism in the face of tragedy, it's hard not to wonder where stoicism leaves off and flintiness begins. The death of her son Nicholas, who was killed at the age of 10 when he was struck by a bus as he rode his bike, gets mentioned briefly in a telegram and follow-up note to Lady Redesdale, but then disappears from sight until the very end of the book. By her own account, Decca \"simply airbrushed\" Nicholas' existence out of her second memoir, A Fine Old Conflict: \"His birth, his short & delightful life, never mentioned.\" And yet, overall, it's impossible not to be drawn in by Decca's spiky charm and disarming curiosity, which remained with her to the end. \"I do wish I knew who Miss Jerry Hall, tall Texan, is,\" she wrote her younger sister Deborah in 1990, in response to a description of a ball her sister and her husband, the Duke of Devonshire, had given at Chartworth, the family estate, which both Mick Jagger and his then-girlfriend attended. Perhaps it's only Decca exerting her force of will once again, but in a world that seems to grow ever more homogenized, it is refreshing to encounter a one-of-a-kind character\u2014however eccentric and bullying\u2014especially at safe remove. In her penultimate letter, dated July 13, 1996, 10 days before she died of a metastasized lung cancer that had been diagnosed less than a month earlier, Mitford observed to her younger sister: \"Am also taking FULL ADVANTAGE of condition to press all sorts of things (lawsuits etc of no interest to you) on ground that you can't refuse a dying person's request.\" Decca remained a naughty child all her life, one who ventured out from the nursery, thinking of ever more ingenious ways to annoy or alarm the grownups. But who among us doesn't nurture a feisty inner imp, intent on having the last laugh before bedtime? \"And there is distrust in Washington. I am surprised, frankly, at the amount of distrust that exists in this town. And I'm sorry it's the case, and I'll work hard to try to elevate it.\"\u2014 Speaking on National Public Radio, Jan. 29, 2007.

The Bushism is at 4:30. For more, see \" [The Complete Bushisms](http://www.slate.com/id/76886/).\" . . Dear Timothy, To be fair, you neglected to mention [in \" [Bush's Baby Einstein Gaffe](http://www.slate.com/id/2158226/?nav/navoa/),\" Jan. 24] the $200,000 that I've donated to [The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children](http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/PublicHomeServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US) (every penny of profit made by [The Safe Side](https://www.thesafeside.com/)), the donation of a child safety program to every school district in the state of Texas, and the nearly $2 million dollars I've personally invested in educating kids on how to stay safe. Apparently, the $5,000 that my husband [donated to a Republican Senator](http://opensecrets.org/indivs/search.asp?NumOfThou=0&txtName=Clark%2C+William&txtState=CO&txtZip=&txtEmploy=&txtCand=Thune&txt2006=Y&txt2004=Y&Order=N) (not Bush) takes precedence. But I'm sure you consider yourself fair and balanced? Oh--and you might fact-check to determine which videos were produced by me prior to the sale of Baby Einstein to Disney. I didn't make [Baby DaVinci](http://www.babyeinstein.com/Common/Demos/ProductDemo.asp?ProductID=368), nor did I make any of the claims that you referenced in your article. And I was raised a Democrat! Imagine that. Have a great day. Julie Aigner-Clark Ms. Aigner-Clark is the founder of Baby Einstein, which she sold to the Walt Disney Co. in 2001. President Bush touted her accomplishments during the \"heroes\" portion of his 2007 [State of the Union address](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070123-2.html) (click [here](http://www.c-span.org/executive/stateoftheunion.asp) for the video). Dear Julie, 1.) I never said your husband donated $5,000 to Bush in 2004. I [said](http://www.slate.com/id/2158226/?nav/navoa/) he donated $5,150 to Bush and the Republican National Committee. That is a matter of [public record](http://opensecrets.org/indivs/search.asp?txtName=Clark&txtState=CO&txtZip=&txtEmploy=&txtCand=&txt2006=&txt2004=Y&txt2002=&txt2000=&txt1998=&txt1996=&txt1994=&txt1992=&txt1990=&txtSoft=N&Order=N&Cycles=1&Cycle1=2004&Cycle2=&Cycle3=&Page=2). 2.) I applaud your charitable contributions. I don't rate them up there with [leaping in front of a subway train to rescue a stranger](http://www.voanews.com/specialenglish/2007-01-28-voa3.cfm), or [repelling an enemy attack with two legs full of shrapnel](http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/01/24/1485-soldier-honored-at-state-of-the-union-address/), which is what two of the other honored \"heroes\" (seated with you beside the first lady in the House visitor's gallery) did. But they're generous contributions. You can afford them. 3.) I'm glad to learn that you no longer owned Baby Einstein when the video Baby DaVinci was marketed with the outrageous claim, \"[Y]our child will learn to identify her different body parts, and also discover her five senses ... in Spanish, English, and French!\" That claim is one basis for a consumer [complaint](http://www.commercialfreechildhood.org/babyvideos/babyvideocomplaint.pdf) filed against Baby Einstein with the Federal Trade Commission last spring\u2014a complaint that includes letters of support from the [American Academy of Pediatrics](http://www.commercialfreechildhood.org/babyvideos/attachments/AAP%20letter%20of%20support.pdf) and the [American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry](http://www.commercialfreechildhood.org/babyvideos/attachments/aacap%20letter%20of%20support.pdf). But another basis for the complaint ( [see p. 7](http://www.commercialfreechildhood.org/babyvideos/babyvideocomplaint.pdf)) is the name of the company itself, which was bestowed on your watch: The brand name \"Baby Einstein\" sends an initial message to consumers that the videos are educational and beneficial. Even Baby Einstein founder Julie Clark has admitted that the name \"Einstein has become a generic term for a smart person.\" A footnote cites a 1946 decision, Jacob Seigel Co. v. F.T.C., which \"held that a product's name can play a role in implying a claim.\" There is no evidence that parking a child under the age of two in front of a video\u2014any video\u2014will make him smarter, and there's some evidence that it may do him harm, which is why the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against it. By all accounts, what Baby Einstein videos are really good for is distracting the baby while Mom or Dad sneaks off to take a shower. I'm a parent myself, and I well remember those moments when a baby could feel like the commandant of a particularly inhumane prisoner-of-war camp. (No, you may not go to the toilet! I don't care how long you've been waiting!) But you didn't market these videos under the brand name Baby Hypnotize or Baby Chloroform. You marketed them under the name Baby [Einstein](http://www.alberteinstein.info/). That's deceptive. What's more, your disassociation from marketing practices undertaken by Walt Disney Co. after you sold Baby Einstein strikes me as disingenuous. You may no longer own the company, but President Bush said [in his speech](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070123-2.html) that \"with [your] help Baby Einstein has grown into a $200 million business.\" That suggests that you maintained a role in the company after you sold it. [Your picture](http://www.babyeinstein.com/about/01-03_founder.asp) appears beside the words, \"Our Founder,\" on a Baby Einstein Web page. And [that's you](http://www.babyeinstein.com/about/01-03_founder.asp) in a QuickTime video on that same Web page touting the videos. \"We use art to teach color to children in really fun, silly ways,\" you say. Not \"We used to teach color in really fun, silly ways, before those unscrupulous hacks at Disney took over.\" And in what sense can a video really \"teach\" an infant anything? What evidence do you have that anything is being learned, other than an early attachment to the TV screen? 4.) You may have been raised a Democrat, but you are now being used by Republicans. Don't mistake the president's mentioning you in his speech as anything other than condescension\u2014a condescension of which Democrats are equally capable. If President Bush cared at all about the issue of child development, then someone on his staff would have taken the five minutes necessary to discover that prominent medical professionals consider the business you founded to be a scam. (For that matter, if President Bush cared at all about the issue of early child development, then he wouldn't have [let Head Start funding lie flat](http://www.saveheadstart.org/backpages/headstartFY07signed.pdf) during the past five years. But that's another story.) The White House's choosing to spotlight your accomplishment was surely meant to demonstrate its commitment to children, to families, and to all those other womanly good feelings it fears that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D., Calif., taps into with female voters. But in failing to perform even rudimentary research on what it is Baby Einstein actually does, the White House ended up demonstrating the precise opposite. The fact that this screw-up attracted less attention in the press than the president's absent-mindedly referring to the \" [Democrat](http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/013107/dems.html)\" rather than the \"Democratic\" party further shows that President Bush's indifference to these \"women's\" issues is widely shared in newsrooms. Cheers, Timothy Noah Is Barack Obama\u2014 [junior U.S. and \" [exploratory\" presidential candidate](http://www.barackobama.com/)\u2014the second coming of our Savior and our Redeemer, Prince of Peace and King of Kings, Jesus Christ? His press coverage suggests we can't dismiss this possibility out of hand. I therefore inaugurate the Obama Messiah Watch, which will periodically highlight gratuitously adoring biographical details that appear in newspaper, television, and magazine profiles of this otherworldly presence in our midst. Today's item, from a [Los Angeles Times profile](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-oxy29jan29,0,667925.story?coll=la-home-headlines) by Larry Gordon about Obama's two years at Occidental College (before he transferred to Columbia): In [political science professor Roger] Boesche's European politics class, [classmate Ken] Sulzer said he was impressed at how few notes [italics mine] Obama took. \"Where I had five pages, Barry had probably a paragraph of the pithiest, tightest prose you'd ever see. ... It was very short, very sweet. Obviously somebody almost Clintonesque in being able to sum a whole lot of concepts and place them into a succinct written style.\" Readers are invited to submit similar details\u2014Obama walking on water, Obama sating the hunger of 5,000 with five loaves and two fishes\u2014from other Obama profiles.

Click [here](http://www.slate.com/id/2157863/) to read the other entries in the series. Michael Lewis first began his \"Dad Again\" column after the birth of his second daughter, Dixie, in 2002. Click [here](http://www.slate.com/id/2064335/) to read about that delivery. There was a warning sign before the trouble began, but I missed it. The afternoon I brought Tabitha home from the hospital was also the day of our neighbor's glamorous wedding, in which Quinn and Dixie were to be the flower girls. In walked Tabitha, and off flounced her little girls with other grown-ups to the Mark Hopkins Hotel, to have their hair and makeup done, and then lead a bride to her doom. Good, I thought, the little monsters are gone for the day, and Tabitha will have one day of peace in the house, before the war resumes. But when I deliver mother's milk tea to her in bed, I find her sobbing. \"I just wanted to be there when our little girls walked down the aisle,\" she says, as if they, not our neighbor, were getting married. This is unusual; her mind has a slight tendency to race to some tragic conclusion, but she usually stops it before it arrives. I hug her, pretend to sympathize, tell her that it's no big deal to miss just one of approximately 3,000 occasions on which her little girls will dress up like princesses and preen in public. And she appears to agree, and to feel better. Fixed that one, I think, and move on to the next. A family is like a stereo system: A stereo system is only as good as its weakest component, and a family is only as happy as its unhappiest member. Occasionally that is me; more often it is someone else; and so I must remain vigilant, lest the pleasure of my own life be dampened by their unhappiness. On this first night, even after the girls return, it is not. I can't believe it: Five people in the room and there is nothing wrong with any of them. I'm like a man who has fallen from a 10-story building only to get up and walk away without a scratch. I'd count all my blessings, but I'd run out of fingers, so I stick with the big ones. For the first time in three attempts, my wife has given birth without needing doctors to save the child's life or hers. She's so physically robust that she declined a second free night in the hospital and came home early. Our baby is healthy and\u2014a first in my experience of newborns\u2014reasonable. He cries when he's hungry and weeps before he farts and otherwise appears to be satisfied with the world as he finds it. Even his older sisters have gone into remission. Eight hours of the full princess treatment distracts them for a few more from their [suspicion that a new baby brother means less of everything for them](http://www.slate.com/id/2157845/). We spend an hour in front of the fire like a fairy tale family, listening to them relive their first wedding. \"When we walked down the aisle, they played Taco Bell's Canyon,\" Quinn says, knowingly. (Named for its German composer, Johann TacoBell.) When they're done, they yawn and go off to bed, sweetly, like fairy tale children, and leave us with fairy tale leisure\u2014which we use to decode this year's Christmas cards, stacked up and waiting for weeks. There's the drummer in the rock band who sends us a card each year but each year has got himself an entirely new family. Not merely a new wife but, seemingly, new cousins, aunts, and uncles. Who are they? There's a couple we've never seen, apart from in the picture they've helpfully included, but who say how nice it was to get together with us not once but twice in 2006. Who are they? Two happy little girls sleep in their bunks, and a new baby boy sleeps in the contraption Tabitha has rigged up beside our bed\u2014having given away the expensive co-sleeper she swore we'd never again need because she was done having babies. In time she joins him, and so I curl up with Malthus' Essay on the Principle of Population, a new edition for which, oddly enough, I owe an introduction. \"I think I may fairly make two postulates,\" writes Malthus, before advancing the most famously wrong prediction about humanity ever made. \"First, That food is necessary to the existence of man. Secondly, That the passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain nearly in its present state.\" And off he sets, with the cool hysteria of the Unabomber's Manifesto, to argue that my biggest problem circa 2007 should be a shortage of corn. On the other side of the Bay, fireworks explode. It's New Year's Eve. Just before 2 in the morning, I'm prodded awake. It's Tabitha, with a look on her face I've never seen there before. \"I'm sorry,\" she says. \"Okay,\" I say. \"What's the matter?\" But I already know it's serious. She's fighting very hard to hold it together. Her eyes dart around, and she fidgets as if she itches in 50 places at once. \"I don't know,\" she says, \"I'm really, really scared.\" She's like an addict in need of a fix that does not exist. She's terrified. Worse, she doesn't know what she's terrified of. All she knows is that she can't be alone, can't even close her eyes in my presence without shuddering with fear. \"I think I might need to go to the emergency room,\" she says, reluctantly, and she might. But it's 2 in the morning, we have three small children in the house, the neighbors are all gone, and the nearest blood relation is 2,000 miles away. \"Tell me exactly what you feel.\" \"As if something really bad's going to happen.\" Tears fill her eyes. \"I feel like I don't have any control of anything. I feel like I might be going insane.\" Five minutes later I'm leaving messages on doctors' voice mails with one hand and Googling with the other: Childbirth. Panic. At the top pops alternative translations of Psalm 48:6 (Panic seized them there, Anguish, as of a woman in childbirth). Skipping down I find what appears to be a relevant entry: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders After Childbirth. \"Have you ever heard of this?\" I ask her. \"No,\" she says. But then a lot of unpleasant things can happen to a woman after childbirth, and you don't hear about most of them until they happen to your wife in the middle of the night. \"Don't leave me alone,\" she says, trembling beside me. I don't think I've ever seen her scared of anything, and she is now more frightened than I've ever seen another human being outside of the movies. She's the little kid in The Sixth Sense. She sees dead people. Still, born with the ability to remain calm in the face of other people's misery, I feel more curious than alarmed. People who actually are going insane don't know they are going insane. Googling on, I finally come to a plausible-sounding Web page written by a psychiatrist named Christine Hibbert. \"Three common fears experienced by women with a Postpartum Panic Disorder are: 1) fear of dying, 2) fear of losing control, and/or 3) fear that one is going crazy.\" It's like finding the picture of the red-throated diver in the bird-watching manual right after you've glimpsed one for the first time. Postpartum Panic Disorder: So now the thing has a name. Roughly one in 10 women experiences it after childbirth. How, then, could we never have heard of it? At length a doctor calls back: Stay with her, she says, and do what you can to calm her down. But she may become completely hysterical, in which case she'll need to go to the hospital. The next six hours offer a new experience. She can't sleep; she can't close her eyes for fear of her mind thinking some terrible thought. But I know\u2014or think I know, which amounts to the same thing\u2014that she's suffering from some chemical glitch that would repair itself in time and that a pill would fix instantly. What she feels has nothing to do with who she is. It's a state of mind triggered by an event that she will never again endure. She might just as well have turned bright green for a day. But she doesn't know this. She's sure as Malthus that this terror is going to be with her forever\u2014and yet she's as brave as she can be about it. Amazingly, the only thing that makes her feel better is me. I fix her tea, rub her back, and try to enjoy being the sane one for as long as it lasts.

Please send your questions for publication to [prudence@slate.com](mailto:prudence@slate.com). (Questions may be edited.) Dear Prudence, I attend a university on full scholarship, but as part of this scholarship, I'm required to keep a 3.5 average. This isn't so easy in the sciences. Many of my professors won't even give an A. I live in constant fear that my grades aren't high enough, because if they aren't, I'll get kicked out of the program and have to find a way to pay for college by myself. I am beginning to think that fearing the loss of my scholarship is actually worse than losing it would be. I've been in high-level classes my whole life, always made to feel like I have to be amazing to justify my existence, like it's never OK to mess up. I don't think I can take that kind of pressure anymore and it makes me very depressed; the downward spiral this causes has been going on for about two or three years now. In the last year (especially the last few months), I've lost a lot of weight due to the constant stress. Is it wrong to want to be just a normal student like everyone else? Am I really wasting my potential if I decide I'd rather be a good student with a healthy life instead of an amazing student who's a constant wreck? My family tells me it will be a horrible waste of money if I don't have free college anymore, but I'm not sure it's even their business, since they won't give me a dime. Am I a bad person just because I don't want to push myself anymore? \u2014Tormented Dear Tormented, Make two appointments, and make them today: one with your academic adviser and the other with a therapist at the school's counseling office. Yes, you are entitled to be normal; yes, you are entitled to not be amazing at everything; yes, you are even entitled to mess up now and then. Are the people who've pushed you so mercilessly to always excel perfect themselves? Not everyone finds college to be one of the greatest times of their lives, but having it be a torment means something's got to stop, and fast. Ideally, college should be a time not only of achievement but of exploration. Maybe you're in the wrong major, or you need to take a semester off. Maybe you need to take some art classes, or spend a year abroad. Your academic adviser should be able to talk to you about how to figure this out and how to deal with the requirements of your scholarship, or find another one that's more suitable for you. Your therapist should help you look at how to shake off the burden of others' expectations and find out what you want to do with your own life. \u2014Prudie Dear Prudie, For over 15 years I have corresponded with my favorite college professor. We seldom visited each other, but stayed in regular touch with letters. Just before the holidays, she wrote me that she has late-stage cancer. I called her immediately and we talked calmly and easily of her plans for this last stage of life. She has perhaps a year to live. I haven't written her again, as I'm not sure what to say\u2014I do not want to be maudlin or self-centered. My friend is a kind, brilliant, and courageous woman. She has helped me enormously throughout our friendship, especially after the death of my own child. Still, I can't seem to begin to write, though our last conversation was not at all awkward. Can you help? \u2014Blocked Dear Blocked, During your time of terrible grief, she showed you what it means to stay close, and how to find the right words. By doing the same for her, you will let her know that she has continued to be the best teacher you ever had. Tell her what she has meant to you and how extraordinary she is. Then fill your letter with the kind of news you would normally share. Yes, she is facing the end of her life, but she sounds like someone who will be fully engaged with that life until the end. Don't let your discomfort mar this rare friendship. \u2014Prudie Dear Prudie, I became engaged to a wonderful man a few months ago, and will be married this year. The question of my married name has come up several times. I want to change my maiden name to my middle name and have my husband's last name as mine. For example, once Betty Jane Doe marries John Smith, her name would become Betty Doe Smith. My husband-to-be, however, would prefer I drop my maiden name and use my middle name and his last name: Betty Jane Smith. He thinks my preference is \"snobbish.\" I chose it because I like what it represents\u2014me before I met my husband and after. We both feel strongly, and cannot come to a decision. I realize marriage takes sacrifice, but is this something I should have to give up? \u2014What's in a Name? Dear What's, Is Hillary Rodham Clinton considered a snob because she uses her maiden and married names? Was Harriet Beecher Stowe? Yes, marriage involves sacrifice\u2014but what is the sacrifice being offered by John Smith here? It just sounds as if he's bullying you. Certainly a couple should be able to discuss their feelings about the name question\u2014but ultimately a husband has to respect his wife's decision to keep her maiden name, or make it her middle name, or hyphenate her name, etc. In your case, I'd be tempted to tell him you've decided to call yourself Harriet Beecher Stowe, and he can stuff it. He may be a wonderful guy, but until he can say that Betty Doe Smith sounds beautiful to him, I wouldn't take that walk down the aisle. \u2014Prudie Dear Prudie, I have been with my loving, attractive, intelligent boyfriend for three years. I'm genuinely happy in the relationship and have no intention of not being in it. I work in public relations, and often flirt with other men, innocently, at networking events or otherwise. The problem is, I have a really difficult time telling people that I'm already spoken for. I fear I'll offend a man who's potentially interested in me, and thus lose a business contact. How can I politely, firmly, and honestly tell someone that I'm off the market? \u2014Off the Market but Still in the Marketplace Dear Off, What is the nature of this flirting if it results in your constantly having to say \"Down, boy!\" to potential clients? Are you using the Samantha Jones character from Sex and the City as your role model for how to advance in PR? Sure, if you're young, attractive, and friendly, men will come on to you. But it sounds as if you're sending off vibes that announce your sexual availability more than your professional skills. If every time you're out to increase your contacts those contacts want to increase your physical contact, something is going on. Do you have a trusted friend, male or female, who has seen you in these settings, whom you can talk to about whether you're coming on too strong? And what's your hesitation at saying to an interested man, \"Oh, thanks, but I have a boyfriend\"? Could it be that you enjoy encouraging the sexual intrigue? \u2014Prudie Cuba has announced it will [send](http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N31430606.htm) a group of doctors to help Castro's old ally President Daniel Ortega bolster the health system in Nicaragua. Castro also [sent](http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2006/12/29/morales_says_cuban_doctors_top_us_medical_aid/) about 1,700 physicians to Bolivia in 2006 to lend aid to the government of Evo Morales. Why does Cuba have so many doctors to spare? Well, because Castro said so. The Cuban constitution [guarantees](http://www.embacubalebanon.com/constite.html) every inhabitant the \"right to health protection and care.\" After the revolution in 1959, half of the country's 6,000 doctors fled the island. The new government promoted medical education as part of a national project to revamp the health-care system, and by 1984, Cuba had enough doctors to put a physician and a nurse in every neighborhood. Some will tell you Cubans become doctors because they believe in universal health care; others emphasize the social and economic rewards. (Doctor aren't paid much, though\u2014some make [less than $40 a month](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4583668.stm).) Whatever their motivations, Cuba has more doctors per capita than any other country: 70,000 for a population of 11 million. As a result, Cuba's national health-care system\u2014there is no private care in Cuba\u2014is widely [praised](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/5232628.stm), and the Latin American School of Medical Science in Havana [attracts](http://www.economist.com/world/la/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8597159) students from around the world. But some say the system has been crippled by a [lack of supplies](http://www.slate.com/id/2674/). The combination of the U.S. embargo and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba's primary financier and supplier, have hurt Cuba's access to medical equipment. Some critics of Castro cite his own dire medical condition\u2014and the decision to bring in a [Spanish doctor](http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N17351242.htm) to treat him\u2014as evidence of a failed system. But the numbers suggest Cubans lead healthy lives. [Life expectancy in Cuba](http://www.who.int/countries/cub/en/) is the same as that of the [United States](http://www.who.int/countries/usa/en/), and its rate of HIV/AIDS is one of the world's lowest. In fact, Cuba's [medical prowess](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4583668.stm) may be its ticket out of poverty. In the 1990s, Cuba was the first country to develop a meningitis B vaccine. In 2005, Cuba provided cancer treatment technology for a new biotech company in China. Then last year Washington agreed to make an exception to the trade embargo to allow a California firm to test a Cuban cancer treatment. Thanks to an increase in biotech exports, Cuba raised its health budget a couple of years ago to $300 million. So, if having all these doctors has helped Cuba, why does Castro send so many of them abroad? Part of it is Cuba's commitment to internationalism, another ideal of the revolution. (Political opponents say the government is showcasing one success of an otherwise botched revolution.) \"Medical diplomacy\" is also a way to win and keep friends, and to trade services for goods that Cuba wouldn't have otherwise. For example, about 15,000 Cuban doctors and dentists currently work in Venezuela, while President Hugo Chavez supplies Cuba with oil. Castro even [offered](http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/americas/09/05/katrina.cuba/index.html) to send a group of 1,600 doctors to the Gulf Coast after Katrina, but he said the United States didn't respond.

Beloved Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro was [euthanized](http://msn.foxsports.com/horseracing/story/6421288?MSNHPHCP>1=9012) Monday after an eight-month struggle to recover from the broken hind leg he suffered at the Preakness Stakes last year. Barbaro's owners stressed soon after his injury that they wanted him to live whether or not he could breed. How healthy does a horse have to be to sire a foal? In theory, Barbaro could still get a mare pregnant. A stallion can father foals through artificial insemination or embryo transfer even after he's dead. But Barbaro was a special kind of racing horse called a [Thoroughbred](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred). (Only a Thoroughbred can compete for horse racing's triple crown.) According to the [rules](http://www.thejockeyclub.com/registry.asp?section=3) of the Jockey Club, which sets the standards for Thoroughbred breeding in the United States, no offspring that results from artificial insemination or embryo transfer can have the coveted designation. The only way a thoroughbred is allowed to reproduce is by \"live cover\"; i.e., horse-to-horse sexual intercourse. Barbaro was never able to become a father; his nagging leg injuries made it [dangerous](http://news.bloodhorse.com/viewstory.asp?id=33813) for him to even attempt mounting a mare. The Jockey Club has never allowed artificial insemination, or AI. Vials of frozen sperm are easier to transport and dilute and can impregnate more mares than live cover, so AI could produce a glut of thoroughbreds born from popular studs and mares. Some breeders believe this could result in the overproliferation of offspring from particularly desirable studs, and limit [genetic diversity](http://www.wildhorsepreservation.com/resources/genetic.html). If too much of a thoroughbred's sperm were available, it would be less rare, and perhaps less valuable. (It was estimated that Barbaro, who was 4 years old when he died, could have commanded [$1 million a year](http://www.examiner.com/a-115985~Breeding_Barbaro_could_earn_millions_for_owners.html) had he recovered enough [to mate](http://www.alphahorse.com/horse-mating.html).

AI is less physically dangerous for both the male and female than natural breeding, and can be done in a couple of ways. Handlers have a stallion mount a \"breeding phantom,\" which resembles a pommel horse and comes outfitted with a rubber-lined vagina that can be adjusted to match the temperature, pressure, and lubrication level of the real thing. Breeders can also use a female in heat or one who has been given hormones as a \"mount mare,\" to attract the stallion for mounting and semen collection in an artificial vagina. The deposit can be [chilled](http://www.equitainer.com/Equine/Cooled_Semen/Background.htm) to around 39 degrees Fahrenheit and refrigerated for up to 70 hours before use. For longer storage, horse semen can be frozen, but this doesn't always work. Meanwhile, Barbaro's [bloodline lives on](http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/horse_racing/articles/2006/05/19/barbaro_appears_to_be_a_breed_apart/), even though he wasn't able to breed. His parents, Dynaformer and La Ville Rouge, have produced about 1,000 thoroughbreds combined. Got a question about today's news? [Ask the Explainer](mailto:ask_the_explainer@yahoo.com).

Cartagena\u2014And a fine lunch is offered, for visiting writers, at the beautiful naval museum of the city of Cartagena de Indias, the old, walled citadel that is the pearl of the Colombian coast. The ostensible purpose of the banquet is to sample the delicacies of \"Macondo\": the magic-realist domain brought to vivid life by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez in One Hundred Years of Solitude. That invitation could be offered any year, but it is just now four decades since the novel's publication, and the museum\u2014normally heavy with encrusted old ships' cannon and other marine tackle\u2014has an entire floor of paintings and etchings given over to depicting the scenes and denizens and personalities of the Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez story. Since the English adventurer Sir Francis Drake\u2014or \"the pirate Drake,\" as he is known in these latitudes\u2014makes a couple of appearances in the tale, this is somehow within the flexible maritime rules. For this reader, the most arresting episode in the Macondo saga was the epidemic of insomnia that afflicted the tribe. Crazed with sleeplessness, and forgetting elementary words, the villagers at first decided to write the names of things (like knife or cow) and affix them to the relevant objects. But then they passed into a new state of insane awakeness, which made them also forget how to read. ... In the nicest possible way, Cartagena is still a city that never sleeps. There is music, and various discrepant forms of private enterprise, at all hours. How else to commemorate the 40th anniversary of a century? Well, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez himself is now 79, so a competition is being announced to find the 39 best young writers in Spanish America, the results perhaps to be announced before old \"Gabo\" himself turns 80. Forty plus 39 is 79. For that matter, one third of 39 is 13. While all this numinous calculation is being pursued in the secular and literary world, I pay a visit to the adjacent cathedral of Santa Catalina de Alejandr\u00eda. A large plaque, dated January 2007, informs me without sentiment that the lovely old church has been restored, by the combined good offices of Carlos Mattos Barrero and \"Hyundai Colombia Automotriz.\" (Drake pounded the old Spanish cathedral with ball and shot because the papists did not bring him the silver ingots fast enough, but his mercenary Protestant rage seems quaint when contrasted with this matter-of-fact materialism.) Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez himself floats above and even somewhat beyond these local preoccupations. His handsome house near the old walls is proudly pointed out, but he is as often to be found in his other habitations in either Havana or Los Angeles, and may indeed be the only person now living who can appear\u2014or perhaps I mean to say \"materialize\"\u2014with equal facility in either one of those two improbable cities. Cartagena prefers in some ways to propose itself as more prosaic: as Colombia's most orderly and normal center of population. The inhabitants of Cali and Medell\u00edn may have lived for decades in a narco-world of tense wakefulness and fear, and friends in the capital of Bogot\u00e1 tell me that it's only in the past few months of the tough-minded Uribe regime that they have felt safe taking a drive out of the city at weekends. But in Cartagena one is supposed to be able to relax and take a paseo at any time without apprehension. As if to prove this point too much\u2014the permanent tendency of all nervous governments\u2014Colombian military and police forces were at every corner of the city for the annual literary festival, assuming relaxed yet vigilant postures, and my own little public event was drowned out by the hovering of a deafening helicopter. I later learned that the vice president had planned to attend, and that the security nightmare had to be viewed in light of the fact that, in an earlier phase of his career, he had been a long-term, compulsory guest of the great cocaine cartelista Pablo Escobar. I gathered this information at a cocktail party in the beautiful Palace of the Inquisition, scene of many hideous dramas (including a personal appearance in the main square by the devil himself, before he was successfully exorcised) and now the home to the gentlest museum of torture in the hemisphere. It's pretty obvious that the replica of the guillotine in the courtyard does not date from the Inquisition, because the guillotine was invented by later French opponents of clerical absolutism, but underneath almost every other instrument of faith-based sadism appears the reassurance (written in Spanish only) that this particular item was never in fact put to use in Cartagena. An unsorted museum of virtual artifacts of fictional torture, or of might-have-been autos da fe, has something particularly Colombian about it. \"In fact,\" sighed a knowing Colombian friend, \"this whole country is a case of samples. We have some iron, but not much. We have some emeralds, but not that many. We have oil, but only a little. We have coffee, but not enough of it. ...\" He left the statement unfinished. Colombia does have one product which is unrivalled both in its purity and in its abundance, and as I write these words there are millions of people in the West quite willing to pay excellent money just to acquire a hint of this magical powder. It was decreed long ago, however, by the lords of Macondo, that only criminals and bandits would be able to take part in the trade. Our own politicians are inconsistent about everything else, but since the time of Richard Nixon, they have been unswervingly obedient to Macondo rules. In this lovely place, which we in our arrogance consider to be a problem rather than a country, you can see the frozen and preserved legacy of Nixon's \"war on drugs\" and even Bill Clinton's \" [Plan Colombia](http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/colombia.noframes/story/essays/clark/).\" Try asking why this policy is still pursued in spite of its evident and repeated and inevitable failure, and why it has been allowed to poison the society with death squads and corruption and poverty, and you will receive no answer. That's because everyone involved is so janglingly and hectically wide awake, and so hooked on the junk speed of \"zero tolerance,\" that they have completely and absolutely and blissfully forgotten. Monday, as Food and Wine scrambled to cover up a leak of who won Bravo's Top Chef competition before bloggers could pounce on it (to no avail\u2014click [here](http://la.eater.com/archives/2007/01/29/breaking_top_chef_finale_spoiled_again.php#more) if you really want to know), it demonstrated how decidedly perishable food TV is today. It's hard to imagine the same fervor being applied to an episode of Baking With Julia. While the days of the lone host chattering behind the counter as she demonstrates how to make boeuf bourguignon may not be doomed, they are at least dispirited. New programming has largely been given the American Idol treatment, repeatedly reformulated as a talent contest with a deliberately careerist bent, promising amateur and unknown cooks money, jobs, and plenty of PR. The Food Network has [The Next Food Network Star](http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_nf_vote); BBC America ran the more pedagogical Master Chef; even PBS had its own contest, [Cooking Under Fire](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cookingunderfire/about/index.html), with a job at one of Todd English's restaurants as the prize. The most compelling of these cooking competitions, in terms of ratings and zeitgeist, have been [Top Chef](http://www.bravotv.com/Top_Chef_2/index.shtml), which wraps up its second season tomorrow night, and Gordon Ramsay's [Hell's Kitchen](http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/) on Fox. Top Chef, from the creators of Project Runway, offers a similar structure to the popular fashion talent-search program. The show starts with 15 contestants, from self-taught caterers to French-trained chefs. Each week presents two challenges: one quickie, which generally earns the winner immunity from elimination, and one more elaborate, which gets the loser or losers kicked off. As with Project Runway, the challenges have little to do with the real demands of the profession. There's no demand for consistently acing the same dish night after night, or for dealing with investors, employees, or customers with allergies. But they're fun to watch nonetheless: Contestants have a stingy two hours to cook a dish of variety meats like pigs' trotters or oxtails; they must make a classy snack out of a Kraft product. Much of the food looks disastrous\u2014overcooked eggs, soggy funnel cakes\u2014but some looks truly well-conceived\u2014 scallion beignets](http://www.bravotv.com/Top_Chef_2/rate/episode_5/sam.shtml), or with clams and saffron](http://www.bravotv.com/Top_Chef_2/recipes/episode_11/elim/ilan.shtml). Of course since we can't taste it, we have to trust the judges even more than reality contests about singing or fashion, and it's an uneasy relationship. Foxy host Padma Lakshmi, a model, actress, and cookbook writer, who parades around the kitchen in belly shirts, doubles as a judge, along with stiff Food and Wine editor Gail Simmons, and semi-gruff head judge chef [Tom Colicchio](http://www.craftrestaurant.com/). One of the distinct pleasures of Top Chef is its star power. The panelists are joined by rotating guest chefs: real-life restaurant idols, the kind who don't usually show up on cooking shows, like Suzanne Goin of [Lucques](http://www.lucques.com/), and Eric Ripert of [Le Bernardin](http://www.le-bernardin.com/). Last week, when dreamy frontrunner Sam Talbot was booted off, the show abandoned any pretense that it was seeking a winner truly ready to run a restaurant. Instead, the final episode will witness what feels like a bronze-medal match between Ilan Hall, who has been a line cook at Mario Batali-owned Casa Mono in New York and Marcel Vigneron, who cooks at Jo\u00ebl Robuchon's Las Vegas restaurant. Both are young and brash men who have goaded each other throughout the series. With lofty hair and a needling voice, Vigneron has been the show's pest since the first episode when, unbidden, he showed his knife collection off to Hall. Hall has shown himself unable to resist Vigneron's baiting, insulting him in front of the camera, the judges, and anyone else who will listen. Talbot's ouster provoked bloggers, who claimed that the producers somehow pushed the judges to pit the rivals against each other. No doubt Bravo can milk Hall and Vigneron's sneering rivalry, but in its own half-baked way, their battle is bringing a very real aesthetic conflict to a broader audience. Though we as viewers can't taste it, we get that Hall's food is essentially conservative, while Vigneron's is sometimes stupidly, occasionally ingeniously, provocative. Hall is a practitioner of the elevated rustic, using big, broad, mostly Spanish flavors like smoked paprika and saffron, while Vigneron is a self-proclaimed molecular gastronomist, inclined toward digital scales and algae derivatives that make sauces more viscous. He is criticized by the judges and fellow contestants for repeatedly making foams\u2014a double whammy since foams are neither new ( [Ferran Adria's](http://www.elbulli.com/) been doing them for a decade now), nor reliably classic. But in last week's Hawaii challenge, it was a frothy dish\u2014a take on Hawaiian salted salmon\u2014that ensured his place in the finale. Somehow, Top Chef is less endearing than its sister, Runway, though. There is no Tim Gunn-like mentor in the kitchen to help guide the chefs to better work, nor is the matter-of-fact Colicchio a rival for the hilariously bitchy critiques of Runway regular Michael Kors. And finally there are the contestants themselves, who seem all too media-hungry for my taste. In the end, the only character I had any really fondness for was Michael Midgely, the party-boy line cook, who made it farther than expected because he learned from his better-skilled competitors. In his cooking contest, [Hell's Kitchen](http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/), due to return to Fox this summer, Gordon Ramsay, the lauded and fully media-saturated British chef/restaurateur emphasizes the daily grind and pressure of restaurant cooking more than creativity. He has his wannabe chefs run a made-for-TV restaurant and chews them out with his famously filthy mouth. It's all very shrill, although I agree with his basic premise that the cooking life is a hard, repetitive one. Those who are missing Hell's Kitchen can turn to the BBC America broadcast of his series [The F Word](http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/159/about.jsp), which will resume its season on March 4, where Ramsay chews out not aspiring chefs, but \"passionate amateurs\" who cook with him purely for the thrill of being called, say, a twat on television. In the nine-part series, a different crew of amateurs\u2014male butchers one week, female doctors another\u2014cook in another made-for-TV \"restaurant,\" competing to see which group can get the most customers to agree to pay for their food. Interspersed with the not-too-compelling drama of the amateurs is Ramsay on a series of food adventures, teaching hapless bachelors and divorcees to cook something wholesome. As a sign of humility, Ramsay has regular recipe cook-offs with various British celebrities, and repeatedly loses. The general message is that restaurant cooking is best reserved for hard-asses like Ramsay, but that preparing good food is very much in the reach of the average cook. I like Ramsay when he's bantering filthily with some of the celebrities he invites on his show, but The F Word has none of the direction of his earlier show, [Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares](http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/154/index.jsp), [which I adored](http://www.slate.com/id/2111851/). The F Word's competitions put very little on the line. In fact, I found the overproduced recipe segment my favorite part of the show. At least the camera lingered on the food, not the theatrics of the guy making it, as culinary competitions are compelled to do. I'm tired of contests, now\u2014the time is ripe for someone to reinvent the old-fashioned recipe show. Last Thursday, the Lebanese were offered a shuddering contrast on their television screens. For much of the day, they watched an international financial conference held in Paris on Lebanon's behalf, which [brought in](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6296729.stm) more than $7 billion in funds. Yet by late afternoon, Lebanese were watching Sunni and Shiite youths [battling in the streets](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6299037.stm) of Beirut. During the last two months, Lebanon has been dangerously destabilized by the political split between the opposition, led by Hezbollah and including some Christian and pro-Syrian groups, and the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, supported by a majority in parliament. Sunnis have rallied to Siniora, Shiites to Hezbollah. Given the concentric circles of interests impacting on Lebanese affairs, Iran and Syria are backing the opposition, while leading Arab states, the United States, and much of the international community are behind the government. Indeed, the Paris conference, called to help Lebanon overcome its ballooning debt, was hosted by French President Jacques Chirac largely to bolster Siniora against the challenge from Hezbollah and its foreign allies. Lebanon is one of several new front lines in a regional contest between the United States and the Sunni regimes of the Arab world on the one side, and Iran and its allies or proxies\u2014most significantly Syria, Hezbollah, and Hamas\u2014on the other. However, what is interesting is that all sides are resisting sectarian conflict. Neither Iran nor the Arab states want a Sunni-Shiite conflagration. Sectarian polarization would severely impair Iranian interests in the Arab world; it would also threaten the stability of Arab countries with sizeable Shiite communities. This is particularly true of Saudi Arabia, where Shiites make up 15 percent of the population, concentrated in the oil-rich Eastern Province. That is why avoiding Sunni-Shiite violence in Lebanon and elsewhere is so vital, and why both the Saudis and Iranians have recently been trying to sponsor a negotiated solution to the Lebanese crisis. At the forefront of talks on the Saudi side is the one-time ambassador to the United States and head of the kingdom's National Security Council, [Prince Bandar bin Sultan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar_Bin_Sultan); on the Iranian side, [Ali Larijani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Larijani), secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. A resolution is easier mentioned than done. The spoiler is Syria, which until 2005 was the power broker in Lebanon\u2014from which it was forced to withdraw after the [assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri](http://www.slate.com/id/2113565/). As Iranians and Saudis have been talking, Syria has been fidgeting, fearing it will have no say in a final deal. Yet the Syrians are in an odd position: keen to wreck the Siniora government's endorsement of a mixed Lebanese-international tribunal to try those involved in the Hariri murder; but also aware that a Sunni-Shiite war might undermine the minority Alawite regime of President Bashar Assad, which rules over a majority of Sunnis in Syria. The Assad regime is the prime suspect in Hariri's killing. The inability of Lebanese parties to compromise on the tribunal is a major reason the country is so mired in mutual antagonism. Syrian behavior puts Iran in a difficult position. The Iranian regime has strengthened its alliance with Syria in the past year, and knows that if the tribunal takes off, it might threaten Assad. In Iran's ongoing standoff with the United States, Syria is a valued partner. On the other hand, if Lebanon dissolves into civil war, Hezbollah could be destroyed, there would be heightened sectarian animosity against Iran and Shiites in the Middle East, and 25 years of Iranian exertion to create a pro-Iranian constituency in Lebanon would come to naught. Lebanon's Shiites are vulnerable. In Beirut proper, the community is caught between mainly Sunni and Christian neighborhoods. Hezbollah's stronghold in the capital's southern suburbs lies below mountains controlled by its adversaries. And Beirut can be easily cut off from Shiite strongholds in south Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley. War would be a calamity for all, but if one applies a hard logic, Shiites are likely to lose a great deal. Hezbollah has been considerably discredited outside the Shiite community\u2014a downward spiral that began last July when the party, without consulting anyone, provoked a war against Israel that brought about ferocious Israeli reprisals. Since then, Hezbollah and its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, have transgressed most of the \"red lines\" governing the delicate Lebanese sectarian compromise system. Nasrallah has even accused some of his opponents of collaborating with Israel against his party\u2014a charge difficult to step down from. Much in Lebanon will depend on whether the Saudis and Iranians can come to an arrangement that Syria accepts. Reports in the London-based Saudi daily Al-Hayat on Monday suggested that Bandar had traveled to Washington to meet with U.S. officials and ensure, as the paper put it, that Lebanon would be kept out of the Middle East's \"politics of axes.\" But Syria dreams of somehow reimposing its writ in Lebanon and will undermine any political settlement with which it is unhappy. For the moment, Iran will side with the Syrians. But it is now the Iranians, instead of the Syrians, negotiating Lebanon's fate. So if Hezbollah's, and the Shiites', future is put in doubt, it may become gradually more difficult for Syria and Iran to find common ground on Lebanese matters. It \"fell far short\" (Washington Post editorial) and offers only \"marginal\" gains (New York Times editorial) and is \"nonsense\" (Charles Krauthammer) and \"isn't much\" (Thomas Friedman). All these are descriptions of the energy policy proposal in George W. Bush's State of the Union address last week. They don't match the plan itself. Last week Bush proposed something environmentalists, energy analysts, greenhouse-effect researchers, and national-security experts have spent 20 years pleading for: a major strengthening of federal mileage standards for cars, SUVs, and pickup trucks. The No. 1 failing of U.S. energy policy is that vehicle mile-per-gallon standards have not been made stricter in two decades. Nothing the United States can do in energy policy is more important than an mpg increase. Presidents George Herbert Walker Bush, Bill Clinton, and, until last week, George W. Bush had all refused to face the issue of America's low-mpg vehicles, which are the root of U.S. dependency on Persian Gulf oil and a prime factor in rising U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions. But now Bush favors a radical strengthening of federal mileage rules, and last week to boot became the first Republican president since Gerald Ford to embrace the basic concept of federal mileage regulation (called the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard). This should have been Page One headline material\u2014PRESIDENT CALLS FOR DRAMATIC MPG REGULATIONS. Instead, most news organizations pretended Bush's mpg proposal did not exist, or buried the story inside the paper, or made only cryptic references to it. In his 2006 State of the Union address, when Bush said America was \"addicted to oil\" but proposed no mpg improvements, critics rightly pummeled the president. Now Bush has backed the needed reform, and the development is being downplayed or even ridiculed. What's going on? First, mainstream news organizations and pundits are bought and sold on a narrative of Bush as an environmental villain and simply refuse to acknowledge any evidence that contradicts the thesis. During his term the president has significantly strengthened the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution caused by diesel fuel and diesel engines, to reduce emissions from Midwestern power plants, to reduce pollution from construction equipment and railroad locomotives, and to reduce emissions of methane, which is 20 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. You'd never know these reforms even happened from the front page of the New York Times, which for reasons of ideology either significantly downplays or fails to report them. Second, with the war in Iraq appearing a fiasco of the first magnitude, editors and pundits feel Bush must be ridiculed on all scores\u2014even when he offers intelligent, progressive proposals. This is mendacious; it also backfires, since mocking everything the president says reduces the impact of objections specific to his foreign policy. Last Tuesday, Bush proposed that the CAFE standard grow 4 percent stricter per year. Essentially, this would mean that each new model year would need to get one mpg better gas mileage than cars from the year before. The last time the federal fuel-economy standard was strengthened was 1988. Nineteen years with zero progress on mpg is the leading reason U.S. petroleum consumption continues to rise. Bear in mind that since 1988, Republicans have doggedly opposed stricter fuel-economy rules, denouncing the CAFE system in venomous language as intruding on a supposed \"right\" to drive wasteful, large vehicles. (The Constitution says you have a right to read a newspaper and to own a gun; courts consistently rule that government may regulate vehicles on public roads for public purposes such as safety and energy efficiency.) Now, George W. Bush has embraced the system of mandatory federal mpg standards, asking they become much stricter. For this he's denounced! Does 4 percent improvement per year sound too modest? [According to the EPA](http://www.epa.gov/otaq/cert/mpg/fetrends/420s06003.htm#http://www.epa.gov/otaq/cert/mpg/fetren), average actual fuel consumption of new vehicles sold in the United States is 21 miles per gallon. (The figure on the sticker in the showroom is often higher, but it is calculated under unrealistic conditions\u2014no passengers or cargo in the car, air conditioner off, gentle acceleration, and no exceeding the speed limit.) Improve on 21 mpg by 4 percent annually for 10 years, and the number rises to 31 mpg. If the actual fuel economy of new vehicles were 31 mpg, oil-consumption trends would reverse\u2014from more oil use to less. In fact, the goal the president laid out in his State of the Union address sounds remarkably like a repetition of the first phase of federally mandated mpg increases. When the OPEC oil embargo took effect in 1974, there were no federal fuel-economy standards, and average actual consumption by new vehicles was 13 mpg. From 1975 to 1987, automakers were required to make continuous improvements in fuel economy. New-vehicle actual gasoline economy rose to a peak of 22 mpg in 1987. What else happened during that period? U.S. petroleum consumption declined from 18 million barrels per day when the CAFE rules were enacted to 15.2 million barrels per day in 1983. That decline broke the OPEC price cartel, and oil prices fell worldwide. Now U.S. oil consumption has risen back to 20 million barrels daily, and the pattern of consumption has shifted. In the 1970s, about half of oil use was for transportation, the other half for heating, industry, and electricity generation. Now three-quarters of oil use is for transportation: Petroleum demand for cars, trucks, trains, and planes has gone way up, while petroleum demand in other sectors has been flat or declined. The reason for rising petroleum demand for cars and trucks is that Americans today own twice as many cars and trucks as they did 30 years ago and drive them nearly three times as many miles. Yet since 1988, fuel economy standards have not toughened. The likely result of the White House proposal for tougher standards would be a replay of the first big mileage improvement\u2014U.S. petroleum demand would fall, reducing greenhouse gases and reducing the political influence of Persian Gulf dictatorships. How can the New York Times possibly think that would represent only a \"marginal\" improvement? While endorsing the first CAFE strengthening since the oil embargo, Bush also called for a law mandating a fivefold increase in U.S. ethanol production in the next decade and requiring refineries to blend more ethanol into gasoline. There's a lot to debate about ethanol\u2014its value can be questioned, but that's another article. Let's assume for the sake of argument that a big jump in ethanol production is a good idea. [In](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/) assuming this, we will join the New York Times editorial board and Thomas Friedman, both of whom lavishly praised last fall's Proposition 87, a California referendum mostly designed to boost ethanol production. Friedman said California would \"make history\" if it passed the proposition. [*](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#Correct) A Times editorial called this and other California green-energy proposals \"pathbreaking.\" For good or ill, California voters rejected Prop 87. But suppose it and other California mpg initiatives had gone into effect: Projections suggest petroleum consumption in California would over a period of years have declined about 25 percent. Suppose Bush's mpg and ethanol proposals go into effect: Projections suggest petroleum consumption in the United States will decline about 20 percent. How come a California plan to cut oil use 25 percent in one state is brilliant, while a White House plan to cut oil use 20 percent across the entire country is insignificant? It's true that last week Bush did not endorse any mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gases, and the time for such restrictions has come. Many who reacted negatively to the Bush plan were really saying they were upset that Bush did not offer a plan to reduce the odds of artificial global warming. Yet Bush did offer the most important oil-use reduction proposal since 1975, and reducing petroleum consumption will cut greenhouse-gas emissions somewhat. Bush's energy critics seem to say that because he did not give them everything they wanted, any major concession he did offer must be deplored. But stricter federal mpg rules would lead to far-reaching changes in American oil-consumption curves and American automobile culture. Give Bush some credit! Less than a week after botching its coverage of the mpg improvements Bush proposed, the New York Times banner-headlined a story saying Saudi Arabia now wants to keep petroleum prices relatively low at $50 a barrel. Have the oil sheiks decided they are making too much money? The sheiks don't want the United States taking real action to reduce our dependence on Persian Gulf oil, so they hope to lull Capitol Hill into thinking oil will stay cheap and mpg improvements won't be needed. The media may not have understood Bush's mileage proposal. The Saudi princes surely did.

In fact, the law proposed support for other alternative fuels.

Universities champion unbiased inquiry. Presidential libraries often include museums that exalt their honorees with selective versions of history. The two have never meshed well. Duke University, where Richard Nixon attended law school (and broke into the dean's office to see his grades), spurned efforts to build his library there. Ronald Reagan's people wanted to locate his repository-cum-shrine at Stanford University but got a chilly response. Plans to house the Kennedy Library at Harvard ran aground in the mid-1970s. Now, Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, the alma mater to Laura Welch Bush, is in an uproar over its bid to become the permanent home of the George W. Bush Presidential Library. Three times in three weeks the faculty has met to debate the subject. [According to the campus paper](http://media.www.smudailycampus.com/media/storage/paper949/news/2007/01/25/News/Faculty.Meeting.Focuses.On.Bush.Institute-2676999.shtml?sourcedomain=www.smudailycampus.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com), professors complained loudly, some not wishing to yoke the university's reputation to a president they considered shameful, others rejecting the plans to host a Bush Foundation-run institute that would fund pro-Bush research. But the university president, R. Gerald Turner, has remained unbowed. Whatever individual professors may think of Bush, he and his supporters say, any archives of presidential documents would be a boon for SMU. So, who's right? The story begins last fall, when it became clear that Bush's people wanted SMU to house his presidential papers. The other colleges in contention were the University of Dallas, but that was too low profile, and Baylor University, but that was in Waco. As a Bush ally told the press, \"You can't ask people in Dallas for $20 million until they can be sure the library won't be in Waco.\" (For some reason, Bush doesn't seem to have considered his own alma maters, Harvard and Yale.) As SMU emerged as the front-runner, two theology professors, Bill McElvaney and Susanne Johnson, protested in [the campus paper](http://media.www.smudailycampus.com/media/storage/paper949/news/2006/11/10/Opinion/The-George.W.Bush.Library.Asset.Or.Albatross-2452428.shtml?sourcedomain=www.smudailycampus.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com) on Nov. 10. They wanted the administration to include the whole university community in the discussions. They also argued that Bush's most objectionable policies\u2014the violations of international law, the premeditated preventive war and his acts of \"misleading the American public\"\u2014raised \"deep ethical issues\" about hosting his library, and the attendant temple to him that was sure to follow. These arguments gained support from many colleagues. But they didn't derail Turner. On Nov. 27, the New York Daily News reported that SMU would be the home for the library and that Bush's people planned to raise $500 million for it, from \"wealthy heiresses, Arab nations and captains of industry.\" Notably, the plans also included a policy institute, answerable only to the Bush Foundation, that would, as a Bush ally told the Daily News, retain conservatives and \"give them money to write papers and books favorable to the president's policies.\" Besides the benefit of having an important historical collection on campus, Turner and others in SMU's leadership expect the library would lure visitors, publicity, and dollars. Some supporters also note that political passions fade over time, turning today's \"principled\" stands into tomorrow's \"politicized\" decisions. [One SMU political science professor](http://www.smu.edu/politicalscience/faculty.asp#hollifield) writing in the New York Times last weekend recalled his days as a graduate student at Duke when it refused the Nixon papers, denying the university a rich collection that would have been a magnet for historians. On this much Turner is right: SMU should embrace the chance to host the Bush archives. The decision would entail no endorsement of his agenda, and the university could insist on some control over the museum display to ensure historical accuracy\u2014as the incoming director of the Nixon Library, Tim Naftali, [hopes to finally do](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#2158701) at an institution long known for its [twisting of history](http://www.slate.com/id/2134766/). On the other hand, the SMU faculty are right to reject the proposed think tank. In its original article, the Daily News also said that the proposed institute would mimic Stanford's Hoover Institution\u2014a dubious precedent. A right-wing think tank, Hoover (also named for a former president) has a schizophrenic personality: It plays home to many eminent scholars of on the right (and some liberals) and produces much sound scholarship. But it also provides a nominal perch for former right-wing politicians and operatives utterly lacking in scholarly distinction, such as Spencer Abraham, Newt Gingrich, and Ed Meese\u2014not to mention outright propagandists and ideologues such as [Dinesh D'Souza](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/12/AR2007011200082.html) and Tod Lindberg. When Hugh Hewitt, the original director of the Nixon Library, said he would screen and bar insufficiently pro-Nixon researchers, he was countermanded and sacked. The SMU administration, in contrast, has yet to condemn the vision of the Bush institute expressed in the Daily News. Insisting the deal is \"all or nothing,\" Turner has told professors they needn't worry. He says that because the institute would answer only to the Bush Foundation, its projects won't reflect on the university itself. And perhaps the Hoover Institution's employment of a few partisans hasn't hurt Stanford's reputation\u2014though it surely hasn't helped it, either. Many critics of the Bush project, including Susanne Johnson, have [offered to compromise](http://media.www.smudailycampus.com/media/storage/paper949/news/2007/01/23/Opinion/Can-We.Change.The.Topic.Of.Conversation.Please-2668371.shtml?sourcedomain=www.smudailycampus.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com), accepting the library but [drawing the line at the proposed think tank](http://media.www.smudailycampus.com/media/storage/paper949/news/2007/01/19/Opinion/Focusing.The.Discussion.On.The.Bush.Institute.Not.The.Library-2654527.shtml?sourcedomain=www.smudailycampus.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com). This is the wisest course. A university, committed to disinterested scholarship as a first principle, can't in good conscience support a center devoted to what is avowedly political propaganda. And propaganda is the issue. A measure of spin at presidential libraries is one thing, to be grudgingly tolerated. The deliberate politicization of expert authority is another. And such manipulation has been the Bush administration's hallmark. From the counting of the vote in the 2000 election to the selection of intelligence before invading Iraq; from denying scientific support for global warming to supporting creationism in public schools; from rejecting the opinions of medical experts in the Terri Schiavo case to rejecting the opinion of legal experts in the judicial-selection process; even in its labeling of mainstream news sources as partisan\u2014consistently, Bush has, like the most facile Postmodernists, denigrated the expertise of long-standing authorities, deeming their claims to authority mere masks for a political agenda. Every indication suggests that the Bush people view historians the same way. SMU faculty members are pessimistic about stopping the institute. But they may have recourse. As the New York Times reported recently, no-confidence votes have been toppling presidents at a range of colleges, from Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., to Case Western Reserve in Cleveland to Baylor. Perhaps SMU's board of trustees will see the folly in erecting a propaganda mill on campus. Then again, the [board of trustees' most famous member](http://www.smu.edu/trustees/) is also its most politically prominent alumna.

The Nixon Library, which ended up in Yorba Linda, Calif., as a purely private institution, became infamous for its distortions. Now, however, that library is finally slated to become part of the National Archives and to take possession of Nixon's presidential papers (which have remained at the National Archives in College Park, Maryland, outside Washington, D.C.).

[Catching](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/) up on homework: Well, we finally got around to slipping The Last King of Scotland into the DVD player. For some reason it took a while to bring ourselves to watch the bloody mayhem that must be a part of any movie about Idi Amin\u2014and part of many films angling for Oscar. At the beginning, there was the inevitable \"inspired by true events\" claim that is also mandatory for many movies angling for Oscar. After that unfolds a preposterous tale\u2014and there are major spoilers to come\u2014that left us wondering, exactly which true events inspired this? [At ](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/)a glance, the only facts in the film are that there was a deranged dictator named Idi Amin in a place called Uganda and, at one time, a hijacked Air France airliner landed there. [*](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#Correction) The movie, based on an acclaimed novel by Giles Foden, tells the tale of a young Scottish doctor who finds himself a favorite of Idi Amin. The doctor can be rather plucky with Amin but generally ignores the growing evidence of the hideous truth. He busies himself with knocking up one of Amin's wives and then getting her an abortion. Unfortunately the boss is wise to him and has him hung by hooks thrust into his flesh. Far more fortunately, this hanging takes place at the airport at the exact moment when some Entebbe hostages are being released. A noble colleague sacrifices himself to free the bloodied doctor, who slinks off with the Entebbe hostages. His doomed savior admonishes him to tell the world of the outrages perpetrated in Uganda. This series of astonishing events made us curious about the truth upon which the story was based. It was late, so we were left with Wikipedia. (In the Internet age, truth is easy to come by\u2014right?) We found that the character of the young doctor was loosely based on a fellow named Bob Astles, who was neither Scottish nor a doctor. Twice married, he was an English adventurer who worked for Amin while running a pineapple farm as well as an aviation service. He later said, \"I kept my eyes shut, I said nothing about what I saw, which is what they liked.\" Astles eventually became the head of Amin's anti-corruption squad. \"Until today, what Astles did or did not do during Amin's brutal tenure is conjecture,\" the Wikipedia article concludes. \"He was feared, and considered by many to be a malign influence on the dictator; others thought he was a moderating presence.\" It's imperative for novelists to invent, of course, but why does the film industry have a compulsion to palm off stories based on \"true\" events that are not just miles but light-years from the truth? Not that many people will see The Last King of Scotland\u2014although more than might be expected, thanks to Forest Whitaker's almost assured best actor award. And how many of them will walk away thinking they've seen something that is more true than not? The bottom line is that Hollywood has little respect for the truth. When he was making JFK, Oliver Stone became enraged when George Lardner, a Washington Post reporter who had covered the assassination of John Kennedy, got hold of a script and denounced the story as preposterous. It wasn't fair, Stone said, to judge an unfinished movie by a screenplay. Pressed about whether the misrepresentations in the screenplay wouldn't also be in the film, Stone said the movie would represent an \"essential truth,\" and that adherence to actual fact was less important. And there you have the Hollywood attitude\u2014the movie version is the one that counts. The only time we can remember that this approach was stuffed up the industry's nose was when the 1999 film The Hurricane was attacked for misrepresenting facts about boxer Rubin Carter. That episode did not teach the industry caution. Instead, a lot of time and expense is devoted to re-creating the look and feel of a period with no regard to what actually occurred. Many will defend the Hollywood way as an exercise of the artist's prerogative. And obviously there are many immortal stories told in historical settings. But it would have been peculiar if Thackeray suggested that Vanity Fair was \"inspired by true events\" because his characters were caught up in the Napoleonic Wars. And, if you are dealing with something as momentous as the assassination of a president, you might want to stick to facts that were dramatic enough. If you have a strong story\u2014a fiction about a young doctor and an African dictator\u2014why not just embrace it for what it is and lose the tenuous \"true story\" claim? Diddling with history, as we've seen, can be a dangerous business.

The academy is searching its soul. Last night, the academy decided that Brad Grey cannot accept an Oscar should The Departed win in the best picture category. The academy also decided that only three of five producers will be permitted to accept the award for Little Miss Sunshine should it win. The academy giveth, the academy taketh away. The academy has said it will let the Producers Guild decide the issue of who deserves a \"produced by\" credit for award purposes. The guild attempts to vet the question thoroughly. It decided that Grey didn't deserve the \"produced by\" credit for The Departed. But it also named five producers for Little Miss Sunshine. Here's where the academy parted ways with the guild. The academy has held that no more than three people should go on stage to receive the best picture award. So it booted two of the five Sunshine producers. It's a tough break for Ron Yerxa and Albert Berger, who first shopped the script around Hollywood, recruited the directors, and who, most importantly, were sufficiently involved throughout to get the \"produced by\" credit from the guild. The arbitrariness of this decision is apparent even to the academy, and we now hear that the group will re-evaluate its rules and consider whether it should just stick with the guild decisions on who gets to accept the best picture award in the future. It may be too late for Yerxa and Berger. But their picture did set a Sundance record when it sold for $10.5 million. It has silenced those who mocked Fox Searchlight for overpaying, as the film has grossed almost $100 million worldwide with more to come (pretty good margins for a movie that cost about $8 million). But no producer wants to be the one who was treated so unfairly that the academy had to reconsider its rules. 5:15 P.M. ( [link](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#Scoops)) [Here's ](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/)a [scoop](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/): Sources tell us that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has decided not to recognize Paramount chief Brad Grey as a producer on The Departed. Recall that Grey had helped to put the movie together as a manager/producer before he assumed his current role. The Producers Guild had denied him a \"produced by\" credit, a decision that he appealed unsuccessfully. The academy generally follows the guild's lead on this issue, but Grey nonetheless appealed. Now, that appeal has apparently been denied, meaning that should The Departed win on Oscar night, Grey will have to content himself with a quick hug in the aisle. Since the film was released by Warner, and Paramount has Babel in contention, some in the industry feel that's the appropriate result. 2:07 P.M. ( [link](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#Scoop/)) Thursday, Jan. 25, 2007 Men in Black: Creative Artists Agency has just moved into its formidable new digs (our friends at Defamer have already [noted the terror that struck](http://defamer.com/hollywood/agents/caas-century-city-invasion-so-it-begins-229176.php) a Century City denizen who observed an incursion of agents into a shopping-mall food court). The new location presumably will be quite comfortable once they get the air-conditioning trouble straightened out. Meanwhile, CAA's rivals can content themselves with the image of CAA agents, for once, sweating. But what of CAA's old home at the intersection of Santa Monica and Wilshire Boulevards? The gleaming I.M. Pei-designed monument to CAA co-founder Michael Ovitz's lofty dream? It seems just yesterday that ground was broken there with a feng shui ceremony and a flight of white birds. Well, the feng shui seems to have worked well for the agency, which dominates the industry. But it didn't do much for the chi between the former CAA partners who own the now-empty building. Last May, the Los Angeles Times speculated that after CAA departed, the building would become \"the most expensive Beverly Hills office space in memory.\" A tenant would ante up about $6 million a year\u2014or a pricey $5 a square foot\u2014for this influential address. But no one has stepped up. The building is owned by Ovitz and erstwhile partners Ron Meyer (the head of Universal Studios), producer Bill Haber, and former CAA Chief Financial Officer Robert Goldman. CAA has rented the building from them since 1995 and\u2014according to at least one source with firsthand knowledge of the situation\u2014is still paying rent. And the building\u2014with its giant, custom-made Roy Lichtenstein painting still in the lobby\u2014is standing vacant. More than a year ago, the owners hired the Cushman & Wakefield brokerage firm to lease the building. But then, nothing happened. \"It's the weirdest thing,\" says veteran Beverly Hills real estate agent Gary Weiss. \"All of us don't understand it.\" Maybe it's not so weird after all. The building has a curving facade, and the space inside is idiosyncratic and difficult to reconfigure. With its soaring atrium, a tenant would be paying a lot for space that can't be put to use. When Ovitz was working on the plans, Weiss says, \"I don't think they paid much attention to whether it was efficient or not.\" Then there's the question of what to do with the Lichtenstein. The canvas is gigantic\u2014the artist worked on it in situ\u2014so it's not something that could hang in one's living room or even in an ordinary office lobby. It would be a problem, in fact, to get it out of the building. Sotheby's has apparently advised that it can't be removed from its stretcher without damaging it. \"You tell me how you move that,\" says a longtime CAA partner. The former CAA partners who own the building (and the painting) put Ovitz in charge of it back in the late 1980s, when it was conceived, and that's the way it is today. Meyer has since said that at the time, he was like an abused spouse in a trance. He could hardly have imagined the acrimony that would follow when the marriage split up, as it did in 1995. (When Meyer landed the job at Universal\u2014a position that Ovitz had sought for himself\u2014Ovitz's incredulous response at learning that Meyer had gotten the offer was enough to sour the relationship. Matters didn't improve when Ovitz later tried to purchase land in Malibu that Meyer had picked out for his dream house.) Now Meyer must wait for Ovitz to rent, sell, buy\u2014do something with the building. One CAA agent said he'd heard a rumor that Ovitz may want to turn the space into a museum. Through a spokesman, Ovitz dismissed that idea. Certainly Ovitz has a big, expensive collection of modern art (not to mention an ego that could use a new monument, following his ill-fated tenure at Disney and the failure of his management company). And Lichtenstein is already there. Ovitz didn't respond to queries about what he intends to do with the building.

By now, you know that Dreamgirls pulled in the most nominations\u2014eight\u2014but was snubbed for best picture and best director. It is fascinating to imagine how this news is being received at Paramount headquarters, where Babel (from the studio's Vantage label) got seven nominations, including the big ones. All has turned out well for studio chief Brad Grey. He got to issue a press release proclaiming that his studio led with 19 nominations, knowing that his friends at his DreamWorks \"label\" were left to lick their gaping wounds. Yes, this was a bad day for DreamWorks (though not for composer Henry Krieger, who appears to be the single most nominated individual, with three best song nods for Dreamgirls). Clint Eastwood, having been snubbed by the Directors Guild, the Writers Guild, the Producers Guild, and the Screen Actors Guild, had to be at least a little surprised to be running another victory lap with his best director nod for Letters From Iwo Jima. \"When it comes to the Academy, never overlook an old guy who can do it and do it well,\" chortled one voting member. The academy showed a healthy respect for diversity. African or African-American actors got five of 20 nominations (Forest Whitaker, Eddie Murphy, Will Smith, Jennifer Hudson, and Djimon Hounsou). And the academy recognized all three of the three amigos\u2014Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu for Babel, Guillermo del Toro (for best foreign-language nominee Pan's Labyrinth), and Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n for writing and editing Children of Men. As the dust settles, little light has been shed on the eventual best picture winner. Some think that since only Babel and The Departed were nominated in the influential editing category, the race comes down to those two. Others point out that a contingent of academy voters hates Babel and dreads nothing more than seeing it become this year's Crash. Another group seems inclined to go only so far for Scorsese\u2014and especially for this movie, which seems to have a number of endings. So, if you need help with this year's office pool, don't call us. There are a lot of factions out there\u2014making for mathematical possibilities too weird to contemplate.

When performing the song in public, Thompson, 57, has used a cheat sheet to head off senior moments (scroll down to see it).

A U.N. [scientific report](http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM2feb07.pdf) says the best-case scenario for global warming is already catastrophic. [Calculations](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/02/science/earth/02cnd-climate.html): 1) By 2100, at projected gas-production rates, temperatures will rise 3.5 to 8 degrees, with a significant chance of an even greater increase. 2) Sea level will rise 7 to 23 inches and will keep rising for 1,000 years, with historical evidence that levels could end up 20 feet higher than today. 3) Arid, subtropical countries will lose another 20 percent of their rainfall, exacerbating drought. 4) All of this is happening because of industry. Idealistic view: Finally, we see the threat and are mobilizing to save our planet. Cynical view: Last one out, turn off the air conditioner.

A Canadian report [says](http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070201/wl_afp/canadachinahealth_070131211257) the Chinese army is using Falun Gong prisoners to supply organs for medical tourists. The report is based on interviews with organ recipients and the hospital staff who attended them. Phone calls to Chinese officials confirmed the pattern. One Falun Gong adherent says his comrades at a labor camp \"were systematically subjected to blood tests to match their organs with recipients.\" Another woman says her ex-husband, a surgeon, admitted taking corneas from 2,000 living Falun Gong prisoners. Theory: Hospitals need income to make up for government funding cuts; organs supply the income; and army doctors are able to conduct the transactions in secrecy. (For previous updates on organs from Chinese prisoners, click [here](http://www.slate.com/id/2154137/), [here](http://www.slate.com/id/2140137/), and [here](http://www.slate.com/id/2150326/).) A New Jersey school board banned surreptitious tape-recording in classrooms after a teacher was caught telling non-Christian kids they belonged in hell. The teacher also said that evolution wasn't scientific and that Noah's ark carried dinosaurs. A student says he recorded some of the comments because he feared nobody would believe the teacher had made them. Classmates later objected that their voices were on the recordings and were being broadcast without their consent. Board's [responses](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/nyregion/01tape.html): 1) Unspecified \"corrective action\" against the teacher. 2) Training all teachers in separation of church from state. 2) No recording in classrooms without the teacher's consent.

A study suggests excess weight in football players is filtering down to high schools. [Nearly half](http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/297/4/363) of Iowa high school linemen are overweight, and nine percent are severely obese, according to a sample of 3,600 players. [Theory](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070124/ap_on_he_me/diet_prep_football_5): 1) 300 pounds of weight is advantageous in pro football (a recent study found that most NFL players are technically obese), so 2) college teams cultivate heavy players, so 3) high-school kids put on weight to emulate their idols and win scholarships, so 4) other high-school kids have to put on weight just to keep up. Skeptical view: Obesity is defined by your ratio of weight to height, and in football players, a lot of that weight is muscle, not fat.

Trans fat update: 1) Los Angeles [dropped efforts to ban trans fats](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-fat27jan27,1,2348812.story) after concluding that only the California state government has such authority. 2) Instead, the city cut a deal with local restaurants to eliminate trans fats in 18 months. The deal is [voluntary](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-transfat31jan31,0,6718055.story) and applies only to members of the California Restaurant Association, a minority of local restaurants. 3) More than 1,200 [McDonald's](http://today.reuters.com/news/articleinvesting.aspx?type=companyNews&storyid=233808+29-Jan-2007+RTRS) franchises have switched to trans-fat-free frying oil. 4) Research suggests that the most common replacement for trans fats\u2014\"interesterified fats\"\u2014may be [just as unhealthy](http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=healthNews&storyID=2007-01-24T172701Z_01_COL459548_RTRUKOC_0_US-TRANS-FAT.xml).

His owners said he was in [too much pain](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/sports/othersports/30barbaro.html) after setbacks following his severe leg fracture last year. [Romantic spins](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/29/AR2007012900612.html): 1) He fought bravely for months after his injury, when other horses would have given up. 2) His owners and other horse lovers fought gallantly to save his life, donating millions to animal medicine. 3) In his honor, let's carry on the fight to ban horse slaughter and fund health care for horses. [Surgeon's view](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/29/AR2007012900612_2.html): \"The opportunities afforded that horse were as heroic and modern as any human athlete would be afforded.\" Alternative view: Now, about health care for humans ...

With court approval, Israeli parents are using their dead son's sperm to inseminate a woman he never knew. It appears to be the first explicit legal authorization to make a baby using a corpse and a stranger. Argument from the dead man's mother: \"He would always talk about how he wanted to get married and have children.\" After he died, \"His eyes he told me that it wasn't too late, and that there was still something to take from him. ...

Nuclear power is making a comeback because global warming looks worse. 1) Hans Blix, the guy who led the U.N. inspections of Iraq's nuclear weapons program, says we should promote the spread of nuclear power, which emits no greenhouse gases, because \" [global warming [is] a greater threat than weapons of mass destruction](http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070125/sc_afp/egyptnucleariranunblix_070125175332).\" 2) The Tennessee Valley Authority is proposing the first two new U.S. reactors since the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. Some 30 reactors are being planned nationwide, because \"concerns about global warming have [changed attitudes](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/28/AR2007012801047.html) about nuclear energy.\" 3) Fear of global warming is prodding [France and Germany](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/weekinreview/28land.html) toward nuclear power. Extra argument for nuclear: If we depend on oil, terrorists can halt our energy supply. Rebuttal: If you depend on nuclear, terrorists can blow up your reactor.

She gave her story exclusively to News of the World. [Highlights](http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/story_pages/news/news1.shtml): 1) She pretended to be within the clinic's age cutoff, 55, and says \"they didn't ask for my age.\" 2) She bought eggs and sperm by choosing \"from photos in a catalogue. It was a bit like studying an estate agent's brochure and choosing a house.\" 3) She went through menopause 18 years ago. 4) She was \"inspired by magazine stories of older women giving birth.\" 5) The pregnancy put such stress on her aging body that doctors barely kept it going long enough to deliver her twins seven weeks prematurely, at 3-and-a-half pounds each. 6) She says, \"When they begin toddling I'll [get one of those playpens](http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/oldmum2.shtml) and put them there.\" retort: Don't \"shouldn't.\" (For previous updates on aging women getting IVF, click [here](http://www.slate.com/id/2156766/) and [here](http://www.slate.com/id/2141239/).)

Season 6 of American Idol began on a triumphalist note, with a montage of past winners and images of a nation gone Idol-mad. \"Together, we've created a phenomenon,\" said Ryan Seacrest, trying hard to sound stentorian, like the voiceover guy from NFL Films. \"You caught McPheever, and turned [Katharine](http://www.katharinemcphee.com/site/) into America's Sweetheart,\" he intoned. Did we really? I'm not so sure. Still, as the new season kicks off, Idol's pop-culture preeminence is undeniable, as is its music-biz clout. (Among the astonishing statistics reeled off by Seacrest is the fact that Idol contestants have produced \"over 100 No. 1 CDs.\") The industry held its nose for the first couple of seasons, but now superstars vie to appear as guests on the show, and last year's finale, with performances by Prince and Mary J. Blige among others, felt like as much of an event as the Grammys. This year, producers are promising more A-list Macca?](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16563051/)\u2014and [big at Idol](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200611/american-idol), the show's track record of anointing worthy new talent is very solid indeed. Exhibit A in 2006 was Season 4 winner Carrie Underwood, whose debut, Some Hearts, was [an excellent country-pop record](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T56vLzS5i5w), not to mention the year's best-selling CD by a solo artist. Did I mention that an American Idol runner-up is [about to win an Oscar](http://www.popmatters.com/images/news_art/d/dreamgirls-hudson-4-mc.jpg)? None of which has much to do with Red. Red is the nearly toothless, flame-haired giant who croaked a pitiful version of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" on last night's broadcast, a two-hour-long compendium of clips from Idol's Seattle auditions. (Tuesday's show focused on the Minneapolis tryouts.) Red was mesmerizing\u2014in a creepy, [hillbilly Charles Manson kind of way](http://www.americanidol.com/photos/view/?set=112&seq=57)\u2014but in general I find the audition phase boring. Six years in, the formula is familiar: a parade of the freakish, the tone-deaf, and the delusional, interrupted, roughly every half-hour, by a talented singer who gets a ticket to Hollywood. Occasionally, the bad singers are funny and revealing. On Tuesday night, a lesson in the larynx-shredding aesthetics of post-grunge vocal style was supplied by a pimply young \"rocker,\" whom Simon sent off to learn an Abba song. I laughed at (with?) the [big girl](http://www.americanidol.com/photos/view/?set=112&seq=26) who mumbled her way through the Pussycat Dolls' \"Don't Cha\"\u2014and was excited beyond reason to learn that she'd co-authored an Idol-inspired \"novella\" with her mother. (Hello, publishing world? Where's Judith Regan when you need her?) Overall, though, the freak show preliminaries are tiresome, and I find myself itching for the beginning of the competition proper. It's the post-William Hung effect: For every genuine would-be superstar, there's a would-be \u00fcber-geek anti-star. Watching the first two episodes, you couldn't help but suspect that most of the \"bad\" singers were actually savvy performance artists, angling for a few minutes of airtime. Thus the [Jewel super-fan](http://www.americanidol.com/photos/view/?set=111&seq=55) (quite possibly the last one on earth), who sang a wounded water buffalo version of \"You Were Meant for Me\" to a panel that included guest judge [Jewel herself](http://991.com/newgallery/Jewel-You-Were-Meant-Fo-101975.jpg); the [dude dressed up as Uncle Sam](http://www.americanidol.com/photos/view/?set=112&seq=0); [the fellow in the Apollo Creed outfit](http://www.americanidol.com/photos/view/?set=111&seq=37); the \" [cowboy](http://www.americanidol.com/photos/view/?set=111&seq=46)\" who mauled \"Folsom Prison Blues\"; the tiny Justin Timberlake wannabe, whom Simon cruelly (but accurately) likened to \"one of those creatures that live in the woods with those massive eyes\"; the \" [urban Amish](http://www.americanidol.com/photos/view/?set=111&seq=17)\" guy; [the juggler](http://www.americanidol.com/photos/view/?set=111&seq=10); [the girl with the pink arms](http://www.americanidol.com/photos/view/?set=112&seq=29); etc. These acts mostly ring false, and when they don't, Idol veers into the icky, exploitative territory of lesser reality shows. (Last night, the program lingered for several uncomfortable minutes on a [fat kid](http://www.americanidol.com/photos/view/?set=112&seq=44) who was clearly developmentally disabled.) Really, how many more bug-eyed Simon Cowell reaction shots can we see before the joke ceases to be funny? On the other hand, I am enjoying the leitmotif of rejected contestants trying to exit through the wrong, locked door\u2014a priceless bit of old-school slapstick punctuated, each time, by Simon's drawling, \"Other door, sweetheart.\" One of the big questions heading into Season 6 is: Will Idol get with 21st-century innovations in pop repertoire and vocal style? Back in Season 2, I wrote an article complaining about Idol's domination by Mariah Carey wannabes, and the overuse of flamboyant Careyesque melisma in pop and R&B singing generally. What I didn't take into account was the groundbreaking new singing style\u2014speedy and tensile, weirdly syncopated, clearly influenced by rap\u2014that was being pioneered right then by [R. Kelly](http://youtube.com/watch?v=xUzGovNBycQ), [Usher](http://youtube.com/watch?v=zFVDH4iAKKY), and, especially, [Beyonc\u00e9](http://youtube.com/watch?v=90oCoLrueoU). In the years since, Idol has seen its share of country and rock singers, and even some old-fashioned crooners. But circa-1992 Mariah- and Whitney-style belting remains the most prevalent\u2014this despite the fact that [Carey herself has moved on to channeling Beyonc\u00e9](http://youtube.com/watch?v=KBrZFt2xx4w). Will Season 6 bring a post-hip-hop R&B vocalist, a singer representing the definitive contemporary style? When is someone going to step forward, braving the wrath of Cowell, to do a version of \" [Ignition (Remix)](http://youtube.com/watch?v=o0k_REE9S0E)\" or \" [Ring the Alarm](http://youtube.com/watch?v=gNtGzS-0kYA)\"? We'll keep an eye on that and other intriguing musical and sociological questions in this space, in addition to the more pressing issues\u2014 [Paula Abdul](http://youtube.com/watch?v=S1BSHw6FjlY)'s fragile emotional state (she's been disappointingly sane and sober thus far), the smoldering sexual tension between Simon and Ryan, Randy Jackson's gratuitous mentions of his own session work with Journey and Mariah Carey. (The tally so far: 1.) In the meantime, my early votes go to the absolutely adorable Malakar siblings, [Shyamali](http://www.americanidol.com/photos/view/?set=112&seq=32) and [Sanjaya](http://www.americanidol.com/photos/view/?set=112&seq=33) (who killed his audition); to 16-year-old [Denise Jackson](http://www.realitytvmagazine.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/denise_jackson_1.jpg), who, we were informed in a heart-jerking interlude, was a \"crack baby\"; and to the extravagantly moussed beatboxer [Blake Lewis](http://www.americanidol.com/photos/view/?set=112&seq=39), who, despite his hair, came across as genuinely charismatic and talented. (You can sample his vocal stylings on [his MySpace page](http://myspace.com/blakelewis).) Then there's the developing singers-in-arms subplot, with two members of the military already advancing to the next round. [Rachel Jenkins](http://www.realitytvmagazine.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/rachel_jenkins.jpg), an Army reservist from Minnetonka, Minn., whose husband is currently in Baghdad, might be the stronger vocalist of the two. But the smart early money is on [Jarrod Walker](http://www.realitytvmagazine.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/jarrod_fowler.jpg), a Naval intelligence specialist with a pleasant Andy Griffith air about him, who won the USS Ronald Reagan's \"Reagan Idol\" competition, and sailed through to Hollywood, singing the Rascal Flatts weepie, \"Bless the Broken Road.\" Might Americans purge their guilt about souring on the Iraq war by \"supporting the troops\" in the Idol competition? Until next week: other door, sweetheart. For Episode 3 on Tuesday night, American Idol traveled to Memphis\u2014back to the loamy Southern soil that has produced all of its winners. Through five seasons, region has proved the most significant Idol metric, far more than race, gender, genre, or anything else. There have been three white and two black Idols, three females and two males. Winners have included a straightforward pop singer (Kelly Clarkson), an R&B smoothie (Ruben Studdard), a soul belter a country balladeer (Carrie Underwood), and a cuddly Adult Album Alternative type with a delusional Otis Redding complex (Taylor Hicks). But they've all been from Dixie\u2014Carrie Underwood, from Checotah, Okla., is the closest we've seen to a Northerner. Most of the major runners-up (Clay Aiken, Bo Bice, Chris Daughtry) are also from the South. For those who like to [draw](http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/ethicalperspectives/sing.html) [comparisons](http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1783339,00.html) between Idol and presidential politics, the regional question is compelling. Will Season 6 finally give us a champion from someplace north of the Mason-Dixon? If not, should the Dems think twice before nominating a Yankee like Hillary or Obama? Tuesday's show\u2014shortened to an hour because of the live broadcast of a [plaintive solo acoustic set](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/01/20030128-19.html) by 2000 Idol winner G.W. Bush\u2014was a tad less shrill and \"freak\"-heavy than last week's Minneapolis and Seattle episodes. Did Idol producers re-edit the broadcast, in response to a week's worth of [criticism about the show's \"meanness\"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/20/AR2007012001781.html)? (Lord help us if Rosie O'Donnell has such power.) The closest the Memphis episode came to the freak show was the usual [rejectee singalong montage](http://youtube.com/watch?v=QZXQqcEq7KQ). (Predictably, they chose an Elvis song, \"Burning Love.\") Then there was the totally endearing [Sean Michel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSoqDsWZkXU), with very long hair and a stretching Old Testament beard, who (not unreasonably) compared his own look to Osama Bin Laden and Fidel Castro. The judges were clearly taken aback, but his rugged performance of Johnny Cash's \"God's Gonna Cut You Down\" made them believers. Paula: \"That was kind of shocking. I didn't expect to hear that.\" Simon: \"We expected something about a revolution.\" Randy: \"It don't matter what you look like, you can blow! Welcome to Hollywood, baby!\" Here's hoping that Michel makes it through to the final 12, if only to see how the Idol stylists handle his makeover. Memphis also gave us the two best singers thus far. First, there was the roly-poly fellow with the preposterous name of Sundance Head, whose father, Roy Head, had a No. 1 hit in 1965, \" [Treat Her Right](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ga4mM01SeE).\" In the pre-audition interview, Head fils claimed he was a better singer than his father, and sure enough, he [peeled back the judges' ears](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJoqpQVsqw0) with a roaring \"Stormy out Wonder's \"For Once in My Life.\" Doolittle is a professional background singer, and boy, can you tell: In terms of tone, timbre, and control, she has the best instrument of any Idol contestant I've heard, in any season. Mark my words: She'll make it all the way to the final three. At least. No one nearly as great emerged from the New York auditions, but there were some cuties. Simon nearly dissolved into a puddle of drool [during the audition of best friends Amanda Coluccio and Antonella Barba](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZDTQYNO-zI). (A leering, totally gratuitous B-roll montage showed the pair romping on the beach in bikinis.) Paula was treated to her own hunk of cheesecake in the form of 16-year-old [Jenry Bejarano](http://www.realitytvmagazine.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/jenry_bejarano.jpg), who will almost certainly be co-starring with Tyson Beckford in a boxer-briefs advertisement within months. On the other end of the charisma spectrum was the sepulchral guest judge, songwriter Carole Bayer Sager, who brought the show to a screeching halt every time she spoke. At this point, isn't Idol bigger than B-listers like Sager? Can't [Simon Fuller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Fuller) put in a call to [Max Martin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Martin) or something? Oh yeah, some people cried. Check that: Nearly everybody cried. This isn't anything new\u2014from the get-go, Idol has aimed for catharsis, prying open tear ducts with some of the most lethal weapons known to man: the soft-focus up-close-and-personal segment and Whitney Houston's and the preponderance of slow-boiling self-actualization anthems, virtually guarantees many weepy money shots, and sometimes these are quite affecting. Who can forget Fantasia Barrino's glorious diva moment in the Idol 3 finale, [belting out \"I Believe\" through streaming tears](http://youtube.com/watch?v=DercnakDhp0)? But this season has upped the emotional pornography quotient; the show is veritably awash in tears. Tears of triumph, tears of defeat, tears of frustration. Mom's tears, Dad's tears, Little Sister's tears. In New York, Sarah Burgess cried before, during, and after her audition about her father's lack of support for her singing aspirations. (Father and daughter reconciled, in a tearful phone call.) Kia Thornton wept after getting sent through for a fine performance of Aretha's \"Ain't No Way.\" When the judges rejected tone-deaf [Sarah Goldberg](http://youtube.com/watch?v=Udj_0Qh6FOc), she flew into a tearful tirade. Then there was [Nakia Claiborne](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbEU4wExQU), who went from manically jovial to heartbroken in a span of a couple of minutes, proving that there is nothing sadder than the tears of a clown. I nearly shed a tear myself when she emerged, dejected, from the audition room. \"They said no,\" she sobbed. \"And sometimes you get tired of hearing no.\" In truth, the raw emotions are understandable, given the intensely personal and expressive nature of singing itself. This is the heart of American Idol: Yes, it's a big, schlock-drenched, hyper-commercialized, exploitative spectacle. But the show is really about one of the most primal and moving human activities\u2014the act of expelling air from your diaphragm and shaping it into music with your vocal cords\u2014and this gives Idol a purity and grandeur that you just don't find on, say, The Bachelor or Celebrity Fit Club. There's often little difference between singing and crying in the first place\u2014little wonder the tears flow. Still, there are healthier ways to deal with an Idol rejection than bawling. Simon was right to call [Ian Benardo](http://youtube.com/watch?v=gGy4dGNb2UM), who did a kind of Arnold Horshack rendition Laura Branigan's \"Gloria,\" \"annoying ... Mr. Boring.\" But Benardo got laugh. \"Hollywood is not even that great,\" Benardo said, marching off in a huff. \"Hollywood is New Jersey with celebrities.\" There are approximately 142 hours between the end of one week's American Idol broadcasts and the beginning of the next\u2014a slow, grim plod, brightened only by the radiant memory of [Ryan Seacrest's latest sport-coat-and-T-shirt ensemble](http://media.marketwire.com/attachments/200603/TN-248494_Ryan_Headshot_RT.jpg). Sunday brunch rolls around, you realize that there are still two-plus days to go, and your soul is engulfed by melancholy. All is blackness, all is waste. Or is this just me? In any event, the mood of those long empty Idolless days and nights is perfectly captured by \"It's Not Over,\" the hit single by last season's third runner-up, Chris Daughtry. \" [It's Not Over](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56LbkqHheOM)\" is inescapable these days\u2014the song seemed to follow me everywhere all week, blasting out of taxis and Korean delis. \"I try to see the good in life/ The good things in life are hard to find,\" Daughtry wails as the guitars circle pitilessly between the same five crunching major chords. It's a punishing and effective piece of music, and even if the Nickelbackian post-grunge that Daughtry loves is the most joy-killing and charmless of contemporary pop styles, there's no doubt that he's very good at it\u2014along with Carrie Underwood, he's the best genre singer that Idol has produced. And, possibly, the most popular: [Daughtry](http://www.amazon.com/Daughtry/dp/B000IY04RC/sr=8-1/qid=1170318018/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-9564782-5265522?ie=UTF8&s=music) has been in and out of the Billboard No. 1 spot for the past few weeks, has sold nearly 1.4 million copies, and though the album dropped to No. 3 this week, its sales actually ticked up. Between Daughtry and [Hollywood golden girl Jennifer Hudson](http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/01/31/dreamgirl_jennifer_hudson_to_perform_at_), this is looking like the year of the Idol also-ran. On Tuesday, another runner-up, Katharine McPhee, released her [debut album](http://www.amazon.com/Katharine-McPhee/dp/B000IY04RM/sr=8-1/qid=1170319729/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-9564782-5265522?ie=UTF8&s=music), and it's actually a good record, staking out a nice middle ground between R&B and adult album alternative, with the blowsy ballads kept to a minimum. (I'm a sucker for the single, \" [Over It](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR_hBYwWm2M).\") Meanwhile, [Taylor Hicks' album](http://www.amazon.com/Taylor-Hicks/dp/B000IY04S6/sr=8-1/qid=1170326371/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-9564782-5265522?ie=UTF8&s=music) continues to tank\u2014proof, perhaps, that Hicks-hater Simon Cowell was right after all, and a lesson worth bearing in mind as Season 6 moves along. Sometimes, an Idol victory can be Pyrrhic. And if you're a rock singer like Daughtry, getting kicked off the show is probably good for your cred. Tuesday's auditions took place back in Hicks country, Birmingham, Ala. More of the same: a few decent performances, a few awful ones, and a baby-talking 19-year-old, Katie Bernard, who the judges sent onto the next round despite her goo-goo-ga-ga speaking voice and annoyingly twitchy singing style. (Paula: \"You just got married. I think you should enjoy that marriage.\" Katie: \"Oh, no, no, no, no!\") Human interest, of a particularly ghoulish kind, was supplied by Jamie Lynn Ward. She told the judges about her paralyzed father, who shot himself and his wife when he caught her cheating. Simon was unimpressed, but Randy and Paula put her through. She's this season's Kellie Pickler, with an even harder-luck back story. By far the brightest spot in Birmingham was chubby, mop-headed Chris Sligh. \"Some people tell me that I look like Jack Osborne. Some say that I look like Jack Black. But when I look in the mirror every morning, it's not those people that I see. It's Christina Aguilera,\" he deadpanned. Sligh told the judges that he's entered the contest because he \"wanted to make David Hasselhoff cry,\" before launching into a nice version of Seal's \"Kiss From a Rose.\" Six seasons and untold hundreds of contestants later, Idol has its first ironist. I'm looking forward to Sligh's subverting Idol's pieties for weeks to come. Wednesday's show, in Los Angeles, featured guest judge Olivia Newton-John, looking like she'd just been discharged from the offices of Jocelyn Wildenstein's surgeon. ( [Sandy, why'd you do it](http://youtube.com/watch?v=9siEx5w6rvA)?) Personally, I'm so over the auditions but I was amused\u2014slightly\u2014by the \" [panther\" stylings](http://www.realitytvmagazine.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/martik_panther.jpg) of Martik Manoukian.

Are we headed for a Rogers vs. [Doolittle](http://www.realitytvmagazine.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/melinda_doolittle.jpg), battle of the background singers? The night's \"emotional high\" was the appearance of 64-year-old [Sherman Pore](http://www.realitytvmagazine.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/sherman_pore.jpg), 36 years too old to qualify for Idol, who showed up to pay tribute to his late \"lady love.\" I was about to click over to Deal or No Deal in disgust, but Pore's performance of the old Jo Stafford hit \"You Belong to Me\" totally transcended kitsch\u2014it was a sweet, dignified, understated, and altogether lovely, a [great old song](http://youtube.com/watch?v=U_at5GX0tHw), sung from the heart. Paula wept\u2014for once, her tears were earned\u2014and Simon shook Pore's hand and called him a class act. But why not take it a step further? Bend the rules! Send the old man to Hollywood!

Newsweek columnist Jonathan Alter suggests that Bush suffers from a baby-boomer, Saigon-fell-because-we-quit hawkishness, while Lincoln biographer Joshua Wolf Shenk points crowd at the shores of the Hamptons' Northwest Creek, where an anomalous, encroaching pod of dolphins drew awe from onlookers. It shifted to concern, however, when several of the dolphins drifted ashore, dead.

With up to 20 possible candidates considering running and no incumbents, it will be \"the most wide-open presidential race in generations.\" It will also be expensive: With so many contenders mobilizing, they'll have to raise even more money to be considered serious competitors.

Yet they still sell at \"nosebleed prices.\" This new type of art isn't irreverent like Dadaism or Pop Art, though: \"[Those] artists were mocking something. They had a target. ... Laissez-faire aesthetics makes a mockery of nothing. Even irony is too much of an idea. It treats everything equally.\" ... A piece [dissects](http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20070205&s=trb020507) Sen. Barack Obama's appeal to whites. As Colin Powell's prospective presidential bid a decade ago suggested, whites like blacks who defy stereotypes, Peter Beinart writes. But Obama has it easier than Powell did, since racially loaded issues like welfare reform and crime\u2014debates that could force him to alienate either whites or blacks\u2014no longer define the national debate.\u2014C.B. Joe Biden got his presidential campaign off on the wrong foot this week when he called one of his competitors for the Democratic nomination, Barack Obama, \"the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.\" This isn't his first such lapse: In another unguarded moment last summer, Biden said, \"You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin Donuts [in Delaware] unless you have a slight Indian accent.\" So, is Biden a bigot, and should we care in the context of his presidential candidacy (assuming it survives)? Federal laws offer a rationale for concluding that the answer is, not much. Civil rights law doesn't prohibit racism by employers. It prohibits discrimination on the basis of race\u2014tangible actions taken by employers, not their bad attitudes. The 1989 Supreme Court case Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins helped to determine how the law handles cases where both bias and acceptable motivations influence a decision about how to treat an employee. Ann Hopkins, a candidate for partnership at Price Waterhouse, alleged sex discrimination when she was passed over for a promotion. People in her firm had made sexist comments about her, and some had made sexist comments in connection with her bid for promotion. But that wasn't enough for Hopkins to win. The Supreme Court held that she needed to show that their sexism affected the company's decision to deny her the promotion. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor made the distinction between attitudes and actions most pointedly in her concurrence, worrying that imposing liability based on sexist attitudes alone would make civil rights law into a form of \"thought control.\" This may seem weak: Why should we let racists and sexists off the hook? Shouldn't the law try to change hearts and minds as well as practices? But it makes practical sense. Attitudes are notoriously hard to discern, much less control. Maybe Joe Biden is a bigot who thinks most blacks are dirty and inarticulate, but maybe he's just inarticulate himself. And Justice O'Connor was right to suggest there's something creepy and illiberal about the state policing and punishing thoughts\u2014even thoughts most people think are reprehensible. Attitudes matter, but they matter because they can affect decisions. Happily, most decisions in moderately sized institutions\u2014and more so in large institutions like Price Waterhouse or the government of the United States\u2014are made through relatively formal procedures, where reasons need to be articulated and evaluated. Even if bigots participate in the decision-making process, the rules and norms of the institution can help to ensure that their attitudes are not allowed to pollute the decisions. In the end, Ann Hopkins won her lawsuit against Price Waterhouse, in part because the firm as a whole did nothing to disclaim or repudiate the sexist comments of some partners. This made it more likely that the sexism did in fact affect the decision to deny Hopkins a promotion. Yet there are plenty of new tools for the thought police. For instance, the [Implicit Association Test](http://www.slate.com/id/2134921/), developed by psychologists Mahzarin Banaji and Anthony Greenwald, seeks to identify not just hidden biases, but even unconscious biases. It works by testing reaction time when the subject is asked to make associations between faces and words: If you're quick to associate white faces with words like \"articulate\" and \"clean\" but slow to associate African-American faces with those words, you may be an unconscious bigot, even if you're a liberal Democrat who thinks you're a paragon of tolerance. Critics have questioned whether the test really proves anything about the unconscious minds of individuals\u2014reaction time might simply reflect the associations you are used to seeing in society, not the associations you yourself believe to be valid. But suppose it does smoke out unconscious bias. Should we make candidates for elected office take it and pay attention to the results? It's widely known that by many reliable accounts, President Lyndon Baines Johnson was something of a racist, as was typical of white Southerners of his age. He might well have flunked Banaji and Greenwald's test. But of course Johnson worked tirelessly and at real political cost to ensure the passage of modern civil rights legislation. His professional and personal dealings seem free of the stain of bigotry. By contrast, as Jacob Weisberg has [suggested](http://www.slate.com/id/2125812/) in Slate, one need not think President Bush a bigot in his heart to think that his reaction to Hurricane Katrina bore the hallmarks of racial insensitivity. If Bush didn't care about black people in New Orleans, that was not because of his personal racial animus, but because of his institutional priorities. This was not a political constituency that mattered to him. Like Price Waterhouse, a political party or executive branch that allows racial prejudice and indifference to affect decisions is a larger problem than the bias of an individual. Presidents don't make decisions in a vacuum\u2014they make them as leaders of administrations and in reaction to political pressures. So, their decisions are more like institutional decisions. A president who resists the pressures to ignore the needs of relatively powerless minority groups, like the Katrina victims, is one who deserves our support\u2014whatever his latent personal attitudes. My vote's with the next LBJ. RICHMOND, Va.\u2014The Justice Department must think three times is a charm when it comes to the enemy combatants they've socked away in Navy brigs. Its first kick at the can was Yaser Esam Hamdi\u2014a U.S. citizen captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan and held for almost three years by the military without charges. After a face-off with the Supreme Court, Hamdi was released and sent home. (Oops.) [The ](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/)second try was Jose Padilla, grabbed as a so-called dirty bomber, [*](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#Correction) locked down in a Navy brig where he was\u2014it seems\u2014brutally treated, then demoted to a civilian criminal trial just prior to a face-off with the Supreme Court. (Oops, we did it again.) And then there was one: Ali Saleh Kalah al-Marri is the last person designated an enemy combatant who's still in a brig. Unlike Hamdi and Padilla, al-Marri, who is being held in Charleston, N.C., isn't a U.S. citizen. Unlike Hamdi and Padilla, he was nabbed on the streets of Peoria, Ill. And unlike Hamdi and Padilla, the government has not yet gone toe-to-toe with the U.S. Supreme Court in his case. But today the government goes toe-to-toe with Judge Diana Gribbon Motz of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. The same Judge Motz who wrote a dissent in Rumsfeld v. Hamdi that could light your barbecue from 100 feet: I fear that [this court] may also have opened the door to the indefinite detention, without access to a lawyer or the courts, of any American citizen, even one captured on American soil, who the Executive designates an 'enemy combatant,' as long as the Executive asserts that the area in which the citizen was detained was an 'active combat zone,' and the detainee, deprived of access to the courts and counsel, cannot dispute this fact. The 4th Circuit outvoted her in Hamdi and [got snookered](http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/056396R1.P.pdf) in Padilla. The question today is whether that court's capacity for being worked by the Bush administration is infinite. The three-judge panel hears argument this morning in the federal courthouse in Richmond. Al-Marri has been in federal custody for more than five years, 17 months of which he served without any legal contact. A native of Qatar here on a student visa, he was picked up after Sept. 11 and, if the government is to be believed, his phone records and computer files show connections to the planners and financiers of 9/11 as well as plans for future chemical attacks. But in 2003, before he stood criminal trial on credit card and other fraud charges, the Bush administration swooped him up, tagged him an \"enemy combatant,\" and threw away the key. A federal judge in North Carolina agreed that detention was lawful. So, here we are in Richmond. Jonathan Hafetz, from the Brennan Center for Justice, represents al-Marri, who isn't in court. He tells the panel the only question in this dispute is \"whether criminal law or military law governs,\" warning that the president \"can't militarize the arrest of a man in Peoria by a stroke of the pen.\" He turns to whether the court even has jurisdiction to hear this case. The recently enacted Military Commissions Act of 2006 provides, in part, that \"[n]o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider any [legal] action against the United States ... related to any aspect of the ... confinement of a noncitizen properly deemed an enemy combatant.\" A threshold question for this panel is whether, as the government contends, the MCA strips it of the power to hear the habeas petition of a legal resident who is detained in the United States. Judge Motz questions Hafetz on how, under the statute, someone is \"properly deemed\" an enemy combatant and presses him to distinguish al-Marri from the detainees at Guantanamo. Hafetz says that as a lawful resident alien, al-Marri is entitled to \"the same rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the Constitution as any citizen of the United States.\" Motz: \"The bulwark of your argument is that he has certain constitutional rights. What constitutional rights?\" She adds: \"Habeas doesn't give him a right. It just gives him a remedy.\" Judge Gregory is sympathetic toward Congress. \"Congress gave the president broad powers after Sept. 11 to wage a war on terror,\" he says. It allowed him to use \"all force necessary.\" But, replies Hafetz, the Authorization for Use of Military Force \"didn't give the president authority to detain someone arrested in his home with no connection to the battlefield!\" \"Don't you think Congress knew this was a pretty amorphous definition of war?\" Gregory asks. \"This war was provoked by a domestic attack!\" Motz explains her problem: \"You assume he's a civilian,\" she tells Hafetz. \"They assume he's an enemy combatant. But nobody has told us what we look to, to make that determination.\" Hafetz says that to be an enemy combatant, the defendant \"must be a direct participant in hostilities, or have some connection to the battlefield. Otherwise, you are just unraveling the AUMF to allow military jurisdiction to swallow criminal law.\" That authorization allowed the president to go after fighters in Afghanistan, he says, \"not to turn all of the United States into a battlefield.\" David Salmons, assistant to the solicitor general, gets a turn on the hot seat. Salmons seems to have a little problem allowing Motz to complete her questions. At the Supreme Court that's a hanging offense, but things seem a little looser here at the 4th Circuit. Salmons opens with the claim that al-Marri was only designated an enemy combatant after \"an extensive, multi-agency review process.\" Motz promptly jumps on his head. \"Is there any evidence that al-Marri is involved with the Taliban?\" she asks. No. \"Or any other nation-state?\" No. \"Because often in these cases the government has some late-breaking developments. Are there no late-breaking developments here?\" she demands. Motz distinguishes between the president's authority to wage war on the Taliban (representing a nation-state) and al-Qaida, at least according to \"the laws of war.\" \"But we are at war with al-Qaida,\" protests Salmons. \"But there is no nation of al-Qaida,\" retorts Motz. \"Al-Qaida is everywhere.\" \"Can the president declare any member of Hamas an enemy combatant?\" \"Yes,\" Salmons says, \"That comes back: \"There's no doubt after Hamdi that the president has the right to detain an enemy combatant. But what I don't understand is, how do you make that determination? When I call someone an ostrich, I look in the dictionary for a definition. But what did the president look to in determining whether he was an enemy combatant?\" Salmons says the AUMF was perfectly clear\u2014anyone responsible for the 9/11 attacks is fair game for the president. Motz won't budge. \"Nations have wars against each other. People have quarrels or fights.\" Motz asks whether the government believes even U.S. citizens can be treated this way. \"Yes. That was Padilla,\" says Salmons. At this point Motz is forced to scold Salmons for constantly speaking over her questions: \"Mr. Salmons. I am sure you have a lot more things to say ... \" He interrupts to apologize. The two skirmish about the precedential value of the 4th Circuit's decision in Padilla. She wonders if it needs to be vacated or if the court could simply determine that \"it doesn't have much precedential force.\" That Padilla decision, even though it sent Judge Michael [Luttig into orbit](http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1135159512321), is still the strongest judicial statement of approval for the president's claims to limitless executive authority. Motz would be quite delighted to set it on fire. Judge Gregory says he agrees with the government that the AUMF extends to al-Qaida. \"But the Patriot Act gives protections to noncitizens ... before you can be plucked from the streets and called an enemy combatant.\" He tells Salmons, \"You've swallowed up all the protections of the Patriot Act and the Constitution.\" Motz is still searching for some way to constrain\u2014she calls it \"cabin\"\u2014the executive power arising from the AUMF. \"Suppose the head of PETA was in France and planning to break into the French banking industry,\" she posits. \"Does the French government have the right to declare war on PETA? Can they declare him an enemy combatant?\" It's an almost Scalia-esque flight of hypothetical fancy, and Salmons spends a good bit of time resisting the hypo. Then Motz adds: \"You may be quite right that Congress can do this. I'm just not sure they have.\" Salmons' rejoinder: \"In the five years since 9/11 we are talking about just one individual picked up in the United States. ... We have hard evidence from his laptop and phone records. ... Representatives of PETA can sleep well at night.\" The suggestion that the president should be granted these outrageously expansive powers because he uses them only once in five years is amazing. As is the insistence that there is \"hard evidence\" of al-Marri's role as a terrorist, even though some has allegedly been procured by torture and none has been tested in a court. This latter insistence prompts Motz to ask whether the appeals court would have to give similar credence to the evidence in the event that \"the president had someone file an affidavit saying that PETA was connected to 9/11?\" Perhaps the most fraught moment this morning comes when Motz stops her assault on Salmons and Judge Gregory steps in to ask, politely, what the panel might do if the president plays fast and loose with the 4th Circuit. \"If we decide we have no jurisdiction to hear this case, and you don't make good on your promise to put al-Marri before a CSRT [the combat status review tribunal to which all enemy combatants are entitled], how would we come back and reverse that?\" he asks, doubtfully. Salmons offers the equivalent of the Boy Scout promise that al-Marri will get his day in quasi-court. And Gregory looks like a guy who's just been asked, yet again, to trust the Bush administration to do the right thing. Because maybe the third time really is a charm.

It speaks volumes about the topsy-turvy legal universe of the Bush administration that its mistakes are still trumpeted from the rooftops, while\u2014on the rare occasion in which it does the right thing\u2014no one seems to notice. Compare the administration's handling of the Maher Arar affair last week with yesterday's proceedings in the trial of accused Iraqi insurgent Wesam al-Delaema.

[Maher Arar](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/01/27/MNG9SNQ6BO1.DTL) is still on the front pages, however, and Wesam al-Delaema is nearly buried.

The Canadian software engineer was grabbed during a stopover at JFK Airport in 2002 and subjected to 10 months of \" [extraordinary rendition\" in the care of our good friends in Syria](http://www.commondreams.org/views07/0125-30.htm). He was tortured until he falsely confessed, then sent home without explanation. A two-year inquiry by a prestigious [Canadian commission](http://www.ararcommission.ca/eng/index.htm) determined that it had all been an awful mistake. The Bush administration refused to cooperate with that commission and still refuses to remove Arar from the American security watch list, claiming to have secret information that he's still dangerous although the Canadian authorities dispute that. Last Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered Arar [a public apology and $8.9 million in compensation](http://www.7days.ae/en/2007/01/28/a-terrible-mistake.html) while the Bush administration has blocked his lawsuit, citing the executive branch's \"state secrets privilege.\" The conclusions of the Canadians, admitting his arrest was a mistake, are disregarded. No concessions, no apology, no transparency, and no regard for our Canadian allies. Arar wins a permanent entry under A in the world's Dictionary of Reasons To Hate Us. Now consider the case of the Iraqi-born Dutch citizen Wesam al-Delaema. Yesterday, following a two-year battle over the terms of his extradition, [Delaema pled not guilty](http://washingtontimes.com/national/20070130-122433-4467r.htm) to several conspiracy counts in a federal criminal court. He faces a public trial on six counts, including conspiring to kill American citizens abroad, to use a weapon of mass destruction, and to maliciously damage or destroy U.S. government property by means of an explosive. Delaema and his cronies, who call themselves the \"Mujahideen from Fallujah,\" videotaped themselves planting bombs on a road used by American forces in Iraq, and the videotape was aired widely on television in the Arab world. The tape\u2014which evidently includes the defendant bragging \"this is not the first operation we carry out ... . Their casualties have gone beyond your imagination,\" was found in his house in Amersfoort in a 2005 raid. Before he was extradited to the United States, Delaema told the Dutch courts he was on the tape only because he'd been kidnapped while visiting Iraq for a wedding. He said he was forced to plant the bombs (and presumably gloat about it) or he would be beheaded. The claim rings slightly false in light of a Dutch television interview he gave in 2003 in which he swaggered, \"I don't care if I myself die or not. I want to offer myself up for my land, for my people.\" His family claims that interview was \"a joke.\" In order to win extradition for Delaema to face trial in the United States, prosecutors had to make a raft of promises to the Dutch authorities that would be insulting to American perceptions of the rule of law, were they not so completely well-earned over the past few years. The defendant will be tried in criminal court, not by a military tribunal. He will not face the death penalty, even though under our law his crimes could warrant it. He will serve his sentence\u2014possibly a life one\u2014in a jail in the Netherlands, not here. And, perhaps most astonishing of all, the United States had to agree that Dutch courts will be able to review and possibly modify the terms of the American court's sentence once Delaema is returned to the Netherlands. The American judgment, then, is not necessarily final. And all this because, according to Delaema's attorney, the U.S. government no longer can be trusted to treat its prisoners humanely. Clearly, the Dutch authorities agree. There is much to be understood from this deal between the American and Dutch authorities. On the one hand, it highlights the level of mistrust and disdain we have earned from our Western allies. But it also reveals a new, almost sensible, oddly secret approach by the Justice Department. The Bush administration can become pretty accommodating when its option is either an open criminal trial or no domestic prosecution at all. Suddenly the criminal courts\u2014long touted by Bush and Cheney as ineffective in prosecuting the war on terror\u2014are adequate. Suddenly, open proceedings don't threaten national security. After literally years of dismissing our allies, the existing conspiracy laws, and the criminal courts, the Justice Department has finally agreed to give 'em a whirl. After years of fighting for symbolic legal gains at the expense of small, tangible ones, the president has finally accepted that it's worth nailing terrorists with powers he has, as opposed to [powers he merely craves](http://www.slate.com/id/2157493/). What a contrast between the Bush administration's striking inflexibility in Arar's case and humble pragmatism in Delaema's! The government cannot concede the error in torturing an innocent Canadian but is willing to take what it can get to prosecute a Dutch insurgent? Do we trust our friends in the Netherlands more than our allies to the north? Or is admitting a mistake more difficult for this administration than accepting a legal compromise? Perhaps the difference between our treatment of Arar and Delaema is best explained as the slow triumph of expediency over empty symbols. As the post-9/11 fever recedes, the administration may be rediscovering the sober virtues of trials over torture, the benefits of multilateralism over going it alone. The president has either realized or been forced to accept that other Western democracies, the U.S. Congress, the federal judiciary, and the free press don't, in fact, want unhinged jihadists roaming the streets any more than he does. And having gone toe to toe with each of these institutions, it now seems he needs their help more than they need his. So, the president will cooperate. But he will never apologize. In Dalaema's case, that means striking a bargain with the Netherlands. But in the Arar case it would require asking too much: apologizing so that the whole world can hear. And if the president's concern is now pragmatism over symbolism, let me offer a longer wish list: the closure of Guantanamo, fair trials for its occupants, and the dropping of all charges against Jose Padilla. The president isn't quite there yet. But with this Delaema deal, he may be starting to circle back to the legal world he pretty much demolished in the wake of 9/11. Welcome back to the Rule of Law, Mr. President. We've missed you. It's no secret that the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court have served some hard time in the makeup chair this year. In a welcome development for openness and transparency, many of the justices have done their share of close-ups this term. In recent months, Justice John Paul Stevens and Chief Justice John Roberts gave prime-time interviews to ABC's Jan Crawford Greenburg; Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg chatted with CBS' Mike Wallace in chambers; and Justice Stephen Breyer has logged almost as much time on camera as Lindsay Lohan\u2014including a sit-down with Charlie Rose and a gig on Fox News Sunday. Roberts is participating in a four-hour documentary to be aired [on PBS starting next week](http://www.pbs.org/previews/supremecourt/). Even some of the justices still unwilling to talk to the cameras have been more amenable to speaking on the record. Justices Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer, for instance, engaged in a wide-ranging public debate last December that is available for download [on the Web](http://www.acslaw.org/node/3909). And ABC's Greenburg was able to secure interviews with nine justices for her new book, [Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court and America's Future](http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781594201011,00.html). Nine justices. That's a lot more than Bob Woodward got for The Brethren. What the justices have discussed in these interviews has ranged from judicial philosophy to how much the chief justice's young son likes Spider-Man. And that's opened the door to a far more robust and nuanced national conversation about constitutional law and the proper role of the judiciary. Whether it's the new chief justice extolling the virtues of unanimity and minimalism, or Stephen Breyer selling his constitutional theory of \"active liberty,\" the court has finally taken its case to the airwaves, and that is unequivocally good for an America that\u2014for better or worse\u2014has pretty much taken up permanent residence there. But a funny thing is happening on the way to the soundstage. Some justices are refusing to discuss certain areas of the law in these extrajudicial discussions. And that raises interesting questions about which justices avoid which topics and why. Does the selective chill reflect fissures on the court, in the law, or both? For example, Ginsburg talked openly with Mike Wallace in October until he came to the subject of abortion. Out came the ice water: \"Stop!\" she said. \"We're not going to talk about abortion.\" Ginsburg also expressly refused to discuss questions about the separation of church and state and Bush v. Gore, insisting \"questions are going to come before this court on those turbulent issues.\" So too, when Chris Wallace asked Breyer about abortion in December, the justice stopped him, explaining, \"I decide abortion cases when they come up. But I know perfectly well that anything I say on that subject is enormously volatile.\" He also felt it improper to \"talk about that subject particularly in a public forum that isn't the court.\" When Wallace interrupted to ask for clarification, Breyer repeated: \"No, not any question to do with abortion ...\" Full stop there. And Breyer similarly refused to touch the subject of abortion at a public debate with [Scalia in Washington last December](http://www.slate.com/id/2154993/). Interestingly, Scalia had no such qualms. At first, this just looks like a variation on the old confirmation two-step. That's the dance that happens at judicial confirmation hearings wherein a prospective justice refuses to answer any questions about cases or subjects that \"may come before the courts.\" (And, yes, the court heard an abortion case this term.) But that's not really the calculus the justices are using in their increasingly meaty public speeches: At that same debate in December, Breyer spoke about Brown v. Board of Education, even as the high court was hearing two cases that raised school-integration issues that very week. He discussed\u2014briefly\u2014the presidential-powers cases in his interview with Wallace. Betcha that issue will come before the court again soon. And in her interview with Wallace, Ginsburg spoke passionately about the court's decision in a major case involving the presidential authority to create military tribunals, concluding, \"In this country, we have no royalty, we have no king who has absolute authority.\" Justice Stevens recently discussed the flag-burning case. And this week Scalia told an audience at [Iona College in New York](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/S/SCOTUS_RECALLING_THE_RECOUNT?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT) that Florida's handling of the Florida recount in Bush v. Gore was a violation of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. \"Counting somebody else's dimpled chad and not counting my dimpled chad is not giving equal protection of the law,\" he said. Scalia let the crowd know that the case is one only for the history books: \"It's water over the deck\u2014get over it,\" he said. Given that Bush v. Gore explicitly claims to hold no precedential value in future cases, perhaps he's right; still, such voting cases will doubtless come before the court again in the future. So, how do we account for the justices' sudden silences and pregnant pauses? Surely, it's a question of personality in part. Roberts appears unwilling to discuss cases or doctrine off the bench, Breyer is inclined to discuss them, but mostly in the abstract, and Scalia is inclined to discuss pretty much anything quite openly. But there's something else at work here\u2014something to do with what Breyer calls the \"volatile\" cases and Ginsburg calls the \"turbulent\" ones. For both these justices abortion clearly falls into that category. And in general, they seem to avoid talking about the explosive moral issues that tend to divide the court just as they divide the country\u2014gay rights, race-based decision making, abortion, religion. These are the fronts on which the court's liberals often strive to use constitutional doctrine to protect minority rights. And while there is certainly a sound constitutional basis for their positions, it's been increasingly tricky for the court's liberals to explain them in a sound bite. \"Active liberty,\" as it turns out, requires a whole hour with Charlie Rose to unpack. The one unifying theme in most of the judicial speeches this past year has been this one: The power belongs to the people. Whether it's Breyer urging citizens to engage in government or Scalia insisting that it's the job of the people, not the court, to modify the Constitution, the universal message of the justices is not to fear the court, but rather to become more involved in the legislative process. But that's only half the story, and the justices know it. The really tough cases are, invariably, the hardest to explain. As Justice Scalia continues to prove, the taut lines of his theory of \"originalism\" tend to be an easier sell than the blurriness of a \"living Constitution.\" Which may be why some of the justices sometimes talk the loudest when they say nothing at all. A version of this piece also appeared in the Washington Post [Outlook section](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/opinions/outlook/?nav=left). After years of rising concern about left-wing anti-Semitism, the [New York Times reported this week](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/arts/31jews.html) about [a study for the American Jewish Committee](http://www.ajc.org/). Written by professor Alvin Rosenfeld of Indiana University, the study describes the spread of a virulent anti-Zionism in many quarters on the left that has helped legitimate anti-Semitism. Some people have seized on the study to argue that these extreme anti-Zionists are really anti-Jewish bigots. Critics reply that criticizing Israel, even harshly, doesn't prove animus toward the Hebrew people.

One of the most trying problems for parents of young infants is colic, those awful bouts of evening crying and inconsolable fussiness between the ages of three weeks and three months. Severe colic is miserable for parents\u2014there is nothing worse than being unable to comfort your suffering baby\u2014and frustrating for doctors. But now [a new study](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/119/1/e124) describes a promising treatment from an unlikely source: a germ. In particular, a probiotic, or live culture of a bacterium often found in the gastrointestinal tract. Colicky infants appear to be in pain when they fuss, and the pain seems to be located in the intestines. Yet the problem often isn't taken seriously enough by pediatricians. For one thing, that's because it's self-limiting\u2014colic clears up on its own in almost all babies by their fourth month. For another, colic causes no physical injury. Colicky infants tend to grow faster than kids without colic, perhaps because they are taking in a lot of milk to comfort themselves. Still, colic matters. In addition to the babies' pain, it erodes parents' sense of confidence and competence. Beginning in the 1950s, a quite effective medication existed for colic. Called dicyclomine, it was an [antispasmodic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antispasmodic) that was thought to decrease tight contractions of the smooth muscle of the bowels of colicky infants. [Dicyclomine'](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/)s benefits were confirmed by high-quality research, but it was reclassified as \"contraindicated for children under 6 months,\" in the mid-1980s out of concern that it might be harmful. [*](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#Correct) (Some infants were seen to gasp after being given a dose, and a few died after taking dicyclomine, though there was evidence that some of the victims had been given a large overdose.) When I had to give it up, I felt as if penicillin had been taken away from me. Currently there is one rather less effective medication available\u2014hyoscyamine, a weak plant extract that is also an antispasmodic\u2014and an almost useless one, simethicone drops, which prevent intestinal gas from accumulating as a stable foam. Which is why the new probiotic treatment seems so attractive. In a study of 83 breastfed colicky infants, divided into two equal groups, Dr. Francesco Savino and his colleagues at the University of Turin, Italy, compared treatment with live [probiotic bacteria](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#2158642) (five drops daily) to treatment with simethicone. The results were pretty amazing. Within a week, the probiotic treatment produced a measurable, statistically significant improvement in the amount of time the treated babies spent crying, compared to the group of infants treated with simethicone. After four weeks (at the end of the study), 95 percent of the colicky babies responded favorably to this treatment, compared to only 7 percent of the infants treated with simethicone. By then, the simethicone-treated infants were spending about three times as many minutes crying as the probiotic-treated babies\u2014145 minutes a day as opposed to 51 minutes. This result is better than I ever achieved with dicyclomine. The probiotic treatment Savino's team tracked has been used safely for many years in treating adults and children for various gastrointestinal problems. [Other recent studies](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#2158644) suggest that it is also safe for infants, including premature babies, when used to treat or prevent diarrhea. Still, Savino and his co-authors (and I) suggest waiting a while before trying this treatment for colic so its safety and efficacy can be confirmed. In the meantime, I'm reminded of an observation about newborn feeding behavior I made many years ago that I think relates to colic. A remarkably large number of babies become excessively fussy and demanding about feeding\u2014often wanting to be fed hourly\u2014on or very near the 12th day of life. This occurs with great regularity whether or not the infant is born prematurely, close to his or her due date, or a couple of weeks late. So, the 12th-day phenomenon can't be the result of some aspect of neurological development (which begins during pregnancy and continues after birth). Instead, the cause must be some process whose clock begins ticking at the moment of birth. The most likely cause, it seems to me, is immunological. Here is my speculation about what's going on. At birth, bacteria\u2014from the mother, from the delivery room, from the hands of the nurse who weighs the baby\u2014begin to colonize infants' bowels. This much we know. And many of the early colonizing bacteria are relatives of the very bacteria used in the probiotic treatment for colic tested by Savino. After nine or 10 days, the baby's body begins to recognize these bacteria as foreign and starts to produce an immune response to ward them off. The bowel wall acquires antibody-producing cells, and these antibodies change the ecological balance of bacteria in the bowel, because some species of bacteria are more sensitive to them than others. The antibodies produced by the cells in the intestinal walls help protect us against disease for the rest of our lives. (We don't properly appreciate our intestines.) The problem with this early natural shift in the body's ecology, however, is that many of the bowel bacteria of later infancy, as well as adulthood, ferment milk sugar (lactose) and thus produce gas and other irritating byproducts of fermentation. When gas stretches the bowel wall, the intestines feel pain. That's why these early-in-life bacterial shifts may be linked to colic. And it may be that the probiotic treatment, by administering lots of live bacteria from a baby's first days of life, tends to push the ecological balance away from the gassiness-producing germs. Now, as I warned, there's a lot of speculation here. We know about the early bacteria of the bowel and about the change in the bowel's ecology, but we don't know if the shift occurs around the 12th day of life and so could neatly explain the discomfort I typically observe. And even if the timing is right, there is no research to date that endorses (or refutes) my hypothesis about cause and effect. Also, we have no idea how\u2014or even if \u2014the 12th-day feeding frenzy relates to colic more generally. Still, in my practice I have found a huge payoff in warning mothers and fathers to expect this 12th-day phenomenon, and in assuring them that their babies' frequent demands for feeding don't represent hunger\u2014there isn't really a growth spurt\u2014but rather a baby's attempt to feel more comfortable. If nursing mothers know what to expect, I find, they are less likely to give up breast-feeding, because they don't have to worry that their baby isn't getting enough milk. For many babies, the problem fixes itself in a day or two, whatever the parents do. (Though carrying, singing, and giving the kid to your in-laws are all recommended.) But maybe soon I won't need to issue 12th-day warnings anymore. Perhaps we'll be giving infants an early dash of probiotic to prevent colic, and even paving the way for a smooth day 12, too. I'm not ready to prescribe this treatment yet. But I am waiting anxiously for the follow-up research.

Conceptually, this is the opposite of antibiotics, which produce an organism that kills or inhibits another organism. Probiotics are living cultures of bacteria and yeasts that are thought to enhance the health and well-being of patients. The bacteria incorporated in most probiotics are often the same as (or closely related to) the bacteria that convert milk into yogurt or kefir. Some are commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract of normal, healthy people. The probiotic chosen for Savino's study in Italy contains exactly this kind of bacterium, called Lactobacillus reuteri. Historically, naturally soured milk has long been known to protect against intestinal infections. (I always assumed this was a simple matter of the acidity suppressing the growth of intestinal pathogens, but recent probiotic research hints that there's more to it than simple low pH.) The great pioneering Russian microbiologist Ilya Mechnikov argued 100 years ago that the consumption of yogurt was associated with longevity.

The two Super Bowl head coaches, Lovie Smith of the Chicago Bears and Tony Dungy of the Indianapolis Colts, are exceptional in the exclusive fraternity of successful football coaches. It's not because they're African-Americans. It's because they're not jerks. For years, the archetypal gridiron coaches have been yellers like [Bill Parcells](http://www.slate.com/id/1841/), who relishes questioning the manhood of players and the intelligence of reporters, or ungracious grumps like Bill Belichick of the Patriots, who this season refused to shake hands with his former assistant Eric Mangini, after the Mangini-coached New York Jets beat the Pats. But as Karen Crouse [notes](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/sports/football/28dungy.html) in the New York Times, Dungy is a \"civilized man in a coarse profession. He doesn't berate his players or stalk the sideline. He doesn't spew profanity or chew tobacco.\" Earlier this month, Smith, who once worked for Dungy, told the Times that he learned the value of being nice from his old boss. \"We talked about how to do it, being a teacher instead of screaming and yelling, all that stuff.\" Smith and Dungy are fully capable not just of shaking hands with opponents, but of hugging them and breaking bread with them. As MSNBC's Steve Silverman [writes](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16673409/), before Indianapolis played the Kansas City Chiefs in the wild-card game earlier this year, Dungy, Smith, and Kansas City Chiefs coach Herman Edwards had dinner together with their families. Business and politics\u2014two famously combative and competitive spheres\u2014love to borrow from the culture of sports leadership.

It contains anecdotes about social-science research that prove people respond more to niceness than to fear and anger, and several Pay It Forward examples of good deeds rewarded. (Being nice to Donald Trump's wife at a photo shoot led to a role for the executives on The Apprentice. That's a case where nice led to dreck.) They advise readers to take pains to exercise their \"niceness muscles.\" (Note to Kaplan and Thaler: For the paperback edition, please tell readers where these muscles are. I spent an hour looking for mine, to no avail.) The nice meme goes against the grain of the long-dominant take-no-prisoners approach that views business as one long war, or football game.

In his no-crying-zone, firing people is an act of kindness and shuffling executives around the globe every few years, their families be damned, is an act of generosity. Welch's tough-guy approach still sells books and inspires executives, but it's not exactly taking the marketplace by storm. Look at the divergent fates of two of Welch's best-known prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Robert Nardelli took Welch's ethos with him to Home Depot. Earlier this year, after having alienated shareholders, employees, and board members with his imperious style, Nardelli was [essentially fired](http://ir.homedepot.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=224078). Meanwhile, Welch's successor, [Jeff Immelt](http://www.ge.com/en/company/companyinfo/executivebios/eb_immelt.htm), seems to have a much higher emotional IQ than Nardelli or Welch. He smiles a lot and [says the right things](http://search.ft.com/ftArticle?queryText=%2522immelt%2522&aje=true&id=061103001226) about executive pay and global warming. You wouldn't mind leaving your kids in his care for an afternoon. Or consider the evolution of Bill Gates. In the 1990s, America's richest man was seen by many as a cut-throat monopolist, feared and respected more than loved. He's been reborn this decade as a cuddly mensch, bringing the same focus to curing malaria and HIV as he did to crushing rival software companies. Now, it's easy to exaggerate the triumph of nice. Corporate America and professional sports remain spheres in which the bottom line is all that matters. Shareholders and fans will forgive their managers for being jerks so long as they post results. But corporate culture always evolves. And among executives it is surely trendier to be culturally sensitive, environmentally conscious, and concerned about [income inequality](http://www.slate.com/id/2157859/fr/flyout/) than it was in the past decade. Why? In the 1990s, with stock ownership expanding at a rapid rate\u2014the percentage of households owning mutual funds or stock more than doubled in the decade\u2014Americans suddenly cared a great deal about corporate profits, since that's what boosted stock prices. But in this decade, ownership hasn't expanded, and it's clear that gains are not being as broadly shared as they were in the 1990s. Meanwhile, as the stocks of gigantic companies like General Electric, Wal-Mart, Microsoft, and Home Depot are having difficulty gaining traction even as they post favorable results, CEOs know they can't be respected public figures on the basis of stock performance alone, as Welch was during the '90s. As shares of GE have badly [underperformed the S&P 500 for the last five years](http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/charts/chartdl.aspx?PT=9&D5=0&D2=0&D3=0&showchartbt=Redraw+Chart&D4=1&CB=1&compsyms=hd&MA0=0&MA1=0&D7=&D6=&C5=1&C6=&C7=1&C8=&C9=1&symbol=GE&nocookie=1), Immelt's winning personality and eagerness to exercise his nice muscles have insulated him from shareholder wrath. There's a frailty to the power of nice, in business and sports. Dungy's Colts needed a [last-minute touchdown](http://www.superbowl.com/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20070121_NE@IND) to beat Belichick's Patriots in the AFC championship game. A fumble or an interception, and analysts would be questioning Dungy's laid-back style. Just so, a few poorly conceived ad campaigns could cause Kaplan Thaler to lose its mojo. Immelt might find the nice-guy act wearing thin if GE continues to underperform the market. And this Sunday, in the Super Bowl, one of the nice guys will finish last. Factory Girl, George Hickenlooper's biopic of actress/socialite/Warhol muse Edie Sedgwick, is a bit like Sedgwick herself\u2014whatever substantial qualities it might once have possessed have been wasted, picked over by rumor and gossip, and sullied by the pawing of many hands. Since the Weinstein Company snuck the film onto screens in December to qualify for Oscar consideration (yeah, good luck with that), Factory Girl has had a troubled release history. Most recently, its opening date was held up after Bob Dylan threatened a [defamation lawsuit](http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1972966,00.html). Dylan (called \"The Musician\" in the credits, though he's clearly the object of Hayden Christensen's drawling impersonation) feared the film would imply he was responsible for Sedgwick's death by overdose at the age of 28. In a last-minute reshoot after the initial screenings, new footage was added, including the flash-forward framing device in which we see Edie (Sienna Miller) telling her own story on a therapist's couch. If Dylan's only concern was defamation, he needn't have fretted about the release of Factory Girl. Its portrait of the artist as a young a-hole isn't exactly flattering, but it still manages to be hagiographic by all but declaring that Edie would have been saved if she'd only managed to bag the elusive Dylan. The galumphing voiceover narration was apparently another product of the film's last-minute makeover. The much more effective talking-head interviews with Edie's real-life intimates (including her brother Jonathan, who recently came out with an [even seedier](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,176-2534786,00.html) Dylan-related claim) have been moved to the final credits, where, along with stills of the incredibly photogenic Sedgwick (one of the few biopic subjects to be even more attractive than the actor portraying her), they remind you with a start what a fascinating movie you could have been watching. There have been other rumors around Factory Girl, too\u2014most recently, tabloids speculated that Miller and Christensen (who dated in real life after Miller's then-fiance, Jude Law, cheated on her with the nanny) had engaged in unsimulated intercourse while filming Edie and Bob's graphic love scene. By now you're thinking, fine, cut through the hype and tell me about the movie already\u2014but you tell me, where does one end and the other begin? See, it's just like Edie herself! This tension between surface and depth, glamour and authenticity, was at the heart of what made Warhol's work so radical. It's also what made Edie the ideal Warhol muse: With her blankly luminous beauty, she was a Marilyn Monroe-like projection screen for the desires and fantasies of others. But the director, George Hickenlooper (Hearts of Darkness, The Mayor of Sunset Strip), doesn't find either Warhol's art or Edie's opacity particularly interesting. For a movie about the tumultuous friendships among artists, musicians, and filmmakers during one of the 20th century's periods of creative ferment, Factory Girl is remarkably incurious about cinema, music, and art. The story plods through the stations of the cross of Edie's life, linking each instance of her outrageous behavior to its equal and opposite childhood trauma. The screenplay by Captain Mauzner (Wonderland) makes sure we understand how important Warhol's work is by having Edie rush up to him at parties, piping, \"Your work is so important!\" And I can't let my favorite line of [biopic dialogue](http://www.slate.com/id/2111080/), spoken by Edie's authoritarian father, go unquoted: \"Let me get you a steak, Warhol. You look like you could use one.\" I wouldn't go as far as Lou Reed, who [called](http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/384953p-326717c.html) Mauzner's script \"one of the most disgusting, foul things I've seen\u2014by any illiterate retard\u2014in a long time.\" (With Warholian sangfroid, Hickenlooper responded, \"I love Lou Reed. I love him for hating my project, which can only bring it more attention.\") There have been far-more-disgusting scripts by illiterate retards. But there's no question it's the writing that weighs down this project\u2014the film's surfaces are shimmering and vibrant, the pacing brisk, and the performances consistently strong (despite some strange casting choices: Jimmy Fallon as a Svengali-like impresario?). Sienna Miller literally shines as the enigmatic heiress\u2014like Angelina Jolie in the 1998 TV movie [Gia](http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/384953p-326717c.html), she invests a stock fallen-waif part with genuine pathos. The movie's best scene pits Warhol (movingly incarnated by Guy Pearce) and Dylan against each other in a junior-high-school-style showdown for the attentions of the popular girl. Dylan, invited to the Factory to film one of Warhol's \"screen tests,\" refuses to sit down to be filmed, and Warhol refuses to give him any direction at all. The resulting power struggle is both funny and painful, with each artist trying to out-\"I don't care\" the other as the eager-to-please Edie hovers in the background. It's a rare moment in which the movie has something to say about the constant small humiliations of the famous, and the desperate insecurity of those who depend on their favor.

Then an old man came and prayed. Scooter Libby is being sacrificed to protect Karl Rove. That is going to be a key part of Libby's defense, judging by his lawyer's opening statements today. Libby attorney Theodore Wells channeled his client, recalling a 2003 conversation between Libby and his boss, Vice President Dick Cheney, at the start of the leak investigation. \"They're trying to set me up. They want me to be the sacrificial lamb. ... I will not be sacrificed so Karl Rove can be protected.\" Cheney then scrawled a note to himself: \"Not going to protect one staffer and sacrifice the guy that was asked to stick his neck in the meat grinder.\" Libby had stuck his neck (probably his head, too) in the meat grinder by talking to reporters about prewar intelligence. Rove, or, as Wells called him, \"the person who was to be protected,\" was being shielded because he was \"the lifeblood of the Republican party\" and \"very important if [Republicans] were to stay in office.\" If Scooter Libby was sacrificed to save Karl Rove, then Scooter Libby is now returning the favor. How much this line of argument helps Scooter Libby in the courtroom will be up to the [12 members of the jury](http://www.slate.com/?id=2157695&entry/2158028/?nav=tap3) to decide, but it will certainly be a political problem for the president and his staff, who are already doing a lot of duck-and-cover drills. Bush has historically low approval ratings, a very unpopular Iraq strategy, and new domestic programs Democrats will ignore. Now they must deal with the fact that Rove, who is still organizing the president's strategy, engaged with others in the White House to sell out the vice president's chief of staff. The notion that Rove set up a colleague and that other White House officials worked to shield Bush's boy genius is a Democratic revenge fantasy come to life. How will the White House respond to such a charge from Libby, whom both the president and vice president have lauded in the highest terms? White House officials are likely to continue to play peekaboo\u2014refusing to talk about the case though it's under way, except when it serves administration interests. Cheney said on [Fox in early January](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,243632,00.html) that Libby was one of the most honest men he knew. Today marked the real start of the Libby case. After four days of jury selection, each side gave opening statements, and the first witness was called. Patrick Fitzgerald, the Chicago prosecutor, opened like a dime novelist. \"It's Sunday July 2003 just after the Fourth of July. The fireworks are over\u2014but a different kind of fireworks are about to begin.\" Fitzgerald spoke quickly throughout his hour and a half presentation. He wore a sturdy gray suit, white shirt, and sensible blue tie, upon which he had a microphone pinned. He paced before the jury, his fingers often in a steeple. The courtroom audience only saw his back and the pink yarmulke of baldness at the top of his head. Fitzgerald's case was linear and clean. Libby told investigators he learned about Valerie Plame from NBC News reporter Tim Russert. But Fitzgerald told jurors that was clearly a lie because Libby had already been discussing the matter inside and outside of the White House. Fitzgerald then went through a careful delineation of the 11 instances in which Scooter Libby discussed Valerie Plame's identity with administration officials and reporters. \"When the FBI and grand jury asked about what the defendant did,\" Fitzgerald said, \"he made up a story.\" To explain why Libby would be motivated to lie, Fitzgerald offered two main arguments. The first was that White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan had told the press that anyone involved in the business would be fired. If Libby was found to be the leaker, he'd lose his job, or at least cause a massive public embarrassment for the administration. The second motivation, Fitzgerald explained, was that Libby had promised Vice President Cheney he wasn't involved, and on that promise Cheney had gone to bat for him. In the October 2003 press swarm over the CIA leak, Libby asked Vice President Cheney to help clear his name in the press. Scott McClellan had told reporters Karl Rove was not involved in the leaking but had stopped there. Libby wanted McClellan to say specifically that Libby had also been cleared. He asked Cheney to make that happen. Cheney did, and in a subsequent briefing, McClellan said Libby was not involved in the affair. The Fitzgerald presentation was like a warm soak. Ted Wells' defense opening was a Rolfing. He was emotional and emphatic about his client, whom he said was \"wrongly, unjustly, and unfairly\" charged. Wells only needs to raise a reasonable doubt in the minds of jurors, and he did a very good job of it. He was a charismatic fog machine who challenged everything but the very nature of human existence. He was most effective picking apart the three reporters whose recollections contradict Libby's. He suggested that Tim Russert had the faulty memory. The host of Meet the Press says he didn't tell Libby about Wilson's wife because he didn't know about her status as a CIA employee, but Wells argued that Russert may have been in a position to have known. David Gregory, the NBC White House reporter who works with Russert, had been told by White House spokesman Ari Fleischer that Wilson's wife worked at the CIA. Wells argued that Gregory or his colleague Andrea Mitchell, who also claimed to know, would have passed this information on to Russert before he had his conversation with Libby. Wells pointed out that Matt Cooper, my former Time colleague, had extensive notes about his interview with Karl Rove, who passed along the information about Wilson's wife, but had no record of Libby's secondary role in confirming that information. To discredit Judith Miller, Wells relied on the former New York Times reporter's own testimony, in which she repeatedly referred to her bad memory, tendency to conflate events, and fuzziness about details. The government's case suggested Libby had been on the hunt for information about Wilson's wife after Wilson published an op-ed in the New York Times claiming he'd been sent to Niger to answer a question Cheney's office posed to the CIA about the sale of uranium yellowcake by Niger to Iraq. During that hunt, Libby engaged in eight separate conversations with colleagues about it. Wells didn't go after all eight conversations, but he picked apart several of them. Two of the people who had said they talked to Libby about Plame only remembered the conversations after prompting from investigators. Ari Fleischer's account of Libby was suspect because he had asked for immunity from the government. (This immunity deal is news: Presumably, Fleischer asked for it because he had disclosed Plame's CIA status to Gregory and thought he'd get in trouble.) \"All of these witnesses have their own personal recollection problems,\" he said. As his presentation wore on, Wells got his blood flowing. He got chatty and colloquial. \"Mr. Libby was a very busy man, but he wasn't stupid,\" he said. He threw around a lot of \"doggone\" this and \"doggone\" that. He described a sudden recollection by one witness \"like it came out of the sky, like a lightning bolt went into his head.\" He did impersonations: At one point, when characterizing the prosecution's narrative, he lapsed into \"white person,\" the highly nasal formal patois of the Caucasian diction teacher. He did a little Jewish: \"You want to talk about the week this guy was having?\" In a debate with Fitzgerald and the judge, he dismissed an opposing view by saying \"izzzzzitzzzzit.\" It sounded like a dying neon bulb and yet accurately conveyed his view that the argument was absurd. The case, which picks up again tomorrow with testimony from Mark Grossman, a former State Department official who discussed Plame's status with Libby, has opened a window into an administration that in 2003 was deeply at war with itself. The White House was at war with the vice president's office, and the vice president's office was at war with the CIA. Much of the spat was over 16 words uttered in the 2003 State of the Union address. Four years later tonight, Bush must give that annual speech again. You want a leak case? Here's a leak case: socialite-actress-producer for libel and slander for Hilton's alleged leak to Page Six of the New York Post. Hilton allegedly falsely reported that Graff had gone \"berserk\" at a London nightclub when she saw Hilton dancing to \"Copacabana\" with Graff's ex-boyfriend Paris Latsis. Hilton allegedly also reported that Graff tried to rip a $4 million diamond necklace off Hilton's neck, and that Graff, according to Hilton, is allegedly \"a woman who is older and losing her looks, and she's alone. She's very unhappy.\" Graff is in her mid-30s. But instead we have Scooter Libby and no tiny dancers. Yesterday's opening arguments supplied high drama\u2014 [Libby's claim](http://www.slate.com/id/2158157/) that he was hung out to dry so that Karl Rove could continue to work the levers of Bush's brain\u2014but today the trial gets down to the more mundane business of whether Scooter lied to investigators and the grand jury. In case you believed that trials are interesting, this morning's cross-examination of Marc Grossman\u2014the first prosecution witness, a former undersecretary of state who testified yesterday afternoon that he told Libby that Joseph Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, worked for the CIA\u2014would quickly disabuse you of that enthusiasm. Libby's attorney Ted Wells makes about 200 rapid-fire attempts to impeach Grossman's credibility, some of which are silly, and some of which result in bits of bloody tissue on Grossman's chin. I have never been a fan of defense efforts to make witnesses look stupid for failing to take notes or otherwise memorialize every conversation they had with anyone at any time, in anticipation of future litigation. So, Wells' relentless \"you have no notes/ you wrote no follow up/ you have not one piece of paper,\" says less about Grossman's credibility than it does about his rather healthy tendency to avoid thinking like a lawyer. But Wells scores points for either tenacity or truth when, after about 30 laps around the same mulberry bush, he gets Grossman to concede that what he told the FBI, the grand jury, and the Libby jurors about his conversations with Libby had \"changed\" over time. Wells also highlights Grossman's inconsistency about whether these meetings with Libby happened over the phone or face-to-face. He plants the seed with the jurors that Grossman's decision to meet with his boss, former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, the night immediately before Grossman was interviewed by the FBI in October 2003, was \"fishy\" and tantamount to \"cooking the books\"\u2014although Wells withdraws his original legal characterization of that meeting as \"monkey business.\" This morning's direct examination of the government's second witness, former Deputy CIA Director and \"Iraq Mission Manager\" Robert Grenier, goes pretty much along the same lines as yesterday's direct of Grossman. Grenier delivers a polished performance\u2014the former CIA deputy who looks like an anchorman. Grenier reveals how he came to tell Libby that Plame was Wilson's wife. According to Grenier, an \"aggrieved\" and \"slightly accusatory\" Scooter called him on June 11, 2003, wanting to know whether the CIA was responsible for sending Joe Wilson on his mission to Niger, and whether it was true that interest from the office of the vice president was the basis for the mission. According to Grenier, Libby was\u2014paraphrasing now\u2014freaking out about what Wilson was telling the press\u2014so much so that Libby couldn't wait for Grenier to call him back, but instead pulled him out of a late-afternoon meeting with then-CIA Director George Tenet, to find out whether he had learned anything since they spoke a few hours earlier. This was also when Grenier passed along the tidbit about Wilson being married to a CIA agent\u2014a bit of gossip about which Grenier later felt \"guilty.\" Grenier testifies on direct, and then later on cross, that he didn't mention the whole Plame thing in his FBI interview or his grand-jury testimony, but that months later he developed the \"growing conviction\" that he had indeed told Libby about it. As the defense characterizes it this afternoon, \"his memory grew.\" When confronted on cross with FBI reports that contradict his earlier testimony, he prefaces his remarks with: \"As a former CIA officer I have the greatest respect for the FBI. But the FBI officer who reported this may not have gotten it exactly right.\" The pressroom busts out laughing. Grenier, like Grossman, wriggles uneasily under defense questioning about his on-again/off-again memory. When asked whether his grand jury testimony was \"wrong\" he says, \"It was what I believed at the time.\" Then Grenier begins to pat at his pockets, in search of the eyeglasses he'd been wearing all afternoon. This goes on for so long that the judge calls for a break in which we watch the court being ransacked for the glasses. Doubtless, once his glasses are found, Grenier will remember where they were. The last witness of the day is Craig Schmall, Libby's morning intelligence briefer from the CIA. On direct examination, he describes how briefing books are organized and tabbed and then details the events of June 14, 2003, which included a visit to Libby's office by Tom Cruise and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz. He was \"very excited about it.\" When asked why the Cruise-Cruzes were visiting, Schmall relates that they were \"there to discuss with Libby how Germany treats Scientologists.\" No wonder Scooter can't recall anything else that happened that day! Schmall testifies about the Plame leak, including his concerns about the \"grave danger\" that might follow the disclosure of the name of a CIA officer that could lead to \"innocent people in foreign countries\" who could be \"arrested, tortured, or killed\" as the result of outing an agent. This elicits a stern caution from the judge that jurors not consider the matter of Plame's status as a CIA agent, or the dangers of leaking her identity: These issues are not before them. On cross, Schmall is questioned about whether he recalls that on June 14, the same day he and Libby discussed the Wilsons, he also briefed Libby about a bomb defused near a residential compound, a police arrest, a terrorist bombing in an unidentified country, explosions, extremist networks, a possible al-Qaida attack, Iraq's porous borders, violent demonstrations in Iran, and 11 other pages of terrorist threats. Schmall cannot recall. Then Schmall has a ride in the defense team's \"I forgot what I told the FBI and remembered it later\" machine. But he's still a good prosecution witness. He smiles when he says, \"I forgot.\" 9:23 a.m.: Scooter Libby arrives, walks up the courtroom aisle, and, before taking his seat at the defense table, gives a quick smile and nod to his wife in the front row. As we're waiting for the judge to arrive and call us to order, I glance around. This is a modest little room with a broken clock on the wall. The public seating section isn't full: Aside from the press, there's just a handful of spectators here\u2014including a vaguely syphilitic-looking older fellow, in jeans and a sweatshirt, who carries a stack of newspapers and constantly jots notes on a tiny memo pad. [The last time](http://www.slate.com/id/2115135/) I [covered a trial](http://www.slate.com/id/2117900/entry/2117904/), the defendant was Michael Jackson, and there was a lottery every morning for these public seats. Fans lined up by the hundreds sometimes for a chance to be in the same room as the King of Pop. Scooter Libby is apparently not quite the same draw. 9:30 a.m.: Judge Reggie Walton enters, we all rise, and at this point I notice a three-ring binder sitting on the prosecution table. Its spine reads: \"Ari FLEISCHER.\" Perhaps today will bring our first semi-celebrity witness? 9:33 a.m.: The defense continues its cross witness, Craig Schmall, Libby's CIA intelligence briefer. They're mostly clearing up odds and ends. After a few questions, there is some sort of technical dispute between the lawyers, and they approach the judge to confer out of earshot of the courtroom. For nearly half an hour, we patiently wait for them to wrap up. All I can think about is how many thousands of dollars this dead airtime is costing Libby (and the friends and supporters helping him to pay). Scooter's sitting idly at his defense table, surrounded by a legal team of at least seven people in suits. The clock is ticking. (Actually, it's not, because it's broken. But metaphorically, it is.) 11:23 a.m.: The government calls witness Cathie Martin, a blond Harvard Law School graduate (Class of '93) who succeeded Mary Matalin as the top press liaison for Vice President Cheney. Martin gives a behind-the-scenes account of how the whole Joe Wilson-yellowcake-Valerie Plame incident unfolded within Cheney's office. Martin's story begins with the Nicholas Kristof column that appeared in the New York Times in spring 2003\u2014and kicked off this whole sordid mess. The column alleged that Cheney's office had asked for an envoy to be sent to Niger (that envoy being Joe Wilson, though Kristof didn't name him) with the specific mission to hunt down evidence that Saddam Hussein had sought nuclear materials from Africa. This assertion threw Cheney's office into a tizzy because (according to Martin) it just wasn't true. Cheney had no idea who Wilson was, hadn't asked for any mission to Niger, and hadn't heard peep about the whole affair until he read Kristof. The story didn't go away, and Cheney and Libby became increasingly irritated. They determined that Wilson had in fact been sent to Niger by the CIA. So, Libby asked Martin to talk to an official at the agency, who in turn told Martin that Wilson's wife was a CIA employee. Martin says she soon after relayed this information to Libby and Cheney. And that, for the government, is the key detail of Martin's testimony. Here's someone in Libby's office (who worked with him every day and knew him well), saying she told Libby that Wilson's wife was a CIA worker. This directly contradicts Libby's assertion that he learned the information later, and from reporters. 1:14 p.m.: There's a break for lunch, and I stop by the men's room. On my way out, I pass prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald, who's walking in. It occurs to me that he's alone in there, maybe at the urinal, and that this could be my chance to accost him. I consider going back into the bathroom on some sort of ruse (I forgot to wash my hands?) but decide that the chance Fitzgerald will tell me something interesting is slightly outweighed by the risk that he'll call security. 2:31 p.m.: The defense begins cross-examining Martin. I can't see how it's helping them. Everything Martin says reinforces the notion that Libby (and Cheney) was deeply involved in the effort to rebut Joe Wilson. Cheney sat down with Martin and personally dictated talking points (he didn't know Wilson, he didn't ask for the mission to Niger, etc.) that he wanted emphasized to the press. Libby himself called at least one reporter to set the story straight. (\"I was aggravated that he was talking to the press, and I wasn't,\" says Martin, drawing a chuckle from the media representatives in the courtroom.) All of which casts doubt on the Libby defense team's contention that their man was too distracted by matters of great import to remember these piddling events. At one point the defense switches tacks and claims Libby was also distracted by matters of the heart. As the vice president's plane was landing at Andrews Air Force Base one Saturday, Cathie Martin asked Libby to stay at the base and make some quick phone calls before ending his workday. (Martin felt it was somewhat urgent that he reach out to Time's Matt Cooper and Newsweek's Evan Thomas.) In response to questioning by the defense, though, Martin acknowledges that Libby was irritated by the request\u2014because he was eager to get home for his son's birthday. 3:42 p.m.: A short break in the action. For the second time today, Libby leans back in his chair, turns around, and winks at his wife. 4:07 p.m.: Martin says she felt Hardball's Chris Matthews was saying things about Cheney that were \"somewhat outrageous.\" 4:46 p.m.: The jury\u2014and Martin\u2014has been dismissed for the day. It's time for a highly entertaining lawyer slap fight. It turns out Ari Fleischer will be the next witness, once court resumes Monday. (Damn, just missed him!) The defense team wants to note\u2014for the jury's benefit\u2014that Fleischer demanded immunity before he would agree to testify, because this might cast Fleischer's testimony in a different light. And here Fitzgerald makes a nice little chess move: Fine, he says, we can acknowledge that Fleischer sought immunity. As long as we explain why. Turns out Fleischer saw a story in the Washington Post suggesting that anyone who revealed Valerie Plame's identity might be subject to the death penalty. And he freaked. Of course, if Fleischer was this worked up about it during the time period in question, that suggests Libby would have been, too. (Which again undermines the notion that Libby had much bigger fish to fry.) Cue 20 minutes of lawyers whining about each other's conduct. Finally, the judge tells them to cool it. \"This is why I quit practicing,\" he says. \"Other lawyers kept accusing me of doing things I hadn't done.\" I wanted to raise my hand and ask, \"Your Honor, may I approach the bench?\" I was at the Scooter Libby trial to cover it, and all of a sudden, I found myself in the middle of the case. In his testimony today, former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told the courtroom\u2014which included me\u2014that when I was a White House correspondent for Time magazine, he had told me that Joe Wilson's wife worked at the CIA. He did? Everyone had heard about Robert Novak, Matt Cooper, and Judith Miller, the reporters who had received the Valerie Plame leak. But now Ari was saying I was in that club, too. I have a different memory. My recollection is that during a presidential trip to Africa in July 2003, Ari and another senior administration official had given me only hints. They told me to go inquire about who sent Wilson to Niger. As far as I can remember\u2014and I am pretty sure I would remember it\u2014neither of them ever told me that Wilson's wife worked at the CIA. [In a piece I wrote about a year ago](http://www.slate.com/id/2135554/), I figured that the very reason I'd never been subpoenaed in the case or questioned by any lawyers was that I'd been given only vague guidance and not the good stuff. So, what to do now that I'd heard Ari's testimony? Should I stand? Should I shout a question at Ari? Should I walk from the press section into the witness box? Call a press conference? Get a lawyer? Then, my picture was displayed on the big screen in the courtroom. The defense attorneys had put it up there to identify (and, apparently, punish) me. \"I believe that's Mr. Dickerson in the second row from the back of the courtroom,\" said someone. Mr. Dickerson didn't know who said it, because Mr. Dickerson was trying to make sense of a world suddenly turned upside down. (They used the [publicity photo](http://www.simonsays.com/content/destination.cfm?tab=1&pid=513134) from [my book](http://www.amazon.com/Her-Trail-Mother-Dickerson-Woman/dp/0743287835/ref=pd_sxp_f_pt/002-6852511-1229657?ie=UTF8). I like it on the book jacket, but blown up at such size, it transforms me into a guy who looks like his great ambition in life is to be a wristwatch model.) So, why was Ari testifying about something that I don't think ever happened? I don't know. Ari asked for immunity from prosecution based on the idea that he'd told me and David Gregory of NBC that Wilson's wife worked at the CIA, so Ari clearly believes he spilled the beans. But my memory is just the opposite. Could I have forgotten that Ari told me? I don't think so. Here's how I remember it: I had talked to Ari on July 11 and remember him telling me to investigate who sent Wilson. When I landed in Nigeria late that night, I found a few e-mails from Cooper. He was trying to get me to call him and wouldn't tell me why. I was a little irritated. I hadn't eaten, didn't trust the Nigerian food, and was [filing to the Web](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,463671,00.html) site and closing three stories, including a [long piece](http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,464417,00.html) for the European edition that would run on the cover in Africa. But then, when I talked to Cooper, I learned why he wanted to get me on the phone. He had talked to Karl Rove, and Rove had told him about Wilson's wife. (Cooper would talk to Libby the next day.) When I realized that, a light bulb went off in my head. I realized that was what Ari had been trying to point me toward in our earlier conversation. It made perfect sense: It immediately undermined Wilson's report by making his errand look at best like nepotism and at worst like busy work from a CIA spouse who needed to find errands for her househusband. If Ari had told me that Wilson's wife had sent him, Matt's news wouldn't have been new to me. I was not so tired that I lacked a competitive pang: Matt and I were working on the same story, and he had gotten the better dirt. If Ari had told me about the wife, I certainly would have quickly pointed out to Matt that he was only telling me something I already knew. (This is, after all, is my heritage. I grew up in Washington, where no one admits they don't know something.) So, how to explain Ari's testimony? I've covered him for 12 years, since I reported on tax policy and he was a spokesman for the Ways and Means committee, and he's never lied to me. Shaded, wiggled, and driven me around the bend with his spin, yes. ( [I wasn't a fan of his book, either](http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1039692,00.html).) But he never outright lied, and I don't see how it would be in his interest here. More likely, he admitted to prosecutors more than he may have actually done because better to err on the side of assuming he disclosed too much than assuming he gave over too little. How does Ari's testimony affect the perjury and obstruction of justice case against Libby? It certainly complicates it. For starters, when this piece appears, it may get me out of my press seat and into that uncomfortable little witness box. It hurts the prosecution if Ari admitted something he didn't do, because they're relying on his memory. Libby is on trial for saying he didn't know about Wilson's wife and that he learned it from NBC's Tim Russert. Fleischer contradicts that. He claims that Libby told him about Wilson's wife at a lunch in early July, long before Libby ever talked to Russert. If they can poke holes in Ari's recollection of what he told me, they can raise doubts about what Ari remembers Scooter telling him. But this isn't universally good news for the defense. Russert says he couldn't have told Libby about Wilson's wife, because he didn't know she worked for the CIA. The defense contends that Gregory might have told Russert about Plame following his conversation with Ari. But if Ari didn't tell Gregory and me about Plame, then Gregory couldn't have passed the information on to Russert. Only moments before Ari's surprise disclosure, I had been trying to figure out what my lede would be for today. I enjoyed seeing Ari have to answer questions under oath, which he never had to do in the White House briefing room. As a reporter, I'd always tried to put him in the witness box, and he always climbed out. Now he may have put me in there. Today, Scooter Libby's lawyer William Jeffress was so frustrated with Judy Miller I thought he'd yell liar, liar, pants on fire. The former New York Times reporter had presented detailed accounts of three conversations with Libby during the prosecution's questioning, but during the defense cross examination, she seemed incapable of remembering much of anything. Jeffress kept pressing her. \"Do you remember my question?\" he snapped at one point. Miller sighed. She apparently didn't. There are nine women on the jury. Scooter Libby's defense team better hope they don't have strong sisterhood feelings because Jeffress' thinly veiled condescension was enough to create sympathy for Miller. In Washington, that's like creating cold fusion. Miller's reporting on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has been renounced by her former paper. Her role in the Libby affair led to a very public spat that ended in her departure. But most of the members of the jury don't [know](http://www.slate.com/id/2138161/) [all](http://www.slate.com/id/2127240/) [of](http://www.slate.com/id/2095394/) [that](http://www.slate.com/id/2086110/). Only one, [a former Washington Post reporter](http://www.slate.com/id/2157695/entry/2157791/), is a news junkie. What the jury saw was a small woman in a black velvet jacket dabbing her runny nose with a tissue. Maureen Dowd [called her](http://select.nytimes.com/2005/10/22/opinion/22dowd.html) the Fourth Estate's Becky Sharp, but by the end of the day she was looking more like [Amelia Sedley](http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-158,pageNum-43.html). What prosecutors are trying to show with Miller's testimony, as they had with the previous six witnesses, is that Libby knew about the CIA ties of Valerie Plame, Joe Wilson's wife, well before his conversation with Tim Russert, which Libby said jogged his memory on the point. Two of the three conversations Miller had with Libby took place before his conversation with Russert. Miller recalled that at their first meeting Libby told her Wilson's wife worked in the \"bureau.\" She initially thought he meant the FBI, but \"through the context of the discussion, I quickly determined it to be the CIA.\" The key defense effort to undermine Miller zoomed in on that first meeting with Libby on June 23, 2003. On her original trip to the grand jury, wasn't she so fuzzy about the meeting that she forgot that it even took place? As the exchanges became testy, Miller called Jeffress \"sir\" more often. She insisted that rereading her notes (found in a bag under her desk after the grand jury appearance) \"bought back these memories\" of June 23. A main pillar of Libby's defense is that he was too busy to remember what he did and didn't know about the identity of Joe Wilson's wife. Miller, too, has depicted herself as too preoccupied to bother with such details. Libby's lawyers played a clip from her January 2006 appearance on the program Digital Age, in which Miller said, \"I had so much work in front of me ... all of this only became important after, when this whole thing blew up.\" This mirrors Libby's defense claim that his schedule muddled his memory almost exactly. The day ended as this trial always seems to, with lawyers from both sides bickering over procedural rules. Defense lawyers were trying to question Miller about her other sources. They didn't think she could name any and hoped by showing so in court they would further undermine her credibility. \"This is nothing more than classic 101 [impeachment](http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=901&bold),\" said Ted Wells, Libby's lead lawyer, arguing that the judge should give him leeway to pursue this line of questioning. Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald said Wells was on a fishing expedition. Wells shot back that he didn't think Miller had any sources. Fitzgerald came back so fast the judge told him to ease up. \"I apologize; I'll take a time out,\" said the prosecutor. Then he charged that Wells was trying to expand the questioning so broadly that it would include Bush's reason for going to war in Iraq. \"If that's going to be tried in this trial we've got to bring cots,\" Fitzgerald quipped. In a walk-on role, Washington superlawyer Bob Bennett, who represents Miller, took Fitzgerald's side. \"They're not going to get this gem they think they're going to get,\" he said of the defense, \"because she does have other sources.\" The judge cut off the debate with a gem of his own: \"I've got to get out of here.\" Judy and the bickering will continue tomorrow. My former Time colleague Matt Cooper took the stand Wednesday and faced what no journalist wants to\u2014a display of his notes and e-mails on a big TV screen. It's not just journalists who don't want this: I'm sure Scooter Libby doesn't like seeing his notes up there either. But for us, who obsess about crafting our final product, it's never pretty to look at the scraps we put into making it. So, while Cooper was mostly calm and measured, it was excruciating to watch him talk through the notes he took while talking on the phone with Scooter Libby on July 12, 2003. Cooper contends that he asked Libby if he knew Wilson's wife worked at the CIA, and that Libby answered, \"Yeah I've heard that, too,\" or words to that effect. Nowhere in his notes though, is there a reference to that exchange. The defense spent a great deal of time making Cooper go through the notes, deciphering the typos and explaining his style. Lawyer William Jeffress seized on a single sentence and started a line of inquiry that led to a moment that was part Perry Mason revelation, part Doug Henning magical illusion. The passage as it appeared in Cooper's typewritten notes read: \"had somethine and abou the Wilson thing and not sure if it's ever.\" Jeffress suggested this referred to Libby's answer to the question about Wilson's wife. Could Cooper really have meant to type: \"heard something about the Wilson thing and not sure if it's even true\"? That wasn't Cooper's recollection. So, Jeffress took him through notes he'd taken about other conversations and pointed out instances in which he'd dropped letters, so it was possible had could mean heard; he'd substituted an \"r\" when he meant to type an \"n,\" which would turn ever into even. (The excitement was building!) What about the \"and\" in Cooper's original sentence? Jeffress showed that Cooper often inserted the word \"and\" where it didn't belong, almost like a note-taking tick. It all seemed very promising and clever. And then Jeffress tried to turn the blank space in Cooper's notes into the word \"true.\" (Here, ladies and gentlemen, is the rabbit!) That's not evidence. It's magic. The defense team also suggested that Cooper had learned about Wilson's wife not just from administration officials but from me. [This isn't the case](http://www.slate.com/id/2135554/), and Cooper didn't say otherwise. But whenever Libby's lawyers tried to get more specific about my role, Fitzgerald objected. (I can't figure out why exactly.) The judge circumscribed the defense's inquiry into what I had told Cooper. (If you're sick of [me talking about me](http://www.slate.com/id/2158157/entry/2158492/) [and who isn't?], buy [Hubris](http://www.amazon.com/Hubris-Inside-Story-Scandal-Selling/dp/0307346811/sr=1-1/qid=1170299514/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-8383889-4979909?ie=UTF8&s=books) for another account.) In the end, Cooper said that I had relayed information to him on the phone from Africa, as I had. That information showed up in an exhibit Wednesday\u2014a July 11, 2003, e-mail written by Cooper that included the line \"Dickerson reports dissing of Wilson at his end.\" That is, almost verbatim, a line from a file I sent from Africa a few hours after talking to Cooper: \"On background WH officials were dissing Wilson. They suggested he was sent on his mission by a low level person at the agency.\" Jeffress was obsessed with the dissing idea, asking Cooper repeatedly if Libby had dissed Wilson in their phone conversation. (Later, we blessedly avoided such scrutiny of a reference to a \"pissing match\" in a file Cooper wrote.) Round and round Jeffress and Cooper went, trying to define the verb \"to diss\" and then arguing if it applied to Libby's remarks about Wilson. Libby's lawyer seemed to be trying to distance what he'd said from the \"dissing\" I'd reported. The defense had a point. In their July 12 phone call, Libby was offering Cooper a counterpoint to Wilson's report about Iraq's efforts to acquire uranium. Libby was trying to substantively argue against Wilson. If Libby had wanted to undermine Wilson further, he would have brought up Plame and her CIA status, as he allegedly did to Miller. Instead Cooper, not Libby, brought up Wilson's wife. Talking to me in Africa the day before, on the other hand, the administration was more aggressive, though on a slightly different tack. The two Bush officials I talked to said Wilson had been sent by a \"low-level\" person at the CIA, suggesting that Wilson's trip and he were unsanctioned and unserious. (This, to me, was \"dissing.\") Later that day, CIA Director George Tenet took a shot at Wilson's competence in his [statement taking responsibility](http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/07/11/sprj.irq.wmdspeech/index.html) for the famous botched 16 words in president Bush's 2005 State of the Union Address. After the defense team's cross examination, prosecutor Fitzgerald tried to bring Cooper back to the key question at issue, which was whether Libby told Cooper what Libby claimed he told him in his grand jury testimony. Before the grand jury, Libby said he told Cooper that he didn't know if Wilson had a wife or where she worked and that anything he knew he'd learned from other reporters. Cooper didn't have any of that in his notes. Today he said he didn't remember Libby saying any of it. It was fitting that Cooper's testimony followed Judith Miller's turn in the witness box. The two fought Fitzgerald's efforts to subpoena them together, invoking their First Amendment rights. At one point they shared a lawyer. They both lost, but there may be more constitutional fights. Defense lawyers announced that they are going to call Miller's former colleague, New York Times managing editor Jill Abramson. They expect her to resist appearing. They want Abramson to testify about whether in 2003 she blew off Miller's suggestion that the paper write about Joe Wilson, as Miller claims. Calling Abramson is presumably an effort to further impeach Miller. Her reputation has already taken a pretty good pounding. She continued to say \"I don't remember\" so often today you thought she might sing it once, for variety. 10:24 a.m.: Scooter Libby arrives and sits at his defense table, 10 feet in front of me. Having stared at the back of this man's head for hours on end last week, I've come to wonder: Who is this tiny, tiny fellow? Not more than 5-foot-7, to my eye. Sleek and slight like a kitten. Wears a digital watch with a Velcro band. Also wears a little beaded bracelet around his wrist. And writes [semiperverted novels set in 1903 Japan](http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/articles/051107ta_talk_collins). I admit it: You fascinate me, sir. 10:42 a.m.: Judge Walton arrives, but the jury is held out of the room as we engage in another lawyer slap fight. At issue this time: whether the jury should see videotapes of former White House Press Secretary Scott McLellan saying, in October 2003, to the assembled media hordes, that he had personally talked to Scooter Libby and that Libby was not involved in the leak of Valerie Plame's identity. (Note: Everyone agrees that McLellan did this only after being pressured by the vice president's office.) The defense doesn't want these tapes played (because the defense doesn't want to make anything easy for the prosecution). But prosecutor Fitzgerald argues that the tapes help us understand Libby's state of mind when, later that same month, he was questioned by FBI agents investigating the Plame leak. Fitzgerald figures that after McLellan was urged to go to bat for Libby, and McLellan dutifully went before the cameras to say that Libby was innocent (and also that whichever scoundrel had leaked would immediately be booted from the administration), well, Libby was \"locked in with his feet planted in cement.\" He couldn't possibly tell FBI agents, just days after McCllellan's performance, that he in fact was involved with the leak. It would mean making McLellan (and the White House) look silly, and also mean losing his job. Even without the fear of criminal proceedings hanging over his head, Libby had a motive to lie. Libby's team opposes the videotapes in part because they tend to undermine the defense's grand narrative that Libby was being \"scapegoated\" by the White House, and that the White House was protecting Karl Rove while sacrificing Libby. As Fitzgerald puts it: \"This rebuts the notion that the White House was throwing him [Libby] under the bus. Mr. McLellan was standing in front of the bus.\" In the end, the prosecution wins. The defense wins a small concession: McLellan's answers will be shown on video, but the press corps' questions to him will be read to the jury from transcripts. 12:34 p.m.: We break for lunch. The jury has still not been called into the courtroom. I eat a horrifically bad sandwich at a chain restaurant near the courthouse. 2:19 p.m.: The jurors are finally brought in, after almost four hours of twiddling their thumbs in a back room. Now the prosecution fires up the projector and\u2014oh look, it's Scott McClellan! I'd recognize that doughy, flustered face from a mile away. I get a little nostalgic watching him stutter awkwardly through his responses. In the video clips, and the transcripts read to the jury, McClellan answers questions about the leak of Valerie Plame's identity. Standing at the White House pressroom podium, speaking to reporters, McClellan says that \"no one wants to get to the bottom of this more than the president.\" (We'll take his word for that.) McClellan says that he personally talked to Karl Rove and Scooter Libby, just to be totally certain about it, and that they both assured him they were not involved. (Rove has since admitted he leaked to columnist Robert Novak; Libby is now on trial for allegedly lying about leaking.) McClellan says that if someone in the administration was involved, they will no longer be a part of the administration. (Libby did resign when he was indicted. But Rove just keeps on truckin'. He is currently the president's deputy chief of staff.) 2:53 p.m.: The government calls witness Deborah Bond. Or, as they refer to her, \"Agent Debbie Bond.\" (Which is almost as cool a name as Scooter Libby.) Bond is a 19-year veteran of the FBI. She has a severe, straight-lipped face; a locked-tight jaw; and graying hair, cropped even with her earlobes. She speaks in a Dragnet monotone. Bond was present for the FBI questioning of Libby in October and November 2003 (his grand jury appearance was later, in early 2004), and she's here to describe those sessions. She tells us that during the first questioning, Libby volunteered a handwritten note that he said he'd recently found in his files. This note recorded a telephone conversation Libby had with Cheney sometime around June 12 that year. During this talk, Cheney told Libby that Joe Wilson's wife (that is, Valerie Plame) worked at the CIA. Libby claimed to the FBI that he'd forgotten all about this conversation when he talked to Tim Russert a month later, on July 10, and thus was surprised when Russert told him that Wilson's wife worked at the agency. (Russert, meanwhile, is expected to testify next week that he never said boo about Plame, and that his discussion with Libby that day was in fact about the TV show Hardball.) Libby told the FBI that it was only later that he discovered his handwritten note and suddenly realized he'd heard about Plame from Dick Cheney long before he'd heard the same thing from Tim Russert. This is a tricky little part of the case that's hard to understand. Let's buy, just for the moment, the prosecution's theory that Libby is inventing a careful lie to tell the FBI agents. Then why would Libby want to rope Cheney into his story? Possible answers: 1) Libby knows the FBI will eventually discover the existence of this note, so he wants to explain it up front. 2) He doesn't want to force Cheney into telling lies to back him up, and he knows Cheney faces no danger over this conversation (because Cheney was just telling Libby something\u2014not leaking it to a reporter outside the administration). But why, if Libby readily admits that he first heard about Plame from Cheney (and even has the note to show it), would he want to tell the FBI (remember, we're still pretending that he's crafting a careful lie here) that he temporarily forgot about the Cheney thing and thus, in his mind, first learned about Plame from Tim Russert? Prosecutor Fitzgerald seems to be making the case that Libby was \"shifting his story from an official source to a non-official source,\" (ie, from Cheney to Russert). Libby couldn't be sure what Time reporter Matt Cooper would say (or not say) to investigators, but he had to assume that Cooper might tell them that Libby had confirmed Plame's identity to Cooper on July 12. (In this scenario, Libby is more confident, for some reason, that New York Times reporter Judy Miller will keep her mouth shut. Of course, as we know, Miller eventually yapped\u2014after serving jail time and getting the OK from Libby.) If Libby was confirming Plame's identity to Cooper based on Tim Russert saying \"all the reporters know\" about Plame, that's one thing. If he was confirming it based on Cheney having told him, that would be leaking. Whew. I'm dizzy now and have only the vaguest inkling that my scenario makes sense. No doubt various wild-eyed bloggers can take this ball and run with it. Or deflate it and kick it limply back in my face. 3:08 p.m.: Agent Bond says Libby claimed, under questioning, that he never discussed Valerie Plame with Judy Miller. (Miller's testimony earlier this week directly contradicted this assertion. Miller said she discussed Plame with Libby on multiple occasions.) 4:07 p.m.: The defense begins its cross examination of Agent Bond. It is mad contentious. At one point, Bond says Libby \"claimed\" he first learned about Plame from the vice president. Defense attorney Ted Wells takes issue with the word. \"You mean he 'said' it? He didn't use the word 'claim.'\" Bond sticks by her guns: \"It's what he claimed.\" With this, Scooter Libby's heretofore placid wife, who is sitting directly in front of me, turns her head away from the courtroom, shakes it in disbelief, frowns, and sighs. Meanwhile, the judge intervenes with a chuckle. \"Is that what he said?\" he asks Bond, trying to move things along. \"It's what he told us,\" says Bond, unwilling to completely back down. \"Did he also 'tell' you his name was Scooter Libby?\" asks Wells with a hint of sarcasm. \"It took us a long time to get him to tell us what his first initial meant,\" says Bond, drawing a laugh. \"He still won't tell me,\" says Wells. In August 2005, when [Newsweek](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8770112/site/newsweek/print/1/displaymode/1098/) reported the spread of a national methamphetamine \"epidemic\" in a cover story, I [wrote](http://www.slate.com/id/2123838/): The leading indicator that a national trend has peaked and has begun its downward trajectory is often its appearance on the cover of one of the newsweeklies. Last Friday, Jan. 26, the federal National Survey on Drug Use and Health released [results](http://oas.samhsa.gov/2k6/meth/meth.htm) from a survey that showed meth use had \"declined overall between 2002 and 2005\" and that the number of \"initiates\"\u2014 people using the drug for the first time in the 12 months before the survey\u2014had \"remained relatively stable between 2002 and 2004, but decreased between 2004 and 2005.\" (See the chart below for the NSDUH chart.) In other words, meth use was declining just as Newsweek started clawing itself bloody about the growing trend. Was I prescient or just lucky? I'd say \"prescient.\" One would guess that a decline in use and new use would be considered news\u2014good news, even. One would imagine that after publishing and broadcasting a steady stream of stories about the unstoppable meth ascendance that editors would have been eager to share the government's latest findings with readers. Alas, I can't find a single news story or television transcript in Nexis that reports the NSDUH measured meth decline. The only Nexis hit is of the US Fed News' publication of the agency's press release. Do we draw from this that reports of increased drug use are news, but reports of decreased drug use are not? We do, and we have for a long, long time. As long as I'm taking victory laps, let me quote my July 21, 2006, [column](http://www.slate.com/id/2146303/), \"Pfft Goes the Methedemic\": An iron law of journalism dictates that news of increased drug use goes onto Page One and at the top of broadcasts, but news of decreased drug use must be buried or ignored. A couple of caveats about the NSDUH survey. Measuring drug use is difficult because 1) drug users are considered criminals, and 2) law-breakers tend not to want to confess their crimes in surveys. That said, the NSDUH survey has relied on a consistent methodology since 2002, \"administering questionnaires to a representative sample of the population through face-to-face interviews at their place of residence.\" It may not be a perfect survey, but it's the survey we've got, and it's one of the surveys the press turns to when it's time to herald the increase in drug use. Maybe my press colleagues blew the NSDUH press release off because it came out a Friday which, according to press lore, is the day the government and corporations dump news they don't want reported, because they know reporters are in a rush to get home and start their weekend. If this press fable is really true, a newspaper or Web site should create a \"Friday Press Release\" column for Saturday morning editions or Friday postings. (Note to Weisberg: Why doesn't Slate start a \"Friday Press Release\" column? But please don't assign it to me, because I go home early on Fridays.) By design or accident, the press dropped the federal government's measurement of a decline in methamphetamine use down the memory hole. But still it's not too late for criminal-justice reporters, medicine reporters, and even culture reporters to bang on the NSDUH survey results. I'd even settle for an informed editorial, which shows how desperate I am. Any takers? Addendum, Feb. 2: Above, I wondered if it's only a press fable that bureaucrats use Friday press releases to \"hide\" inconvenient information. Indeed, it appears that they deliberately do so at the highest levels of government. Reader Theodore J. Sawchuck points to a Washington Post [column](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/25/AR2007012501951_pf.html) by Dana Milbank this morning that quotes Cathie Martin, former Cheney communications director, testifying in the Libby trial that her office dumped bad news on Fridays when she worked for the vice president. From Milbank's column: With a candor that is frowned upon at the White House, Martin explained the use of late-Friday statements. \"Fewer people pay attention to it late on Friday,\" she said. \"Fewer people pay attention when it's reported on Saturday.\" ****** If the New York Times finds itself short-staffed this Friday afternoon, I'll come over after I finish my shift at Slate and write the meth story for them.

The myth of the spat-upon Vietnam veteran refuses to die. Despite Jerry Lembcke's debunking [book](http://books.google.com/books?id=IJrzaNOjjzwC&dq=spitting+image+myth+memory+and+the+legacy+of+vietnam) from 1998, Spitting Image: Myth, Memory, and the Legacy of Vietnam, and my [best efforts](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#link) to publicize his work, the press continues to repeat the fables as fact. Earlier this month, Newsweek resuscitated the vet-spit myth in a dual [profile](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16501666/site/newsweek]) of John McCain and Chuck Hagel. Newsweek reports: \"Returning GIs were sometimes jeered and even spat upon in airports; they learned to change quickly into civilian clothes.\" Nexis teems with such allegations of spat-upon vets and even includes testimonials by those who claim to have been gobbed upon. But Lembcke\u2014a Vietnam vet himself\u2014cites his own research and that of other academics to assert that he has never uncovered a single news story documenting such an incident. Lembcke writes: If spitting on veterans had occurred all that frequently, surely some veteran or soldier would have called it to the attention of the press at the time. ... Indeed, we would imagine that news reporters would have been camping in the lobby of the San Francisco airport, cameras in hand, just waiting for a chance to record the real thing\u2014if, that is, they had any reason to believe that such incidents might occur. In researching the book, Lembcke found no news accounts or even claims from the late 1960s or early 1970s of vets getting spat at. He did, however, uncovered ample news stories about anti-war protesters receiving the saliva shower from anti-anti-war types. Then, starting around 1980, members of the Vietnam War generation began sharing the tales, which Lembcke calls \"urban myths.\" As with most urban myths, the details of the spat-upon vets vary slightly from telling to telling, while the basic story remains the same. The protester almost always ambushes the soldier in an airport (not uncommonly the San Francisco airport), after he's just flown back to the states from Asia. The soiled soldier either slinks away or does nothing. One of the early vet-spit stories appears in First Blood, the 1982 film that was the first of the Rambo stories. John Rambo, played by Sylvester Stallone, claims to have been spat upon by protesters at the airport when he returned from Vietnam. \"Protesting me. Spitting. Calling me baby killer,\" Rambo says. \"Who are they to protest me?\" Like other urban myths, the spit story gains power every time it's repeated and nobody challenges it. Repeated often enough, it finally sears itself into the minds of the writers and editors at Newsweek as fact. Now, it's possible that a Vietnam veteran was spat upon during the war years. Lembcke concedes as much because nobody can prove something never happened. Indeed, each time I write about the spit myth, my inbox overflows with e-mail from readers who claim that a spitting protester targeted them while they were in uniform. Or the e-mail writer claims it happened to a brother or a friend at the airport or bus station. I expect similar e-mails this time, and I will share with readers any account that comes with some sort of evidence\u2014such as a contemporaneous newspaper story or an arrest report\u2014that documents the sordid event. ****** My e-mail address is [slate.pressbox@gmail.com](mailto:slate.pressbox@gmail.com). (E-mail may be quoted by name unless the writer stipulates otherwise. Disclosure: Slate and Newsweek are owned by the Washington Post Co.) Slate's machine-built [RSS feed](http://www.slate.com/rss/feed.aspx?id=68090). A well-lawyered newspaper distinguishes itself by the way it writes around something. The Wall Street Journal's [opening coverage](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB116947215772783650-SDEea3G1JYlb7p8kEvxWghDEO4g_20070206.html?mod=blogs) of the corporate shake-up at Citigroup appeared in its Jan. 23 edition, where the paper noted the \"ouster\" of Citigroup executive Todd Thomson. The paper didn't explain exactly why Thomson had been ousted but allowed that it \"came amid internal tension over his judgment and expenses, including use of Citigroup's corporate jet, people familiar with the matter said.\" The next sentence offered an example of Thomson's bad-judgment jetting, reporting: On one business trip in November, for instance, Mr. Thomson flew with a group of Citigroup employees to China\u2014and left them there to make their own flight arrangements home, at the company's expense, while he flew back on the corporate jet with Maria Bartiromo, a CNBC correspondent, one of these people said. It's fair to assume that Thomson and Bartiromo flew back alone, even though the piece doesn't say so. It merely states that Thomson left behind the group with whom he flew to China. But by not overtly stating Thomson and Bartiromo's aloneness, the Journal has it both ways: It's not saying the two were romantically linked, and it's not saying they weren't. The Journal followed its Citigroup story the next day, Jan. 24, [reporting](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB116960799115885885-q6T3UCeFnLu8vJnTCukDHLWttn0_20070206.html?mod=blogs) that Thomson \"had used more than $5 million from his division's marketing budget to sponsor a new television program for the Sundance Channel.\" One of the program's hosts was to be Bartiromo. Deeper into the story, the Journal offers these two paragraphs (emphasis added): Inside the bank, Mr. Thomson's friendship with Ms. Bartiromo became an issue. When Mr. Druskin, then Citigroup's investment-banking chief, took his management team to a holiday dinner in 2005 at the ritzy Daniel restaurant, he spotted Mr. Thomson having dinner with the CNBC anchor [Bartiromo], according to people familiar with the situation. Word of the sighting spread through Citigroup the next day. A Citigroup spokeswoman says Mr. Druskin has no comment. In recent months, some Citigroup executives advised Mr. Thomson to reduce his contact with Ms. Bartiromo, a person familiar with the matter says. But he justified the outings as good for business because clients enjoyed access to the CNBC anchor, according to another person with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Thomson noted to associates that his unit was showing better growth than any other Citigroup businesses, this person says. Delineating a friendship that includes a trans-Pacific flight alone in a corporate jet, an apparently significant sighting in an expensive restaurant, and a dressing down in which a corporate executive is told to reduce his contact with his friend of the opposite sex, all but draws the doughnut and tosses the hot dog through it. On [Jan. 26](http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB116978688800288808-JlonRx7050wMBiaD9jj9aMU3X_U_20070202.html?mod=blogs), the Journal rehashes some of the Thomson-Bartiromo story, referring to their jet trip home from Asia, their \"friendship,\" and their \"relationship\" (twice). The story breaks new ground in reporting that Thomson tried and failed to get Bartiromo on his jet more than a year ago, while entertaining clients in Montana. You can almost hear the Journal reporters snicker when they write that CNBC insisted that any jet trips taken by Bartiromo \"fell under the 'source development' section of its code of ethics.\" Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more! Having dumped the compost, planted the seed, and fertilized and watered the earth, the Journal leaves it to nobody's imagination what species the flowering Thomson-Bartiromo friendship, relationship, and contact is without actually coming out and writing anything that 1) they can't prove and 2) invites a libel suit. This is the sort of copy a clever lawyer directs reporters to write when they \"know\" something but can't prove it. Leave it to the reader to assemble the meaning of the facts in their minds, the wise libel attorney tells his clients. The [Jan. 26](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/business/media/26maria.html?ex=1327467600&en=ece79cf23c7e2b29&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) New York Times also walks the cow around the barn by noting that both Thomson and Bartiromo are married. Or maybe I'm reading too much into both that story and the headline to David Carr's [Jan. 29](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/business/media/29carr.html?ex=1327726800&en=4a88761e6bf50166&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) column in the Times: \"Citigroup and CNBC Cozy Up.\" [Today](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16840015/site/newsweek/)'s Newsweek takes a more disingenuous approach than the Journal, employing the old trick of citing sources in no position to know the truth. \"The mainstream press is questioning Bartiromo's journalistic ethics,\" quoth Newsweek, \"while bloggers are insinuating that the Banker and the Anchor may have had more than just professional ties.\" Newsweek would never do anything so irresponsible as that! Is Newsweek reading the same Wall Street Journal I am? The most extensive mainstream coverage to appear is the Journal's, and it has brushed so many coats of innuendo onto the story that there's no need to cite blogger naughtiness to speculate about Thomson and Bartimoro's romance, or lack thereof. At least Britain's Private Eye magazine accepts responsibility for its own impiety whenever it wants to imply an unprintable intimate relationship by referring to a \"Ugandan discussion\" or \"Ugandan relations.\" (See the warring etymologies on [Usenet](http://groups.google.com/group/alt.usage.english/msg/cb3a007ffa58b5f5?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) and [UgandanDiscussions.co.uk](http://www.ugandandiscussions.co.uk/why.php).) Sometimes reporters write around the subject they want you to pick up on. Other times they just buzz over the subject, as did three top Washington Post reporters on Jan. 10, 1989. Their tiny story\u2014just 245 words\u2014announced that Jennifer Fitzgerald was about to be appointed chief of protocol by the new administration. As you may recall, it was widely rumored during the 1988 presidential campaign that Fitzgerald had gone Ugandan with Vice President George Bush, for whom she had worked many years. The rumors were without foundation, as the late Ann Devroy, one of the three authors of the infamous Post story, would acknowledge in 1992 to the Post's Howard Kurtz. \"I spent two solid months looking into this in the early 1980s and I never found any evidence of it,\" said Devroy, who worked for Gannett News Service in those years. No evidence, but plenty of room for innuendo. Devroy's collaborators were Maralee Schwartz and current NewsHour senior correspondent Gwen Ifill, and their lede reads (emphasis added): Jennifer Fitzgerald, who has served President-elect George Bush in a variety of positions, most recently running the vice presidential Senate offices, is expected to be named deputy chief of protocol in the new administration, sources said yesterday. Whether Thomson and Bartiromo were getting it on, I can't tell you. Neither, despite their elbow nudges, can the Journal or Newsweek. ****** Innuendo and out the other: Send your favorite examples to [slate.pressbox@gmail.com](mailto:slate.pressbox@gmail.com).

Slate's machine-built [RSS feed](http://www.slate.com/rss/feed.aspx?id=68090). Polish nonfiction writer Ryszard Kapuciski [died last week](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/24/AR2007012402233.html) at age 74. Many considered him the quintessential foreign correspondent, and his allegorical books about the wars and revolutions he witnessed stand out as exemplars of the genre. Still, his critics [are often troubled](http://www.slate.com/id/2158315/) by the fact that he made up some of the details in his books. In a 2003 \"Culturebox\" column, reprinted below, Meghan O'Rourke defended literary journalists\u2014including Kapuciski\u2014who bend the rules of literal truth-telling in order to tell a bigger story: \"After all, unlike newspaper stories, literary journalism seeks to make or 'conjure up' a broader reality\u2014to bring us into a world. This isn't news of the who-what-when-how-why variety, but news of the kind that V.S. Naipaul said only the novel can deliver\u2014news that resonates with the potency of its presentation. Strictly segregating fact from fiction hobbles literary journalists unnecessarily.\" Joseph Mitchell's Old Mr. Flood is a great book. It's as vivid a portrait of the Fulton Fish Market and of working-class life in New York City as any we have. Old Mr. Flood is also partly invented. Though it was first presented as journalism\u2014most of it ran as magazine pieces in The New Yorker in 1944\u2014Mitchell revealed in the book's preface some four years later that Mr. Flood was a composite character, as Jack Shafer recently [noted](http://www.slate.com/id/2084316/) in Slate. With the reappearance of Stephen Glass and the dismissal of Jayson Blair, a certain kind of rule-bending literary journalism has taken it on the chin. Mitchell and other respected sometime-\"fabulists\"\u2014including A.J. Liebling and Ryszard Kapuscinski\u2014have been lightly tarred and feathered along with the black-listed young journalists. After all, the argument goes, the realms of Fact and Fiction are diametrically opposed. There is no truth but the plain truth. The very currency of journalism is fact; to toy with it once is to devalue it (and your integrity) permanently, whether you are a great stylist or a hack. This line of reasoning is entirely logical. And yet too rigid an adherence to such standards would mean an impoverishment of American journalism\u2014one that seems unthinkable. There'd be no Old Mr. Flood, no The Honest Rainmaker, by A.J. Liebling; some work by New Journalists like Tom Wolfe, Gay Talese, and Norman Mailer would go in the trash. John Hersey is said to have created a composite character in a Life magazine story; does this mean we should think differently of his masterpiece Hiroshima? Of course, no one wants to encourage budding Jayson Blairs. There is a line between aesthetic enhancement and outright fabrication; what's at stake here is something closer to judicious manipulation of fact than to Stephen Glass' invention-stews. Newspaper journalism always ought to be thoroughly factual. (H.L. Mencken's fabrications in the Baltimore Herald, for example, are indefensible.) And in an ideal world any partly invented magazine story would come with a warning attached, as did Tom Junod's controversial profile of Michael Stipe in Esquire in 2001. But the combination of fictional technique and factual reporting can get at something that factual reporting on its own can't (even if it is dangerously tricky to regulate). If it didn't, the practice, dating back at least to Daniel Defoe's Journal of a Plague Year (1722), would surely have been squelched by the power of the ethical argument against it. But can we defend such practice in theory? To buy any defense of Mitchell, you have to accept the controversial but oft-repeated claim that there's aesthetic value in a \"truthfulness\" that's not strictly factual. Gay Talese explained the storytelling liberties of New Journalism by saying it \"seeks a larger truth.\" Alastair Reid, who used composite characters in pieces for The New Yorker, said, \"There is a truth that is harder to get at ... than the truth yielded by fact.\" Mitchell wrote in his preface to Old Mr. Flood, \"I wanted these stories to be truthful rather than factual, but they are solidly based on facts.\" Unsurprisingly, this larger-truth defense smacks of pretension in the eyes of the anti-fabulists, who see it as a shameless attempt to \"have it both ways.\" In part, I suspect, they hear \"larger\" truth as \"higher\" truth\u2014whereas what Mitchell is talking about is a formal distinction, not a qualitative one. Implicit in his statement is the argument that Truman Capote and New Journalists like Tom Wolfe later made in the '60s: that narrative journalism, like fiction, needs to avail itself of all possible rhetorical techniques\u2014including inhabiting the minds of characters\u2014for the purpose of storytelling. Indeed, there are times when the license of fiction, sparingly employed in the service of nonfiction, results in a great book with no negative effects on the lives of those involved. Old Mr. Flood seems precisely such a book. For one thing, no one real person is defamed in Mitchell's composite of Flood (unlike Stephen Glass' untruths about Vernon Jordan). Nor does Mitchell's use of a composite detract from the realism of Old Mr. Flood's compassionate, elegant, reportorial portrait of the Fulton Fish Market. Like a novelist, Mitchell takes license with dialogue in order to dispense with some of the ancillary randomness that is part of everyday life and arrive at a more highly stylized portrait. The quotes in the Old Mr. Flood are models of eloquent compression, such as you rarely find in real life and usually find in fiction. The point? To create a work that provides more aesthetic pleasure than a less highly wrought one, a distillation that makes us feel something essential about the world described, and thus has a greater chance of being remembered, read, used. After all, unlike newspaper stories, literary journalism seeks to make or \"conjure up\" a broader reality\u2014to bring us into a world. This isn't news of the who-what-when-how-why variety, but news of the kind that V.S. Naipaul said only the novel can deliver\u2014news that resonates with the potency of its presentation. Strictly segregating fact from fiction hobbles literary journalists unnecessarily. Where fiction is an inclusive genre, one that allows for its conventions to be violated, journalism relies on a system of conventions intended to guarantee objectivity. But clearly even these conventions don't make for pure objectivity, which from the start compromises the sanctity of the fact/fiction opposition. (Consider recent studies suggesting that firsthand witnesses often remember events differently, calling into question the reliability of some journalistic witnesses.) Fine, you might say; the use of storytelling technique is important to journalism. But why extend that to inventing dialogue or deceptively conflating characters? Because everyday speech and the limitations of reporting a story don't lend themselves to the kind of compression of narrative, image, insight, event, and character that Mitchell, Liebling, and, say, Ryszard Kapuscinski have been able to get down on the page. This does lead to complicated, messy questions. Take Kapuscinski's The Emperor. A chronicle of the last years of Haile Selassie's dictatorship in Ethiopia, The Emperor is a deeply memorable mythopoetic vision of absolute power; novelists like Rick Moody gush about it. The Emperor is also full of inaccuracies about Ethiopia. Some appear to be intentional, surreal exaggerations; others seem simply like sloppy reporting. After the book's publication, many readers were [understandably indignant](http://www.richardwebster.net/johnryle.html) that these inaccuracies might be accepted as historical fact. Nevertheless, The Emperor succeeds in depicting Selassie's corruption with a rich concentration that transforms it to near-allegory\u2014as Kapuscinski now belatedly suggests he intended it to be read. So, the salient question is: Why didn't Kapuscinski simply publish The Emperor as a fact-fiction hybrid, with a prefatory note? Why didn't Mitchell append a note to the Old Mr. Flood stories in The New Yorker? It's possible that our fixation on fact as highest good and on maintaining the antipodes of journalism and fiction has created a problematically rigid division of genres\u2014one that may encourage writers to lie (and then later come out of the closet, sheepishly, as genre-benders). Understandably, we think we value magazine pieces and nonfiction for their factual truth. But surely the impact of literary journalism derives in part from aesthetic intelligence and authoritative vision. Mitchell's Old Mr. Flood is a world you want to read about not because it's utter fantasy but because it seems real\u2014in fact, it's a world that seems more real, more pressing in its moral accounting than those you find in many well-documented but dull examples of magazine journalism. So, perhaps the problem is partly that our culture has no label for this kind of work, and that, systematizing creatures that we are, we need labels. Maybe we even need a new magazine genre, somewhere [between fact and fiction](http://www.slate.com/id/2086286/sidebar/2086304/). As for how and when it ought to be used, the only way to determine the answer would be on a case by case basis; in large part it depends on how worthwhile the result is. A system that asks writers to evaluate their own self-worth (in advance) is not a simple one; take the fact that Truman Capote's rigorous notion of a factually accurate nonfiction novel has quickly given way to a less well-enforced sub-genre, one example of which is Maria Flook's new book about Christa Worthington, a journalist murdered on Cape Cod in 2002. But such a system is theoretically feasible: Fiction writers pillage the lives of friends all the time; we tend to shrug off the negative consequences when the result is Saul Bellow's Herzog or a Robert Lowell poem. Certainly when in doubt, a journalist should assume it's not OK to take licenses like those described here; they're tools to be used rarely. But let's not take Mitchell off the syllabi because other writers lack his judiciousness and talent. Citigroup executive Todd Thomson [resigned](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16840015/site/newsweek/) last week amid a cloud of scandal-sniffing from news media and bloggers over Thomson's mysterious relationship with business-news fixture Maria Bartiromo. One particular episode seems to have gotten Thomson in trouble: When traveling from China back to New York, he reportedly bumped Citigroup colleagues from a company jet so he could fly home privately with Bartiromo. His colleagues\u2014o, the horror!\u2014had to fly commercial. A 2004 \"Moneybox\" by Daniel Gross, reproduced below, explains why private jets are often so prominent in corporate scandals. The trials of [Martha Stewart](http://www.slate.com/id/2093610/), former Tyco executives Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz, and Adelphia's Rigas clan have shown conclusively that, yes, the rich are different than you and me. They spend thousands of dollars on shower curtains. They get early stock tips. And they don't fly commercial. The trials have confirmed that the most important perk of all, the perk that really separates them from us, is the private jet. Private aircraft have played a role in virtually every recent story of corporate entitlement and corruption. While her jet was refueling in Texas en route to a Mexican resort, Martha Stewart made a fateful phone call to Douglas Faneuil, which was [apparently overheard by her friend, Mariana Pasternak](http://www.slate.com/id/2094441/entry/2095800/). Jurors in the Tyco trial learned that executives cruised around the country in the company's 13-plane air force. And just when jurors in the Rigas trial get over their outrage about one private jet excess, the prosecutors bring up another. So far, jurors have learned that: Perhaps prosecutors are focusing on the use of jets because it is the privilege most likely to stir up resentment among juries. It's even more infuriating than accounting chicanery or $2 million birthday parties in Sardinia. Most jurors couldn't fathom having\u2014or wanting\u2014a $6,000 shower curtain. But many of them probably have endured the hellish experience of flying Delta out of La Guardia airport. [Hopping a Gulfstream IV out of Teterboro](http://www.panynj.gov/aviation/tetframe.HTM) is something very few jurors have done but that all of them would surely want to. They appreciate that executives might be so attached to this perk that they would commit fraud to keep it. Wouldn't you commit a crime to avoid waiting in another Southwest check-in line? Prosecutors may also recognize that the private jet has been a key, perhaps the key, to the creation of an elite executive class. Time was, flying on a plane was a democratic experience. CEOs could do no better than first class. Today, when salespeople who log tons of frequent-flyer miles routinely fly in the front rows, first class is second class. And even if you're seated in first class, you still have to endure the indignity of removing your shoes and belt in public. Commercial flyers\u2014no matter how wealthy they are\u2014remain tethered to airline schedules, are subject to inevitable delays, and assume the risk of being seated next to screaming babies. By contrast, flying on private jets is a breeze. You drive directly onto the tarmac at an uncrowded aviation field and leave when it suits you. Delays? There are no delays. And of course, it's safer, or that's what executives pretend. In the wake of 9/11, companies have tended to justify the use of private aircraft by top executives on security grounds. Once you've gone private, it's very difficult to go back. Such is the allure of private planes that not even Warren Buffett, the famously frugal founder of Berkshire Hathaway, could resist. He enjoyed his experience with the fractional jet ownership company [NetJets](http://www.netjets.com/) so much, he bought the company. There's no evidence that Peta Wilson succumbed to Tim Rigas' charms because of the size of his plane. Business journalists are more easily seduced. The classic Fortune or Business Week CEO puffer starts with the reporter sitting on the corporate jet with Carly Fiorina or [Buffett](http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_27/b3636001.htm). Offering the plane ride is a brilliant move by public relations executives. Journalists are more excited about logging a few hours on the jet than with logging a few hours of face-time with the boss. For executives, flying off the grid has become a major obsession. Former Tyco CEO Kozlowski may not have known his own Social Security number, or how many options he received in 2001. But had he been called to testify, Kozlowski surely could have rattled off every plane in Tyco's fleet. Perhaps the most telling anecdote about private jets comes from the best of the books about Enron, [The Smartest Guys in the Room](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=1591840082&itm=1). It finds Enron Chairman Ken Lay working intently in his office. Enron's stock is plummeting. Serious questions are being raised about Enron's viability. And what is Lay doing? He is carefully examining fabric swatches for Enron's newest plane. Lay may plausibly claim to have known nothing of the Raptor partnerships that torpedoed the company he built. But nobody\u2014nobody\u2014will ever accuse Lay of not knowing if the plane's interior was brown leather or black. Veterinarians euthanized champion racehorse Barbaro this morning, eight months after he broke his leg in the Preakness Stakes last spring. In a \"Highbrow\" column written after his initial injury, and reproduced below, Meghan O'Rourke asked why Americans connected so strongly to his story\u2014and showed that horses have historically caught the country's attention in times of national turmoil. (To read an explanation of why a broken leg is so dangerous to a horse, click [here](http://www.slate.com/id/2142159/).) After the breakdown of Barbaro in the Preakness Stakes the other week, an astounding outpouring of emotion deluged the pages of newspapers and newsmagazines across the country. \"Brave Barbaro, His Owners Must Love Him,\" proclaimed the Wall Street Journal. \"Now's a Time for Healing, for Barbaro and for Matz,\" noted the New York Times, staunchly. An op-ed writer for the Times offered up a ponderous, if accurate, rationale for why Americans feel so strongly about a horse most had never heard of until a few weeks earlier: Horseracing is dangerous, and so we feel cruel when these \"wordless creatures\" hurt themselves for our entertainment. Well, yes. But horses\u2014even famous horses, like Go for Wand\u2014break down all the time while racing. What that columnist and other essayists have failed to answer is a deeper question: Why this horse, and why with this much feeling? There's one potential factor that no one has pointed to: Americans have historically become preoccupied with horseracing in times of national strain. The last time we saw this much interest in the sport, my father recently pointed out to me, was during the Watergate era, when two horses, Ruffian and Secretariat, seized the public imagination. [Ruffian](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345450000/) was the game front-running 3-year-old filly who broke down in a match race with Foolish Pleasure and had to be put down. The year was 1975. Patty Hearst had been kidnapped the previous summer. The fall of Saigon took place in April. Only a few years earlier, the Watergate scandal had begun; America had pulled out of Vietnam; and Palestinian terrorists had attacked and killed 11 Israeli athletes at the Olympics in Munich. Against this backdrop of recent unrest, Ruffian was seen as a beacon of hope when she won the Fillies' Triple Crown. Her dominance led sportswriter Pete Axthelm to write, \"Horseplayers are beginning to wonder if this year's leading three-year-olds are involved in a battle for a racing championship or a national election campaign. ... [T]he candidate with the real charisma\u2014the people's choice who has inspired the current bidding war between racetracks\u2014is the magnificent filly Ruffian.\" Ruffian liked to run in the front, and her mettle reminded Americans (or at least American sportswriters) that idealism wasn't a lost cause. More interestingly, sportswriters turned Ruffian into the embodiment of anxious contemporary debates about civil rights and women's rights (one piece about her was called \"Fillies' Lib\"). Remembering her after her death, Axthelm wrote, \"She was big, black and beautiful. She had raced ten times and never for a single stride had she been second best.\" Likewise, in 1973, Secretariat was put on Time's [cover](http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19730611,00.html) after winning the Belmont; beside him was the text \"Super Horse,\" as if, like the caped superhero, he could save Americans from the muck of Watergate. Tellingly, America's other most beloved horse, Seabiscuit, came to the nation's attention during the Great Depression. A scrawny, small colt, Seabiscuit lost dozens of races as a 2-year-old before finding his racing legs\u2014and the right jockey and trainer, a washed-up duo who believed in him\u2014in 1936. When he began to win and win like there was no tomorrow, he swiftly became an iconic figure for down-on-their-luck workers. [After](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/) suffering a series of sidelining injuries, Seabiscuit was matched against the perfectly proportioned and sleek-muscled [*](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#correction) War Admiral\u2014a Triple Crown-winning F-16 of a horse. As Laura Hillenbrand elegantly captured in [Seabiscuit: An American Legend](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0449005615/), the match, which Seabiscuit won, became an incarnation, in the public eye, of starving families' fight to survive. Seabiscuit enjoyed a level of fame that seemed unprecedented for a horse. When he once raced in Tijuana, Mexico, thousands of Americans crossed the border to see him, inverting the normal flow of exchange. In 1938, Walter Winchell named Seabiscuit one of the Top 10 \"newsmakers of the year,\" along with Franklin Roosevelt. Of course, when a Kentucky Derby winner like Barbaro suffers a public injury in a major televised event like the Preakness, our sympathy is surely magnified. (A filly who'd won only one race died last week at Belmont, the New York Times reported, and little noise was made about it.) Even so, his injury seems to have taken on a surprising significance to scores of adults. When the star filly Go for Wand broke down in the stretch of the Breeder's Cup Distaff in 1990, it was enormously distressing to those in attendance and watching on TV (I was there, and I wrote about it [here](http://www.slate.com/id/2100554/)). But her injury didn't cause the level of national response that Barbaro's injury has, even though racing's danger to horses was as real then as it is now. The [e-mails](http://www.vet.upenn.edu/barbaro/messageboard.php) piling up at the veterinary hospital where Barbaro is in recovery express more than a public sense that horseracing's costs are too high. They reflect a national desire to rally around something uncomplicated\u2014a hurt horse we're trying, with our love, to heal. (\"Barbaro, a Nation Turns Its Sad Eyes to You,\" one letter headline in the Times read.) Several of the many letters penned to Barbaro put it more bluntly: \"Barbaro, you are the hero America needs\u2014keep up the good healing\u2014God bless all those taking care of you.\" (That this letter was purportedly penned by a \"canine\" friend only underscores the phenomenon.) When I asked Laura Hillenbrand what she made of the deluge of attention, she wrote, by e-mail, \"Perhaps America has become so wrapped up in Barbaro's struggle to survive because, in a time in which we are seeing so much loss in the world, we have a much greater need to see someone pull through. ... Perhaps, if this one animal survives, we will feel less helpless, and feel that there is some justice. I think that's why millions of people, many of whom had never heard of Barbaro before the Preakness, are hanging on every report out of the hospital where the horse is fighting for his life.\" Politicians are always trying to figure out how to unite Americans, how to heal the divisive animosity citizens persist in feeling toward one another. Well, the response to Barbaro suggests that it doesn't take a village. It takes a horse. Preferably a fast one.

( [Return](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#return) to the corrected sentence.)

Now look what's happened: In just [6,000 years](http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/ussher.htm), we've abandoned their sensible eating habits for a high-fat, sugar-loaded diet, and turned ourselves into a nation of lard-asses. Goodbye Garden of Eden; hello [Olive Garden](http://www.olivegarden.com/press/news_releases/2006/20060816.asp). Whence our fall from grace? According to Michael Pollan's [essay](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28nutritionism.t.html?ei=5087&em=&en=ce28063f61d4a925&ex=1170219600&pagewanted=all) in last Sunday's New York Times Magazine, the serpent wears a lab coat. For decades scientists have been analyzing the food we eat, breaking it down into component parts, and studying how each nutrient affects our health in controlled conditions. More often than not, the \"expert advice\" that emerged from this work did more harm than good, it seems. When the government told us to eat more low-fat foods, we ended up binging on carbs. We bought margarine when the gurus told us to avoid saturated fats; now city governments are telling us that margarine is [against the law](http://www.bantransfats.com/). Well-intentioned blunders like these have crowded out the ancient wisdom that once guided our culinary habits, Pollan argues. Blame the scientists. They \"need individual variables they can isolate,\" Pollan explains. \"Yet even the simplest food is a hopelessly complex thing to study, a virtual wilderness of chemical compounds, many of which exist in complex and dynamic relation to one another, and all of which together are in the process of changing from one state to another.\" We'll never understand the biology of eating because it's just too hard to study in the lab. Large-scale clinical investigations won't be much help, either: There's no good way to observe or control how people eat; when doctors ask us about our diets we either misremember or make up stuff. That much may be true, but it doesn't mean there's an inherent flaw in the scientific method. An optimist would say the worst years are behind us. Sure, we've made a few mistakes, but the science is getting stronger every day. Just as the discovery of vitamins made it easier to treat [beriberi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beriberi) and [scurvy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scurvy), so will the latest research eventually help us to vanquish coronary heart disease and diabetes. That's how science works: You keep plugging away in the lab until you finally get somewhere. It would help me to accept Pollan's claim to the contrary if I could think of any other topic in the universe so complicated that it defies scientific investigation. Yes, there's a lot to consider when you're looking at nutrition. But is climatology any easier? Should we throw up our hands at the idea of studying global warming, simply because it reflects a wilderness of variables in complex and dynamic relation to one another? Once we might have charged psychology with the same crimes here ascribed to nutrition: The mind is too complex, and individuals too unreliable, for us ever to understand what goes on inside our heads. But surely we've now seen the benefits of opening the [black box](http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/Ethology/skinner.htm)\u2014and tinkering around with the [100 billion neurons](http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/facts.html) of the human brain. Pollan presents the food scientist as a reductionist bogeyman, trampling willy-nilly over the delicate complexities of the natural world. (The illustrations assigned to his article convey dread at the notion that a fruit might be reduced\u2014gasp\u2014to its [constituent parts](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/23/magazine/28meals.600.jpg).) It's a dangerous path, he argues, since those complexities have kept us alive over the course of human history. We don't have to identify which of the three-dozen antioxidants in a sprig of thyme, for example, will protect us from cancer; if we've always been eating fruits and vegetables, then they must be good for us. It's natural selection of the human diet: Thousands of years of trial and error must have pushed us toward increasingly wholesome foods. Any unhealthy eating habits would have gone extinct along the way. Why toss out these extraordinary evolutionary data in favor of a few decades' worth of lab experiments? But Pollan's nutritional Darwinism only makes sense if the selection pressures of the distant past were in perfect alignment with the health concerns of today. In other words, our food culture would have evolved to protect us from cancer, heart disease, and obesity only if those maladies had been a primary threat to reproduction in the ancient world. It's hard to imagine that the risks posed by these so-called \" [diseases of affluence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diseases_of_affluence)\"\u2014which often strike late in life, after we've had babies\u2014would have been as significant to our [fast-living, sickly forebears](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/health/30age.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5070&en=d47c1c15524d3ed0&ex=1170392400) as the dangers of, say, bacterial infections or the occasional drought. Indeed, for much of human history, natural selection might well have traded off the dangers of morbid obesity to mitigate the risk of starvation. There's just no way to know how the ancient culinary traditions will fare in the modern world until we try them. Modern nutrition may be more of an ideology than a science, but so is Pollan's nutritional Darwinism. The two ideologies stand in direct opposition to one another, with the science-minded progressives on one side and the culinary conservatives on the other. The Darwinists reject the idea that lab science can be used to engineer public health on a massive scale. They rely instead on the time-tested mores that have always been our guides. Pollan's reflections on the diet revolution could be an homage to Edmund Burke: Our radical eating habits have produced a [swinish multitude](http://www.bartleby.com/24/3/6.html#txt1). A conservative approach to eating seems very straightforward, which gives it an enormous appeal. We'd be healthier, Pollan argues, if we just stopped thinking and worrying so much about food and let nature take its course. (He takes several opportunities to congratulate the svelte, chain-smoking French for their pleasure-based cuisine.) But there's no reason to believe that nutritional Darwinism will give us any more clarity on its own terms. Health gurus routinely use the same language of ancient culinary traditions to sell fad diets that would make Pollan cringe. Barry Sears, author of the low-carb [Zone diet](http://www.zoneliving.com/), suggests a return to the traditional food culture of the \" [Neo-Paleolithic](http://www.sloandietworkshop.org/abstracts/sears_abstract.htm)\" period, when caveman \"decathletes\" consumed large amounts of meat and very little grain. In his version, we bungled up the natural selection of foodstuffs when we invented agriculture. Pollan says that happened during the Industrial Revolution. Two evolutionary stories offer very different nutritional advice. How can we know who's right? If we had only the rhetoric of natural selection to go by, we'd never know for sure. Lucky for us, humans have gradually developed the means\u2014over centuries of cultural evolution, no less\u2014to evaluate one claim against another on the basis of objective facts. For all its foibles, food science has given us a reliable set of data on what works and what doesn't. As Ben Goldacre [points out](http://www.badscience.net/?p=352) in the New Statesman, solid epidemiological work has validated the standard advice we get from our doctors: Exercise more and eat your fruits and vegetables. Pollan cites the same scientific research to support what he describes as his \"flagrantly unscientific\" diet plan: \"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" I'm happy to follow those dicta if they'll help me to live a longer, happier life. But that doesn't mean I have to buy into the misleading, great-great-grandma-knew-best philosophy that spawned them. I'd rather stick to the science, warts and all. When it comes to consumer electronics, I dream big and buy small. My fantasy living room features a wall of [103-inch plasma screens](http://ces.engadget.com/2006/01/06/give-them-an-inch-matsushita-ups-the-ante-with-103-inch-plasma/), some [terabyte hard drives](http://news.com.com/2100-1015_3-6105515.html) to store my collection of [Blu-ray DVDs](http://www.blu-ray.com/info/), and a couple of sets of quarter-million-dollar [German speakers](http://www.higherfi.com/spkrlist/speakerlist.htm). My actual living room has a 20-inch TV-VCR combo unit, an $80 DVD player, and an iPod docking station. Two things have kept me from upgrading my dorm-room-quality gear. The first is an extreme aversion to spending money. The second is my small apartment. The living room is also the dining room and the guest bedroom, and my girlfriend doesn't want a gigantic TV dominating the space. Wall of 103-inch plasma screens: out. Table and chairs: in. What I needed was a cheap, smallish gadget that could masquerade as a fancy, expensive gadget. When a friend started crowing about a magical machine that converts any blank wall into a movie screen, I was sold. I had to get a projector, and fast\u2014the Super Bowl was only weeks away. Soon after succumbing to the allure of watching my beloved New Orleans Saints on the living-room wall, I remembered that I know nothing about projectors. What features should I look for? What technology is state of the art? What shades](http://www.insolroll.com/standard.php?id=6)? [a screen](http://www.projectorcentral.com/screen-suppliers.htm)?\u2014would must be easily stowable, cost less than $1,000, and display DVDs, high-definition television, and videos that I've downloaded to my computer. Over the past month, I tried out six such projectors. I must confess that I've fallen hard\u2014I assure you, dear readers, that you will not regret letting one of these glorious machines into your life. But first, a list of the five most important considerations when shopping for a projector: LCD vs. DLP. Many A/V connoisseurs believe DLP (digital light processing) projectors are best for home theaters. According to Evan Powell, editor of the invaluable Web site [Projector Central](http://www.projectorcentral.com/), DLP projectors in the under-$1,000 price range generally produce superior black levels and less visible pixelation than their LCD (liquid crystal display) counterparts\u2014data that my testing confirmed. Some viewers complain that DLP machines create a horrifying-sounding \" [rainbow effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLP#The_DLP_.22Rainbow_Effect.22)\" in which the changes wrought by the projector's spinning color wheel become visible. Thankfully, I never noticed any rainbows. Resolution. This is probably the hardest and most important concept to get down. Every device has both a \"native resolution\"\u2014think of it as the projector's natural state\u2014and a \"maximum resolution\"\u2014what the projector's capable of if it really stretches itself. An example: The Epson Moviemate 30s has a native resolution of 854 by 480 pixels and a maximum resolution of 1280 by 1024. This means the Epson has the capability to display an image that comes in at 1280 by 1024, but to do so, it must compress the image to 854 by 480, the projector's native resolution. The compression process can lead to a loss of detail and sharpness. Why should you care? Projectors with a native resolution of 1280 by 720 can show [720p](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720p) high-definition television without compressing the image, making them the best choice for HDTV fanatics. If you care only about watching movies, though, an 854-by-480 device works fine. American DVDs store video at 720 by 480 pixels, meaning that a 1280-by-720 projector won't make your flicks look any more detailed than an 854-by-480 projector. (Since the individual pixels on a 1280-by-720 projector are smaller, though, you might see less visible pixilation than on an 854-by-480 device.) Brightness. Any projector, even a relatively dim one, will look great if you live in a cave. If your living room gets a ton of sunlight, however, no projector will generate a passable image. Somewhere in the middle? Then you need a projector with a high [lumen output](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(unit)#ANSI_lumens) to keep your picture from looking washed out. Warning: Projector lamps typically peter out after 2,000 to 3,000 hours of use, and replacement bulbs cost $300 to $400. Budget accordingly. Throw Distance. Your choice of projector will depend on the layout of your room. My projectors were 10.5 feet away from a blank wall space that's 8 feet wide and 4.5 feet high. Using the [distance](http://www.infocus.com/service/software/projcalc/index.asp?site_lang=1&site_region=1&) [calculator](http://www.optomausa.com/distancecalculator.asp) on each manufacturer's Web site, it's easy to figure out which projectors will \"throw\" a picture that fits your space. Compatibility. Buying a projector is only half the battle; you also have to connect it to your set-top box, DVD player, and computer. Five of the six projectors have a [VGA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA_connector) input for hooking up a PC and all six accept [composite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_video) and [component video cables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_video). Using a component video connection (the red, green, and blue plugs) rather than composite (the single yellow plug) noticeably improves image quality. (Click [here](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#2158697) to read what I think about fancy digital cables.) Methodology If you're thinking about buying a digital projector, you might want to go whole-hog\u2014upgrade your sound system and DVD player and get the best screen you can afford. But I'm a cheapskate. I tested each projector with my second-rate DVD player and iPod speakers. I did try [an adjustable screen](http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/consumer/consDetail.jsp?cookies=no&oid=63064168) for a while, but it took up lots of space and didn't noticeably improve image quality. My apartment was also dark enough that I didn't have to consider any kind of blackout shades. I did have to buy a few things to watch high-definition TV, however. Click [here](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#2158698) if you want to know what I needed. Along with lots and lots of Saints games, I evaluated each projector with three different DVDs. I used the snow-filled [Fargo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116282/) to test how they handled whites, the sunless sci-fi flick [Dark City](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929/) for blacks, and [Finding Nemo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266543/) for colors. I also critiqued how well each displayed videos from my computer. I had planned to assess the difficulty of getting each device hooked up, but they were shockingly easy to use. Don't worry if you're intimidated by electronics\u2014projectors are nothing to be afraid of. Unless you're trying to mount one to the ceiling. I'll admit, that does seem frightening. The Projectors [InFocus InFocus' best attribute is a gyroscopic base that makes it a breeze to position. But it loses points for plug-and-playability. It comes with only a puny composite cable, meaning you'll have to schlep to Radio Shack for cables to connect your DVD player and PC. The InFocus is also worst in show for zoom and focus. The circular dials are hard to budge, making fine control difficult. Performance: For the cheapest of the bunch, the InFocus holds up well. It was the surprise winner of the Dark City test, where its rich, dark blacks outshone a sea of greenish competitors. It didn't do as well with HD football games, which looked dull and lacked fine detail, and the image was unacceptably washed out with the lights on. The InFocus' picture\u2014a maximum of 82 inches diagonally from 10.5 feet away\u2014is enormous compared to any TV screen. But this was still the smallest of any projector. It takes more than 82 inches to impress me these days. Recommended for: Movie buffs who don't care about HDTV. It's also a great option for the budget-conscious: As of this writing, you can get the InFocus and a 92-inch Features: This a home theater into a gigantic (15.4 pounds!) all-in-one cube. Thanks to its built-in DVD player and speakers, you can pop in a disc and start watching\u2014no cables or external devices required. Equally handy are the dials that let you adjust the picture's placement without moving the projector\u2014a thoughtful feature, considering you're liable to get a hernia lifting this beast. Performance: The Epson aced the Finding Nemo test, producing a more vibrant, vivid coral reef than others. Plus, big things come in big packages: It generated by far the biggest picture, a ridiculous 134 inches diagonally from 10.5 feet. Perhaps due to the size of the image, HD football broadcasts looked pixelated and suffered from a lack of sharpness. Recommended for: Tech neophytes; anyone who wants an extremely A projector, only much, much smaller. Features: Panasonic claims that this 2.9 pounder is \"the world's lightest and smallest LCD projector.\" It's certainly small enough to carry around all day, or tote in a suitcase. It wouldn't shock me if it also had the world's smallest remote control (it resembles a large cracker) and the world's loudest fan (it sounds like a tiny outboard motor). For digital photographers, there's a built-in [SD slot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital_card). Drop in your memory card, and you can bore the kids with a slide show in seconds. Performance: Big things come in small packages, too: The 110-inch picture was second only to the Epson. The Panasonic probably would have done better in a bigger room, or with an Excel spreadsheet. It was overmatched by high-definition football\u2014the game looked pixelated, the colors oversaturated. A whiteout snowfall in Fargo turned blue around the edges, and Dark City had a greenish hue. The Panasonic's picture controls\u2014brightness, contrast, etc.\u2014don't offer much range for tweaking, Recommended Foreman Grill. Features: Lightning-fast auto detection ensures that your movie will pop up as soon as you plug in the DVD player. The zoom and focus are very easy to adjust, and there's a loud (if tinny) internal speaker that eliminates the need for an external sound system. The biggest deficiency here is the on-screen menu system. The interface is not intuitive to navigate, and worse, the gigantic, opaque menu boxes sit in the middle of the screen, making it impossible to tweak the picture while you're watching. The NEC comes with a carrying case and handle, but its claims of portability seem far-fetched\u2014it's too beefy to cart around for long periods of time. Performance: At 2,500 [ANSI lumens](http://www.projectorpeople.com/resources/lumen-guide.asp), this is by far the brightest of the lot. The luminous picture, which topped out at 106 inches diagonally, makes the NEC a joy to watch with the lights on. Consequently, it's an excellent choice for business types who need to light up a large conference room and homebodies who don't want to watch movies in total darkness. The superior brightness did wonders for Fargo\u2014the whites looked their whitest\u2014and for Finding Nemo, in which subtle tonal variations popped out. It didn't do as well with football, which suffered from the LCD projectors' chronic pixelation problem. Recommended for: Movie watchers who want to give the occasional PowerPoint presentation; adults who are still afraid of Features: Optoma is almost worth buying for the lovely light-up remote, which has dedicated buttons for each aspect ratio and source (HDMI, component, computer, etc.). It also comes with its own component cable\u2014you can plug in and start watching DVDs right away. Each machine I surveyed includes a \"keystone\" control to straighten the picture when the projector's pointed at an angle. The Optoma's keystone, however, is one of the few that does a credible job fashioning the onscreen image into a rectangle. The focus dial is a bit sticky, making it hard to make adjustments without jostling the projector. Performance: The projector's 1280-by-720 resolution did wonders for football\u2014the picture was noticeably sharper than the competition. It was the worst of the pack on flesh tones, though. White faces took on a yellowish cast in television programming and in Fargo. The screen size\u2014a max of 92 inches diagonally at 10.5 feet\u2014was at the bottom end of the range, but I still got a nice big image when plugging in my computer. Recommended for: Sports fans who watch lots of YouTube Wave radio. Features: The Mitsubishi remote is even better than the Optoma's, with dedicated buttons for each source, aspect ratio, and individual picture controls (contrast, sharpness, etc.). It also has the best keystone controls of any projector; it's possible to get a rectangular picture from even a sharp angle. Handles on the zoom and focus dials make it easy to adjust the picture size. Performance: The Mitsubishi blew away the competition on the football test\u2014the sharp picture allowed you to pick up subtle details the other projectors missed, like stitching on a white knit cap and the players' jock-strap lines. (Or so I'm told.) Its superior contrast made a big difference on Dark City, revealing shadowy minutiae that were lost on the other machines. Since it's not as bright as the NEC, the whites didn't sparkle as much in Fargo, and I couldn't see as many of Finding Nemo's colors. My biggest disappointment with the Mitsubishi was that, despite having the same maximum screen dimensions as the Optoma (92 inches diagonally), the videos on my computer only showed up at two-thirds the size. Recommended for: Me, and anyone else who's obsessed with sports. The Mitsubishi doesn't outshine the competition when it comes to DVDs, but since it laps the field on HDTV, this is your best bet if you want a machine for watching both movies and high-definition television.

Powell told me that if you put two identical projectors side by side, you'd see that digital cables ( [HDMI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI) and [DVI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVI)) usually produce a slightly superior image than analog component cables. For what it's worth, I tested out an HDMI cable on the three projectors with an HDMI input; I couldn't detect a bit of difference. Return to [article](file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/kobrzynskiz/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/OLK934/02022007.htm#back2158698) Since I don't subscribe to high-definition cable service, I needed to build my own HD setup. For a total of $230, I bought [an indoor antenna](http://www.antennaweb.org/aw/welcome.aspx) and an [HD tuner box](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-DTB-H260F-HDTV-Terrestrial-Tuner/dp/B000JV6TQY). That equipment allowed me to tune in to over-the-air signals from eight local stations, including ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox. (That's right, you can pick up HD broadcasts without paying your cable company $230 to \" [watch HDTV for free](http://tv.about.com/od/hdtv/a/hdantenna.htm).\") This isn't an ideal setup. I constantly had to warn guests not to touch, breathe on, or sit in front of the rabbit ears. It was good enough, though, to convince me that high-definition football is reason enough to buy a projector. It comes to us [from sportswriter Peter King](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/peter_king/01/21/playoffs/index.html) that this past summer, in training camp, Peyton Manning developed a fancy new practice method in which a team cameraman took up a spot in the defensive secondary. From there, he would train his camera on Manning's eyes, videotaping them, presumably to give the Indianapolis Colts quarterback an idea of how an opposing cornerback might read him. King, alas, doesn't dwell on this any longer. But this sort of thing\u2014the kind of creepily involved training a quarterback might undergo if he were coached by Philip K. Dick\u2014goes to the heart of the world's problem with Peyton Manning. The Colts quarterback, it seems, is a big ol' dork. Manning's stardom has always been problematic. He is indisputably the best quarterback of our day, one of the greats of all time, the scion of an eminently likable signal-calling dynasty, a player who combines prodigious physical gifts and an instinctive feel for the game. And yet, on the eve of the biggest game of his career, he finds himself [scorned](http://www.tmz.com/2006/08/14/peyton-manning-the-nfls-anna-kournikova/), [mocked](http://www.deadspin.com/sports/nfl/peyton-manning-going-all-brokeback-mountain-on-us-128185.php), and generally [loathed](http://www.talkingnfl.com/i-hate-peyton-manning-part-1/) in any part of the country that is not Indianapolis, Tennessee (where he played college ball), the Garden District of New Orleans (where he was raised), or Madison Avenue (where he pitches Gatorade, DIRECTV, Sprint, ESPN, MasterCard, and Reebok, among others). A victory on Sunday, and Canton can go ahead and commission the bust. But nobody, [not even Time magazine](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1582320-1,00.html), wants to cheer for him. Of course, if we're to believe any of the journalism escaping from Miami this week, the formerly petulant Manning has, at last, \"matured.\" He is \"new and improved,\" a far, far cry, apparently, from that awful, callow thing who tossed a league record 49 touchdowns two years ago. Manning, it is said, has finally figured out how to win the Big Game, something he has supposedly failed to do over his previous eight years in the league. It goes without saying that these are entirely phony story lines, cheap even by the standards of Super Bowl week, where sensible journalism goes to die. (For one thing, this all presumes the quarterback is the author of everything that transpires on the field and is therefore responsible for the outcome of the Big Game. Somebody should tell [Jerry Kramer](http://www.amazon.com/Instant-Replay-Green-Diary-Kramer/dp/0941372057).) But the pundits' point is abundantly clear: Manning has finally achieved greatness because he no longer comports himself, if I may channel Chuck Klosterman for a moment, like [Samuel \"Screech\" Powers](http://www.briscoebarnyard.com/pictures/doublediamond.jpg). Appraising a Great Quarterback is a messy business, and not just on account of the football. A Great Quarterback is an American mascot, having wholly supplanted the cowboy as the country's standard of manliness. He has all the qualities desired in a leader. He is quiet and smoldering and unafraid to get a little dirt on the uniform; a field general, tactically brilliant, unfailingly chivalrous. Sammy Baugh fits. So do Otto Graham, Johnny Unitas, Joe Montana, Brett Favre, and Tom Brady. [Erwin Rommel](http://gi.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_rommel.html), too, but that's another story. One thing a Great Quarterback cannot be, however, is a nerd. More than any sport, football has been slow to embrace its inner geek ( [or outer geek](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2419713), for that matter). It is a game still played by a fraternity of big, violent men according to a macho code. That's why Manning, in the popular imagination, remains somewhere on the edges. Manning has never been a jock. He doesn't look the part, all pouts and frantic gestures. He geekily immersed himself in football's nuances at an early age, learning seven-step drops as a 4-year-old and shortly thereafter developing an almost autistic devotion to film study. In college, Todd Helton, the baseball player and former Tennessee quarterback, dubbed Manning \"R2-D2.\" (It's interesting to note that if Manning were a head coach today, the obsessive film study and attention to detail would get him labeled a genius, a la Belichick.) All this came at some expense to Manning's social development, it would seem. A 1999 profile in Sports Illustrated spent most of its time chortling good-naturedly over Manning's various gaucheries: the name written on the inside of the jeans; the bafflement over a can opener; the underwear turned inside out (so he wouldn't have to use the confounding washing machine). As a childhood friend of Manning's told SI: \"He's too easy to make fun of. He's mature beyond his years as a public figure, and he has an amazing grasp of what to do on the field, but he can't do anything else on his own. He's always going to be the guy who steps in dog poop, and every time he eats a sandwich or a hamburger, he'll end up with ketchup down his leg, mustard on his ear.\" Rain Man, the quarterback. Manning, at times, is every bit as insufferable as he's reckoned to be. There are the occasional [impolitic](http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2003/0202/1503003.html) quotes, and you can frequently discern the sense of entitlement of a kid born into football royalty. He gives very little of himself, preferring instead the careful cultivation of his own image\u2014in bars, Manning would sometimes keep his beers out of sight, fearing what people might think of him. This is partly why so many fans and writers recoil at his many commercials. (The other reason is their sheer ubiquity, and Manning's, which is a comical complaint coming from the very media that enable Manning's ubiquity.) \"His affability takes on an overtone of insincerity,\" [writes](http://chiefmarketer.com/cm_plus/peytons_place/) one critic. \"After the fourth Peyton Manning endorsement, it takes a pretty lunkheaded viewer not to realize he's only in it for the money.\" No, it takes a lunkheaded viewer not to realize it after the first commercial. Besides, the spots aren't all that bad. The most memorable of the bunch has him [cheering on a series of commoners](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0hidqy8oyY), in the manner of a rabid sports fan: \"Let's go, insurance adjusters, let's go!\" For what it's worth, he has a better comic instinct than Tom Brady. None of this stuff is Manning's problem, though. This lies with the fans, who now seem to indulge in a sporty sort of phrenology, by which the character of a man is sussed from a MasterCard commercial and a highlight on ESPN. \"It's just impossible to root for the guy,\" wrote Matt Taibbi in one sustained [rant](http://www.nysportsexpress.com/2/2/departments/afc.cfm), \"which is not something one says about all the other Great Quarterbacks Who Do Not Play For Us. Brett Favre, an unmistakably three-dimensional human being, is easy to root for.\" Or there's this: \"He is not a person you would invite over for dinner, nor is he a person that you would want to spend your Saturday with. Rather, he is the person you would be wondering about. Some people would feel sorry for him.\" Oops! That one's about [Bill Gates](http://members.aol.com/erichuf/Linux3.html). Sorry. It's time, I think, for football to embrace its poor Screech, Peyton Manning. Let the dorks into the fraternity. After all, we nerds are one of the NFL's sustaining life forces, with our fantasy football and our [Football Outsiders](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/) and our Madden NFL 07. Like the man says: Let's go, insurance adjusters, let's go! The October-to-April stretch is the prime rib on the sports menu. On the schedule for those seven months: the World Series, the Super Bowl, March Madness, and the Masters. This year, the titans of sports broadcasting who will bring us all of these choice events are Fox's Joe Buck and Jim Nantz of CBS. Is that really the best we can do? Buck, the voice of Fox baseball and football, is the definition of occupational mediocrity. He's also, sadly, the more compelling figure of the two. The son of legendary St. Louis Cardinals broadcaster Jack Buck, Joe is a charter member of the [sportscasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Brennaman) [legacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Caray) society, at the mike more because of his last name than his overwhelming talent. Like another beneficiary of nepotism whose last name is four letters long and starts with \"B,\" Joe evinces smugness in the face of extraordinarily low approval ratings. Check out [this Holiday Inn commercial](http://youtube.com/watch?v=z9IilLW1aEw) in which a bunch of worshipful dudes corner him at the hotel bar. These are the sportscaster equivalent of Bush campaign rallies, where only supporters were allowed in, and anyone wearing an opposition T-shirt [got kicked out](http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Vote2004/story?id=214695&page=1). Buck's broadcasts typically descend into awkward attempts to hug it out with his younger audience members. One [classic example](http://awfulannouncing.blogspot.com/2006/08/fox-sports-announcing-preview.html) of Buck's cloying sense of humor came after Pam Oliver teasingly threw to \"the cool Chris Myers.\" Buck then went berserk: \"You are cool. ... You are the epitome of cool. ... Pam Oliver is right. ... You are cool, Chris Myers!\" But the Buckism that sticks with me most is his infamous announcement after Fox re-upped its contract with Major League Baseball: \"You're stuck with us!\" The masters of biting wit, the Kornheisers and Cosells, use sarcasm to puncture the sports power structure. Buck's Simpsons quotes and sarcastic digs, though, serve to separate him from the average viewer. People have a pretty good sense of who brings a populist streak to a telecast (think John Madden), and who brings the kind of sneering condescension that screams \"obey authority.\" Buck's worst moment, his [over-the-top scolding](http://www.tvgasm.com/archives/sports/000482.php) of Randy Moss' faux moon during a 2005 playoff game, is best understood by looking at its corporate context. The Moss moon came the season after the infamous \"wardrobe malfunction\" at Super Bowl XXXVIII, and the networks were scared to death about getting fined by the FCC. Buck wasn't outraged by Moss' harmless taunting\u2014he was afraid of the potential criticism and penalties against his employers. Note Buck's silence after [Reggie Bush's display of poor sportsmanship](http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/fb/texansfront/4507781.html) in the NFC championship game, which was ugly but not indecent. That change of tone makes you wonder if he has any opinions that don't serve the interests of the suits upstairs. Buck's time in the national broadcast booth is mostly done until baseball cranks up again. That leaves the next few months to [Jim Nantz](http://cbs.sportsline.com/cbssports/team/jnantz). CBS's main man will have an extraordinary run of big events starting Sunday. After the Super Bowl, he will be courtside at the Final Four in Atlanta, then pivot east to call the Masters in Augusta, Ga. Nantz is probably best known for his golf work. That's fitting, for no one projects an image of country-club piety and blandness quite like him. While technically sound, he is one of the few in the business capable of turning a rousing AFC championship game into a [round at Torrey Pines](http://www.torreypinesgolfcourse.com/). Nantz is [Gus Johnson](http://www.sportsline.com/cbssports/team/gjohnson) and [Kevin Harlan](http://sportsline.com/cbssports/team/kharlan)\u2014he has an internal governor that pulls him back at moments when he should get excited. When there is an obvious big story line, like the Colts' final drive against New England two weeks ago, he ably sets the stage. But Nantz usually prefers to fade into the background, biding his time until he can unfurl a cornball capper. My favorite is this coda to the 2005 NCAA tournament: \"It started in March, ended in April, and belonged to [Sean] May!\" Oof. I prefer my play-by-play man to call the game, then let the celebration speak for itself. Nantz's wallflower behavior is a result of swallowing the CBS mantra that the analyst\u2014Billy Packer for hoops, Phil Simms for the NFL\u2014is the star. Nantz is the epitome of the company man, the Man in the Gray Flannel Network Blazer. One gets the strong feeling that he's in the booth because he plays golf with the right people at CBS, because he can be counted on to get the promos in on time, and because he isn't the type to [embarrass the network with racial gaffes](http://www.slate.com/id/2154672/fr/rss/). Is he good at his craft? Sure, but he won't make you tilt forward in your seat like Marv Albert or Bob Costas or Al Michaels. Sunday's extravaganza in Miami will surprisingly be the first time Nantz dons the Super Headset. He's off to a typical start, gushing that [he's happy](http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2007-01-30-hiestand-nantz_x.htm) it's the 41st edition of the Big Game, due to his close friendship with George H.W. Bush. Naturally, Papa Bush is a golf buddy. During the game, expect Nantz to jam the preordained story lines (Peyton vs. Rex, dueling African-American coaches, etc.) down our throats, while ignoring personnel shifts and formation tendencies. That will be the purview of Phil Simms, who's a smart analyst but tends to over talk, an excusable trait since his partner seldom leads him to the nuts and bolts analysis. What's the common bond between Buck and Nantz? They both offer the calming reassurance of a corporate promotional video. Buck's self-serving geekiness and Nantz's vanilla extract convey that all is well, that the brand names (CBS, Fox, Budweiser, the NFL, the Masters) still run the sports world. Buck and Nantz aren't play-by-play men so much as vice presidents in charge of communications. They just happen to sit in the broadcast booth, not the luxury box. Harry Potter. The seventh\u2014and final\u2014Harry Potter book will be released on [July 21](http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2007/02/01/final_henry_potter_book_due_out_in_july/), and fans aren't the only ones mourning the end of the series.

Fans are perhaps most concerned by Rowling's proclamation that two characters die in this book, particularly if one of them is Harry. While Rowling is keeping the secret close to her chest, the BBC notes, \"Rowling has said she could understand authors who killed off their characters, to stop others writing new adventures. But she admitted being worried about the reaction from fans if the boy wizard [came to a sticky end](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6320733.stm).\" After the announcement, pre-orders for the book catapulted it to the [top of the charts](http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_local_southwest_brit/2007/02/rowling_sets_la.html) at Amazon and Barnesandnoble.com.

This biopic about Andy Warhol ing\u00e9nue Edie Sedgwick (Sienna Miller) has bored reviewers\u2014largely because the world of Warhol's Factory is less interesting up close than one would expect. The New York Times wonders: \"How do you discover the inner life of people determined to live so fast and hard that they can outrun their demons? How do you bring substance to charismatic personalities whose [glamour may camouflage a void](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/02/movies/02fact.html)?\" The Los Angeles Times sniffs that the film \"disappoints as both biography and drama. ...

The 21-year-old British songstress\u2014who first rocketed to fame on [MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/lilymusic)\u2014has released her first full-length album stateside. Critics are largely enamored with her bad-girl act. The Guardian writes, \"Allen is not so much hanging out her dirty laundry as rolling around in it, [delighting in its filth](http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1819662,00.html), to a soundtrack of ska rhythms and lilting reggae tones.\" But the Washington Post wonders whether her British success (her single \"Smile\" hit the top of the chart last summer) will translate in the United States: \"Though she's a star in the United Kingdom, it's difficult imagining High School Musical-loving tween girls warming up to [Allen's tunes about crack whores](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/29/AR2007012901992.html), pot-smoking brothers and declarations that size does matter.\" ( [Buy](http://www.amazon.com/Alright-Still-Lily-Allen/dp/B000KG5EQE/sr=8-3/qid=1170345685/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/103-6023634-6754265?ie=UTF8&s=music) Alright, Still.) The Sarah Silverman Program (Thursdays, 10:30 p.m., [Comedy Central](http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_sarah_silverman_program/index.jhtml)). Critics are chuckling at the eponymous sitcom from the raunchy comic best known for her concert film, Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic, and a show-stealing rape joke in The Aristocrats. The New York Times seems to think Silverman is a breath of fresh air, praising the show as \"an [antidote to the self-serious sitcoms](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/arts/television/31silv.html) that broadcast networks continue to churn out, the ones that mix a young, idealistic married couple and an older, bitter married couple and wait for the hijinks to ensue.\" The San Francisco Chronicle wonders about the secret of Silverman's charm: \"the funny, often shocking thing about Silverman's show is: You are [drawn to the character](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/01/31/entertainment/e060120S82.DTL), however appalling, even as she pushes you away with a rude shove.\" But, as The New Yorker's Tad Friend points out, Silverman is taking a risk by creating a character who falls outside the sitcom's prescribed norms: \"We admire the [purity of Silverman's scornfulness](http://www.newyorker.com/critics/television/articles/070205crte_television_friend), but we don't want to hang out with her the way we did with Mary and Rhoda.\" Top Design (Wednesdays, 10 p.m., [Bravo](http://www.bravotv.com/Top_Design); premiere airs at 11 p.m. ET). Bravo has carved a reality-show niche for itself, pitting amateurs pursuing a common profession (fashion design, hairstyling, cooking, etc.) against each other and anointing one the winner. The network's latest is an interior design competition, with fashion (and [La-Z-Boy](http://www.lazboy.com/ourfurniture/collections/TO_collections.aspx)) designer Todd Oldham in the mentor role. The Boston Globe complains that \"Top Design is so [derivative of Project Runway](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2007/01/31/top_design_too_formulaic_for_its_own_good/), from the setup to the structure of the judging, that it's impossible not to make a point-by-point comparison, with the new show falling short on every level.\" But other critics find this dose of the Bravo formula acceptable. As the Washington Post remarks, \"Bravo is gambling that there's at least as much interest in the rooms we live in as the food we eat and the clothes we buy. And judging by this show's high points, that's [one safe bet](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/30/AR2007013001808.html).\" Some Loud Thunder, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah (self-released). The indie-music phenomenons\u2014whose self-titled, self-released first album won them instant fame and fortune\u2014are meeting with a tougher critical reception for their follow-up. The band \"demands a new, irksome level of indulgence on Some Loud Thunder,\" observes the New York Times. \"But it finds a [new richness](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/arts/music/29choi.html) in the songs it doesn't sabotage.\" The Los Angeles Times is less forgiving, griping that \"despite many fetching elements, the collection as a whole feels [scattered and undercooked](http://www.calendarlive.com/music/reviews/cl-ca-clap28jan28,0,252890.story?coll=cl-albumreviews).\" And Pitchfork, the online music magazine that played a large role in the band's initial rise, calls Some Loud Thunder \"an [adequate follow-up](http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/40757/Clap_Your_Hands_Say_Yeah_Some_Loud_Thunder) that contains a handful of fantastic songs, a handful of uneven ones, and a handful of duds.\" ( [Buy](http://www.amazon.com/Some-Loud-Thunder-Clap-Hands/dp/B000LPR4YY/sr=1-1/qid=1170172423/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-6023634-6754265?ie=UTF8&s=music) Some Loud Thunder.) Not Too Late, Norah Jones (Blue Note). It would be almost impossible for Norah Jones to live up to the standards she set with her first two albums\u201430 million copies sold worldwide, eight Grammys won. But the artist isn't resting on her laurels, as the Houston Chronicle notes: \"[Not Too Late] finds Jones again [trying to surprise herself](http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/4508276.html), commendable for an artist with so many early successes.\" Many critics have observed that her new work is darker, and the Washington Post applauds Jones for producing a \"foreboding and magnificently moody\" album that \"tackles not just matters of the heart, but [matters of state](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/29/AR2007012902035.html) as well,\" with songs about the national psyche and New Orleans. And the Boston Globe remarks that the album's \"subtle, but piquant, [new dark streak](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2007/01/29/norah_joness_new_dark_streak_is_a_nice_touch/) ... goes a long way toward lifting Jones's songs out of the realm of background music.\" ( [Buy](http://www.amazon.com/Not-Too-Late-Norah-Jones/dp/B000KCHZK6/sr=8-1/qid=1170172240/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-6023634-6754265?ie=UTF8&s=music) Not Too Late.) Sundance postgame. The film festival ended Saturday, and Padre Nuestro\u2014about a Mexican immigrant teenager on a quest to find his father in the United States\u2014won the [grand jury prize](http://edition.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/28/sundance.awards.ap/) for best American drama. But those who came to Park City, Utah, looking for the next Little Miss Sunshine were disappointed. \"More double and triples\u2014but [no home runs](http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-01-28-sundance-standouts_x.htm),\" sighed a New York entertainment lawyer to USA Today. Critics were quick to note the festival's high-profile failures; chief among them was the widely panned Hounddog, about which the Boston Globe's Ty Burr snickers, \"Bad-movie buzz can do more damage in Park City than any conservative baying over [Dakota Fanning's rape scene](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2007/01/27/with_deals_done_focus_returns_to_the_films/).\" But the festival has long been a destination in itself, in any case, as the New York Times' Manohla Dargis muses: \"The movies may not be terribly good, the art of the deal may matter more than the art of cinema to most attendees and worthy work may go unnoticed and unloved, but [Sundance is hot](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/movies/29next.html).\" Breaking and Entering (MGM).

Even if you missed [Bill Gates on The Daily Show](http://www.comedycentral.com/motherload/player.jhtml?ml_video=81467) Monday night, you probably know what he talked about. Today is the launch day for Windows Vista, so Gates and Jon Stewart spent half the time gabbing about Microsoft's new OS and the other half joking about Gates' password and interactive television. Not once did they mention the other Microsoft product that's debuting today, [Office 2007](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx). That's no accident. Why isn't Gates stumping for you to buy Office again? Because he doesn't have to. Office is Microsoft's real monopoly. Try to find a business, large or small, that doesn't rely on some combination of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Watch [Apple's TV ads](http://www.apple.com/getamac/) and count how often they remind you\u2014Macs run Microsoft Office, too! Today's Macs can actually boot Windows, but it's Office that makes the sale. The real proof is the price. You can upgrade your PC from Windows XP to Vista for as little as $100. The cheapest Office 2007 suite [goes for $150](http://www.officemax.com/max/solutions/minisite/minisiteTemplate.jsp?msno=83). It's got Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Did you want Outlook? That'll be another hundred bucks for an upgrade package. (You can upgrade to Vista and Office 2007 separately\u2014neither product requires the other.) After playing around with Vista and Office for the last few weeks, I can condense my thoughts into one sentence. Upgrading to Vista is mostly painless but not necessary, while upgrading to Office 2007 is painful but inevitable. Vista goes out of its way to smooth your transition from Windows XP. As I [wrote earlier this month](http://www.slate.com/id/2158037/), Vista's installer let me know which applications might not run and what gadgets it doesn't support yet. If I wait a few weeks for new device drivers, I'll have no incompatibilities at all. Office 2007, on the other hand, seems to go out of its way to make your transition as difficult as possible. By default, the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files you create won't open for people who have older versions of the software. Sure, you can save in \"Office 97\u2014Office 2003\" format, but you'll lose some of your formatting. Microsoft does offer a conversion program for people with the old Office. It works only as far back as Office 2000, though, and it doesn't work at all on Macs. (Apple users won't get a compatible Office upgrade for another year or so.) My home office has two computers, a Mac with Office 2004 and a PC running Office 97. I've never needed to upgrade for work. Unless I buy the new Office, I'll be out of luck when I get files from editors and publicists who don't save in the old format. Upgrading software is always risky. My fingers and toes twitch from the time I click OK until I've convinced myself everything's working. Will it break my computer? Will it work right? I winced and held my breath throughout the Vista installation, then forgot the pain and anxiety quickly when I saw Vista worked mostly like a tidied-up version of XP. I can't say the same for Office. First reaction: They changed everything! Office 2007 deletes the old toolbars and menus at the top of the screen and replaces them with [the Ribbon](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/HA100898951033.aspx), an overlapping set of tabs that regroups each application's functions into graphical tools rather than text-driven menus. Still photos don't do the Ribbon justice. Watch [this movie](http://microsoftwowlaunch.com/archive/2006/11/29/welcome-to-the-office-ui.aspx) to see it in action. Even better, download a free [60-day trial](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/HA101741481033.aspx) of Office 2007\u2014don't worry, it won't disable your existing Office software. The Ribbon mimics the tabbed interfaces of the Firefox and Internet Explorer 7 browsers. It looks cool, but it took me most of five minutes to find, set, and test the Track Changes options my editor expects. As my deadline loomed, I panicked when I couldn't find the option to save in Office 2003 format. It was hiding behind a [new jewellike logo](http://officeblogs.net/UI/OfficeButton.gif) in the upper left corner called the Office Button. Microsoft's reviewer's guide makes clear that all of the keystroke commands you know and love are still here. That will assuage speed-typing accountants who might otherwise refuse to switch. But as nice as the Ribbon and other user-interface upgrades are, it's only natural that most users will react with annoyance rather than wonder when they find out they can't switch to some kind of \"Classic mode\" in order to finish a write-up that was due 20 minutes ago (like this one). Initially, I didn't see the point of the UI's tabs, thumbnails, and rounded edges. Was Microsoft simply trying to embrace the Web 2.0 aesthetic? I e-mailed [PC World](http://www.pcworld.com/) editor Harry McCracken to ask if I was missing something. McCracken praised the Ribbon as forward-looking, the sort of user interface you'd design from scratch for late-model PCs. \"The old Office UI dated back to the days when just rendering a drop-down menu used considerable computing power,\" he told me. \"The new Office UI usually shows things rather than explaining them.\" He's right. The Ribbon uses thumbnail images rather than text labels in most places. Elsewhere on the screen, ghostlike menus fade in and out as I work, offering graphical menus\u2014not text lists\u2014of the tools (fonts, styles, highlighting) I might want to apply. Office 2007 is still driving me nuts because I don't know where things went. But now I can see where it's going, and I can see the future me happily pecking away in Word 2007. But that leaves me wondering: If they really wanted to redesign Office from scratch, why not do like [Google Docs & Spreadsheets](https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=writely&passive=true&continue=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2F<mpl=homepage&nui=1) and offer a full-featured Web-based version? I'd be happy with that right now, not in some indefinite future. Office 2007 will delight the next generation of word processors and infuriate old fogeys. In that way, it reminds me less of its release partner, the soothing, seductive Vista, than of Windows 95\u2014a radical overhaul that left nonbuyers behind and annoyed everyone who did buy it. Curse it now, but you'll eventually upgrade to join the rest of the human race. And you'll be glad you did. Someday. In a move borrowed from It's Garry Shandling's Show, comedienne Sarah Silverman plays a version of her brattish stand-up persona on The Sarah Silverman Program (Comedy Central, Thursdays at 10:30 p.m. ET). \"She's a white female, kinda Jew-y but totally hot, not out-of-your-league hot, just cute, long neck, really nice skin. She could easily pass for 20,\" or so says a convenience-store shopkeeper (Masi Oka) in the episode \"Batteries.\" He's giving this description to a cop because Sarah, who is 36, has just wrecked his store and stolen a four-pack of double-As. The cop gets on his radio: \"Dispatch, we have a black male.\" Force of habit. That's one of the better bits in a show that's manic with cultivated bad taste. A majority of the jokes\u2014about child abuse, gay bashing, wheelchair athletes, penises, vaginas, \"doody,\" and getting high on cough syrup\u2014aren't especially funny. They aren't even especially jokes. They just decorate the space where Silverman, indulging in her brand of charged sexual and ethnic humor, turns her haughty Jewish-American Princess fa\u00e7ade into a comedy character. As Sarah herself sneers at the beginning of a show, advising viewer discretion, the program \"contains full-frontal Jew-dity.\" The Sarah Silverman Program is a six-episode sitcom that's plays like one shaggy sketch\u2014a loose and tomboyish riff, Sarah Silverman as a JAP minstrel. She's not making any kind of commentary on the stereotype, just doing a half act, trying to wander into funny business and, when in doubt, provoking offense. But back to the batteries. You see, Sarah has been slacking on her couch in Valley Village, trying to find some awesome TV to pass the day with when she clicks onto a 36-hour leukemia telethon: Remember, these are children that are DYING. \"Dying like a fox,\" our Sarah scoffs, and then the batteries in her remote control give out. Because the alternate reality of The Sarah Silverman Program proceeds according to a druggy, magic-realist brand of illogic, Sarah does not simply unplug the TV, but instead uses desk tape to affix dollar bills all over the screen, which also muffles the sound. So, now she needs to go buy batteries at the convenience store, which involves mooching cash off her sister\u2014played by the real Laura Silverman\u2014who's out at brunch with friends, a schlubby gay couple. Soon, the four of them are sitting at the table, trading noisy farts. When it's Sarah's turn to deliver, she goes too far and accidentally poops her pants. After a musical interlude where the heroine rhymes \"retarded\" with \"re-smarted,\" she meets God, who answers her prayer that she might have that wind-passing moment back again, and then she's back at the brunch table, squeezing out a wicked but clean one. That seems like an awfully long way to go for a fart joke that would not pass muster in Scary Movie 2, but you've got to credit the sound designers for the way they make Silverman's juicy flatulence spurt out in stereo. Sarah borrows three bucks and goes to the store. The batteries cost $3.50 or something, so Sarah steals them. She evades arrest when God turns the policemen chasing her into rustling bags of snack chips. (God, who is black, by the way, apparently has a product-placement deal with Bugles.) Then the two of them, God and Sarah, go back to her place and hook up, and she kicks him out in the morning. Which is all to say that The Sarah Silverman Program isn't about anything but its own supposed daring and the hyperbolic smugness of its star. When Larry David makes himself look like a non-PC jerk on Curb Your Enthusiasm, there's a richness that springs from his sense of wonder at the subtle discomfort and anxieties surrounding social taboos. Silverman is so intent on delivering attitude that she doesn't care whether the jokes have any weight. \"I can't even imagine what it would be like to be homeless,\" the Sarah character says to a neighborhood bum at one point, her delivery whiny and slack. \"High school is the closest thing I can imagine to that. Y'know, 'cause it's cliquey.\" Read that again. What's the target? It only hammers away at Sarah's own famous self-absorption, which is more like self-immersion. You can't accuse Sarah Silverman of being annoying: That's her whole shtick. The Miss America Pageant is on tonight (CMT at 8 p.m. ET), so let's be clear: There's Miss America, and then there's Miss USA. Miss USA is the little girl from Kentucky who went up to New York and got into all that fast living, unconscionably supplying Donald Trump, who owns that pageant, with another excuse for flapping his mouth at live microphones. Miss America, meanwhile, is a national institution. On yesterday's Chris Matthews Show (NBC), Newsweek's Howard Fineman discussed whether Phyllis George, Miss America of 1971, was getting ready to run for the governor's office of Kentucky or just one of its Senate seats. He discussed it with Andrea Mitchell, as Matthews himself was out of town ... judging the [Miss America Pageant](http://www.missamerica.org/). When this column [checked in last year](http://www.slate.com/id/2134658/), Miss America was in an awkward transitional phase. ABC had parted ways with the pageant, and the country-fried cable channel CMT had moved in, relocating the show from Atlantic City to Las Vegas and giving the old gal a proper overhaul. The trick is to American Idolize the show without violating its spirit. Miss America should have a sense of humor about herself without turning into a joke, and CMT needs to find a new vessel for the old values\u2014\"poise and confidence and grace.\" Pageant School: Becoming Miss America, a two-hour film that premiered last Friday, is central to the new effort. It's a reality drama without any drama\u2014a sweet-tempered, well-mannered showcase with the standards of a Vanderbilt sorority mixer. It also forces the cynical viewer to quit sneering and re-evaluate a few preconceived notions (or, as Miss Utah calls them, \"pre notions\") about the pageant. Four months ago, contestants representing each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands, gathered in Santa Monica to hone their skills, make new friends, and, quite literally, do one another's hair. At the end of Pageant School, one woman is crowned Miss Pageant School\u2014which doesn't necessarily mean that she's a favorite to win the big enchilada, but rather that the expert panel took a shine to her \"spirit and enthusiasm.\" Further, in a new twist on the Miss Congeniality award, fans could watch the contestants vote for three finalists and then go to CMT's Web site to pick their favorite, announced live tonight. And there's a lottery: If you correctly predict the actual finalists, you can win a million bucks. The centerpiece of this inaugural Pageant School was Miss Texas. She's tall, bright, and powerfully glamorous, with that intimidating Lone Star star quality. Her tears welled up sincerely when she talked about how proud she was to be \"the first African-American Miss Texas.\" But she's also shy, a touch gawky, maybe even a bit aloof. Can she go all the way? Is she becoming more self-confident? Should she do something else with her bangs? Pageant School also spends time with the contestants who definitely aren't going the distance, those 42 nonsemifinalists relegated to the background of Miss America before you've even settled into your couch. They're rather endearing, especially Miss Vermont, whose tiara has been lost in her luggage, and even Miss D.C. When asked what superpower she would wish to have, she replied, with that combination of tone-deafness and grubby paranoia peculiar to the District, \"I would like to be able to be a fly on the wall at any location. That way I would be able at the same time to know where Osama Bin Laden was hiding and also know how my best friends really thought about me.\" One challenge explored makeup. First, the contestants listened attentively as a cosmetics expert ran through \"the four main mistakes\" of beauty-pageant makeup: 1) too much makeup, 2) heavy foundation, 3) dark lipstick, and 4) wrong color eye shadow. If I understood the compare-and-contrast demonstration correctly, then Divine wore too much makeup in Mondo Trasho and everyone else is doing OK. The girls then paired up in a kind of trust exercise, taking turns powdering and glossing one another. Miss Texas graciously strained to compliment what Miss North Dakota had done to her face: \"It's very ... natural.\" Miss New Jersey had some trouble, too, \"I made the mistake of adding some bronzer?\" Then it was time for line dancing. The contestants donned boots and denim skirts. A new-fangled group called The Lo-Cash Cowboys materialized to provide music and some notes on choreography. Miss Texas was having trouble learning the steps, but Miss Maryland, who's actually a dance teacher, was thrilled to help her. Miss Nevada, meanwhile, had a bad attitude. The camerawork and editing were a bit queasy-making in this segment. You couldn't quite tell if this was a small disaster of fake-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 filmmaking\u2014after all, the production values of Pageant School are often on the level of an infomercial\u2014or if they just kept the camera swaying to disguise the fact that the dancing was not really dancing. \" ... 5, 6, drop it like it's hot,\" exhorted one Cowboy, quoting Snoop Dogg. \"What if it's not hot?\" asked Miss Nebraska, \"Then how do you drop it?\" We next turned our attention to swimsuit-related matters. The girls broke into seven groups, each of which was charged with donning vintage one-piece bathing suits from a particular decade and devising a little skit. The girls of the 1920s did a vibrant flapper routine. The girls of the 1940s made a shout-out to Rosie the Riveter. The women of the 1980s provided the most absorbing moment of this whole experiment. The suits being \"delightfully tacky,\" as Miss Alaska put it, the contestants did a big-haired New Wave thing. They resourcefully went over the top, with too much makeup and the wrong color eye shadow. In the skit, robotic as Robert Palmer girls, each of them pledged her commitment to \"world peace,\" \"world peace,\" \"world peace ... \" The joke had a Max Headroom angle to it. Miss America had embraced irony. It's looking good for Miss Texas going into tonight's competition; Phyllis George herself was excited to see her grow more extroverted, while another panelist praised the good job she'd done restyling those bangs. I'll also be keeping an eye out for Miss Arkansas, who became the inaugural Miss Pageant School; for Miss Mississippi, who seems really sweet; and for Miss Colorado, who asked if she could vote for herself for Miss Congeniality. Then there's Miss Alabama. Never count out Miss Alabama. In 1951, [Yolande Betbeze](http://www.missamerica.org/our-miss-americas/1950/1951.asp) of Mobile won the Miss America crown and then refused to make any further public appearances in a bathing suit: \"I'm an opera singer, not a pin-up!\" The swimsuit sponsor then went off in a huff to found Miss USA. Miss America stayed true to herself\u2014progressive as the boardwalk, pragmatic as Main Street, poised like a daddy's girl, as classy as a cornball can be. In his book [The Persian Puzzle](http://www.slate.com/id/2110538/), Kenneth Pollack aptly frames the problem of Iran as a \"race between two clocks.\" One clock counts down the time until Iran enriches enough uranium to build a nuclear weapon. The other ticks off the hours remaining for its corrupt and dysfunctional clerical regime. The danger confronting the United States, Israel, and the world is that the alarm on the first clock seems set to go off before the alarm on the second. A sensible way to think about policy toward Iran might be to consider ways to reverse the order\u2014to stretch out the nuclear timetable while accelerating the demise of an Iranian government bent on proliferation. The most common estimates of the time needed for Iran to get enough fissile material and assemble a bomb range from three to eight or 10 years. (The Iraqi example counsels skepticism about all such forecasts.) Predicting the durability of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's rule, or that of the Islamic Republic as a whole, is an even trickier business. Depending on which demise one is talking about\u2014Ahmadinejad's presidency or the mullah-state\u2014and a variety of imponderables, it could be a matter of months or of generations. But there may be a considerable window for political change to occur before the nuclear point of no return. At the moment, the Bush administration's policy seems to be taken straight from the self-sabotage playbook\u2014quite a thick volume when it comes to America's relations with Iran. Were our goal to persuade the Iranian regime to hasten its nuclear race while binding it more closely to a weary and discontented populace, it's hard to see how we could be advancing it more effectively. Especially in the past month, American policy has seemed more about rattling sabers than carrots and sticks. In this week's installment, Vice President Cheney, who may just be twisted enough to want a military confrontation with Iran, underscored that the aircraft carrier USS Stennis is being sent to the Persian Gulf as a \" [strong signal](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/28/AR2007012801075.html?nav=hcmodule)\" of warning. This comes on the heels of our detention of several Iranian \"diplomats\" in Iraq on suspicion of aiding anti-American insurgents. Such belligerence seems unlikely to produce the result we desire for a variety of reasons. For one, our bluster is essentially empty. The United States lacks plausible military options for taking out Iran's nuclear program and dealing with the potential reaction, especially now that we are bogged down in Iraq. It is also proving extremely difficult to get the rest of the world to go along with the kind of comprehensive sanctions that would bite. Meanwhile, America's hostility is supplying Ahmadinejad with an external demon for his propaganda and helping him cover over his domestic failures. This American push for futile sanctions follows a [familiar pattern](http://www.slate.com/id/2147058/), extending from Cuba to Burma to "}
