METHODS:Com-COV2 was a single-blinded to receive a second [dose]8-12 weeks later with either the homologous [monitoring]were performed over nine months. Analyses of antibody and cellular assays were performed on an [intention]-to-treat [population]without evidence of COVID-19 [infection]at baseline or for the trial duration. FINDINGS:In April/May 2021, 1072 participants were enrolled at a median of 9.4 weeks after receipt of a [single dose]of [ChAd](N = 540, 45% [female]) or BNT (N 532, 39% [female]) as part of the national [vaccination]programme. In [ChAd]-primed participants, [ChAd]/Mod had the highest anti-spike [IgG]from day 28 through to 6 months, although the heterologous vs homologous geometric mean ratio (GMR) dropped from 9.7 (95% CI ( [confidence interval]) 8.2, 11.5) at D28 to (95% 5.0, 7.7) at D196. The heterologous/homologous GMR for [ChAd]/NVX similarly dropped from CI2.5,3.5) to 2.4 (95% CI1.9, 3.0). In was [similar]between homologous [schedules]with BNT/Mod inducing the highest duration of The adjusted GMR (aGMR) for BNT/Mod compared with BNT/BNT increased from 1.36 (95% CI 1.17, 1.58) at D28 to 1.52 (95% CI 1.21, 1.90) at D196, was generated immunogenic over [time]in comparison to BNT/NVX. The emerging data on mixed [schedules]using the novel [vaccine]platforms deployed in the COVID-19 pandemic, suggest that heterologous priming [schedules]might be considered as a Similares MEDLINE ...
