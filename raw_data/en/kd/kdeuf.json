Adequate rest, stress management, good nutrition and proper handwashing are all essential practices that keep us healthy through the Fall and Winter. But did you know that acupuncture is also an amazing tool for strengthening your immune system?](http://www.eldoradocommunityacupuncture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sickdog.jpg) Acupuncture treatment induces rapid, measurable changes in the immune system. [This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10437265) of two common immune-boosting acupuncture points found that \"monocyte phagocytosis\" (white blood cells eating up invading microbes) and Natural Killer cell activity both increased significantly following treatment. Monocyte phagocytosis was increased in 45% of the treated subjects within 30 minutes from starting treatment, and in 100% of them after 24 hours. The percentage of Natural Killer cells in the blood was also increased in 40% of cases after 30 minutes, and in 50% after 24 hours. Those are some pretty impressive changes from just two acupuncture points. Everyone can benefit from seasonal tune-up treatments to strengthen the immune system while they're still feeling well. If you are already sick please rest at home to avoid spreading pathogens to vulnerable members of our community. I also have several great herbal formulas that you can keep on hand to take at the first sign of illness. Stay healthy this year "}
