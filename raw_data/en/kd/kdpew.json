Problems with vaccinations include: Vaccinations have come to play an important role in disease prevention. We cannot deny the advantage of vaccination, however, at the same time we wonder about the sense of a universal approach, where individualisation would be more appropriate. Mass preventative measures require an overstated impact, while individualisation be more targeted and fine-tuned. Unfortunately, it does not make financial sense to individualise, because it requires specific evaluation of every case. We also lack the expertise and knowledge to be able to accurately predict all individual outcomes. We know that we are dealing with an epidemic of allergies, Asthma, Attention Deficit Disorder and Autism in children. We are also seeing an increased incidence of auto-immune disease and malignancies in children (as well as our adult population). The reasons for this are hard to confirm, but there are numerous theories. Increased exposure to vaccination at a vulnerable age is one theory. Vaccines are prepared from either dead or weakened organisms. Vaccines are grown on cells that could be from human or animal origin (foetal material, monkey kidney tissue, bovine protein, eggs, etc.) The purpose of vaccination is to artificially create active immunity to the particular pathogen injected, so that the person receiving the vaccine will be resistant to that pathogen when exposed naturally in future. Immunity is dependent on seroconversion. No long-term studies regarding the efficacy or risks exist. When speaking to parents of children who are absolutely certain that their children experienced regression in speech, behaviour and health directly after being vaccinated, one cannot deny the fact that vaccinations are playing a role in the development of sinister changes. In general, it seems as though there are certain predisposing and existing conditions that are further compromised by vaccinating a vulnerable child. Vaccination carries an objective set of potential short-term side-effects including: Measles NEVER vaccinate a child who is ill or on medication, no matter what illness he/she has. For me, the most serious underlying disorder would be any gastro-intestinal abnormally: constipation, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, gastro-enteritis, even reflux, as I believe that underlying gastro-intestinal inflammation predisposes to vaccine complications, especially where the measles vaccine is concerned. Recurrent infections, Eczema and allergies present a risk, I feel, too. Make sure that development is well within normal limits before vaccinating. One can postpone vaccination until a safer time, if there is doubt about milestones. Obviously, where a child has to be enrolled in a cr\u00e8che or care facility or in a third world situation where there is concentrated exposure to many other children, the risk of contracting infections is higher, so that would affect one's consideration. One can test immunity by doing a blood test. This is not a cost-effective option for third world countries or where cost is a concern, however, it is a logical way to individualise the amount of vaccinations a child will be exposed to. 21.
