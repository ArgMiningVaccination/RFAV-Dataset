Application Review Information](#_Section_V._Application) [Section VII. Agency Contacts](#_Section_VII._Agency) [Section VIII. Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) While there has been progress at developing therapeutic and services interventions for the acute management of many mental health disorders, far less attention has been paid to developing and testing mental health interventions and services to improve longer-term outcomes and recovery of function. More research on post-acute phase interventions and services is warranted given that there is increasing awareness that mental health conditions are often chronic or relapsing (e.g., anxiety disorders, mood disorders, ADHD, psychotic disorders) and mental disorders are better conceptualized and managed as chronic conditions. The clinical response to currently available pharmacological, device-based and psychosocial interventions is often incomplete. Therapeutic gains can dissipate with time, and residual symptoms and impairment pose risk for relapse and ongoing dysfunction. Even when acute treatment is successful, the risk for associated downstream comorbidities (e.g., substance abuse disorders) remains high. Management of many mental disorders requires not only ongoing treatment to prevent symptom recurrence, but interventions to promote long-term adherence to treatment plans and engagement with providers and health systems. Research Scope and Objectives The purpose of this funding initiative is to encourage research projects to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic and services interventions for the post-acute phase management of mental health conditions affecting youth and adults, including older adults. The clinical trial should also be designed and sufficiently powered to definitively test effectiveness. The study should also be designed to address hypotheses regarding predictors and moderators of effectiveness, in order to examine whether the intervention engages the target/mechanism(s) presumed to underlie the intervention effects and to address questions regarding the role of such mechanisms in producing clinical benefit. For purposes of this FOA, acute treatment refers to the management of an episode, crisis, or worsening of mental illness that requires intense treatment in order to contain symptoms, prevent harm, and stabilize functioning, in either outpatient or hospital settings. While the goal of acute treatment is typically symptomatic improvement, management of immediate risks for harm, and behavioral stabilization, continuation and maintenance treatment aims to achieve symptom recovery and return the patient to an optimal baseline of functioning, while preventing relapse and recurrence. Likewise, following acute-phase treatment, additional interventions and/or services might be necessary to facilitate care transitions (e.g., from inpatient services to outpatient care) or promote appropriate adherence and continuity of services. Across conditions, post-acute phase interventions/service strategies are needed that are matched to the stage of illness in terms of both their focus (e.g., consolidating and maintaining gains from initial treatment, managing residual symptoms/impairment, preventing relapse, promoting adherence and appropriate service use) and intensity/burden, in order to ensure that the interventions are not only relevant and effective, but also acceptable and sustainable for promoting optimal longer-term outcomes. Technology-assisted approaches might be especially useful for facilitating post-acute phase monitoring, for delivering interventions (e.g., maintenance therapy, relapse prevention), and for promoting treatment engagement/adherence and appropriate service use. Examples of relevant research topics include but are not limited to: Consistent with the NIMH experimental therapeutics approach ( [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2012/experimental-medicine.shtml](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2012/experimental-medicine.shtml) ), this FOA is intended to support studies that not only test the intervention effects on the outcomes of interest, but also inform on the mechanisms of action of the intervention. As such, the scope of work must include specification of intervention targets/mechanisms and assessment of intervention-induced changes in the presumed targets/mechanisms that are hypothesized to account for the intervention outcomes (see NIMH web page on [Clinical Trials](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas/index.shtml)). In this manner, the results of the trial will advance knowledge regarding therapeutic change mechanisms and be informative regardless of trial outcomes (e.g., in the event of negative results, information about whether the intervention was successful at engaging its targets can facilitate interpretation). NIMH encourages a deployment-focused model of intervention and services design and testing that takes into account the perspective of relevant stakeholders (e.g., patients, providers, administrators, payers) and the key characteristics of the settings that are intended to implement optimized mental health interventions. This attention to end-user perspectives and characteristics of intended clinical and/or community practice settings is intended to ensure that the resultant interventions and service delivery strategies are acceptable to consumers and providers, to ensure that the approaches are feasible and scalable in the settings where individuals are served, and to ensure that the research results will have utility for end users. NIMH encourages effectiveness research on potentially scalable preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions that focuses on practice-relevant questions. Accordingly, collaborations between academic researchers and clinical or community practice partners or networks are encouraged. When possible, studies should capitalize on existing infrastructure (e.g., practice-based research networks such as the NIMH-sponsored [Mental Health Research Network (MHRN)](http://hcsrn.org/mhrn/en/), electronic medical records, administrative data bases, patient registries, institutions with Clinical and Translational Science Awards) to increase the efficiency of participant recruitment (i.e., more rapid identification and enrollment) and to facilitate the collection of moderator data (e.g., clinical characteristics, biomarkers), longer-term follow-up data, and broader, stakeholder-relevant outcomes (e.g., mental health and general health care utilization, value and efficiency of intervention approaches). Effective prevention and treatment of mental illness have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with intentional injury (i.e., suicide attempts and deaths, see: [www.suicide-research-agenda.org](https://nihguide.nih.gov/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/AppData/Local/Microsoft/rwagenaa.NIH/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/Q)). Lack of attention to the assessment of these outcomes has limited our understanding regarding the degree to which effective mental health interventions might offer prophylaxis. Where feasible and appropriate, NIMH encourages intervention research that includes assessment of suicidal behavior in order to advance understanding of how effective prevention and treatment of mental disorders might impact suicide relevant outcomes. Information about the mission, strategic plan and research interests of the NIMH can be found at the NIMH website ( [http://www.nimh.nih.gov](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/)/) including [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/strategic-objectives/index.shtml](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/strategic-objectives/index.shtml). Applicants are also strongly encouraged to review the information on the NIMH website focused on clinical trials [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/clinical-trials-for-researchers/index.shtml](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/clinical-trials-for-researchers/index.shtml). Scale and Scope of Studies Covered Under this Announcement This FOA is intended to support effectiveness trials testing post-acute phase interventions that are statistically powered to provide a definitive answer regarding the study intervention's effectiveness in comparison to usual care practices or alternative intervention/services approaches. The study should also be designed to address hypotheses regarding predictors and moderators of effectiveness, to examine whether the intervention engages the target/mechanism(s) presumed to underlie the intervention effects, and to address questions regarding the action of such mechanisms in producing clinical benefit. Support for pilot effectiveness trials to inform the design of definitive effectiveness trials and to evaluate the initial feasibility, tolerability, acceptability, safety and preliminary indications of effectiveness of post-acute phase intervention approaches is provided via TPA (Pilot Effectiveness Trials for Post-Acute Interventions and Services to Optimize Longer-term Outcomes (R34)). This FOA is intended to support research focused on the effectiveness of therapeutic and service-delivery interventions: (1) that are intended specifically for the post-acute management of mental health conditions, and (2) that principally involve the use of research-supported strategies (e.g., in sequence or in combination), matched to the stage of illness. Applications focused on the development and initial efficacy testing of novel intervention strategies and/or novel intervention targets for the post-acute phase or on interventions for the acute phase of treatment will not be supported under this FOA. Applicants are encouraged to visit the [NIMH Clinical Trial web page](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas/index.shtml#2) for a list of alternative FOAs, including FOAs that are intended to support the translation of emerging basic science findings of mechanisms and processes underlying mental disorders into novel psychosocial interventions (\"Development of Psychosocial Therapeutic and Preventive Interventions for Disorders,\" (R61/R33) RFA-MH-18-705 (R33)) and (\"Early Stage Testing of Pharmacologic or Device-based Interventions for the Treatment of Mental Disorders,\" (RFA-MH-18-702 (R61/R33) and RFA-MH-18-702 (R33)). Effectiveness research for acute-phase interventions is supported through additional FOAs, including \"Pilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Prevention and Services Interventions\" (RFA-MH-18-706 (R34)) and \"Clinical Trials to Test the Effectiveness of Treatment, Preventive, and Services Interventions\" (RFA-MH-18-701 (R01) and RFA-MH-18-700 (Collaborative R01)). trials applications consistent with [NIMH priorities](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/strategic-research-priorities/index.shtml) are encouraged to visit the [NIMH Clinical Trial web page](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas/index.shtml#2) and consult with Scientific/Research Staff regarding FOAs that are appropriately matched to the study scope and stage of intervention development and testing. For multi-site trials, use of [single IRBs](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-094.html) is expected. Applications with data collection plans that involve multiple respondent groups (e.g., clients/patients, therapists/providers, supervisors, administrators) should address provisions for human subject protections and consenting procedures for all participant groups, accordingly. The NIMH has published updated policies and guidance for investigators regarding human research protection and clinical research data and safety monitoring ( [NOT-MH-15-025](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-15-025.html)). The application's Protection of Human Subjects section and data and safety monitoring plans should reflect the policies and guidance in this notice.

NIMH encourages the use of common data elements (CDEs) in basic, clinical, and applied research, patient registries, and other human subject research to facilitate broader and more effective use of data and advance research across studies. CDEs are data elements that have been identified and defined for use in multiple data sets across different studies. Use of CDEs can facilitate data sharing and standardization to improve data quality and enable data integration from multiple studies and sources, including electronic health records. NIH ICs have identified CDEs for many clinical domains (e.g., neurological disease), types of studies (e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWAS)), types of outcomes (e.g., patient-reported outcomes), and patient registries (e.g., the Global Rare Diseases Patient Registry and Data Repository). NIH has established a \"Common Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal\" (http://cde.nih.gov/) to assist investigators in identifying NIH-supported CDEs when developing protocols, case report forms, and other instruments for data collection. The Portal provides guidance about and access to NIH-supported CDE initiatives and other tools and resources for the appropriate use of CDEs and data standards in NIH-funded research. Investigators are encouraged to consult the Portal and describe in their applications any use they will make of NIH-supported CDEs in their projects. Applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in [the policy](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=82299). Any instructions provided here are in addition to the instructions in the policy. Important Update: See [NOT-OD-18-228](/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-18-228.html) for updated review language for due dates on or after January 25, 2019. Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. As part of the [NIH mission](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149), all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. In addition, for applications involving clinical trials: A proposed Clinical Trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. Additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is there a strong scientific premise for the project? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? How well does the application justify the practical effect of the intervention or service approach in terms of the estimated hypothesized effect size (e.g., in terms of remediation of residual symptoms or functional impairment, reduced likelihood of relapse or re-hospitalization, improved adherence), compared with already available approaches? How well does the application address both (1) the empirical basis for the anticipated effect size (e.g., citing data regarding the magnitude of the association between the target and the clinical endpoint of interest and/or effect sizes obtained in prior efficacy studies), and (2) the clinical meaningfulness of the anticipated increment in effects compared to existing approaches? If the approach is successful, what are the potential scalability and potential for dissemination into practice given typically available resources (e.g., trained, skilled providers), typical service structures (including health care financing), and typical service use patterns? In addition, for applications proposing clinical trials Are the scientific rationale and need for a clinical trial to test the proposed hypothesis or intervention well supported by preliminary data, clinical and/or preclinical studies, or information in the literature or knowledge of biological mechanisms? For trials focusing on clinical or public health endpoints, is this clinical trial necessary for testing the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention that could lead to a change in clinical practice, community behaviors or health care policy? For trials focusing on mechanistic, behavioral, physiological, biochemical, or other biomedical endpoints, is this trial needed to advance scientific understanding? Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? As appropriate, how well does the trial involve collaborations and/or input from community practice partners/providers, consumers, and relevant policy makers in a manner that informs the research (e.g., to help ensure that the intervention/service delivery approach is acceptable, practical, and scalable) and helps to ensure the results will have utility for end-users?

Recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights law. This means that recipients of HHS funds must ensure equal access to their programs without regard to a person's race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, sex and religion. This includes ensuring your programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency. HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA. HHS provides general guidance to recipients of FFA on meeting their legal obligation to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to their programs by persons with limited English proficiency. Please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/special-topics/limited-english-proficiency/index.html. The HHS Office for Civil Rights also provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html); and [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/laws-regulations-guidance/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/laws-regulations-guidance/index.html). Recipients of FFA also have specific legal obligations for serving qualified individuals with disabilities.
