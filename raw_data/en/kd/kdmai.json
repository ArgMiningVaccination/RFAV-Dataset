The Philosophy upon which Chiropractic is based can be summed up in one simple phrase: Innate Intelligence. Put simply the human body has an in-built (Innate) system, which is designed to heal itself (Intelligence). Chiropractors aim to remove interferences from the nervous system (known as subluxations) that stop the bodies 'Innate Intelligence' from healing them naturally. \"We focus on eliminating the root cause of your problems instead of chasing your symptoms\" Treatments primarily focus on the alignment and function of the nervous system by addressing the function of the joints of the body, particularly those of the spine. This is achieved using gentle techniques known as adjustments alongside other hands on techniques, such as mobilisation and massage. Treatment sessions will also often include advice regarding exercise, rehabilitation and dietary changes. In order to provide the best care available we also co-manage patients with various healthcare professionals and have good communication links with local GPs and Consultants.
