It w as in this c ase be tween the mis trust of doct ors and the dr ama f eels in r esponse t o the challeng es doct o mak e her self look lik e a her o. He jus t happened t o be a child who did g et better. ed, which is discussed in further de tail in the ne xt section. The dr ama tic tone also fulfills a need f or immediacy tha t remains unsa tiated b y the traditional pr ocesses and me thodologies of science. Ther e are complic ated ar eas amoun ts of time t o provide answers\u2014this is especially c onfusing and up setting t o the la yper son, who migh t be a ffected b y an illness or c ondition tha t science has not y et shed suf ficien t ligh t on. McCarth y, by providing a drama tic and f ast-paced narr ative, comforts her r eader s as she fulfills this need f or immediacy ,Saraf25 while glossing o ver the time-c onsuming na tead r eframing this time-in tensiv eness as inaction on the part of r esear cher s and doct ors. Saman tha Gr ay, one of the mother s who adds her narr ative into McCarth y's book, has a story tha t demons trates this c onsequence of the heigh tened pace of the s tories pr esen ted. When Gr ay learns tha t her child, Z ach, migh t have autism, she begins t o sear ch for possible treatmen t options. She t alks about ho w her husband, Gar y, was \"pr etty much in denial or jus t settled with wha t the medic al community sa ys, which is tha t nothing c an be done\" (115). In the same y ear tha t this piece w as writ ten, CNN published an article tha t referred to autism as \" one of the gr eatest mysteries of medicine. \"Additionally ,the article w ent on t o say tha t \"scien tists4 and doct ors still kno w very little about the neur ologic al disor der.\"4Although both the s tatemen t from Gr ay's story and the CNN article r eference the lit tle in forma tion tha t is kno wn about autism, Gr ay's story says tha t the medic al community claims \"nothing c an be done\" wher eas in reality , doct ors and scien tists ar e working t o learn mor e about the disor der. Regardless, Gr ay appear s frus trated with this lack of kno wledg e (justifiably so) and begins doing r esear ch tha t tells her about a specializ ed die t tha t ma y help her son, Z ach. \" ... after all m y resear ch, I decided t o start b y ordering some enz ymes, c olostrum, and vit amins, and t o finally s tart Z ach on the glut en-free, c asein- free die t.\" Following is an e xample of ho w elemen ts of a quick ened s tory satisfy with I bough t every nondair y milk tha t I could find, rice milk, almond milk, all the s tuff that the y say is ok ay to drink. And the ne xt day, I mix ed a half -and-half of the milk he 4(Willingham 2008)Saraf26 was drinking and the ne w nondair y milk. On the sec ond da y, I noticed a dif ference\" (116). The fir st componen t supporting the c ontinua tion of the dr ama tic narr ative is ho w Gr ay appear s to be disc ontent with the idea tha t \"nothing c an be done, \" and as a r esult, t akes action. Gr ay's actions mak e her look lik e her o or pr otagonist\u2014almos t like a r evolutionar y. In a time when no one else c ares or has the kno wledg e to act, Gr ay conduct ed resear ch all b y her self, and t ook action\u2014she t ook c oncr ete steps to correct an issue. This portr ayal of Gr ay as a her o is the fir st aspect of the dr ama tic narr ative tha t ultima tely sa tisfies a need f or immediacy . Later, however, there is an e ven mor e explicit demons tration of quickness tha t satisfies r eader s. Gr ay says tha t \"on the sec ond da y, [she] noticed a dif ference. \"Onthe sec ond day. Medic al resear ch har dly, if ever, would pr ovide ans wers to a pr oblem o ver the c ourse of 24 hour s. Not only did Gr ay notice a dif ference immedia tely, she t ook an e xtremely w-stakes action t o achie ve pot entially life-changing r esults. Tha t is, she mix ed half of her ne w milk with half of the milk he w as alr eady drinking. She didn't e ven switch out his r egular milk c omple tely with the nondair y milk\u2014she only s witched out half . With such a lo w-stakes action, she w as able t o see r esults; not only did she see r esults, she sa w them one da y later. As discussed earlier , rigorous medic al resear ch tha t sheds ligh t on c omple x issues lik e beha vioral conditions oft en requir es years of dedic , testing, failur e, and tal s in kno wledg e or theor y. Gray's experience is not c onsis tent with this a t all. The aim her e is not t o impugn Gr ay's char acter or the v alidity of her s tory tha t she w as br ave enough t o shar e. Ra ther, it is t o sho wcase the dr ama tic, f ast, action-pack ed narr ative tha t vaccine-hesit ant anecdot es seem t o shar e, and t o investigate ho w this c ommon thr ead sa tisfies a v acancy le ft by traditional science, making it so appealing t oSaraf27 reader s. The immediacy seen in Gr ay's story supports the dr ama of McCarth y's book, and satiates reader s in a w ay tha t science is fundamen tally unable t o do. Lisa Ack erman, mother t o Jeff, also uses a h yperboliz ed tone t o shar e her e xperiences, and e xhibits a desir e for quick r esults tha t traditional, scien tifically sound medicine is unlik ely t o satisfy. She shar es her e xperiences and r eactions t o hyperbaric chamber ther apy for her son, appearing frus trated when it does not pr ovide immedia te results, and la ter, once it does appear to provide r esults, seems thrilled. During the summer of sec ond gr ade, w e started to do mild h yperbaric o xygen ther apy. Jeff was pr escribed f or forty sessions and I w as anno yed a t first going t o those sessions because I f elt the y were eating up time in our da y. It w as taking a way from speech therapy and I beg an to get irrit ated. I w ould c all Glen and whine, \" This suck s, suck s, suck s, suck s, suck s!\" Then, on the tw enty-first session, w e came out of the t ank, and the chamber dude, E ddie, look ed a t Jeff and ask ed, \"Ho w do y ou feel? \" ... I called Glen on the w ay home, scr eaming , \"Hyperbaric ther apy is the bes t thing in the w orld! I love it!\" (78). At first, Ack erman mak es it clear tha t she is dissa tisfied with h yperbaric o xygen ther apy, given how time c onsuming it is, and tha t it has not y et provided \"t angible\" r esults. The e vidence f or this lies in the f act tha t Ack erman is frus trated with o xygen ther apy, only un til it pr ovides results. This seems logic al\u2014if a ther apy is not pr oviding immedia te results, and is t aking time away from another f orm of ther apy, frus tration seems an appr opria te reaction. A t the same time, it r eflects a lack of appr eciation f or the slo w de velopmen t tha t is usually an ine xtricableSaraf28 part of medic al treatmen ts. With these tr eatmen ts, it t akes a lot of time t o see r esults. Oftentimes, the c ourse of tr eatmen t itself is not pleasan t\u2014tha t is, while tr eatmen t is being adminis tered, the pr ogress is alw ays clear\u2014in these situa tions, the r esults bec ome clear er at the end of tr eatmen t. When Ack erman sa ys, \"I w as anno yed a t first going t o those sessions because I f elt the y were eating up time in our da y,\" she e xhibits an impa tience with a tr eatmen t that sho ws an inability t o appr eciate the na turally time-c onsuming na ture of a tr eatmen t process. Ack erman describes ho w after his tw enty-first session of h yperbaric o xygen ther apy, Jeff responded positiv ely\u2014he has a liv ely c onversation with the lab t echnician and Ack erman herself, and then, Ack erman r esponds b y saying, \"Hyperbaric ther apy is the bes t thing in the world! I lo ve it!\" Jus t before Jeff's conversation with her , she w as expressing a s trong resen tmen t toward hyperbaric o xygen ther t o \"see\" r esults, wever, chang es her a ttitude c omple tely: no w, she lo ves it. The r ole of the immediacy in r esults is clear: when Ackerman c annot see pr ogress being made immedia tely, she declar es tha t a ther apy is a w aste of time; ho wever, as soon as she is able t o see r esults, her a ttitude shifts 180 degr ees. Be yond a depiction of a na tural human t endency , this e xample demons trates the e xcessiv e fixation on immediacy of r esults tha t real, scien tifically sound medic al treatmen ts har dly e ha ve. Additionally , whene ver gr oundbr eaking r esults ar e achie ved in science, the y mus t have reproducibility . In other w ords, other scien tific e xperimen ts mus t be able t o replic ate the r esults of other e xperimen ts for those r esults t o be c onsider ed valid. Her e, the v erific ation s tep is le ft out en tirely, but Ack erman' s reaction does not r eflect this. The need f or immediacy in r esults is clear , and a quick ened pace inMother W arriorssatisfiesthis need. The e xcitemen t, engagemen t, and action gr anted b y drama tic, h yperboliz ed, polarizing languag e satisfies theSaraf29 vacancy le ft by the lack of e xcitemen t in r eal science. F or ins tance, when member s of the Americ an Ac adem y of P edia trics (AAP) agr ee to join her f or a c onversation on v accines and autism, and agr ee to work with D AN!, McCarth y is w ary of the AAP r eneging on their pr omise: They were jus t words on a piece of paper a t this poin t but I w as hoping the AAP w ould f ollow through. If the y don't, of c ourse, I will hold up their pr ess r elease on e very talk sho w until m y fing ers bleed (118-119). Beyond displa ying McCarth y's dedic ation, and willingness t o take action, she uses h yperbole t o show the leng ths she is wiling t o go to in or der t o ensur e tha t her in terests ar e preser ved. The hyperbole and the action sho wn s tand in c ontrast to the slo w, ture of the scien tific pr ocess. y describes her experience speaking t o represen tatives of the AAP , saying, \"I thank ed her nicely , hung up the phone, and then dr opped t o the floor as if someone had jus t shot me. I w as so wick edly exhaus ted and I r ealiz ed I migh t jus t die an early dea th fr om all of this\" (33-34). Not only does McCarth y's languag e mak e the book e xciting and eng aging t o read, the e xcitemen t added b y this languag e is a char acteristic lar gely ticated people who r ead McCarth y's book also ha ve a need f or immediacy , which is being indir ectly sa tisfied b y the heigh tened pace tha t comes fr om dr ama tic, h yperboliz ed languag e. Traditional medic al disc ourse does not ha ve the same char acteristics as McCarth y's book, e ven though both ar e technic ally medic al disc ourses, with pot ential clinic implic ations. Medic al disc ourse's main char acteristics ar e careful, slo w, only making s tatemen ts and suggestions tha t are support ed b y evidence, and do not c ontain dr ama tized languag e, only carefully chosen languag e to represen t the e xacting na ture of medicine and science. This seemsSaraf30 to lea ve a v acancy in the minds of the scien tifically unsophis ticated, in the f orm of a cr aving f or results and quickness. This v acancy is sub tly filled b y the sensa tionalis tone ead w eaving thr ough man y is the presump tion of kno wledg e. Tha t is, man y of the writ ers of these narr atives seem t o misunder stand the flo w of logic and in forma tion tha t leads t o scien tific de velopmen t and ne w knowledg e. Fir st, ther e is a pr eexisting trus t in wha t is familiar , observable, and simple. McCarth y and the other moms writing inMother W arriorstend t o trus t and under stand macr oscopic c oncep ts tha t can be seen and ar e \"tangible. \" This t endency leads t o a diminished appr eciation f micr of biochemis try, toxicology , and thus the basic sciences of medicine o verall. A mor e do wnstream r esult of this is the per ception tha t science on the issue of autism is s tagnan t, and tha t resear cher s and doct ors are doing lit tle to chang e this s tatus quo. In mos t cases, ph ysicians, scien tists, and healthc are provider s in g ener al in McCarth y's book ar e depict ed as unc aring , dismissiv e, and a t their w orst, inc ompe tent. Worse, the mother s then assume the r ole of de veloping an under standing of v accine science and autism without the appr opria te resour ces and r equisit e kno wledg e to do so. In mos t cases, a pos t hoc er go propter hoc line of r easoning is f ollowed, which is t oo dang erous in such a comple x, high s takes situa tion.Saraf31 When McCarth y goes on Opr ah's live sho w, Opr ah ask s her t o explain wh y she think s her son, E van, bec ame autis tic. This happens righ t at the s tart of McCarth y's book, within the stream of c onsciousness fr ame work of the opening chap ter. Her e, McCarth y is being ask ed to provide an e xplana tion tha t even the w orld' s top doct ors have yet to under stand. In f act, the presiden t of the K ennedy K rieger Ins titut e, one of the leading US F acilities f or autism r esear ch and tr eatmen t, Dr. Gar y Golds tein, has said despit e the kno wledg e scien r unans wered.4McCarth y is thenleft to her o wn in tuition t o giv e an explana tion f or a c oncep tha t is irr efutably science-based, and should be ans wered by science. Thr oughout this, w e need t o keep in mind tha t her celebrity s tatus boos ts her credibility t o man y audiences.2Ther efore, her w ordshold e xtra weigh t. Regardless, a fter Opr ah asks her t o explain her son' s autism, she r esponds b y saying, \"We vaccina ted our bab y and SOMETHING happened. SOMETHING happened. \" (15-16). This e xplana tion is a perf ect e xample of se veral of the themes in v accine-hesit ant narr atives. Fir st, McCarth y follows the pos t hoc er go propter hoc line of r easoning. This is a logic f allacy wher ein someone belie ves tha t, bec ause event B followed e vent A, event B mus t have beencausedby event A. This type of logic al fallacy tends t o take hold especially when it is applied in a gr ey area wher e science has not y et provided de finitiv e explana tions. McCarth y belie ves tha t bec ause she beg an noticing signs of autism in E van a fter he w as vaccina ted, the v accina tion mus t have someho w caused his autism. y communic ates her dissa tisfaction ause their r eluct ance t o belie ve McCarth y's story, and in doing so , demons trates her line of r easoning , within which several interesting and c ommon pa tterns emer ge. Mos tly, she appear s frus trated with the physicians' denial tha t vaccines c aused E van's autism, occurr akes up the r ole of e vidence. W e think of e yewitness accounts as the mos t reliable f orm of t estimon y, bec ause the e yes ne ver lie. Wha t is visible is real. McCarth y reveals this t o be her mode of thinking as she e xpresses her frus tration with ho w doct ors are handling E van's case. Imagine w atching y our child climb up a fligh t of s tairs. He slip s on a s tair and cuts his knee open and begins gushing blood. The cuts ar e deep, and y ou immedia tely w ash away the blood, wr ap up the knee, and head t o the hospit al. Once y ou g et ther e, the doct or ask s wha t happened. Y ou reply, 'He climbed up some s tairs and he f ell and g ot hurt. ' Now imagine the doct or telling y ou it 's not possible tha t your child g ot this hurt from s tairs. 'But I sa w him climb s tairs and f all and I sa w his knee split open, ' you e xplain. Again, the doct or sa ys, 'It 's not possible. ' And y ou repea t, 'But I sa w it happen!' Then the doct or tells y ou tha t climbing up s tairs is sa fe. But y ou kno w wha t you saw with y our o wn e yes and so y ou insis t, 'But ob viously some times it 's NO T safe. Look at my child. I sa w him g et hurt!' The doct or jus t keeps shaking his head and denies tha t stairs could e ver harm a child. (23-24). This analogy t o vaccine injur y is an e xcellen t choice b y McCarth y for se veral reasons. It giv es legitimacy t o the e yewitness mode of t estifying t o some thing (mak es the idea tha t seeing is belie ving look v ery legit). It is also a v ery relatable scenario\u2014almos t every par ent has g one through this e xact e xperience with their child. Also , it mak es McCarth y look v ery compe tent as aSaraf33 first responder in a a ttitude tha doct ors are made t o fit thr oughout the tical situa , ther e is micr oscopic doub t that the slipping on the s tair c aused the injur y on the child' s knee. Bec ause the action of the stair on the knee c an be ob served so dir ectly , and bec ause ther e is no simpler e xplana tion, it is reasonable and mos t use ful to say tha t the child slipped and f ell, and tha t the s tair cut open the knee. T o elabor ate on the pot ential c omple xity of a seemingly simple situa tion, le t us c onsider the same scenario , but with an older per son, sa y aged 75 y ears old. Although it w ould s till be the s tair tha t caused the cut ting of the knee, bec ause the pa tient is dif ferent, we mus t consider the possibility tha t the per son w as going thr ough a s yncopal episode, or w as feeling light-headed, which c aused him/her t o slip in the fir st place. But this underlying e xplana tion is not immedia tely ob vious, and is unlik ely t o be c onsider ed b y people f ollowing the same logic al flo w as McCarth y. The in tention behind the ne w hypothe tical situa tion is t o sho w that a seemingly simple situa tion c an be muddied when w e (ph ysicians and scien tists) tr y to under stand mor e underlying r easons behind cert ain medic al happenings. Ne vertheless, McCarth y sho ws how valuable and trus ted our sense of sigh t is when g athering e vidence t o arriv e at a conclusion. The dif ference be tween McCarth y's hypothe tical scenario and c ases involving v accines is tha t in the la tter case, if only the macr oscopic is c onsider ed, f ar too much instrumen tal evidence/ science/under standing is not acc ounted for. We mus t under stand tha t with medicine, visibility c annot be the only means b y which w e authen ticate a h ypothesis. Tha t is, w e cannot sa y, with e ven reasonable cert ainty, tha t a v accine c aused a cert ain r eaction b y relying only on the visible aspects of the v accine. Still, visible t estimon y appear s to be theSaraf34 primar y way in which McCarth y collects e vidence. Unlik e the knee cut ting e xample, the biochemic al action of the v accine inside the body c annot be seen b y the nak ed e ye. As w ell, in the s tair e xample, the mode of injur y was seen dir ectly , wher eas in the v accine c ase, it is being merely e xtrapola ted, based on wha t is visible. In addition, this particular scenario is e xtremely r elatable, it describes an ar chetypal experience with almos t every par ent. The r elatability indir ectly giv es mor e credibility t o McCarth y's line of r easoning , making par ent very likely t o sub scribe t o a similar use of visual evidence. R elatability is a theme thr oughout. Another import ant theme sho wn in this e xample is the a ttitude tha t doct ors are oft en shown t o ha ve; the doct or her e seems be in a sort of dismissiv e disbelie f about wha t him/her . \"The doct or jus t keeps shaking his head and denies tha t stairs could e ver harm a child\" (24). Not only is the doct or described her e in disbelie f, he seems v ery staunch in his idea tha t stairs could ha ve caused the child' s injur y. He does not amend his w ords to be tter explain himself , nor does he seem pr epar ed to accep t the mother 's story in the fir st place. As well, the doct or in this scenario does not pr ovide an y alt erna te explana tions t o the mother about ho w her child ma y have gotten injur ed. Although this is McCarth y's hypothe d sug gests tha t too man y healthc are provider s, or even lar ger sc ale public health c ampaigns f ocus on of fering c ounter ar gumen ts ins tead of listening and of fering some sort of r esponse tha t at leas t sho ws tha t the mother 's voice is being hear d and ackno wledg ed, r egardless of her messag e's truth v alue. In man y ways, a doct or and an essa yist have the same job: t o put tw o (or mor e) narr atives in c onversation with each other , and thr ough the c onnections the y ob serve, to try and put f orward some truth. While an essa yistSaraf35 may use poems, pla ys, or book s as his narr atives, a doct or mus t align his narr ative and the patient's narr ative, and dr aw out c onnections t o arriv e at the truth, which will then be communic ated to the pa e and wledg e of people, and a sense of empa thy. From McCarth y's messag e, it seems as though ph ysicians ar e failing t o appr eciate the pa tient narr ative and ar e ins tead pushing f orward a truth tha t is based en tirely on their o wn narr atives. sho wn with this a ttitude. In man y ways, the f ounda tion f or McCarth y's (and the other mom' s) pr esump tions of knowledg e are established b y their r eliance on in tuition, discussed in the prior section. The reliance on in tuition, ho wever, demons trates a br oader pa ttern of trus t and r easoning tha t man y human beings, especially people in volved in the v accine-hesit ant community seem t o have, which is a trus t and belie f in wha t can be seen, f elt, hear d, and t ouched. As w ell, the y appear t o trus t familiar sour ces, or sour ces tha t the y have been turning t o for a long while. I though t tha t I migh t be sensing an upc oming seiz ure, as I had in the pas t. As I la y glued t o him with m y eyes wide open, the f eeling in m y ches t got w orse. I s tarted to sweat and then I began to panic tha t some thing w as terribly wr ong with me. I r an to my good ol' comput er and w ent to my favorite univ ersity: the Univ ersity of Google. I sear ched f or heart palpit ations and it br ough t up an xiety and panic a ttacks. I sa t back in m y chair and realiz ed tha t Google w as righ t (19). Here, McCarth y demons trates a hea vy reliance on ins tinct righ t away. In the fir st sen tence, she suspects tha t she is \" sensing an upc oming seiz ure,\" which appar ently, she has done be fore. Of course, it 's import ant and use ful to be able t o process cert ain small en vironmen tal cues, tha tSaraf36 can result in the \" sensing \" feeling tha t McCarth y is describing , but the degr ee to which McCarth y relies on her ability t o sense medic al conditions is surprising. It is also import ant to note tha t she v alida tes her o wn ability b y saying \" as I had in the pas t.\" She appear s to be v ery confiden t in her ability t o sense whene ver some thing is amiss. The trus t in the f amiliar and unchanging is r eally demons trated when she runs t o her c omput er and begins t o sear ch her signs and s ymp toms on Google, though. She sa ys she r an to her \" good ol' c omput er\" which ma y seem insignific ant, tors \"good\" and \" ol'\" illus trate a type of familiarity , and ther efore trus t, she has in her c omput er. These w ords mak e it f eel f amiliar , as though it has been a c ompanion with her f or a signific ant period of time, which is part of the reason she trus ts it so much. Ther e is an inher ent trus tworthiness a ttached t o her c omput er, and this sho ws a tendency of v accine-hesit ant rhe t the tha t sen tence, she sho wcases her trus t in using an online sear ch engine, Google. She even refers to it as her \"f avorite univ ersity.\" The sen tence immedia sen tence show ho w McCarth y confers trus t on cert ain things in perhap s different ways, but both sho w an immense trus t in the f amiliar . By referring t o Google as her f avorite univ ersity, she essen tially tells r eader s tha t this is one of her mos t trus ted sour ces of in forma tion. The t erm univ ersity is ted with some educ ational es tablishmen t with the r esour ces, means, and responsibility of cr eating ne w kno wledg e. Referring t o Google as a univ ersity alludes not only t o the pr eponder ance of in forma tion online, but sub tly hin ts at the purport ed reliability of this informa tion. An e xtension of McCarth y's belie f in wha t is macr oscopic ally visible is her t endency t o categorize \"ph ysical\" illnesses as r eal illnesses. Tha t is, when a c ondition manif ests ph ysically isSaraf37 when it is legitima te and actionable. McCarth y discusses one of her appear ances on Diane Sawyer's talk sho w,Good Morning Americ a, and men tionswha t she think s the medic al community has not y et disc overed. Acc ording t o her , up un til this poin t, doct ors have been treating autism as a pur ely neur ologic al condition, when the y should ha ve realiz ed it is a physical illness. Bec ause ph ysicians and scien tists ha ve not y et recogniz ed tha t childr en with autism ar e ph ysically sick, the y are precluded fr om tr eating them e ffectiv ely. As w e talked about ho w the medic al community doesn't under stand tha t childr en with autism are actually ph ysically sick and ho w pedia tricians acr oss the c ountry have no idea ho w to fix them, I s tarted to realiz e tha t this w as some thing I needed t o pur sue a lit tle bit har der in the pr ess. Almos t every mom I kno w with a kid on the autism spectrum has g one t o a pedia trician who has NO IDE A tha t cert ain s ymp toms e xist in these kids (28-29). McCarth y's deliber ate use of the w ords \"actually \" and \"ph ysically\" before \"sick\" seem t o be her attemp t to attach legitimacy and actionability t o the c ondition of autism. McCarth y demons trates se veral recurring themes in this sen tence. A f alse equiv alency the example with McCarth y's child g etting injur ed on the s tairs; in tha t situa tion, McCarth y can implic ate the actual, ph ysical stair as the ag ent responsible f or her child' s injur y, bec ause she c anseeit happen. Similarly , the purport ed ph ysical signs tha t she is seeing in childr en with autism t ells her tha t the y aretrulyill, and f or this r eason,should be giv en mor e attention b y doct ors. This idea is support ed bec ause pr eviously , she men tioned ho w doct ors cite the inaccessibility of the brain as their r eason f or not being able t o provide tr eatmen t for autism. Although this is not actually true, this is McCarth y's per ception of doct ors. Ther e seems t o be a s trong r elationshipSaraf38 between visibility and truth or r eality f or McCarth y. A b yproduct of the c ontrived equiv alence between visibility and legitimacy is the diminished v alue of micr oscopic, less r eadily visible phenomena and e vidence. Tha t is, McCarth y implies tha t a lack of ph ysical signs indic ates either a lack of illness or a lack of tr eatability , which is of c ourse, not the c ase. P atients figh ting men tal health c onditions, f or ins tance, oft en only pr esen t with s ymp toms and do not sho w an y ph ysical signs. Despit e this, their illness is no less legitima te than someone suf fering fr om a on visibility e problema tically, diminishes the y neur ologic al conditions. McCarth y's idea tha t visible = r eal per sists as she r ecalls a phone conversation she had with a public r elations r epresen tative at the Americ an AAP R epresen tative: \"Well, she r esponded. \" We are deeply in volved with ne w treatmen t for autism. In f act in a c ouple of mon ths w e are coming out with a ne w pr otocol tha t requir es pedia tricians t o scr een f or autism twice be fore the ag e of tw o.\" McCarth y: \"Lis ten, these kids ar e sick no w, physically, do y ou hear me? Tha t's great and all, but your doct ors don't kno w ho w to treat these kids and the y can learn if the y jus t talk t o the D AN! doct ors, man y of whom ar e pedia tricians fr om the AAP \" the w ord \"ph ysically\" in c onjunction with \" sick,\" and in this c ase, does so t o add ur gency t o autism, which is the sickness she r efers to. McCarth y seems t o be sa ying tha t the situa tion is ur gent, and ph ysicians need t o act immedia tely,becausechildr en ar e no w ph ysically sick. The emer gence of ph ysical signs w as the thr eshold f or a cert ain le vel of import ance f or McCarth y, and she appear s to think tha t it should w ork the same w ay for healthc areSaraf39 provider s\u2014tha t is, the y should be as alarmed as she, no w tha t physical signs ar e appearing. McCarth y continues her assertiv e tone, and ultima tely r eceiv es affirma tion fr om the AAP represen tative she is speaking t o\u2014a t the end of their c onversation, she sa ys, \"'Okay, I'm going to ha ve someone c all you'\" (33). When McCarth y receiv es this positiv e response fr om a high ranking member of an ac ademic pedia tric c ommunity , it signifies t o reader s the v alidity of her actions. R eader s are then lik ely t o associa te visible s ymp toms with the seriousness of a condition. Additionally , this in teraction illus trates an earlier t ors, and the \"pr of McCarth y and her c ause. Ph ysicians seem t o only t ake McCarth y seriously once she asserts her self f orcefully, but once she does, ph ysicians who pr eviously did not c are seem t o appr eciate the ur gency of autism, since it ph ysically no w (acc ording to McCarth y). Michelle W oods also appear s to be a pr oponen t of the idea tha t physical illness represen ts actionable illness. When she r eceiv es in forma tion about K evin's diagnosis with autism, ph ysicians in formed her about beha vioral interventions she c ould begin. Ho wever, she observes tha t Kevin w asphysicallyill at the timeof diagnosis as w ell. T o her , this indic ates tha t his autism is \"medic ally based\" and c an be tr eated. The da y we got the diagnosis, I had no idea tha t Kevin's autism w as medic ally based. Nobody men tioned an ything t o me about immune de ficiency or immune r eactions or environmen tal toxins or an ything lik e tha t. Tha t was a w orld opened up t o me la ter. But when he g ot his diagnosis, the only thing the y were telling us w e could do w as start teaching him ho w to beha ve, essen tially r ewiring his beha vioral ne tworks so tha t he under stands ho w to cope with s tressful or an xiety-provoking situa tions. K evin w as soSaraf40 physically ill a t this e xact same time, I wish someone had t old me tha t it w as related! (54-55). Woods' r easoning her e implies tha t ther e is no \"medic al basis\" f or an illness unless it sho ws itself with some ph ysical signs. Tha t is, while she is being t old about beha vioral interventions t o impr ove Kevin's quality of lif e, she seems t o think tha t this means ther e is no medic al basis f or his c ondition\u2014if the only possible in tervention is beha vioral, this means the c ondition is, in a way, not y et real. Ho wever, the in flection poin t occur s when W oods c onnects K evin's autism with his ph ysical signs. Bec ause ther e are no w ph manif estations, W oods c oncludes tha t be medic ally based\u2014which legitimiz es it\u2014and it is no w actionable. It is also not eworth y tha t Woods does not belie ve beha vioral ther apy to be a signific ant form of treatmen t or action. It seems tha t the belie f tha t wha t is visible is r eal e xtends be yond e vidence for causa tive agents, in to legitimacy of tr eatmen ts. In other w ords, much of the e vidence thus far has sho wn tha t when it c omes t o evalua ting the c ause f or their childr en's autism, mother s are drawn t o implic ating wha t the y can see or f eel as r esponsible. But her e, W oods sho ws tha t this mindse t transcends jus t assigning r esponsibility t o wha t she belie ves to ha ve caused K evin's autism, and in volves ascribing legitimacy t o cert ain types of tr eatmen ts, based on whe ther the y are as t angible as other s. As a r esult, beha vioral ther apies ar e treated as less impactful as some biochemic al interventions. Ther e exists an in teresting ir ony her e: beha vioral interventions ar e consider ed less legitima te bec ause the y are less t angible as opposed t o medicines, but the insigh t to appr eciate the cellular mechanisms behind biochemic al medicines is ab sent. This example r einforces tha t ther e is a s trong belie f in the visible and t angible tha t man y of the mother s writing inMother W arriorsare exhibiting.Saraf41 McCarth y later talks about her appear ance on Barbar a Walters' sho w,The Barbara Walters Special. She discusses ho w ner vous she f eltbefore going liv e, similar t o ho w she f elt before speaking on Opr ah's talk sho w. Her e, ho wever, her ner vousness c ame fr om W alters' disagr eemen t with McCarth y on the c ontroversial link be tween v accines and autism; W alters says to her: \"'I said MOS T doct ors do NO T agr ee with an ything y ou're saying! Isn't tha t true? '\" (40). McCarth y responds b y explaining ho w \"it 's a shame tha t mos t doct ors don't kno w about these tr eatmen ts,\" but r epea tedly g ets cut of f by Walters shouting in a hos tile t one. When McCarth y is challeng ed on her claims tha t childr en with autism c an be \" cured,\" she sa ys tha t she does not belie ve childr en with autism c an be cur ed, but the y can recover: \"A great example I use [from St an K urtz] is tha t autism is lik e getting hit b y a bus. Y ou cannot bec ome cur ed fr om getting hit b y a bus, but y ou can recover\" (41-42). Although McCarth y's intention behind this example is t o represen t autism as an acut e affliction, much lik e getting hit b y some tr auma tic force, it sho wcases McCarth y's sus tained f ocus on the visibility of scien tific/medic al phenomena. In the e xample, a bus is the c ausa tive agent of injur y. This e xample aligns ell with McCarth y's earlier e xample in volving a child f alling and hurting himself on a s taircase, with the stairs themselv es acting as the c ausa tive agent of injur y. The c ommon thr ead be tween the tw o examples (fr om dif ferent sour ces) is tha t the ag ent directly e ffecting injur y is visible, and the mechanism of injur y is clear . In the s taircase e xample, the s tairs themselv es ar e visible, and the way tha t the f orceful c ontact be tween the s tair and the child' s knee tha t result ed in a cut is clear; similarly , in the bus e xample, the bus itself is clearly visible, and the mechanism of injur y, a trauma tic force to the body , is clear . Unfortuna tely, this same logic f ails when applied t o vaccine science. Not only ar e the biologic al ag ents in a v accine or medic al treatmen t invisible, soSaraf42 is the mechanism of action. But, McCarth y's fixation on wha t is visible a verts her appr eciation for these micr oscopic r ealities. o her , visibility is the main crit erion f or existence and pot ential for effecting a r esult. In other w ords, an object or ag ent's visibility t o the nak ed e ye represen ts its ability cr eate chang e. W oods' c onfidence in tr eatmen ts tha t she c an see c ontinues when she discusses the doct or's the doct or responsible or Kevin, s tarted a h yperbaric o xygen tr eatmen t for Kevin, which W oods seems t o appr eciate. Then Dr . Neubr mo ved me t o hyperbaric o xygen (ther apy tha t uses high-pr essur ed oxygen, usually in a chamber). I didn't s tart it righ t away. Part of the r eason it t ook me a little while t o get into hyperbaric is bec ause I w anted to see ph ysically, medic ally, wh y it worked. Ther e is a s tigma of autism moms being willing t o try anything and I will tr y some thing as long as ther e is a r eal basis t o it (57-58). Woods men tions tha t it took her time t o warm up t o the idea of h yperbaric ther apy bec ause she w anted toseewhy the w ord \"see\" isespecially import ant\u2014this emphasiz es the utility of visibility t o Woods (and other s who shar e a similar mindse t). She w anted to \"see\" wh y it worked, implying the ability of the e yes and the sense of sigh t to verify a truth, which in this case, is the e fficacy of h yperbaric o xygen tr eatmen t. The issue, then, is tha t we kno w not all truths ar e falsifiable thr ough sigh t; tha t is, some phenomena, especially medic al or scien tific, need t o akes adv antage of mor e t yes, appr eciating the micr oscopic. Ne xt, Woods alency be tween ph ysically and medic ally tha t she has es tablished thus f ar, when she sa ys tha t she w anted to see \"ph ysically, medic ally, wh y it ords \"medic ally\" is deliber ate, sho wcasing tha t Woods, like McCarth y, belie ves tha t physically = medic ally. The \" seeing is belie ving \" pattern of logic domina tes the en tire narr ative. Another mom who wr ote to McCarth y, Karen, ask s her ques tions about the v alidity of biomedic al treatmen ts. In r esponse, McCarth y discusses ho w she ackno wledg es tha t the biomedic al treatmen ts for which she is adv ocating will not be use ful for everyone. She does, ho wever, mak e men tion of the demogr aphic f or whom she think s biomedic al intervention is the bes t option, in a w ay tha t sho ws her me thod of char acterization of per sons with autism. Some moms ha ve even said tha t the y are ab solut ely fine with the w ay their childr en ar e and that their childr en don't need t o be \"fix ed.\" I agr ee tha t these kids ar e beautiful and perfect, but man y of them ar e sick\u2014ph ysically sick\u2014and these ar e the childr en tha t I hope t o help (107). Again, McCarth y mak es clear tha t her f ocus is on the \"ph ysically sick;\" whe ther this is bec eels the seriousness of ph ysical symp toms t o super sede non-ph ysical or because ph ysical illness impliestrueillness is notclear; in either c ase, McCarth y's priority is physical symp toms. She e xplains tha t she hopes t o help the \"ph ysically sick\" bec ause the other s are \"beautiful and perf ect\" and do not need help. The div orcing be tween a need f or help and invisibility of illness and the c onsequen tial union of ph ysically ill and r equiring help is pot entially problema tic. As sho wn b y prior e xamples, this type of thinking t ends t o legitimiz e aspects of conditions or illness tha t manif est physically and diminish the aspects tha t ma y not sho w themselv es as o vertly . Worse, this thinking leads t o an inability t o appr eciate the basic sciencesSaraf44 underlying medicine. The spotligh t focus on visible issues pene trates the en tirety ofMother Warriors, and is lik ely r epresen tative of much ofthe thinking of other v accine-hesit ant rhe tors. The emphasis on visibility and ph ysicality also applies t o McCarth y's and other s' evalua tions of se verity of autism, further demons trating their r eliance on visible char acteristics as a r eliable me tric/mode of e valua tion. Becky Behnan, one of the mother s inMother W arriors, writes about her son, Jack. McCarth y interviews Behnan and her son, and sa ys: While Jack t alked, I of c ourse ob served his beha vior t o see ho w much autism I could see. I ha ve to say, for a c ouple of minut es I had no idea. He seemed e xtremely polit e, with a lit tle bit of oddity in the t one of his v oice. He w as fully c onversational and the only hiccup I migh t have seen w as his not elabor ating on or e xtending his though ts. I was taken aback b y ho w much ligh t was coming out of this man. I truly c ouldn't g et enough of his ener gy. He w as lik e a ligh tbulb tha t went on when he w alked in to the room (92). McCarth y her e explicitly s tates the utility of her sigh t as a means f or verifying the pr esence of autism. McCarth y is not alone her e\u2014St an K urtz, a f ather t o Ethan, who is on the autism spectrum, f ollows cert ain alt erna tive medicine pr ently achie gr eat results; he sa ys about his son: \" The autism look ed g one, as if he' d jus t finished pooping it out of him\" (131). He also uses his sense of sigh t to verify the pr esence of autism, giving ph ysical manif estations cr scien who r tation and ed e xtrapola tion t o de termine wha t is occurring in a space wher e the e yes cannot see\u2014tha t is, wha t is happening a t the micr oscopic le vel, or e ven a t the a tomic le vel, is under stood b y scien tific e xperimen tation\u2014not sole me thod of c ollecting in forma tion. A small, but import ant piece of her languag e is the use of the phr ase \" of course\" be fore she t alks about ho w she w atches Jack' s beha vior. This indic ates her c onfidence in the fidelity of the e yes to provide in forma tion. She c onveys to her reader s tha t she has trus t in the visible, and so should the y. Her quan tification of autism, when she sa ys, \"ho w much autism\" par allels her earlier displa y of thinking tha t autism is acut e and almos t \"tangible, \" much lik e the e ffect of g etting hit b y a bus (t aken fr om her pr evious e xample). Associa tions e being of acut eness, t , and In response t o Behnan' s story, McCarth y recalls her o wn s truggles with E van: It tore my inside up when I used t o watch Evan injur e himself . I had no idea wh y he w as doing it until I r esear ched the beha vior and f ound it w as bec ause he w as in ph ysical pain. I focused on fixing tha t and did (107-108). The f ocus r emains on ph ysical conditions, and the y are then associa ted with actionability . This is problema tic for doct ors and scien tists, who f ocus on underlying c auses, as this mak es them look like the y are doing nothing. Saman tha Gr ay's story aligns with this pa ttern of thinking perf ectly . Her son Z ach liv es with autism, and she closes her le tter to McCarth y with a t one of discontentmen t toward ph ysicians: \" These childr en ar e ph ysically sick. It is not jus t in their minds\" (117). Perhap s the mos t revealing momen t in which McCarth y evinced a m yopia f or only clearly visible e vidence w as during her final momen ts on Opr ah's talk sho w. After asking McCarth y wha t she think s caused E van's autism, and ha ving her e xplain tha t she belie ves vaccines c an trig ger autism, Opr ah cit es a piece of e vidence fr om the Cen ters for DiseaseSaraf46 Control (CDC), tha t refutes an y link be tween v accines and autism. This e vidence is pr esen ted as an opportunity f or rebut tal from McCarth y, which she t akes: Oprah finished with a s tatemen t from the CDC , which said ther e was no science t o support the connection be tween v accines and autism. I c ouldn't help but think, \" Who needs science when I' m witnessing it e very day in m y own home? I w atched it happen. \" I replied with all the lo ve tha t I could mus ter in m y heart. \" At home, E van is m y science. \" (18-19). McCarth y's love and f ocus on her son ar e unbridled. In terestingly , it seems as though McCarth y is conflating her lo ve for her son, her desir e and sub sequen t effort tha t she will put in to ensuring her son' s health with ha ving the medic al/scien tific kno wledg e and e xpertise t o diminish the ability of science t o reveal the truth. In other w ords, she clearly lo ves her son v ery much. As w ell, she demons trates her willingness t o keep him health y thr ough har d work. Unfortuna tely, this lo ve and e ffort super sedes the ability of science t o de termine the truth, in her mind. When she sa ys, \"'Who needs science when I' m witnessing it e very day in m y own home? I w atched it happen'\" , she ag ain sho ws her r eliance on her sense of sigh t and ability t o eyewitness t o provide her with e vidence or the truth. The inability t o appr eciate scien tific c oncep ts tha t are less ob vious t o the nak ed e ye precludes McCarth y and other s from eng aging in an y productiv e discussion or under standing of biochemis try, physiology , or medicine in g ener al. The fix ation on ph ysical signs leads McCarth y and c ompan y to de velop the per ception tha t physicians and scien tists ar e doing t oo lit tle to chang e the s tatus quo on autism. This discontentmen t of these mother s sho wn thr ough their in teractions with doct ors and wha t the ySaraf47 say about doct ors also r eflects a misunder standing of man y of the basic principles g overning science and medic al pr actice. McCarth y et al. oft en emplo y a pos t hoc er go propter hoc f allacy to establish wha t the y belie ve to be the c ausa tive agents behind autism. Their primar y evidence that vaccines \"trig ger\" autism seems t o be tha t their childr en beg an e xhibiting beha viors char acteristic of childr en with y were vaccina ted. Scien tific e xperimen tation, of course, does not r ely on pos t hoc er go propter hoc logic. Additionally , ther e is a misunder standing on ho w clinic al medicine is pr acticed; in teractions with doct ors demons trate that these mother s do not under stand ho w clinic al diagnoses ar e made, nor do the y under stand how treatmen ts or plans ar e de veloped and pr escribed. Mor eover, the y do not seem t o appr eciate the kno wledg e of medic al pr actitioner s, relying ins tead on either their o wn ins tincts or the in terne t. Cognitiv e dissonance is a signific ant theme thr oughout the narr ative, with McCarth y et al. demons trating tha t the y tend t o sear ch for evidence while motiv ated b y some directional pr eference; tha t is, the y seek out e videncethat valida tes their e xisting belie fs,5 instead of sear ching f or the truth. First, and perhap s mos t import antly, man y of the par ents inMother W arriorsdemons trate a post hoc er go propter hoc logic al fallacy in their e valua tion of e vidence. Tha t childr en beha viors char acteristic of fter being v accina ted is fr equen tly cit ed as e vidence tha t vaccines c an trig ger autism. Additionally , mother s victim t o this pa ttern of thinking ar e primed to sear ch for a trig ger to autism, ha ving been in formed (b y various sour ces) tha t environmen tal triggers are responsible f or autism manif esting in childr en. Indeed, in McCarth y's appear ance on Oprah's sho w, she sho wcases this e Interview 2018)Saraf48 s tatistics in one- fifty. I'd like to kno w wha t number it will t ake, wha t number does it ha ve to be f or everyone t o start lis tening t o wha t the mother s of childr en who ha ve autism ha ve been sa ying f or years, which is ... We vaccina ted our bab y and SOMETHING happened. SOMETHING happened. Wh y won't an yone belie ve us? \" (16). In a pos t hoc er go propter hoc f allacy , a per son is led t o belie ve tha t bec ause e ventBfollowed eventAchronologic ally, eventAmus t havecausedeventB. In this c ase, McCarth y belie ves tha t because her bab y beg an to sho w signs of autism a fter being v accina ted, the v accina tion mus t have someho w trig gered autism. In medic al contexts, this thinking is especially dang erous, and carefully sa feguar ded ts negative controls, sham gr oups, experimen tal gr oups, and t ake place in tigh tly regula ted conditions, t o ensur e tha t some e ffect is being c aused b y a specific, kno wn v ariable. Her e, this is not happening\u2014in f act, the only r eason McCarth y has t o belie ve tha t a v accine c an cause autism is tha t the autis tic beha viors appear ed following the adminis tration the v accine. As discussed pr eviously , McCarth y sho ws a tendency t o giv e credence t ovisiblephenomenon. This primes her f or pos t-hoc bec responsible f or trig gering autism (if there is one) is mos t likely micr oscopic. The principles of biochemis try, physiology , and other areas underlying medicine ar e able t o provide in forma tion on neur ologic al conditions, but these ideas e invisible. Dif ferently, the ph ysical adminis tration of a v accine is a visible e vent; even though the biochemic al action of the c ontents of the v accine ar e invisible t o the nak ed e ye, the adminis tration of the v accine is ob vious, which mak es it a prime c andida te for the c ausa tive agent behind autism, in a pos t-hoc thinking model. McCarth y says, \"We vaccina ted our bab y and SOMETHING happened, \" sho wing tha t the chr onology of e vents is wha t leads her t o poin tSaraf49 the fing er at vaccina tion, and tha t she is una ware of wha t truly trig gered his autism (indic ated by her empha tic use of the w ord \"some thing \")\u2014in other w ords, the timeline of e vents is not her primar y piece of e vidence, r ather, it is her only piece of e vidence f or the claim tha t vaccines can cause autism. McCarth y returns t o her theor y tha t vaccines c an cause autism in some childr en la ter with more specificity , but her ar gumen t still rests on pos t-hoc f allacy . She r ecalls her though ts following a phone c onversation with an Americ an Ac adem y of P edia trics (AAP) r epresen tative: Did this AAP guy jus t admit tha t he w as in volved in early r esear ch pr oving tha t the rubella virus can cause c ases of autism? I c ouldn't belie ve it c ame righ t out of his mouth tha t rubella is kno wn t o ha ve caused c ases of autism. If rubella c an cause autism in some childr en, and moms claim tha t the y lose their childr en a fter the MMR v accine and has thr ee liv e viruses including rubella, is it such a hug e leap t o say that vaccines migh t trig ger autism in some kids? (34-35). Here, the pos t-hoc r easoning is bols tered b y the t endency t o create simple associa tions between visible, memor able e vents, and specific e vents tha t follow other e vents chronologic ally. Tha t is, I h ypothesiz e a gr eater suscep tibility t o pos t-hoc r easoning when the event tha t is char ged with c ausing a succeeding e vent is visible, memor able, or someho w rousing. Although the truth is tha t vaccines c ontain a dead or w eakened s train of a pa thog en, McCarth y deliber ately men tions tha t she belie ves the MMR v accine t o ha ve \"thr ee tion trengthens the c onnection between the v accine and autism. It is en tirely possible tha t McCarth y belie ves tha t the v accines have pa thog enic pot ential bec ause the virus s trains ar e living , to explain her use of the w ordSaraf50 \"live\"; s till, r eader s likely per ceive a s trong c onnection be tween the v accina tion and the autism as a r esult of the rhe torical weigh t added t o the MMR v accine b y the w ord \"liv e.\" This incr eased gravitas sub stantiates the logic pa ttern emplo yed b y McCarth y and c olleagues. McCarth y follows by sug gesting tha t bec ause mother s claim tha t the y see signs of autism in their childr en a fter the childr en w ere vaccina ted with an MMR v accine c ontaining liv e pathog ens, it is r easonable t o say tha t vaccines ma y cause autism in childr en. Ag ain, the defining char acteristic of her \" evidence\" is tha t the qualities associa ted with autism beg an to show upafterthe v accine w as adminis tered. It isalso import ant to not e tha t McCarth y frames her c onclusion (v accines c an cause autism) as a rhe torical ques tion, and tha t she autism. Both t\" serve to temper her c onclusion, making it appear less ag gressiv e and thus mor e agr eeable. \"[s]ub tle narr ve been f ound t o be persuasiv e bec ause individuals 'ma y not mar shal their c ognitiv e resour ces t o de fend ag ainst ounter-attitudinal messag e.'\"Essen with6 a strongly c ounter-attitudinal per spectiv e, people t end t o mar shal their c ognitiv e resour ces t o defend ag ainst tha t per spectiv e. By using these tw o rhe torical de vices\u2014the ques tion f orma t and w ord \"migh t\"\u2014McCarth y creates a g entler, mor e sub tle tone in her narr ative, which, according t o Dr. Nyhan' s resear ch, enhances its per suasiv eness. This incr eased per suasiv eness is nested the pos t-hoc r easoning. Like Jenn y McCarth y, Michelle W oods also sho ws a pos t hoc er go propter hoc line of reasoning on the pot ential link be tween v accines and autism. Tha t is, the crux of her e vidence 6(Nyhan, Reifler, et al. 2014)Saraf51 for the claim tha t her son' s, Kevin's, autism w as caused b y a v accina tion is mer ely tha t she began to notice chang es in his beha vior a fter he w as vaccina ted; the v accina tion itself w as eas y to target as a c ause f or autism bec ause of its visibility and memor ability as an \" event\", and the seriousness of the c onditions tha t she appar ently beg an to see: I started to notice chang es when K evin w as about six mon ths old and it w as near Chris tmas 2002. Tha t's when he g ot his D TaP vaccine (diph theria, t etanus, pertussis) with the Hib vaccine (Hib disease), and righ t after tha t he s tarted losing e verything. He beg an getting really sick and los t all of his miles tones (53-54). The c onnection be tween the \" chang es\" tha t Woods notices and the D TaP vaccine is the chronologic al pr oximity of e vents. W oods sa ys tha t she s tarted to notice chang es when he g ot his D TaP vaccine, and tha t \"righ t after tha t he s tarted losing e verything. \" The sole c onnection between K evin \" getting r eally sick\" and the v accine is tha t these e vents took place successiv ely. Woods g oes on t o describe the se verity of K evin's ailmen ts: \"He had ecz ema all o ver his body , he started to bleed in ternally ... He w as bleeding so much. He w as losing ir on\" (54-55). W oods' weigh ted descrip tions of K evin's signs and s ymp toms adds a sense of ur gency t o disc overing wha tever it w as tha t caused these c onditions in K evin. Bec ause ther e is such a sense of ur gency , that the c ause needs t o disc overed immedia tely, and the v accina tion itself w as adminis tered prior t o when K evin s tarted sho wing signs, and it is a seeable e vent (unlik e genetics/ph ysiology underlying c auses of autism), in W oods' mind, the v accine bec omes a prime c andida te for a cause f or autism. A t its c ore, the line of r easoning tha t Woods sho ws is an e xample of pos t hoc ergo propter hoc f allacy; s till, it is nuanced, and cert ain embedded s trategies mak e it seem less obviously a f allacy , and mor e compelling as a possibility t o be c onsider ed. These s trategiesSaraf52 include W oods not r eally discussing the e vidence she has f or her claim tha t the v accine c aused Kevin's conditions be the v accine and then his c onditions, instead f ocusing on the se verity and visibility of those c onditions, adding w eigh to descrip tions ts thr ough dr ama tic languag e, and discussing the s teps she is t aking t o heal K evin. All of these sub-s trategies fit in to her pos t-hoc r easoning t o valida te it, both t o her self and the reader s. Following W oods' assessmen t of wh y she belie ves Kevin's autism t o ha ve been trig gered by a v accine, she discusses ho w Kevin's physician r esponded t o his c onditions. Appar ently, the physician' s diagnosis and pr escrip tion w ere not help ful, but W oods w as able t o provide a use ful remedy f or her son. Though not dir ectly an e xample of pos t-hoc f allacy , it is an e xcellen t example of ho w McCarth y's narr ative frames ph ysicians and, eviden tly, incompe tent. The r eason I include this e xample of neg ative framing of healthc are provider s in this section is bec ause W oods' pos t-hoc f allacy laid the gr ork f or the subsequen t misr epresen tation of ph ysicians and their a ttitudes. He w as anemic and the pedia trician said ma ybe it 's too much milk. And I said, \" Well, I don't really giv e him tha t much milk, but I'll t ake your w ord for it and giv e him some ir on supplemen ts and cut do wn on the milk. \" As it turns out, it didn't ha ve an ything t o do with the milk. He w as bleeding so much. He w as losing ir on. (54-55) In this c ase, it appear s tha t Woods has insigh ts tha t physicians f ail to see. Of c ourse, as demons trated b y the prior section, W oods is subject t o a pos t-hoc f allacy , which is gr anting her these insigh ts she belie ves doct ors to lack. As a r esult, when this ph ysician (of fhandedly) suggests tha t Kevin r educe his milk in take, W oods alr eady doub ts tha t this tr will w ork.Saraf53 From W oods' acc ount, the ph ysician seems unc oncerned, as demons trated b y the br evity and appar ent lack of c onviction in his r esponse t o a pot entially serious issue\u2014in tha t way, the dominan t attitude (of mother s, and sub sequen tly reader s) towards healthc are provider s and scien tists remains neg ative\u2014tha t, at their bes t, the y are indif ferent/unc oncerned, and a t their worst, the y are inc ompe tent. Woods delinea tes tha t she w as unc onvinced b y the doct or's suggestion, but she accep ts it none theless; W oods seems unsurprised when it does not w ork, as evidenced b y her use of the phr ase, \" As it turns out. \" Woods is in a position wher e appear s to have be tter utility f or her son' s health than the ph ysician, which is enabled b y the \"kno wledg e\" she g ets thr ough t o presume kno e over healthc are provider s and scien tists, and this pa ttern is r epresen tative of man y of the par ents inMother W arriors. Woods la componen ts the v accine. The pos t hoc r easoning pa ttern leads t o a pr esump tion of kno wledg e over healthc are and scien tists. Furthermor e, it sho ws tha t McCarth y et al. do not y et under stand ho w scien tific kno wledg e is cr eated and de veloped, and ho w this in forma tion is then inc orpor ated into clinic al pr actice. Additionally , McCarth y and the other mother s fail to under stand ho w clinic al medicine is pr acticed in the fir st place. As seen in pr evious sections, mos t of the par ents writing v alid r esults. Consequen tly, the y are unable t o appr eciate tha t people ar e treated based on the bes t kno wledg e and r esear ch tha t exists at theSaraf54 time of tr eatmen t. As w ell, the y sho w a misunder standing of man y of the smaller in tricacies that are involved in clinic al pr actice, oft en times r eques ting tr eatmen ts, tests, or other prescrip tions fr om doct ors tha t the doct ors do not appear t o recommend. When McCarth y first appear s on Opr ah's talk sho w to discuss pot ential c auses of her son's autism, one of her f ocuses is the f ailur e of v accines t o consider the individual biologies of the childr en to whom the y are adminis tered. Acc ording t o her , vaccines ar e created as though they are \"one-siz en: I continued t o speak about ho w the Cen ters for Disease Con trol (CDC) acts as if v accines ar e one-siz e-fits-all, as if the y should be adminis tered a t the same r ate for all childr en without r egard to the individual child' s needs and biologic al mak eup, and I f elt some thing e ven mor e profound. (16-17). To an e xtent, it is true tha t different people ha ve dif ferent needs and, t o a smaller e xtent, different \"biologic al mak eups.\" As a r esult, people will some times r espond dif ferently to the same f oods, tr eatmen ts, or medicines. A t the same time, the fundamen tal principles of biology and chemis try tha t modern medicine is based on g overn all human beings\u2014w e are all made up of or gans, which ar e made up of tissues, which ar e made up of cells, whose s tructur e, function, and beha vior w e under stand quit e well. This under standing is wha t enables medicine t o work a t all. If e very individual had c omple tely dif ferent needs and biologic treatmen ts and medicines w ould ha ve to be designed f or each and e very per son, which is not the c ase. This is not the c ase bec ause tr eatmen t plans r ely on the fundamen tal principles of biology , which ar e common t o all human beings. Still, the lar ger pa ttern of thinking demons trated in this segmen t and r elated segmen ts is char acterized b y all-or -nothing type thinking , an solut ainty. McCarth y wants her r eader s to assume a c onnection be tween v accines and autism based on the f ollowing reasoning: It's INS ANE tha t hospit als think tha t EVER Y child is born perf ect, tha t EVER Y child has a perf ect immune s ystem, and tha t a his tory of aut oimmune pr oblems in f amilies doesn't mean anything (47). According t o Dr. Shapir o, \"Dichot omous thinking is not alw ays or ine vitably wr ong, but it is a poor t ool f or under standing c omplic ated realities bec ause these usually in volve spectrums of possibilities, not binaries. the c ated realities. \" Medic al science itself is a c omplic ated reality bec ause science and medicine oper ate c ompounding kno wledg e and g ener ating e vidence t o support or refute a theor y rather than pr ove or dispr ove it ab solut ely; v accine-hesit ant rhe tors such as McCarth y see this inher ent char acteristic as a fla w in the science of v accines. It c annot e ver be proventhat all v accines ar e 100% e ffectiv e for everysingle per son t o whom the y are adminis tered. A t the same time, ther e is an abundance of e vidence t o demons trate the ability of vaccines t o prevent deadly diseases, and ther e is an abundance of e vidence tha t breaks any link be tween v accines and autism.Despit e this in forma tion,because McCarth y et al. ar e8 sear ching f or de finitiv e proof tha t vaccines ar e alw ays effectiv e in the same manner f or every person, an y insignific ant piece of \" evidence\" is t aken to mean tha t ther e is no r eliable knowledg e on v accines and autism.

McCarth y et al. showcase dichot omous thinking in their v accine-hesit tely r epresen ts misunder standing of ho w evidence is e valua ted and inc orpor ated in the scien tific/medic community .

In r eality , medic al science is c omple x and in a unique position. It is mor e accur ately char acterized as a s ystem of hypotheses and theories tha t have been r elies on empiric al evidence, but the conventional de finition of science leads us t o think about medic al science as a se t of univ ersal truths ins tead of appr eciating it as a body of kno wledg e tha t is c onstantly being incr emen ted through e xperimen tation ollection. The f ormer de finition is wha t pushes McCarth y et al. t oward binar y thinking , resulting in a v accine-hesit ant per spectiv e. In other situa tions, McCarth y and c ompan y sho w tha t the y do not truly under stand ho w medicine is pr acticed in a clinic al se tting, but, this leads them t o presume kno wledg e overSaraf58 healthc are provider s. Saman tha Gr ay is one of the v accine hesit ant rhe tors who shar es her experiences with her son, Z ach, inMother W arriors.She discusses ho w Zach's pedia trician w as not help ful to her or t o Zach, since he pr ovided in forma tion tha t Gray seemed t o alr eady ha ve, and w as reluct ant to accep t tha t Gray kne w mor e than he r egarding Z ach's health and wellbeing. Gr ay's interactions with the pedia trician sho wcase Gr ay having mor e kno wledg e and the pedia trician appearing unc oncerned and passiv e. Gr ay brings Z ach t o the ph ysician f or the first time: We got to the neur ologis t and Z ach jus t sat and r olled his t oy car back and f orth, basic ally doing nothing. The doct or talked to Zach f or a lit tle bit. Then he t old me tha t Zach has autism spectrum disor der. \"Yes, I kno w.\" I'd alr eady been ying m y eyes out. I kne w wha t it w as, so the diagnosis didn't surprise me. (111). The gr avity of the situa tion appear s to stand in c ontrast to the neur ologis t's attitude. His en tire interaction and assessmen t with Z ach is enc apsulated in the brie f sen tence, \" The doct or talked to Zach f or a lit tle bit. \" The de tails of the neur ologis t's conversation ar e omit ted, with the r esult being tha t he appear s almos t disa ffected b y the situa tion. When he r eveals (emotionless) tha t he belie ves Zach has an autism spectrum disor der, Gray responds, t elling him she alr eady kne w. It is possible tha t she suspect ed it alr eady , explaining wh y she r esponds this w ay, but it seems more likely tha t she belie ves tha t she truly did alr eady kno w Zach had autism spectrum disor der. She r eiterates this poin t when she sa ys, \"I kne w wha t it w as, so the diagnosis didn't surprise me. \" Whe ther Gr ay really belie ves she kno ws better than the neur ologis t or she needs the neur ologis t to confirm, both poin ts support the idea tha t she is kno wledg e.Saraf59 ysicians\u2014the neur ologis t her e is curt, and the lack of dialogue on his part mak es him seem e ven mor e unc aring. F ollowing his discussion with Gr ay, he appear s comple tely unc oncerned about the impact of this episode on Gr ay's life, which is dubious and a typic al for a ph ysician. Aft er seeing Z ach, he disc ourt eously sa ys, \"'B y the way, insur ance doesn't c over an y of this'\" (111). In the prior section, he seemed not t o care about the seriousness of his diagnosis, and ho w it w ould a ffect Z ach's life, or the liv es of his parents; ne xt, by simply in forming Saman tha Gr ay tha t she migh t have to pa y out of pock et and that her son' s visit is uninsur ed, he does not seem c oncerned about the seriousness of financial matters either . Regardless of whe ther this acc ount of the ph ysician' s interaction with Z ach and mother Saman tha is c omple tely accur ate, it r eflects v ery poorly on healthc are provider s entirely. This poor imag e of healthc are provider s tha tMother W arriorsestablishes is sus tained throughout the en tire narr ative it seems. A t the same time, this neg ative imag e of doct ors and scien tists rests within the lar ger theme, which is tha t man y of these mother s presume knowledg e over the doct ors. In this in teraction, Gr ay appear ed to alr eady be a ware of supposedly no vel in forma tion tha t the doct or w as pr oviding , which means she either belie ves she kno ws mor e than the doct or en jus t needed the doct or's confirma tion\u2014either w ay, she pr esumes t o kno w mor e than she actually does. Gray later does r esear ch tha t tells her about the pot entially de trimen tal effects of dair y. Gray belie ves tha t Zach's autism c an be tr eated thr ough a c asein- free and glut en-free die t, which she sug gests to her husband. Her husband then announces tha t he will ask Z ach's physician t o perf orm this t est.Saraf60 And he said, \" Well fir st of all, I think it 's crazy, but ther e's a test we can do I'll jus t tell his doct or to run it. \" The t est was to see if Z ach is aller gic to casein and glut en. I found out la ter tha t it doesn't ma tter if the child is actually aller gic; it has t o do with these kids not being able t o break do wn the pr oteins in dair y and whea t. But Gar y called the doct or and said, \" Just humor me and m y wif e, and please run this glut en casein t est, bec ause she' s thinking of a glut en- and c asein- free die t\" Of course, m y pedia trician said, \" Oh, tha t doesn't w ork. I w ouldn't e ven mess with it. \" Gary responded, \" Just humor us and run the t est.\" (113-114). Despit e the of fhanded t one tha t seems t o align with man y of the other ph ysicians in the book, in this ins tance, the doct or seems quit e cert ain tha t the glut en- and c asein- free die t will not be of an y utility t o Zach. Ne vertheless, Gr ay and her husband ar e intent on ha ving the t est run. Regardless of the r esults of the t est, or the r esear ch tha t led Gr ay to belie ve the die t migh t have worked in the fir st place, the import ant elemen t to recogniz e is tha t after the ph ysician g ave his though ts on the aller gy test, Gr ay and her husband decided t o disr egard his advice, and reques ted the t est anyway. The pa ttern of r eques ting t ests and tr eatmen ts ag ainst or without the advice of a ph ysician is demons trative of a misunder standing of ho w medicine is pr acticed in a clinic al se tting; t ests ar e giv en a fter a pr esumed diagnosis has been made b y a ph ysician, and the t ests then will c onfirm or r efute this h ypothesis. T ests ar e har dly giv en randomly in a \"see-wha t-sticks\" type of f ashion. Un fortuna tely, this seems t o be the v ery testing f ashion tha t Gray (and other moms) adv ocate for. Indeed, Gr ay ends her section inMother W arriorswith the following sen timen t:Saraf61 Why are people so r eluct ant to get all of these t ests done and see f or themselv es? Wha t if y our child is t oo lo w in some thing or t oo high? Y ou w on't kno w unless y ou test him. It 's time to do some thing , Mom or Dad. (116-117). Again, ther e seems t o be an impr ession tha tmoretestingtransla tes to be tter, mor e compr ehensiv e care. In r eality , this type of appr oach t o clinic al medic al pr actice w ould be wasteful. Not only do unnecessar y tests waste and div ert v aluable time and r esour ces, but the y some times giv e false positiv es, which lead t o further unnecessar y testing, or, reveal ar eas of potential w orry, tha t (counterintuitiv ely), had the per son not kno wn about, the y would ha ve lived a normal, health y life. Esserman e t al. discuss o verdiagnosis and o vertreatmen t in cancer -related cases, finding tha t \"cancer s are he terogeneous and c an follow multiple pa ths, not all of which pr ogress t o me tastases and dea th, and include indolen t disease tha t causes no harm during the pa tient's lifetime. Although this c omple xity c omplic ates the g oal of early diagnosis, its r ecognition pr ovides an opportunity t o adap t cancer scr eening with a f ocus on iden tifying and tr eating those c onditions mos t likely associa ted with morbidity and mort ality \" (797).These findings c an be g ener alized situa tions\u2014tha t is, o verdiagnosis and9 overtreatmen t applies t o mor e than jus t cancer situa tions, and is r elevant for an y area tha t requir es testing, diagnosis, and tr eatmen t. Thus, o vertesting, overdiagnosis, and o vertreatmen t are issues in man y, if not all, ar eas of medicine. Esserman e t al. sug gest mitig ating o verdiagnosis in the f Strategies t o reduce de tection of indolen t disease include high-risk popula tions, r aising thr or and t esting the sa fety risk -based scr eening appr oaches t o impr ove selection of patients for cancer scr eening. The ultima te goal is t o preferentially de tect c onsequen tial cancer while inc onsequen tial disease (798). Although Gr ay's physician seems t o ha ve a unc oncerned t one when he advises ag ainst the gluten and c asein aller gy test, his advice aligns with the fir st part of the s trategies t o mitig ate overdiagnosis: Gr ay's physician sees the aller gy as a lo w-yield diagnos tic e valua tion, meaning it is unlik ely t o reveal the pr esence of mor e than benign disease, which is wh y he s tates tha t it is not necessar y. His in tention in this advisemen t aligns with the g oal s tated abo ve, which is t o avoid de tecting inc onsequen tial disease. Gr ay wonder s \"wh y people [ar e] so r eluct ant to get all of these t ests done, \" sho wing tha t she is either un familiar with o verdiagnosis and o vertreatmen t, unlik e the ph ysician, or w ants to ha ve the t ests perf ormed in the hopes tha t the y will r eveal some thing use ful (which the ph ysician advises ag ainst); w orse, she insis ts on ha ving the aller gy tests done, sho wing her supposition of kno wledg e over the ph ysician. In addition t o the misc oncep tion tha t mor e testing r esults in be tter care, Gr ay and her husband appear t o be t elling the ph ysician wha t to do , failing t o appr eciate the kno wledg e and e xpertise of a doct or on medic al ma tters. Gr ay is not the only one t o do this, ho wever; Michelle W oods, in her sear ch for a tr eatmen t for her son, sho ws a v ery similar pa ttern of action. She is c onvinced that me thyl B12 is an appr opria te treatmen t for her son, based on her in tuition.Saraf63 When I sa w Dr .

Woods' jus tification her son with me thyl B12 is \"mor e an in tuition, \" and the hunch of a pot ential \" connection\" be tween me thyl B12 and her son' s autism spectrum disor der.

Jenn y McCarth y her self is the fir st to de tail her e xperiences learning tha t her son, E van had been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disor der. She describes ho w the ph ysician responsible f or the diagnosis deliv ered the ne ws with a dr ama tic, melancholy t one, which added t o the neg ativity surr ounding ASD . After her ins tha t the ph ysician' s diagnosisSaraf83 was accur ate, McCarth y is dis traugh t, as she no w belie ves her son' s beha viors to be manif estations of a disor der, not his true per sonality . The ph ysician' s following s tatemen t, tha t Evan is not an y dif ferent as a r esult of the diagnosis does lit tle to reassur e McCarth y, who no w views her son dif ferently. I decided t o get a sec ond opinion and me t with one of the bes t neur ologis ts in the w orld. He polit ely put his hand on me and said, \"I' m sorr y, your son has autism. \" I died in tha t momen t but m y ins tincts t old me tha t this man w as righ t. All those beautiful char acteristics tha t I though t were Evan\u2014the hand flapping , the t oe w alking , the pla ying with door hing es and lining up t oys\u2014w eren't E van char acteristics a t all. Who was m y son if he w asn't all these things? The neur ologis t saw the look on m y face and said t o me, \"He y, this is the same lit tle bo y you came in this r oom with. He' s not an y different. Hs the same bo y.\" I look ed a t the doct or and r eplied, \"No , he's not. My son is trapped inside this label c alled autism and I' m gonna g et him out \" (15-16). McCarth y's descrip tion oaches \"I' m sorr y\" goes be yond g ood bedside manner\u2014it is as though the neur ologis t is attemp ting t o mitig ate the e ffect of deliv ering ne ws of a t erminal illness. This in teraction on its o wn does not enc apsulate the ableis t languag e on ASD thr oughout the book; ho wever, when examined in c onjunction with other in teractions tha t reveal a ttitudes on autism, it is clear tha t even this seemingly innocuous in teraction be tween McCarth y and the neur t has a nontrivial degr ee of dehumaniz ation of autism. In one of the v ery few displa ys of c ompassion from arriors, the neur ologis ttries t o explain tha t Evan's ASD does not define him\u2014tha t he is the same kid he has been. McCarth y refuses t o accep t this, ins teadSaraf84 belie ving E van to be \"tr apped\" b y his c ondition, as though it is not a part of him. McCarth y's intentional use of the w ord \"tr apped, \" and r eference t o autism as a \"label\" div orces E van fr om wha t would be fundamen tally a part of his char acter, sho wing tha t she think s people with ASD are consumed and suppr essed b y ASD , and tha t their \"true\" char acter is hidden. As such, ASD is defined as an acut e, debilit ating f orce tha t obfuscates a per son's real char acteristics; McCarth y shows this when she ask s her self about E van's beha viors: \"Who w as m y son if he w asn't all these things? \" Her e, she belie ves tha t these beha viors are not r epresen tative of her son, but of autism, as a separ ate en tity. Additionally , she c ategorizes autism as a \"label, \" which a t first, is encouraging bec ause it c ould be f oreshado wing her desir e to dissolv e the s tigma associa ted with the label, but then she sa ys tha t she is g oing t o \"get him out, \" which means she s till sees ASD as an acut e affliction tr apping her son, fr om which she c an remo ve him. The main t akeaway is the loss of aut onom y tha t McCarth y per ceives autism t o induce\u2014tha t is, autism c auses certain beha viors tha t are unchar acteristic of the childr en it a ffects. Norms and s tereotypes appear t o be a theme thr oughoutMother W arriors, revealing that the y are mor e deeply engr ained in to the mindse t of McCarth y et al. than jus t in the c ontext of ASD . McCarth y uses g ender -norm- filled languag e when she tries t o arr ange a mee ting with the Americ an Ac adem y of P edia trics (AAP), speaking in se xist terms ag ainst women. Silence ag ain, then the r eply, \"Um ... I'm not the per son who w ould be able t o organize tha t. I can put y ou in t ouch with the per son who does tha t.\" \"Great,\" I said. Giv e me his number .\" ... A woman ans wered the phone and I ask ed for her boss.Saraf85 \"Hold on a sec ond, \" she said and placed me on hold. All I c ould do w as pictur e this lit tle assis tant running in to her boss' s office fr eaking out about wha t to say to me. I w as hoping he w ould immedia tely pick up the phone and t alk t o me lik e a man, but no such luck (31-32). When McCarth y learns tha t the man she is speaking t o is g oing t o connect her t o someone else, presumably higher up (since he/ she is appar ently capable of or ganizing the mee ting), she assumes it t o be a man. If she did not f ollow up b y speaking in mor e bla tantly se xist terms, it would ha ve been possible tha t she had arbitr arily chosen a pr onoun. But, once she is c onnect ed with a w oman, she immedia tely assumes tha t she has a boss, on only the gr ounds tha t the person with whom she is speaking is a w oman. Additionally , she g oes on t o refer to this w oman belit tlingly , referring t o her as a \"lit tle assis tant.\" Finally , she r eiterates her belie f tha t this woman' s boss is a man when she hopes tha thewouldpick up the phone, and speak t o her \"lik e a man. \" The f ocus of this chap ter is on the s tigma tization of autism, but seeing as ho w one of the primar y vehicles f or the s tigma tization is the use of s tereotypes, this e xample sho wed tha t McCarth y uses s tereotypes mor e widely than jus t in the c ase of ASD . This is import ant bec ause it supports the h ypothesis tha t her languag e on autism is truly based in s tereotypes, and not arbitr ary. The languag e used b y McCarth y and other par ents stigma tizes autism, as it is fr equen tly associa ted with lo w expect ations and hopelessness. The par ents ar e oft en capricious in their moods, seeming a t times t o be dis traugh t by the disability the y per ceive their childr en to ha ve, and a t other times ela ted when their childr en fulfill some artificially se t, low expect ations. OnSaraf86 one occ asion, when McCarth y returns home a fter a long period of ab sence, E van is dis traugh t about ho w long his mother w as gone, but McCarth y's only though ts ar e about ho w impr essiv e Evan's ability t o speak c oher ently is: He said, \"I ha te you and I w ant a ne w momm y tha t will s tay with me and not g o away!\" All I could do in tha t sec ond w as think, \" Wha t a gr eat sen tence!\" ... I laughed and hug ged him har der. He' s so fr eaking cut e. I c an't e ven stand it some times! People alw ays ask me if E van under stand wha t happened t o him or if he kno ws wha t autism is. He doesn't quit e get the full c oncep t, but I think mos t five-year-olds w ouldn't (43). Previously , McCarth y seemed t o be speaking about autism as though it w ere a dea th sen tence, and w as extremely dis traugh t tha t Evan w as affected b y it. Her mood seems t o ha ve shift ed signific antly, and r esponds t o Evan, a fiv e-year-old, b y being impr essed b y his ability t o form a simple sen tence. This o vert lo wering of e xpect ations f or childr en with ASD b y McCarth y demons trates ho w people a ffected b y ASD ar e stigma tized in to ha ving lo wer capabilities. This example begins t o illus trate the fix ation of McCarth y et al. on the per ceived de ficiencies or short comings of individuals with ASD . Sub textually , these artificially adjus ted e xpect ations only serve to further mar ginaliz e a c ommunity tha t other media and cultur e has also r epresen ted poorly . Giv en tha t McCarth y has es tablished her self t o ha ve a s tigma tizing t one t oward ASD thus far, when she sa ys, \"He' s so fr eaking cut e. I c an't e ven stand it some times!\" it c omes acr oss asSaraf87 artificial and f orced r ather than truly a ffectiona te. McCarth y continues t o fuel the artificial comparisons she is making be tween \"typic al\" childr en and her son, when she sa ys: \"It w as at that momen t I realiz ed tha t even though our childr en look c omple tely z oned out, ther e is actually a spirit inside them tha t is full of lif e and lo ve and tha t needs the same t alking t o as tha t of a typic al, health y child\" (43-44). The languag e she uses t o describe her epiphan y sho ws tha t it is not truly a chang e of mindse t; first, she br oadly describes childr en with ASD as appearing \"comple tely z oned out, \" which only otheriz es neg atively/offensiv ely char acterizes) them; she f ollows this up b y referring t o a manuf actur ed \"spirit inside them tha t is full of lif e and lo ve and tha t needs the same t alking t o as tha t of a typic al, health y child. \" In addition t o vie wing autism as en trapping childr ens' ough artificial c omparisons. Lisa Ack erman, mother of Je ff, does this as w ell\u2014she constructs e xtremely lo w expect ations f or her son, acting surprised when he is able t o mee t them, which only ser ves to sho w ho w childr en a ffected b y ASD ar e only per ceived as lacking ability . Disc ourse surr ounding childr with ASD to neg atives\u2014short comings and inabilities, r ather than de veloping a clear er under standing. Ack erman describes ho w she felt when she ob served Je ff reading a book: Now he w as actually looking a t the book. He w as looking a t it so in tently tha t I leaned do wn and poin ted to the pictur e of the dog and said, \"w oof w oof,\" and then I che wed on him and he gig gled. He gig gled! (74-76). Ackerman, lik e McCarth y, has a r eaction of c ontrived e xcitemen t when her son is able t o mee t arbitr arily lo w se t expect ations. Fir st, Ack erman sho ws surprise tha t Jeff is r eading a book\u2014she says, \"he w as actually looking a t the book, \" highligh ting her surprise a t his appr opria te use of aSaraf88 book. Then, she sho ws her surprise a t his gig gling r eaction, as though he is inc apable of na tural, normal beha viors like simply gig gling. This surprise a t basic beha viors for childr en widens the artificial g ap be tween childr en with ASD and childr en without ASD , exacerba ting e xisting stigmas. In Holt on e t al.'s study of ho w the fr aming of autism in the ne ws affects the stigma tization of autism, a finding of one of the r eferenced s tudies w as tha t \"scholar s have noted a rise in ne ws coverage and mass media disc ourse surr ounding autism and r elated men tal health issues but ha ve argued tha t the curr ent portr ayals migh t be doing mor e harm than g ood by presen ting autism as a shame ful, isola ting, and bur densome impairmen t tha t disrup ts the lives of those diagnosed with it, their friends and f amilies, and the c ommunities the y live in\" (Broderick, 2010; W altz, 2012). Un fortuna tely, the languag e used b y McCarth y et al., does precisely tha t\u2014it pr esen ts autism as a bur densome impairmen t tha t disrup ts the liv es of friends and f amily of those diagnosed with autism. Victimiz ation languag e t highligh ts of par ents shifts the f ocus a way from childr en a ffected b y ASD and muddies an under standing of autism, while also surr ounding individuals with autism with f ear. Lisa Ack erman shar es tha t one of the challeng es she f aced w as giving adequa te attention t o her daugh ter, while also t aking care of her son who had autism. McCarth y responds b y focusing on the dif ficulties f or siblings created b y childr en with autism: Wha t are siblings le ft to do? The y bec ome embarr assed t o ha ve their friends o ver bec ause their brother is s timming or acting w eird. Some siblings ar e forced t o ea t their f avorite foods in the g arage bec ause its not glut en- or c asein- free. I kno w some f amilies tha t purposelySaraf89 had another child so he or she c ould t ake care of the one with autism long a fter the parents ar e dead. This is a hug e problem. ... These childr en ar e the ones who will be changing the w orld t o help childr en with autism. the y are the ones who will be le ft with the r esponsibility long a fter w e're gone. They are the hand tha t will be holding our kids' hands and leading them in to a brigh t futur e (81-82). While it ma y be import ant\u2014in or der t o de velop a c omple te under standing of ASD\u2014t o discuss autism holis tically, the languag e of this segmen t is cen tered en tirely ar ound the bur den on siblings of childr en with ASD , and does lit tle to impr ove under standing , mos tly associa ting autism with shame. The languag e used t o describe beha viors of autis tic childr en is surf ace-le vel and der ogatory, as McCarth y says these childr en ar e \"acting w eird.\" Additionally , the ocus cr b y autis tic childr en is sub stantiated when she t alks about ho w the y are constantly in need of help, and ar e comple tely useless on their o wn: she discusses ho w par ents are ha ving childr en to take care of their autis tic siblings, and then portr ays childr en with autism as desper ately needing help, needing their hands held, sho wing tha t the y are doomed without other s to help them. McCarth y's messag e is os tensibly ayal of individuals with ASD b y constantly focusing on how useless the y are if the y are not helped, and all the pr oblems tha t autis tic childr en cr eate for their siblings and par ents. Becky Behnan, Jack' s mother , speak s about Jack' s ASD in a similar fashion, put ting a gr eat deal of a ttention on the dif ficulties tha t autis tic childr en cr eate for their family , which adds t o the e xisting short comings of curr ent disc ourse.Saraf90 Man y years later, when w e receiv ed the same diagnosis f or our son, Jack, m y husband and I were comple tely de vastated, t o say the leas t. Then, soon a fter m y son' s diagnosis, m y sister shot her self in the f ace. She w as attemp ting suicide and did not succeed\u2014un til a few years later. My journe y has been a dif ficult one, but I ha ve surprised man y people with ho w I c arried on. ... But w e kne w one thing f or sur e: Autism w as a bad situa tion (85). Receiving ne ws about a fundamen tal part of a child' s per sonality tha t was pr eviously unkno wn is sur ely signific ant. But the degr ee of dis tress tha t Jack seems t o ha ve caused his f amily is unique\u2014indeed, the pr esen tation of autism her e is not jus t as a bur den t o family member s, but an incr edibly des tructiv e, even-dea th inducing f orce. When Behnan sa ys tha t she and her husband w ere \"devasted\" b y Jack' s diagnosis with ASD , she in tensifies it b y saying \"t o say the least\"\u2014ther e is a ceaseless emphasis on the des tructiv eness of an ASD diagnosis. It is unclear whe ther her sis ter taking her o wn lif e was a r esult of Jack' s diagnosis, but her dea th is cert ainly associat edwith the diagnosis. She then discusseshow her sis ter resort ed to taking her o wn lif e upon hearing about her nephe w's diagnosis. The aim of this thesis is not t o trivializ e lifechanging e xperiences and momen es of par ents\u2014irr efutably, Behnan is br ave for sharing the dif ficulties tha t she and her f amily w ent thr ough; a t the same time, her languag e in describing these dif ficulties and the na ture of the dif ficulties sho ws a v ery problema tic vie w of autism. also , she is not unique in ha ving this ableis t vie w of autism\u2014the other par ents shar e it, and it is this vie w tha t caused their beha vior f ollowing their childr ens' diagnoses. The in tensely negative portr ayal of autism harms ho w it is under stood b y reader s, but also lik ely e xplains theSaraf91 desper ate desir e arriorsto \"cure\" autism immedia tely. The fir st step is alw ays going t o be in terpr etation and fr aming of autism f or the par ents themselv es. Since they are framing it so neg atively for themselv es, lik e a t erminal illness or some deadly illness with their ableis t mindse t tha t childr en with ASD ar e useless, the y are mor e likely t o exhibit the desper ate sear ching f or a cur e beha vior tha t the y sho w thr oughout the book. So , the y are not framing autism neg atively jus t for their r eader s\u2014which is the y are also fr it neg atively for themselv es, which se ts up their misled beha vior la ter on. She ends her introduction b y concluding tha t \"Autism w as a bad situa tion, \" and is c omple tely sur e of it. Norms and the s tigma tization of autism seem t o go together inMother W arriors. The book is full of norms, mos tly g ender norms, in the f orm of se xism; norms ar e also based in some preconceiv ed, unchanging notion of the c apabilities, r oles, and social iden tity of a per son based entirely on their se x. As a r esult, each se x has some tr aits and t endencies associa ted with it, negative and positiv e. Similarly , for childr en with autism, ther e is a pr econceiv ed notion of their capabilities and social iden tity based solely on the f act tha t the y have autism, e ven though autism is incr edibly c omple x and under stood as a spectrum. Saman tha Gr ay's experience illustrates the pr esence of these pot entially harm ful pr econceiv ed notions of autism (and an ignor ance f or the f act tha t it is a spectrum, and e xtremely c omple x and unique f or every child). A website tha t Gray (mother t o Zach) visits appar ently sa ys the f ollowing about childr en with ASD: Childr en with autism ar e not g oing t o live on their o wn. The y're not g oing t o ha ve kids. The y're not g oing t o get married (109-110).Saraf92 To which Gr ay responds: And I w as thinking m y son w as supposed t o be the f ootball s tar, all these sports, he' s our bo y. The bo y everyone w aited for (109-110). In addition t o speaking only about the imperf ections and appar ent short comings of childr en with autism, it c omple tely neglects the dif ferences be tween childr en be tween childr ens' unique e xperiences and liv es with ASD , lumping them all in to one gr oup, and then fr aming this group as c omple tely helpless and bur densome t o other s. This arbitr ary, erroneous gr ouping of all childr en with ASD is char acteristic of norms in g ener al, which ar e also a theme thr oughout Mother W arriors. When McCarth y describes wha t shebelie ves to be a lack of social skills in childr en with ASD , she c onnects it t o her se xist gender norms of men: I was gr ateful Becky w as being so open about this r eal issue of se x tha t the ne w gener ation of autism hasn't had t o deal with y et. These men will ha ve sexual needs someda y, and the fact tha t the y won't be socially sophis ticated enough t o kno w ho w to manipula te woman [sic] like typic al guy s do f or se x mak es mewonder wha t the hell it 's gonna be lik e (92-93). Again, thr ough the neglection of the r eality tha t autism disor ders are placed on a spectrum, because each child a ffected has a unique e xperience and lif e with autism, autism is fr amed negatively, which only f osters a misunder standing and pa ves the w ay for further misunder standing. In this segmen t, all men with ASD ar e char acterized as not being \" socially sophis ticated,\" and ar e tied t o their se xist, preconceiv ed beha viors tha their r ole/social iden tity as men. Tha t is, pr econcep tions about autism ar e connect ed to sexist, unfortuna te preconcep tions about the beha Michelle W oods' languag e is c onsis tent with the ableis t languag e sho wcased b y McCarth y, in r eference t o her o wn son, K evin. Aft er Kevin is diagnosed with autism, W oods begins adminis tering him me thyl B12 shots (without advisemen a ph ysician). She appar ently sees impr ovemen t in his social skills, but his shot w ould w ear of f, and other s seemed to kno w when it did: At tha t poin t, I w as giving it t o him once e very thr ee da ys. And the t eacher s could t ell the da y after he had his shot bec ause it w ould w ear of f gradually . By the sec ond or thir d da y, he was back t o his old self , back t o his sick, bad-beha vior self (57-58). Woods empha tically equa o and bad beha vior. By men tioning \" self\" Woods at leas t to some degr ee, she belie ves Kevin t o be fundamen tally sick and char acterized b y his bad beha vior. As a c onsequence of her languag e, reader s are also lik ely t o associa te sickness and inappr opria te beha vior with ASD on a mor e fundamen tal, basic le vel\u2014tha t is, thenatureof individuals with ASD is de fined b y illness and bad beha vior. Another import ant aspect of v accine-hesit ant narr atives seems t o be the dehumaniz ation of autism tha t comes with an ableis t sort of mindse t. The w ay McCarth y portr ays the ph ysician' s communic ation tha t Evan has autism fir st sets up the ableis t mindse t that follows. When he t ells McCarth y tha t Evan has autism, he \"polit ely put his hand on [McCarth y] and said, 'I' m sorr y, your son has autism' .\"2The br evity of the s tatemen t coupled with the magnitude of its c ontent giv es a sense of dr ama or gr avitas in the deliv ery of theSaraf94 messag e. Not only does this type of deliv ery add w eigh t to the messag e (and dr ama t o the narrative), it se ts up the neg ativity with which McCarth y sees this disor der. She dies in the momen t she learns E van has autism2, and begins char acterizinghis prior beha viors as e ffects of autism, not truly char acteristic of her son. \" All those beautiful char acteristics tha t I though t were Evan\u2014the hand flapping , the t oe w alking , the pla ying with door hing es and lining up toys\u2014w eren't E van char acteristics a t all. Who w as m y son if he w asn't all these things? \"2Here, from the beha viors induced b y his purport ed autism. Tha t is, she belie ves the autism is not r eally a part of E van, but some dis tinct f orce inside him tha t mak es him beha ve in a w ay tha t is not truly him. This denial/inability t o ackno wledg e tha t Evan's (supposed) autism is a part of him r epresen ts a sort of dehumaniz ation of autism per sonality char acteristic. Under standably , McCarth y as a mother is perturbed b y discovering a major per sonality tr ait of her son tha t she had pr eviously not kno wn about\u2014a t the same time, autism is a beha vioral condition tha t is a part of someone, and t o attribut e their beha viors in a w ay wher e autism, dis tinctly , is responsible f or their beha vior and ther efore does not r eflect them in an y way seems t o diminish and an tagonize this men tal/beha vioral condition. Not only does autism c oexist with a per son's per sonality , [[[it is a harmonious part of their personality .]]] La ter, McCarth y sho ws explicitly ho w she belie ves autism is almos t like a virus, infecting her son, and tha t it needs t o be e xcised. The neur ologis t tells her tha t Evan's being diagnosed with autism does not mak e him a dif ferent per son: \"'He y, this is the same lit tle bo y you came in this r oom with. He' s not an y dif ferent. He' bo descrip tion of the ph ysician' s previous dialogue made it seem some wha t drama tic, but this dialogue f eels v ery genuine and, perhap s mor e import antly, accur ate. McCarth y'sSaraf95 response t o this is the mos t demons trative thus f ar of her per ception of the na ture of autism: \"'No , he's not. My son is tr apped inside this label c alled autism and I' m gonna g et him out '.\"2It is cert ainly possible tha t McCarth y is e xpressing her in tent to dissolv e the social s tigma associa ted with the label of autism, especially giv en tha t she does r efer to it as a \"label, \" but given her a ttitude fr om pr evious s tatemen ts, it seems much mor e likely tha t this is a continua tion/de velopmen t of tha t attitude, thr oughout which she sho ws an ableis t per spectiv e on autism. McCarth y's aim her e does not appear t o be t o dissolv e the s tigma associa ted with autism, but r ather t o \"cure\" her son of the t errible a ffliction she has jus t learned about. The ableis t thinking fr om McCarth y de velop s as she c ontinues t o discuss ho w she plans to \"cure\" autism.10 se veral mechanisms, and with se veral results. Gender norms and preconceiv ed ideas about autism domina te the t ext and pr oblema tize an alr eady unclear under standing of autism. Oft entimes, tr aditional g ender r oles ar e connect ed to stereotypes on autism, which further deindividualiz es the c ondition lik ely cr eates additional f ear/t ension. Ther e is a the f alse \" deficiencies\" of childr en with ASD , and on ho w much of a burden the y seem t o create on people close t o them.
