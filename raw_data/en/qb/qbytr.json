Conclusion: Ayurvedic medicine offers a unique perspective on the biomedical diagnosis of cancer that em- phasizes restoring wholeness, uses natural remedies, includes a focus on emotional health, and emphasizesprevention strategies. Introduction Whole medical systems are usually based on ca- nonical texts and are complete systems of theory and practice that have evolved parallel to biomedicine.1They have their own systems of diagnosis and treatment inde- pendent of biomedicine. Many whole medical systems, such as Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, use holistictreatment approaches individualized to both the patient and the disease. 2,3 Ayurveda, a Sanskrit term that means ''science of the preservation of life,'' has a several-thousand-year history originating in the Indian subcontinent. It has evolved over time and remains an acknowledged system of medicine inIndia, where there are over 400,000 Ayurvedic physicians inpractice. 4,5Ayurveda is a comprehensive system of medicinethat emphasizes the interconnectedness of the body and mind and maintaining the innate harmony of the individual. According to Ayurvedic theory, each individual has a unique combination of bioenergetic principles called doshas . There are three doshas ) represents distinct physiologic processes: vata(principle of movement), pitta (principle of transformation), and kapha (principle of structure). All three doshas are always present, albeit in varying proportions according to the individual. Each indi- vidual's health is influenced by the innate proportion of the three doshas , known as prakruti or nature, and by the state of disequilibrium of these doshas , known as vikruti (i.e., the current state of imbalance of the doshas). (For denitions of key Ayurvedic terms, see the Appendix.)

Ayurvedic therapeutics include nutrition, lifestyle, exercise (i.e., yoga exercises), mind-body practices (i.e., yoga breathing practices),and botanicals. Typically a multimodality approach based on the Ayurvedic diagnoses is used. The features of whole medical systems, such as Ayurveda, pose several important challenges for clinical research. Ap- propriate research methods that account for the unique fea- tures of whole systems are required. A primary concern is tobalance the ecological validity of the system of study withresearch concerns, such as reproducibility, internal/external validity, and interpretable data. To perform research exam- ining Ayurveda's utility for cancer supportive care, re-searchers need to characterize an Ayurvedic perspective on cancer and supportive care. Ayurvedic physicians and their patients inhabit a pluralistic medical system and are acutelyaware of the biomedical diagnosis of cancer. Knowledge of the Ayurvedic perspective is critical for an accurate evalua- tion of the role that Ayurveda can play in cancer care. The ultimate goal of the research reported here was to develop a manualized protocol 6that would be used in a clinical trial to improve symptoms and quality of life among cancer survivors. The aim of this study was to characterizean Ayurvedic perspective on the pathophysiology, causes, and supportive treatments for a biomedical diagnosis of cancer. Methods Hour-long individual interviews were conducted with 10 experienced Ayurvedic clinicians ( Vaidyas ). The study was approved by the University of California San Francisco in-stitutional review board. Written informed consent was ob- tained from all participants. Eligibility criteria Vaidyas with at least 5 years of clinical experience, as well as experience treating at least 50 cancer survivors in their career, were eligible. The Vaidyas were required to have a high level of training in Ayurveda based on current stan- dards in India and the United States: Vaidyas trained in India were required to have at least a Bachelor of AyurvedicMedicine and Surgery (BAMS); United States-trained prac-titioners were required to have 1500 hours of training in Ayurveda or at least 10 years of full-time clinical experience. Interview approach The interview guide focused on ve domains, as described in Table 1. Methods for analysis of qualitative data The interviews were audio recorded digitally and then transcribed verbatim by a trained transcriber. Two investi- gators individually read the transcripts, created an initialcoding scheme, and then met to resolve minor differencesand develop a codebook, which was subsequently used to code all transcripts. A third study investigator reviewed the analyses in light of the codebook to check for accuracy andcompleteness. Coded data were then further analyzed for thematic interrelationships by using ATLAS.ti software(ATLAS.ti Scientic Software Development GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Results Sample characteristics Ten Vaidyas consented to be interviewed (100% response rate). Their average number of years of clinical experience was 23 (range, 9-45 years). Six of the Vaidyas had a BAMS degree (a 6-year degree in Ayurveda), 4 had an MD in Ayurveda, and 3had a PhD in Ayurveda. The MD in Ayurveda is an advanced degree that requires an additi onal 3 years of training beyond t h eB A M Sa n dd e v e l o p m e n to fa na r e ao fs p e c i a l i z a t i o n .B o t hBAMS and MD degrees are granted by universities in India. Four of the Vaidyas had clinical practices in India, 4 had prac- tices in the United States, and 2 had practices in both the UnitedStates and India. Themes The qualitative analyses revealed 4 major themes relating to the Ayurvedic interpretation of biomedical oncologyconcepts spanning cancer development, progression, treat- ment, prevention, and supportive care. Ayurvedic description of the pathophysiology of can- cer. The Ayurvedic description of the pathophysiology of cancer uses traditional concepts translated into a modern con-text. This rst theme addresses the exchanges between systems. Although the Vaidyas differed in some of the details, all framed the pathophysiology of cancer using traditional concepts, suchTable 1.Interview Approach with Sample Questions Category Example questions Practitioner qualica- tionsPlease describe your training in Ayurveda.

In the Ayu rvedic theoretical framework, identifying the nidana (causative factors) is a critical step in the evaluation and treatment of a patient: In terms of cancer, rst and most important are the causative factors. Half of the treatment is done when you alleviate the causative factors. TheVaidyas identied nidana that can be reversed, such as diet and lifestyle factors. They also discussed inherited factors. Many of the Vaidyas spoke about a weakening of the dhatu agni (weakened metabolic strength of the tissue in which the cancer originates) as important in the development of cancer: The samprapti (pathogenesis) occurs due to various causes, such as repeated exposure to environmentaltoxins, which are pitta provoking factors at the deeper cellular level. The increased pitta at the cellular level can cause micro inflammatory changes, which disturbthe cellular components of agni called pilu agni and pithar agni . Due to slow pilu agni ,pithar agni produces poorly formed tissue. In Ayurvedic pathogenesis, vata is the active dosha and is involved in the process of metastasis. Kapha being heavy and gross is responsible for the abnormal growth of the cells creating the ma- lignant tumor, and the tejas component of pitta en- hances the metabolic activity of the cancerous cells. The malignant tissue has strong agni. According to Ayurveda, cancer is a tridoshic disorder which has the capacity to spread due to the interplay of abnormal vata,pitta, and kapha . Some of the Vaidyas spoke about 2 diagnoses in tra- ditional textual sources, granthi and arbudha , that the concept of cancer: [Traditional concepts of] granthi and arbudha can be understood as similar to a cancer condition. Although it is a kapha predominant disease there is always an association of vata, because the multiplication of cells cannot go in excess without the imbalance of vatain it. And the dhatu agni (metabolic rate of the tissues) is diminished. However, others felt that granthi and arbudha did not exactly correlate with cancer. Figure 1 summarizes the Ayurvedic conceptual model for the development of cancer. The participants discussed thatthe multistep process of the development of cancer occurs over the course of many years, and the particular manifes- tations of the disease depend on the individual person andtheir constitution. Biomedical treatment of cancer results in degeneration and depletion. Although the biomedical treatment of cancer is considered valuable, from an Ayurvedic perspective itresults in degeneration and depletion. The Vaidyas spoke about the importance of ojas(vital essence or immunity) and that ojasis depleted due to cancer treatment: Their ojasis depleted because the ojasis the essence of all the dhatus . They are very depleted in ojasand even all the dhatus , what we call in Ayurveda dhatukshaya (depleted body tissues).The Vaidyas used traditional Ayurvedic concepts to de- scribe the adverse effects of the biomedical treatment of cancer (i.e., surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy).They discussed the concepts of degeneration and depletionas dening characteristics of the adverse effects of these treatments: One of the aftermaths is that the whole body is going to feel absolutely devitalized, exhausted, and unable tocope with day-to-day maintenance, with its vital functioning. Nutrition is going to be affected, because the cellular res will almost be flickering. You have toeat food that is intelligent food, which is lled with prana (vitality). The tissues and the cells, whether you look at chemotherapy, whether you look at radiation,it's going to be left with heat and dryness. There willbe a chronic state of low-grade inflammation in the system. They also commented on the interconnectedness of the body systems and that damage in one system adversely af-fects other systems: [Biomedical treatment of cancer] is denitely life- saving, or it's an emergency management. In many cases, it is necessary. You may kill the cancer cell, butthe outcome is damage of systems. When the damage happens your efciency goes and degeneration occurs. When one system is weak it will contribute to weak-ness in other systems, since all the systems are inter-connected. FIG. 1. The Ayurvedic description of the pathophysiology of cancer. Denitions of Ayurvedic terms: Nidanam are causes of a disease and include inherited, dietary, and lifestyle- related causes. Agni represents the digestive strength and metabolic rate of the body tissues. Atiyoga means chronic physical and psychological strain. Ama represents impurities and toxins in the body. Kshayam means degeneration and depletion of the body tissues. Srotorhodam means blockage(s) of body channels, both physical and energetic. Dosha imbal- ance means an imbalance of vata,pitta, and/or kapha agni is the metabolic rate of the dhatus .Dhatus are the body tissues. Balopaghata means altered immunity or impaired re- sistance to disease.366 DHRUVA ET AL.Figure 2 summarizes the effects of biomedical treatment of cancer from an Ayurvedic perspective. These treatments af- fect agni,vata, and pitta, leading to poor tissue metabolism and impaired ojas. Ayurvedic approach for the treatment of cancer. In cases where the biomedical treatment has stopped working or isnot available, an Ayurvedic approach focusing on strength- ening digestion, eliminating toxins, reducing tumor growth, and improving tissue metabolism is viewed as useful. Al-though the Vaidyas agreed that they would not normally use Ayurveda as the primary treatment of cancer, in cases where biomedicine is not possible they would take a specic Ayurvedic approach to treat cancer. This approach ex-emplies Ayurvedic interpretations of the nature of cancer that parallel biomedical oncology concepts of the cytor- eduction of a tumor: The general approach to this treatment protocol will be the kindling of dhatu agni ,pachana (eliminating toxins), and lekahana (reducing the size of the tumor). Ayurvedic approach for supportive care. An Ayurvedic approach to cancer supportive care focuses on restoringequilibrium, building mental and physical strength, and re- juvenation. Given the Ayurvedic conceptualization of the adverse effects of the biomedical treatment for cancer, tra-ditional approaches to reintroduce balance in the system were proposed: It's the role of a Vaidya to create proper equilibrium within the body, because imbalance in the body hasthe potential to create metastasis.The holistic view of the body is matched by this holistic approach to treatment: Post-chemo, post-radiation, sharira balam (physical strength) and satva balam (mental strength) are low. When they are low, recovery is not easy. According toAyurveda, food and lifestyle are the two controllable reasons for health problems as well as health creation. When you follow an appropriate diet and routine, youare enhancing your health. There are many itemsavailable for every patient in their own kitchen. We educate them on that, and then pranayama ,yoga, meditation. Then we go ahead with specic herbs andcustomized formulations. A way to approach herbs and formulations in Ayurveda is to strengthen the physical system, mental system, and immune system.We provide those formulations according to the type of cancer and system or dhatu that is affected. The Vaidyas agreed that Ayurvedic cleansing therapies (panchakarma ) were, in most cases, not advisable immedi- ately after the completion of the biomedical treatment forcancer. They felt that patients must rst regain their strength before undertaking panchakarma : Ayurveda says that there are proper indications for shodana (e.g., panchakarma ) and if the patient has re- cently completed chemotherapy, the body is still toxic. If we do shodana , we are actually pushing the toxins into the deeper tissues. The rst thing we have to do isshamana , palliative measures. There will be amain the body due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. That amawill be neutralized by the shamana protocol and then we will come to the main line of treatment - shodhana - possibly after six months or three months, depending on prakruiti .Kapha prakruiti people usually detox quickly, pitta takes time, and vatatakes still more time. Discussion In the exploration of the integration of Eastern and Wes- tern medical systems into holistic therapeutic programs, a bridging dialogue has been called for. In this study, the qualitative analysis revealed 4 themes that relate to the cor-relation of biomedical concepts in oncology with those ofAyurvedic medicine. Although several authors have de- scribed cancer from an Ayurvedic perspective using tradi- tional textual sources, 7-11this study appears to be the rst to evaluate correlations between Ayurvedic and biomedical oncology concepts using rigorous research methods in ad- dition to traditional textual sources. It is believed that thisstudy provides the rst evidenced based description of cancer from an Ayurvedic perspective to date. Using the traditional approach of samprapti , the partici- pants provided an Ayurvedic view of the pathophysiology of cancer that translated and correlated modern and tradi- tional concepts. Therefore, the samprapti of cancer described in this study represents the optimal Ayurvedic description ofcancer that combines traditional and modern biomedical frameworks and integrates textual sources with what is in use today by Vaidyas . The model from this study (Fig. 1) is similar to that proposed by other authors. 8,9Ayurvedic treatment depends on an accurate description of the samprapti . FIG. 2. The Ayurvedic description of the effects of cancer treatment. Denitions of Ayurvedic terms: Agni represents the digestive strength and metabolic rate of the body tissues.Ama represents impurities and toxins in the body. Kshayam means degeneration and depletion of the body tissues. Dosha imbalance means an imbalance of vata,pitta, and/or kapha . Dhatu agni is the metabolic rate of the dhatus. Dhatus are the body tissues.WHOLE-SYSTEMS AYURVEDA AND CANCER STUDY 367Therefore, these results are relevant to both clinical work and future research efforts in the supportive care and treatment of cancer using Ayurvedic approaches. The Ayurvedic perspec- tives on cancer that were described in this study were used todevelop a manualized protocol for cancer supportive care that is currently being tested in a prospective clinical study. In the Ayurvedic description of the pathophysiology of cancer, the role of causative factors was highlighted. The Vaidyas discussed classic Ayurvedic perspectives on causes of cancer, which included inherited, dietary, and lifestylecauses, that parallel biomedical causes of cancer. Inheritedcauses are an important consideration in biomedicine. In addition, parallels exist in biomedicine in terms of dietary causes of cancer. For example, low-fat diets may reducebreast cancer recurrence, and obesity has been linked to en- dometrial cancer. 12Similar ideas were expressed by the Vaidyas in that kapha- increasing (high-fat) diets could result in an increased risk of cancer. Lifestyle-related causes of cancer are identied by both biomedicine and Ayurveda. For example, research has linked night shift work with cancerincidence. 13,14Ayurveda also refers to the importance of natural biorhythms in maintaining health. On the basis of the current data, a summary of the tri- dosha perspective on cancer includes the involvement of kapha to induce growth of tissue, the role of pitta in transforming the tissue from normal to malignant, and the role of vata in the spread of cancer outside of the organ of origin (i.e., metastasis). Traditional diagnoses (i.e., granthi and arbudha) that are found in classic Ayurvedic texts were suggested to looselycorrelate with the biomedical concept of cancer. However, these correlations are imperfect, as was demonstrated in the current data. Some Vaidyas noted that granthi and arbuda were similar to cancer, but others disagreed. Weakened dhatus and dhatu agnis were highlighted as important Ayurvedic concepts in the pathophysiology of cancer. The Vaidyas suggested that when the dhatus are weakened, that patients are vulnerable to disease and that in particular a weakened dhatu agni predisposes them to cancer in that dhatu . This concept is unique to Ayurveda. However, a parallel exist in biomedicine in the idea of eld cancerization, in which particular tissues (e.g., sites in the aerodigestive tract after tobacco exposure) are vulnerable to cancer. 15 Agreement was found among the Vaidyas that the bio- medical treatment of cancer was valuable. They advocated for integration of Ayurveda rather than limiting Ayurveda to an alternative form of medicine. This sentiment echoesndings from a study of patients who expressed that an in- tegrative approach is preferred to one that excludes one system in favor of another. 16The Vaidyas suggested that the after-effects of biomedical treatment cause degeneration, depletion, and inflammation (Fig. 2). They also discussed the inter-connectedness of body systems. This holistic view ofthe body is distinctive and contrasts somewhat with the biomedical focus on individual organ systems. The therapeutic framework for Ayurvedic supportive care after cancer treatment that focuses on restoring equilibrium,building mental and physical strength, and rejuvenation is well matched to the problems patients with cancer face. These patients frequently face physical and psychologicalsymptoms in addition to impaired quality of life after treat- ment. 17Research on Ayurvedic longevity preparations,called rasayanas , suggest that in addition to reducing the toxicity of chemotherapy, they may have an immune mod- ulating role that may constitute a novel dimension to cancer treatment akin to new directions in cancer immunotherapy.18 The current study has some limitations and several strengths. The study sample was moderately small and as such may not fully represent modern Ayurveda. However, it included veryexperienced Vaidyas with rigorous university-level training in Ayurveda. Additionally, many of the Vaidyas had advanced degrees in Ayurveda (i.e., MD and PhD) obtained in India,which currently provides the most comprehensive training inAyurveda available in the world. Although they were all trained in India, 60% practice Ayurveda in the United States. In conclusion, the correlations between Ayurvedic and biomedical concepts in oncology provide an example of ways in which exchange between traditional and modern systems may enrich perspectives on cancer and supportivecare. The exact cause of cancer is not known in most cases. The Ayurvedic perspectives on the development, treatment, after effects of treatment, and supportive care for cancerdemonstrate that understanding different perspectives incomplex diseases, such as cancer, provides valuable insights. The correlations found in these data between Ayurvedic and biomedical concepts in oncology provide an example ofways in which dialogue can occur between traditional and modern medicine. This dialogue is particularly important in this era of global and integrative medicine.
