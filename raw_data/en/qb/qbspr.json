She took time off to raise her daughter and returned to the field as the Group Facilitator for Caring Choices in Mountain Lakes. Because she also enjoyed the healing atmosphere of the Imbrogno Chiropractic and Healing Arts Center, she became a part-time member of their office staff. Feeling such an affinity with her colleagues, it was a natural transition for her to offer her services as a Reiki Master and Energy Therapist at the Advanced Chiropractic of Montclair. SPECIALTIES AND SERVICES As a Reiki Master with a Doctorate in Psychology, Dr. Carlson specializes in intuitive energy work that is grounded in academic scholarship. With over twenty years of experience working with a wide variety of clients, Dr. Carlson uses a spiritually guided, mind-body approach to understanding and improving emotional, social, and physical functioning. Reiki is an ancient Japanese method of spiritual healing that improves the flow of a person's energy to reduce stress and discomfort while increasing their vitality and well-being. The client relaxes fully clothed on a treatment table while the practitioner uses her hands to direct healing energy to various parts of the client's body. The Reiki energy allows muscles to relax and increases the blood flow to treated areas, which in turn quickens the healing process. Reiki promotes psychological and spiritual growth, improves physical health and mental clarity, and releases stress and tension. EDUCATION Dr. Carlson began her training in the healing arts at the Wyndham Foundation in New York City with Eunice Zimmerman in the late 1970s, learning meditation and various healing techniques. She received a Master's Degree in Clinical Psychology from Radford University in 1982 and a Doctorate in Counseling Psychology from Ohio University in 1990. She became a Reiki Master with a Teacher Training Certificate from Brett Bevell at the Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, New York in 2012. More recently she completed Intensive Training as a Spiritual Response Therapist (SRT) in 2016. She has also studied The Emotion Code, to add that innovative technique to her clinical practice. OUTSIDE THE OFFICE Carol likes to balance her busy lifestyle with a wide range of personal and professional activities. She enjoys many forms of creative expression, including painting, pottery, stained glass, and making jewelry. She also enjoys hiking and kayaking with her husband and daughter.
