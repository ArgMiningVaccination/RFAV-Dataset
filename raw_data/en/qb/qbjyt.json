But, when we experience discomfort or illness, we often prioritise relief over logical thinking. We may quickly turn to medication in hopes of a speedy recovery rather than considering the underlying causes of our symptoms. Think for a minute! When it comes to our physical well-being, many of us do not consider the same factors as we do when selecting clothing or cosmetics, often scrutinising and deliberating over even minor details. Keeping well, inside out, is essential to keep our body running on its own. The [National Wellness Institute](https://nationalwellness.org/) defines wellness as - \"The active process where one becomes aware and makes choices toward a more successful existence.\" Researchers have concluded that wellness is: In the hustle and bustle of seeking a speedy recovery from illness, have you ever paused to reflect on the crucial factors that can contribute to your long-term well-being? We all indeed desire to bounce back swiftly when we fall ill, but amidst the flurry of remedies, have we overlooked the vital aspects of our lives that hold the key to everlasting vitality? Prepare to embark on a journey that unveils the often-forgotten secrets to achieving optimal health and staying in the vibrant pink of well-being for a lifetime. Why must you address your physical, occupational, social, intellectual, spiritual and emotional wellness to prepare for your daily challenges? The answer is straightforward. An illness or physical discomfort can set you back in multiple ways, affecting not only the specific part of your body but also all the above dimensions of your life. So do we need to address these at the time? Addressing your body's needs and losses from all dimensions can be seen in [complementary and alternative medicine.](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/complementary-and-alternative-medicine/) In today's world, people are becoming more aware of health and healthcare through social media and public discussions. As a result, there is a growing acceptance of complementary and alternative healthcare and medical practices (CAM) as a mainstream healthcare system. CAM includes various medical systems, procedures, and products not considered part of conventional medicine. A [survey](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9605899/) was conducted to understand why people are using alternative medicines, reported; \"Most people who use alternative medicine are well-educated and may not be satisfied with conventional medicine. They choose alternative options because they feel these align better with their values, beliefs, and approach to health and life.\" CAM practice is considered under five major groups - Alternative medicine is a broad term, including various medical modalities. Alternative practices rely upon the body's ability to heal itself. This is stimulated by energy alignment, herbal supplementation, and other balancing techniques. These methods use techniques involving the mind and body to heal the body. This type of therapy uses natural products or supplements that work similarly to the body's processes. These products help boost the body's immune system and make it stronger. Some physical therapies and massages are practised to manipulate certain parts of the body to heal them. These include treatments for pain, stress, anxiety and depression. The therapy method uses the belief that the body has an energy that controls its functioning. Techniques like acupuncture and yoga are used to work with specific energy points called 'chakras' in the body. The philosophy of complementary and alternative medicine includes holistic care, which focuses on treating one as a whole person. Today, people often use terms like holistic, integrative, and functional medicine. These terms have become popular because relying solely on modern medicine to regain health is no longer the only approach. Instead, people are returning to traditional practices, like those passed down by their ancestors or traditions, to strengthen themselves and fight against diseases. However, it's important to note that the general population uses these terms\u2014holistic, integrative, and functional\u2014interchangeably. They get used mainly for scientific explanations and understanding. In reality, these terms have distinct scientific differences. Let's explore what each of them means and how they differ. The word \"holistic\" means that everything is connected and cannot be understood by looking at its parts alone. In medicine, the holistic approach focuses on treating the whole person, not just the disease. It considers mental and social factors rather than just the symptoms of an illness. This means that it considers all aspects of a person to improve their health. WHO defined [health](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health) as \"a complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity.\" Some examples of holistic medicine that one could commonly practise include: Holistic medicine explains that the whole body is interconnected and seeks to discover the internal problems that lead to a specific disease condition. Dr Neethu, Ayurveda Consultant at Nirva Health, points out as an example that if someone suffers from loose stools, the first approach will not be to stop the symptom. The course will go on from checking for how good the individual's gut health was before looking for personal character, habits and mental health. Personalisation is an added point in a holistic outlook towards a disease. It can often be considered an East-West approach. As technologies improve in the healthcare system, they give more evidence towards the cause and prognosis of a condition. The majority of consultants use this method to treat patients. An approach is considered integrative when a medical practitioner integrates conventional methods to treat a condition. Integrative medicine combines various therapies to treat different health conditions. For example, if someone is experiencing loose stools, the treatment may involve using medications to stop the symptoms and providing necessary nutrients through IV therapy. Additionally, the focus is on improving gut health and digestion through approaches like yoga, relaxation techniques, and the principles of Ayurveda, which is an ancient healing system. The goal is to address the individual's well-being and promote healing from within. Functional medicine is a newer approach that aims to understand the root cause of a disease or condition. Instead of just treating the symptoms, functional medicine practitioners look at the bigger picture and try to identify the underlying issues. The practitioners of this medicine also do not look at the symptoms but the cause. Functional medical practitioners use modern research and genetics to uproot the real reason which differs one individual from another. Functional medicine also heavily emphasises lifestyle changes to fix health problems, such as diet, exercise, sleep patterns, stress levels, and other aspects of life. Let's return to the example of the loose stool patient and see what a functional medicine approach will be. The reason for the loose stool may be bad mental health and piled-up toxicity. The process will improve the function of all the organs and systems in the body. A functional medicine doctor collaborates closely with each patient, working hand in hand to find a healthy balance and heal the body. There is no hard and fast difference between the three. The methods differ from the conventional Western practice but go hand in hand with all the traditional approaches. All these types tend to heal the individual from within by approaching the person rather than the symptoms. Although, to an extent, they differ in their adaptation to modern technology. Hippocrates, the father of medicine, had quoted, \"The greatest medicine of all is teaching people how not to need it.\" Since time immemorial, the way of dealing with illness has been to teach how not to need it. But as conventional medicine has come into action, people started using the shortcut method to feel good - synthetic pills and syrups. Hippocrates also quoted that going against the natural process of our body is a sure-shot method of accumulating toxins over a while. These then come out as symptoms to show as a disease. Thus, treating this should also be with the rhythm of nature. They include more accepted forms of therapy in today's world. These are - These therapies have been practised worldwide for centuries, and now registered practitioners under these can be found anywhere. The method is based on the concept that the illness of one part of the body affects all other aspects. The body can focus on healing the injured or diseased part if manual manipulation can bring other factors into optimum health. Some methods are: A famous quote goes, \"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food\". Managing your diet well can help in healing your body naturally. Many dietary and herbal therapies look out to manage the body's nutritional balance and bring well-being to you. The different methods included are- Humans are built of energy. If external energy can affect every single cell in him to make him fall sick, then the energy used wisely can manipulate it to a healthy state. Examples of external energy therapy are- The connection between mind, soul, and body is being proved repeatedly as modern research has improved. Studies have recognised that the body heals better with a healthy state of mind. Mental health is the centre of a healthy body for which the therapies may include - Sense organs have a direct connection to mental health. Likes and dislikes, comfort and discomfort, can affect how our body reacts to a stimulus. These can, in turn, manipulate the way our hormones are released. Examples of therapies incorporating the senses include: All these alternative therapies have their benefits and drawbacks. Let us see them below so that you can make your own decisions regarding your health choices. Although alternative medicine is widely accepted and preferred worldwide, its use has certain limitations and barriers. Some of the significant rules and obstacles of alternative medicine are: Choosing a form of healthcare is incredibly personal. Not everything fits everyone. However, knowing that more options are available than conventional Western medicine is essential. If you think alternative medicine might be the right path, mention it to your healthcare provider. Holistic and integrated care plans may typically fall short when approaching whole body health, as they may sometimes overlook the body's short biochemistries, hormonal balances, and nutritional states. A functional practitioner, on the other hand, is well-versed in the nutritional and biochemical needs of the body and can incorporate holistic and integrated care plans as well. Still, they tend to have a more modernised outlook regarding understanding and treating diseases. It is often difficult to decide who to approach when you fall ill. Running from one physician to another, googling your way through, and seeking help makes you tired and still leave you confused. Everything, from our willpower to gardening plants, is medicine. Ancient scholars have said that everything available in this universe is medicine. The only challenge is to know how and when to use it. Similarly, we have to know which medical group to approach.
