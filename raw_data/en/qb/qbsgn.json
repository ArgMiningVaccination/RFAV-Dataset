After a quite shaky start of Germany's COVID-19 vaccination program, 61.5% of its citizens have nowadays received at least one shot, with 65.9% being fully vaccinated. (1) Jabs have been administered at large in dedicated vaccination centers and later by primary care physicians, among others. German politicians and policymakers spent quite significant time and effort in creating trust. But this trust has been shrinking significantly as the chart below outlining the daily administered doses demonstrates. Availability currently exceeds demand: Germany has decided to donate unused doses to other countries (30mn until the end of 2021) as doses would run out of their lifetime. (2) But they also created massive uncertainty which led to anti-vaccine movements. And they continue doing so for being prepared when ICUs will be packed and at their limits again in autumn and winter. As people lost trust in most actions the German government has introduced (lockdowns, curfews, insufficiently working mobile apps, etc) and measures where necessary technical infrastructure wasn't available due to underinvestment, eg for homeschooling, they are now using their policy power again to force people to receive the jab. As one can assume, this will hardly work. How can trust be regenerated and more people invited to get the jab, instead of indirectly pushing them? And how to identify a fraudulent document leveraging technology? In our line of thought, we don't want to mimic the stubbornness of politicians and policymakers, we will look with open eyes into the future, years ahead from now. Trust means relying on someone else's control. The German government has done its best job to lose said trust. (4) as the blue upper line (\"sehr wenig Vertrauen\" = \"very little trust\") in the chart below outlines. Re-creating trust is complex and a long process, so by definition, it doesn't fit into the government's new 10 meters ahead oder genesen\" = \"vaccinated or recovered\"). Only those who either are vaccinated or recovered will be able to join all aspects of life again, with little pieces of paper that have been proven to be easily forgeable as it was only just 10 meters ahead \"thinking\" as well. (3) For the lazy folks, one can also buy them for around $100-150 in the darknet or if you are in the right chat groups. Consequently, for those who really don't want to have the vaccine being jabbed into their body, there are two options: don't join your friends and family anymore or get a document from somewhere else. The role of adequate technology plays a major role in losing & creating trust. Data leaks of personal information of thousands of users (5), the official Corona Warn App with its many fails (6) and the easy-to-fake Green Certificates of the European Union (7) demonstrate everything but confidence. Looking deeper into underlying issues, and exploring why it is so simple to find and use certificates without getting a jab, one common denominator is the inability of proper ID verification, ie proving if the person who holds the document or app is actually the one who claims it to be. In test or vaccination centers, one often just shows quickly their ID and removes their mask a little bit (if at all), or when using the digital certificate only a few actually verify the user's QR code with its credentials and the person's face itself. It takes less than one minute for someone to copy the certificate's QR code of someone else and use it going forward. Automated ID verification has been introduced in the financial services area and many others for many years now, with great success. And biometric data doesn't even need to be stored outside of the smartphone. If the stringent usage of linking one's health credentials to biometric data would have been used, those thousands of forged documents would have been void at the point of use -- and taking away a simple alternative to those who are against getting the jab but expecting to have the same rights and opportunities as such who are fully vaccinated or recovered. German police officials, with their probably limited innovative ideas, even want to flip the coin and request access to the respective health data of all German citizens to simplify their work. (8) Of course, creating another centralized database with all this information would be a massive risk, also when easily accessible by enforcement agencies. And it probably wouldn't last long until this materializes into another mess. Decentralization is key to success. Data should stay with those to whom they belong: the citizen. With this in mind, the aforementioned linking between person, biometrics, ID and vaccine/recovered status would eliminate the need for more data collecting public institutions and manual processes. Assuring vaccinated and recovered persons that they're in a safe area after they get checked (e.g., in a restaurant, club, airport), and making it impossible to forge certificates for vaccines, recovery and tests are essential steps towards recreating trust. Trust that's needed to increase the demand for vaccinations. No policies will change it, trust will. Sources: (1) https://impfdashboard.de/en/ (2) Yale Institute for "}
