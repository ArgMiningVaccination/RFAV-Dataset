Many of these have related to chemicals that may be present in food,including additives (intense sweeteners), processing aids (enzymes), supplements(French Maritime Pine Bark Extracts), food contact materials (terephthalic andisophthalic acids), natural constituents (fluorine, bromine and dioxin-like polychlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls have formed three separate discussionitems, with consideration of results of general dietary exposure, of a specificsurvey of free-range eggs as an indicator of environmental exposure, and the start ofa major review of the tolerable daily intake of these contaminants. The COThas also been asked to advise on the safety of breast implants, on an environmental pollutant, on aspects of research commissioned by the FoodStandards Agency and the Department of Health and on papers dealing with theworkings of scientific advisory committees. We are pleased to note that theCommittee already follows most of the procedures considered to constitute bestpractice for advisory committees. 2000 was also a busy year for COTWorking Groups. An open meeting was held in February to consult on the draft report of the Working Group on Food Intolerance.The final report from this Working Group was published in July 2000, under thetitle \"Adverse Reactions to Food and Food Ingredients\". Two new Working Groupscommenced work during the year, on Phytoestrogens in April, and on RiskAssessment for Mixtures of Pesticides/Veterinary Medicines in December, andexpect to report in 2001 and 2002, respectively. The predominance of food-related issues in the COTagendas led to the decision that the lead responsibility for the Secretariat should be moved to the Food StandardsAgency, on its formation in April 2000. As in previous years, we have been well served by the Secretariat who have continued to ensure the smooth-running of the Committee proceedings and haveprovided working documents of the highest quality. Professor H F Woods (Chairman) BSc BM DPhil FFPM FIFSTHonFFOM FRCP(London & Edinburgh) 9Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment Adverse Reactions to Food and Food Ingredients 1.1 The COTWorking Group on Food Intolerance completed its review of adverse reactions to food. Adraft report was the subject of consultation at anopen meeting of the COTin February 2000 and the final report was publishedin July 2000. The report, entitled \"Adverse Reactions to Food and FoodIngredients\" may be obtained from the COTsecretariat at: The FoodStandards Agency, Room 511C, Aviation House, Kingsway, London WC2B6NH or by contacting Food Standards Agency Publications, PO Box 369,Hayes, Middlesex UB3 1UT(tel: Alitame 1.2 Alitame is an intense sweetener that was initially considered by the COTin 1989. Additional data were submitted during the period 1990-1994 and in1998, both in response to requests made by the COTand as a result ofrequests made to the company by other regulatory bodies. 1.3 In 1998, the COTestablished an Acceptable Daily Intake of 0.3 mg/kg bw per day. This was subsequently confirmed in 1999, following submission ofadditional information by the company. The basis for determining theAcceptable Daily Intake was a significant elevation in liver weight in dogstreated with alitame for 18 months. There was a significant increase in liverweight at 500 mg/kg bw per day and a non-significant increase in male dogsreceiving the next lowest dose (100 mg/kg bw per day). The COTconsideredthat this finding was unusual and that it would be prudent to regard the doseof 100 mg/kg bw per day as a LOAEL. Consequently, the NOAELderivedfor alitame was 30 mg/kg bw per day, the lowest dose tested. Uncertaintyfactors of 10 for inter-species and 10 for intra-individual variability were thenapplied, resulting in the Acceptable Daily Intake of 0.3 mg/kg bw per day. 1.4 The COThad also previously noted other observations of potential concern. Enzyme induction was reported in the dog study, with a NOAELof 100mg/kg bw per day. Astudy in diabetics given alitame 10 mg/kg bw for 90days, had reported a number of cardiovascular complications in some patientsof both the alitame and placebo groups during the follow-up period. 1.5 In 2000, the company submitted the results of a new, more comprehensive study in which diabetics were administered alitame at 10 mg/kg bw per day.Particular emphasis was given to cardiovascular effects, the results indicatingthat alitame was well-tolerated and therefore the company asked for theAcceptable Daily Intake to be increased. 10Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.6 The COTnoted that the diabetic studies had not included an assessment of enzyme induction, and the results of statistical analysis of the new study werequestioned. The COTagreed that the new data were not adequate to justifydecreasing the uncertainty factor and therefore did not warrant review of theAcceptable Daily Intake for alitame. Breast implants 1.7 In 1999 the COTprovided an emergency consideration for the Department of Health and the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) on the safety of breastimplants containing soya bean oil. This contributed to the voluntarywithdrawal of the Trilucent' breast implant due to a lack of adequate safetydata. The MDAsubsequently initiated a review on the safety and performanceof all recently introduced breast implant fillers. 1.8 MDAreviewed the technical information provided by one manufacturer, Poly Implant Prosthesis, on their hydroxylpropyl cellulose hydrogel pre-filledbreast implant. MDAasked the COTto consider the report of a study inwhich rats received subcutaneous injections of the filler material and werethen observed for periods of up to 12 weeks. 1.9 The COTconsidered the rat study to be very limited in nature. There were serious deficiencies in the design, performance and reporting of the study.COTconcluded that the findings of the rat study could not be discounted andsuggested that a study employing a considerably longer period of observationshould be conducted on the filler material. Astatement outlining theconclusions reached by the COTis included at the end of this report. 1.10 On receipt of these conclusions MDAinitiated regulatory activity which led to the voluntary withdrawal of these implants by the manufacturer. This was aprecautionary measure until sufficient information to address MDA'sconcerns over the manufacturer's biological safety assessment of the device isavailable. The withdrawal was made public by an MDADevice Alert (MDADA2000(07)) on 11 December 2000. 1.11 On 5 December MDArequested an emergency consideration of data on a second hydrogel filling material used in NovaGold' breast implants. Thisfilling material was a polyvinylpyrrolidone and guar gum gel. As described inthe 1999 Annual Report, emergency consideration can be undertaken with theagreement of the COTChairman and provides the collated opinions of alimited number of individual members with particularly relevant expertise.The information was circulated to a number of members on 5 December.Their opinions were received by 8 December and were passed to MDA.MDAreleased an MDADevice Alert (MDADA2000(08)) on 11 December, 11Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentwhich identified inadequacies in the manufacturer's biological safety assessment and concluded that as a precautionary measure these implantsshould not be implanted until the concerns have been addressed. Code of Practice for Scientific Advisory Committees 1.12 In July 2000, the Office of Science and Technology published a consultation paper, inviting comments on a proposed code of practice for ScientificAdvisory Committees. The paper outlined proposed guidelines for ScientificAdvisory Committees and complemented a second document on \"Review OfRisk Procedures Used By The Government's Advisory Committees DealingWith Food Safety\", which was published in September 2000 and alsodiscussed by the COT(see paragraphs 1.72 - 1.78). The consultation paperdescribed the duties, rights and responsibilities of committee members andtheir independence from the committee's secretariat, stressing the need forinclusivity, transparency and proportionality and raising the issue of themanner in which confidential information is handled. It stressed the need forclear explanation of levels and types of uncertainty, and how this informationis incorporated into advice, and called for training of committee members incommunication skills. 1.13 The Secretariat noted that producing a set of uniform guidelines would enable interested parties, the public and the media to judge and comment on thestandards required of such committees. 1.14 Members agreed that the COTalready follows the procedures defined as far as is practicable. COTnoted that considerable steps have been made toincrease transparency. However there was concern that publication of somematerial or attribution of comments made during a meeting couldcompromise personal security. 1.15 Members also discussed the issue of confidential papers and noted that steps have been taken to reduce or eliminate use of material classified asconfidential. Where commercial confidentiality precluded full publication, itwas suggested that at least part of the paper and the Committee'sdeliberations should be published. The Secretariat informed Members thatwhere material was \"commercial in confidence\", it is normal procedure toapproach companies to determine whether they would be willing for part, ifnot all, of the papers concerning their product to be made publicly available.(Procedures for openness are outlined in Annex 3). 12Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.16 Members noted the suggestion that Chairs and Secretariats should review board members interests, taking into account: \"the proportion of the totalequity value which is held\" (where share holdings are under consideration).It was stressed that it is well-established COTprocedure to tabulateMembers'interests in the annual report, but that it would be difficult toquantify interests. 1.17 With regard to Secretariat duties, Members noted that the COTwould continue to encourage submission of Secretariat reviews to journals forpublication in peer-reviewed journals. Dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs - Dietary exposure 1.18 COTwas asked to consider estimates of dietary exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs derived from the 1997 Total Diet Study. Dietary exposuresto dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs had previously been estimated from the 1982and 1992 Total Diet Studies. Since these earlier data were published, theWHO had recommended /revised Toxic Equivalency Factors (TEFs) fordioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, which were endorsed by the COTin 1998.Therefore, the 1982 and 1992 exposure estimates had been recalculated usingthese latest WHO-TEFs in order to be directly comparable with the new data. 1.19 In comparison with earlier similar surveys, dietary exposures to dioxin-like compounds, on a total toxic equivalent (TEQ) basis, for all three age groups,showed a continuing downward trend. 1.20 COTagreed the data indicated that changes in analytical sensitivity, or in the number of food groups analysed, had not contributed significantly to thedecline in exposure. COTtherefore agreed it should be stressed that thedecline in exposure to these compounds was real and not an experimentalartefact. 1.21 The COTagreed a statement (included at the end of this report) on dietary exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, concluding that the currentconcentrations of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in food are unlikely to pose arisk to health. 13Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentDioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in free range eggs 1.22 COTwas informed of a Food Standards Agency survey of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in free-range hen and duck eggs. The aim of the survey wasto examine the use of eggs as indicators of environmental contamination andthe results were not considered as being representative of free-range eggs onsale throughout the UK. 1.23 Dietary exposure had been estimated using the concentrations of these compounds in free-range eggs together with age-specific food consumptiondata, and used different scenarios based upon average or maximumconcentrations in the eggs. 1.24 Advice was sought from the COTon the public health significance of the estimated dietary exposures to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs based on datafrom this survey of free-range eggs. Members were also asked to considerwhether the survey was sufficiently robust to draw conclusions applicable toconsumers of free-range eggs and whether the different exposure scenarioswere realistic with respect to anticipated consumption patterns of free-rangeeggs. 1.25 COTagreed that the survey should be considered as a hypothesis generating study, indicating that analysis of free-range eggs is a potentially usefultechnique for investigating environmental contamination. However, becauseof the sampling methodology and the limited number of samples taken, thedata from this survey should not be used to estimate dietary exposures tothese compounds for consumers of free-range eggs. There was also a paucityof data on concentrations of these compounds in other types of eggs, such asbattery hen eggs, against which meaningful comparisons could be made. 1.26 The COTstatement on the survey is included at the end of this report. Di-isopropylnaphthalenes 1.27 Di-isopropylnaphthalenes (DIPN) are used as solvents for the colour former in carbonless copy-paper, which may be included in recycled paper used inmaking board for food-packaging. Treatment of the recycled fibres may failto remove all of the DIPN and thus some may be present in the finished boardand could migrate into food. The Committee gave consideration to a surveyon DIPN during 1998, and agreed that the toxicological information wasinadequate and that additional studies should be submitted within 3 years.(See paragraphs 1.5 - 1.6 of 1998 Annual Report). 14Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.28 COM reviewed new mutagenicity data on DIPN in February 2000. It concluded that DIPN could be regarded as non-mutagenic and that no furthermutagenicity testing was required (see paragraphs 2.11 - 2.12 of this report).COTwas asked whether, in light of the new mutagenicity data and the advicefrom the COM, it wished to revise its previous position on DIPN and itsearlier requirement for a long-term study. 1.29 The COTconsidered that, even though DIPN could be regarded as non- mutagenic, there was still a need for further safety studies. In view of the factthat there were no longer concerns that DIPN may be a genotoxic carcinogen,and that intakes of DIPN were low, a carcinogenicity study was no longerrequired. Instead the COTagreed that a 28-day sighting study for doseselection, followed by a 90-day study would be acceptable. Because the dataon human exposure levels are limited, the Committee stressed the importanceof ensuring that appropriate dose levels were used in the proposed studies,achieving some toxicity at the highest dose. 1.30 COTre-iterated its previous advice that it would be prudent to ensure that the levels of DIPN in food packaging made from recycled paper and boardshould be kept as low as reasonably practicable. Enzyme submission - Amano 90 1.31 COTconsidered the Amano 90 submission by postal consultation in 1999. At that time COTrequired further evidence to support the company's claim thatno residual enzyme activity would be expected in bread after baking, furthervalidation of the enzyme assays and an increase in the frequency of testingfor mycotoxins and antibacterial activity. COTagreed to recommend a twelvemonth temporary clearance of Amano 90 for use in bread making, whileawaiting the additional data from the company. 1.32 In response the company had submitted the results of a study aiming to demonstrate that Amano 90 is inactivated during the baking process, togetherwith data on the repeatability of the assay used to determine enzyme activity.The company also provided written assurance that one in every four batchesof Amano 90 would be tested for mycotoxins and antibacterial activity. 1.33 In the study submitted, Amano 90 was added to flour, at the recommended concentration and also at a 40-fold higher concentration, either prior to orsubsequent to baking. Enzyme activity was only detected in the bread samplein which the higher concentration of Amano 90 was added after baking, beingbelow the limit of detection in all the other samples. However, COTconsidered that the method routinely used to assay enzyme activity inproduction batches of Amano 90 was not sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate 15Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentenzyme inactivation during baking of bread containing the recommended concentration of enzyme. COTrecommended that a more sensitive methodshould be developed, and a limit of detection in bread defined. The improvedassay should then be used in a repeat study, with duplicate analyses. 1.34 COTconsidered that the data submitted were not adequate to demonstrate the validity of the enzyme assay. COTagreed that a better description of the datawould be helpful and this should include data on the linearity of the enzymeassay. 1.35 COTwelcomed the statement of intent to increase routine testing of mycotoxins and antibacterial activity in at least one in four batches but wasunable to recommend full clearance of the enzyme preparation, Amano 90. Enzyme submission - Chymosin 1.36 Chymosin had previously been evaluated by COTand had been granted clearance. The manufacturer had now developed a modified recovery andpurification procedure for this enzyme preparation. 1.37 COTconsidered that additional information was required to confirm the similarity between the product of the modified purification process and theoriginal product. In addition several technical issues relating to the modifiedprocess required further clarification, as did the current specification for theenzyme preparation. The Committee agreed to one year's temporary clearancewhilst this further information was provided. Enzyme submission - Lipase D 1.38 COTconducted a postal consultation of a submission seeking approval of an immobilised enzyme preparation, Lipase D, to be used in manufacture ofyellow fat spreads. The responses were discussed and agreed by the fullCommittee. COTagreed that the level of detail submitted on themanufacturing processes was appropriate and recommended that: the production strain of Rhizopus oryzae should be deposited with a recognised culture collection; the specification for the immobilised enzyme should include limits forheavy metals; 16Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmenttesting for moulds and yeasts should be conducted on every batch and mycotoxins and antibacterial activity should be analysed in at least onein four batches; in the absence of toxicological data on a polymer used in the process,evidence that this polymer is not found in the final inter-esterifiedproduct or products should be provided. 1.39 COTagreed to recommend a two-year temporary clearance for the use of immobilised Lipase D in production of yellow fat spreads, pendingsubmission of the requested analytical data. Enzyme submission - Newlase 1.40 Newlase was granted temporary clearance pending the submission of further data in 1994. Additional data were submitted in 1998 and COTrecommendedfurther temporary clearance, pending the submission of a satisfactory methodfor the detection of the mycotoxin rhizoxin. Data on the detection of rhizoxin,submitted to the COTin 1999, were considered inadequate. The companysubsequently submitted a revised methodology. 1.41 COTconsidered the new methodology would be sufficiently robust to demonstrate the absence of rhizoxin, subject to some additional requirements.These modifications involved the analysis of an appropriate Newlase samplespiked with rhizoxin with each batch and specification of the percentagerecoveries of spiked samples compared to the equivalent concentrationanalysed by direct injection as part of the same analytical run. 1.42 COT agreed to extend the temporary clearance for an additional two years, provided that the recommended amendments to the protocol were adhered toand that batches of Newlase in which rhizoxin was detected should not bemarketed. COTrequested that during this period, the company collate analyticaldata on routine rhizoxin analyses of at least one in every four Newlase batches.These data should be submitted so that the COTcould be assured that themethodology was adequate for routine assay of production batches of Newlase. Fluorine, bromine and iodine 1.43 COTwas informed of the results of analyses of fluorine, bromine, and iodine on samples collected for the 1997 Total Diet Study. COTwas also providedwith estimates of mean population, and mean and high-level adult consumerdietary intakes of fluorine, bromine, and iodine. Dietary intakes for agegroups other than adults had not been estimated. 17Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.44 It was noted that there are no guidelines for fluorine against which to assess estimated dietary intakes. COTwill await the findings of a review of fluorineby the Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM) before consideringany potential effects associated with intake of this element. 1.45 COTnoted that since the essentiality of bromide is unclear, the FAO/WHO ADI of 0-1 mg bromide/kg body weight should be considered as a TolerableDaily Intake (TDI) of 1mg bromide/kg body weight. It was agreed that theestimated intakes of bromide were not a cause for concern. 1.46 With regards to dietary intakes of iodine, COTconfirmed that its 1999 advice (See paragraph 1.17 of 1999 Annual Report) still applied ie these intakes ofiodine are unlikely to pose a risk to health. However, it reiterated its previousrecommendation on the need for investigation of the bioavailability of iodinein milk and indicated that it may wish to reconsider its advice in light of theforthcoming findings of the EVM review of iodine. Astatement on this studyis included at the end of this report. Food Standards Agency funded research and surveys 1.47 COTwas informed that most of the current research portfolio within the Food Standard Agency (FSA) is based on research programmes inherited fromMAFF. At the request of the FSABoard, a Research Review Group had beenestablished to review research within the FSAand ensure that the overallresearch strategy and priorities reflect the FSAfuture requirements. TheGroup is expected to hold three meetings and is due to report in the spring of2001. 1.48 The Review Group had set up a Working Party, comprising senior Agency officials and outside independent experts including academics, other researchfunders, consumer groups and industry, to be responsible for the detailedreview. COTwas informed that the Working Party is conducting aconsultation exercise and was invited to contribute. COTrequested andreceived clarification relating to: funds for research on risk management/risk communication; funds for research on animal feedstuffs; the basis for collaboration with MAFF and DH. openness and responsiveness to researchers with suggestions for newareas to be included on research agendas 18Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.49 COTwas not in favour of making long term commitments to specific \"centres of excellence\", which could deter other potential applicants and inhibitdevelopment of new areas of research. However, it was agreed that longerterm funding is needed to attract and retain good research staff. TheCommittee were informed that most research contracts cover a three-yearperiod. 1.50 The issue of quality assurance for research was raised: COTwas informed that there is a need to develop quality assurance criteria for aspects such asensuring management protocols within laboratories and independent appraisalof the quality of the work. 1.51 COTagreed that the design of surveys should take into account the need to interpret human health implications of the data. French Maritime Pine Bark Extracts 1.52 COThad reviewed French Maritime Pine Bark Extract on previous occasions (see paragraph 1.7 of 1998 and paragraph 1.11 of 1999 Annual Reports) andnoted the possibility that the product might contain allergenic proteins. Themanufacturers had submitted new information addressing this issue. 1.53 COTconsidered that elemental analysis for nitrogen was not sufficiently sensitive and could not be used to exclude the possibility that the extractcontained allergenic proteins. The SDS-PAGE analysis was considered to bemore reliable but more information on the method used was needed,particularly in view of the fact that pine bark extract was a complex material.In addition, each analysis should include a concurrent control. Health effects in populations living close to landfill sites 1.54 In 1998, COTcommented on a SAHSU (Small Area Health Statistics Unit) proposal for a study on health effects in populations living close to landfillsites (see paragraphs 1.9 - 1.15 of 1998 Annual Report). The protocol hadbeen revised following identification of all relevant sites, and the Committeewas asked to consider the amended protocol and comment on whether it wasappropriate to proceed with the study. 1.55 The Committee noted that the primary objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that living near a landfill site is associated with an excess risk ofgiving birth to a child with a congenital anomaly or of low birth weight, orwith an excess risk of stillbirth. The secondary objective was to test the 19Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmenthypothesis that living near a landfill site is associated with an excess risk of certain cancers. 1.56 After discussion of aspects of the study design and possible confounding factors, the Committee considered that it was appropriate to proceed with thestudy but urged caution in interpretation of the results. Hexachlorobutadiene 1.57 Hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD) is formed as a by-product during the manufacture of chlorinated solvents. COTwas informed of public healthconcerns related to possible prolonged exposure to HCBD in the vicinity of adisused waste dump in a quarry in Cheshire, and was asked to provide adviceon the toxicity of HCDB. 1.58 COTnoted that advice had been sought from some members of the COM, who had reviewed the mutagenicity data on HCBD. They had advised that itwas prudent to assume that HCBD is an in vivo somatic cell mutagen. COT therefore agreed that it was not possible to establish a safe level in relation tocancer or to identify a TDI. Thus, it would be more appropriate to determinemargins of exposure, by comparing the measured air levels with the dosesproducing effects in the toxicology studies. 1.59 On the basis of some conservative approximations, the NOAELfor non- cancer effects of 0.2mg/kg bw/day in animal studies was estimated to beequivalent to continuous inhalation of an air level of 60ppb HCBD. Theeffect level for non-cancer effects estimated to beequivalent to 600ppb HCBD in air and the effect level for tumours of20mg/kg bw/day was equivalent to 6,000ppb HCBD in air. 1.60 COTnoted that there are qualitative similarities between humans and animals in the way that HCBD is distributed and metabolised in the body, andtherefore continuous exposure to a concentration of less than 0.6 ppb HCBDin air (which allows for a 100-fold Margin of Exposure compared to theNOAELequivalent of 60ppb) could be regarded as being without appreciableadverse health effects in respect of non-carcinogenic and reproductive effects. 1.61 This level was approximately 10,000 times lower than the dose that caused cancer in animals following lifetime dietary exposure and therefore COTconsidered that the carcinogenic risk at these low exposure levels wasminimal and was not of appreciable health concern. However, given theuncertainties in the data, the Committee considered that exposure should bereduced to as low a level as reasonably practicable. 20Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.62 The Committee was informed that health studies are being undertaken of exposed individuals. There is also a proposal to develop a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model for HCBD exposure. In addition, theCommittee was informed that a technique is being developed to allowanalysis for HCBD at parts per trillion concentrations in air. The Committeewelcomed this information and considered that the results of these studiesshould inform a further review by the Committee, in due course, of itsconclusions on the health significance of low-level exposures to HCBD. 1.63 The COTstatement is included at the end of this report. Multiple Chemical Sensitivity 1.64 COTlast considered this item in 1999 when it agreed that there was a need to continue monitoring developments in the field so that the issues could bereconsidered when more information became available (see paragraphs 1.25 -1.27, 1999 Annual Report). However, it noted that there were no consistentpatterns of symptoms or exposure data to define the condition, and concludedthat on the basis of knowledge current at the time, there was insufficientevidence to make comments on potential mechanisms or to recommendfurther research in this area. 1.65 COTwas asked to consider a recent report published by the British Society for Allergy, Environmental and Nutritional Medicine (BSAENM) (Eaton et al., J. Nutr. Environ. Med. 10, 39-84, 2000). This reviewed prevalence, possible mechanisms, clinical signs, diagnosis and patient management ofMultiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS). The review had generatedconsiderable public interest and referred to links between MCS and allergy(including food allergy). However it contained little peer-reviewed data. Onenew paper (Kreutzer et al., Am. J. Epidemiology 150, 1-12, 1999) which had not previously been considered by the COT, claimed a high prevalence (6%)of MCS, based on a telephone interview. COTwas asked whether theBSAENM report warranted any change in its 1999 view. 1.66 COTremarked on the limited number of peer reviewed studies cited in the BSAENM report. There was discussion in the report of the need for tests tobe developed to aid diagnosis but there was a major problem regarding theabsence of any clear definition of MCS which was a condition based onpatient-defined criteria with no consistent pattern of symptoms. The term isassociated with a wide range of chemicals and symptoms so diverse that it isnot possible to define mechanisms or formulate studies to consider possiblemechanisms. 21Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.67 COTquestioned the discussion in the BSAENM report of high dose effects of chemicals, such as depletion of nutrients, in considering low dose effects. Thereport also referred to TILT(Toxicant Induced Loss of Tolerance), and type Ballergy, with reference to a collection of unexplained symptoms. COTnotedthat there is no scientific basis for these concepts, and that they are notaccepted by the immunology community. 1.68 The new study of Kreutzer et al(1999) was based on telephone interviews with physician-assisted diagnoses. There was an indication that theparticipants may have been asked leading questions and the approach wasconsidered to lack objectivity and accuracy. Another limitation was an almostcomplete lack of exposure data. 1.69 COTconsidered the case-files in the BSAENM paper. It was pointed out that when individual cases of MCS are investigated they often led to diagnosis ofchemical allergy to a single specific chemical agent. People with allergy toone chemical may be more sensitive to effects of other chemicals. COTtherefore agreed that problems with sensitivity to chemicals can occur butthat these are not necessarily Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. The term\"multiple\" may be applied simply because a specific causal agent has notbeen identified. 1.70 COTalso considered the suggestion that funds should be allocated on a ring- fenced basis for research on MCS. However, it considered that the lack ofevidence for any mechanism of action prevented formulation of a soundresearch programme. 1.71 After careful consideration of the BSAEMN report COTconcluded that there was no basis for modifying the view expressed in 1999. Risk procedures used by the Government's Advisory Committees dealing with food safety 1.72 COTwas informed that, at the Prime Minister's request, Sir Robert May (then Chief Scientific Advisor to the Government) together with the ChiefMedical Officer, Professor Liam Donaldson, and the Chairman of the FoodStandards Agency, Sir John Krebs, had carried out a review of risk proceduresin scientific committees that deal with food safety. The review group alsoincluded representatives of the devolved administrations and Dr JimMcQuaid, former Health and Safety Executive (HSE) Chief Scientist andChairman of the Interdepartmental Liaison Group on Risk Assessment(ILGRA). The completed review outlined how the committees approachedrisk analysis and provided recommendations for best practice. 22Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.73 Chairmen of the relevant committees (including the COT) were interviewed and asked to provide information on the committee approaches to riskassessment, information about risk communication, and its role in riskmanagement. 1.74 COTconsidered that it is rigorous in its risk assessment and that the actual approach taken needs to be determined by the specific situation and notdictated by a formal systematic structure. However, a more structuredframework for information gathering (for instance, details of literaturesearches) might help to increase transparency and confidence in the database. 1.75 There was considerable discussion over the issue of providing advice on risk management. It was agreed that, although the COT's primary aim is toprovide advice on risk assessment, occasions can arise when it is necessary toreview the toxicological implications of alternatives for risk managementprocedures. However, a clear distinction was made between technicalassessments of policy options and making judgements on possible politicaltrade-offs. It was noted that, in providing risk assessment advice to policymakers, committees need to clarify the assumptions made and theuncertainties involved in their assessments. Where the COTdid provideviews on possible risk management options these should be carefullydelineated and not weighted by areas outside of Members'expertise. 1.76 COTconsidered that recent measures had greatly increased openness and that very significant moves had been made towards making the findings moreaccessible and transparent. It was agreed that minutes should remainanonymous because of personal security issues. It was stressed that COTreaches a collective decision and therefore unanimity is not an issue. 1.77 It was acknowledged that a degree of communication between expert committees arose mainly from cross membership of advisory committees.Members welcomed a suggestion that, at least on an occasional basis, theyshould meet with their counterparts on other committees. 1.78 Although Members were not usually called upon to discuss Committee conclusions with the media, it was agreed that training in risk communicationwould be helpful. Sucralose 1.79 COTlast discussed sucralose in 1999, when a new teratogenicity study in rabbits was presented. COTconcluded that the \"study was adequate anddemonstrated that sucralose is not a specific developmental toxicant\" and thatthe No-Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for the study was 23Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment350mg/kg bw/day. COTwas content to leave the determination of an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) to the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). 1.80 COTwas informed that the SCF had completed its review and concluded that the effects on the gastrointestinal tract of the dams in the teratogenicity studywere most likely to be attributable to high doses of poorly digestiblesubstances, to which the rabbit is particularly sensitivity. The NOAELidentified by the study was therefore not considered to be relevant to settingthe ADI. ANOAELof 1500 mg/kg bw per day was identified from a numberof dietary and gavage studies. Application of a 100-fold safety factor resultedin an ADI of 0-15 mg/kg bw per day. 1.81 COTnoted and endorsed the SCF opinion and ADI of 0-15 mg/kg bw per day. Terephthalic and isophthalic acids in food 1.82 Terephthalic acid (TA) and isophthalic acid (IA) are starting materials in the manufacture of polyester resins, which are used in coatings on the internalsurface of some metal cans designed to come into contact with food. 1.83 The views of the COTwere sought on the health implications of the results of a survey of TAand IAmigration from can coatings into food. In particular theCOTwas asked to give its views on the possibility that these compoundsmight have endocrine disrupting activity. 1.84 COTwas provided with estimates of intake of IAand TAby infants, toddlers and adults, based upon levels found in canned foods in this survey. 1.85 The toxicology of both TAand IAhad been reviewed by the European Commission's (EC) Scientific Committee for Food (SCF). The SCF had set arestriction (for migration) of for IAand a TDI for TAof 0.125mg/kg bw per day. 1.86 COTconsidered that the available toxicology data were old and not carried out to modern standards. In particular the Committee noted the presence ofurinary bladder stones and associated tumours that developed in a long-termrat study carried out with a concentration of 5% TPAin the diet and requestedthat the views of the COM should be sought on the available in vivo genotoxicity data. 1.87 COTconcluded that the concentrations of TAand IAthat had been determined in foods analysed in the survey were not of concern for publichealth on the basis of available information. However, it was considered that 24Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentthe available toxicity studies were not adequate to exclude the possibility of endocrine disruptor activity, and therefore appropriate studies should beconducted. 1.88 The COTstatement on the survey is included at the end of this report. Working Group on Risk Assessment of Mixtures of Pesticides 1.89 Risk assessment of pesticides has been carried out by measuring residue levels of individual pesticides in food and calculating whether intakes werelikely to exceed the ADI for that pesticide. Usually this has not taken intoaccount concurrent exposure to a number of pesticides via the same route(termed \"cumulative exposure\") or concurrent exposure to one or morepesticides via a different route (termed \"aggregate exposure\"). This has beena source of concern to a number of groups including consumers. Interest inan aggregate approach has been fuelled by the US Food Quality ProtectionAct, which mandates that intakes from all sources including food, drinkingwater and other sources should be considered. It also mandates thattoxicological effects of exposure to more than one pesticide functioning bythe same mechanism of action (eg cholinesterase inhibitors) should beconsidered. In addition, a considerable body of work has been carried out onthe toxicology of mixtures in the US and the assumption is made thatcompounds with the same toxicological action will act in an additive fashionwhereas those with different actions will act independently. 1.90 COTwas informed that the Food Standards Agency considers that \"combined\" risk assessment of pesticides is a priority area. In order toconsider cumulative and aggregate exposures, consideration needs to begiven to the relative toxicity of the compounds, the magnitude of residues andthe amounts of foods consumed. It may also be necessary to consider othersources of these chemicals such as drinking water and veterinary residueswith similar action to the pesticide under consideration, and other means ofexposure, such as occupational and domestic exposure. COTwas asked toconsider establishing a Working Group to review these issues. 1.91 COTagreed to the establishment of the Working Group and approved the terms of reference and membership. The Working Group expects to reportwithin 18 months. 25Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentOngoing work Dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs - Consideration of the TDI 1.92 COT has commenced a review of the recent risk assessments of dioxins carried out by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the EU Scientific Committee onFood (SCF), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA).As part of this review COTwill be reconsidering the tolerable daily intake (TDI).The Committee aims to complete its review of dioxins as soon as possible butaccepted that it would not be complete before mid-2001 at the earliest. Withoutreviewing of the available data independently, COTwas not content to acceptthat the studies selected by the WHO and SCF to inform their tolerable intakeswere the most appropriate for this purpose. 1.93 COTproposed to review the evidence of effects other than cancer, taking into account the information provided by EPA, WHO and SCF. The Committee onCarcinogenicity (COC) was asked to review the evidence of carcinogenicityand the risk assessment procedure adopted by the US-EPA. COTagreed that itwould be valuable to consult additional experts in other specialised areas. Background on the three major assessments being considered by COT. 1.94 In 1998, a consultation of the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health (WHO-ECEH) and the International Programme on Chemical Safety(IPCS) recommended a TDI for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in the range of 1-4pg WHO-TEQ/kg. The WHO assessment was published in 2000 (van Leeuwenand Younes, Food Additives and Contaminants 17(4) 223-369). The WHO TDI was derived using the NOAEL/LOAELs of what were considered to be the mostsensitive effects in experimental animals, and body burdens associated with theseNOAEL/LOAELs (as opposed to daily intakes) were used to extrapolatebetween species. These body burdens were used in turn to calculate the estimateddaily intake (EDI) considered to result in comparable steady state body burdensin humans. The use of body burdens was assumed to obviate the need for anuncertainty factor to account for species differences in toxicokinetics. TEFs wereused to account for differences in toxicokinetics and potency between dioxin-likecompounds. The consultation decided on an uncertainty factor of 10 to accountboth for interspecies and interindividual differences and the use of LOAELsinstead of NOAELs. COTdid not regard the information presented to besufficient to make a judgement on whether the endpoints used by the WHOconsultation to derive its TDI were the critical adverse effects. 26Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.95 Atask force of the SCF reported its review of the TDI for dioxins in November 2000. It concluded that dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs should beallocated a temporary Tolerable Weekly Intake (t-TWI) of 7 pg WHO-TEQ/kg bw. The opinion is available on the SCF website at: http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/scf/outcome_en.html#opinions 1.96 The second draft of the US-EPAreassessment of dioxins was released during 2000. As in its previous (1995) assessment, the US-EPAconsidered thatcancer is the critical endpoint and used low dose linear extrapolation toestimate the risk to humans. The validity of the US-EPAapproach to the risksto health from exposure to of dioxins will be considered in addition to theTDI approach. The US-EPAdraft reassessment is available on the EPAwebsite at http://www.epa.gov/nceawww1/pdfs/dioxin/cd_index.html. Hyperactivity and Food Additives 1.97 COTwas asked to consider the results of a research project entitled \"Do food additives cause hyperactivity and behaviour problems in a geographicallydefined population of three-year-olds?\" Ashort statement was drafted, itsrelease to coincide with release of the study results. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) - Pragmatic guideline limits in food for use in emergencies. 1.98 COTwas asked to consider the appropriateness of setting pragmatic guideline limits for PAHs in food. Guideline limits would be helpful in formulatingadvice on dealing with incidents, such as fires or oil spills, which resulted inPAH contamination of food. In such situations, it may be necessary to makedecisions on possible restriction of harvesting or marketing the affectedfoodstuffs. 1.99 COTnoted that some of the PAHs are generally accepted to be experimental carcinogens and occupational exposure to mixtures of PAHs have been shownto be associated with human cancer. The COC had identified threecompounds as being of greatest concern in respect of carcinogenic hazard onthe basis of in vivomutagenicity and/or multi-site carcinogenicity. These are benzo(a)pyrene, benz(a)anthracene and dibenz(a,h)anthracene. 27Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment1.100 The COTwas informed by published data on reported concentrations of individual PAHs that have been detected in various foods, and noted thatsmoking of food and some cooking processes, such as grilling andbarbequing, may result in higher concentrations being detected. 1.101 COTis considering a statement on pragmatic guidelines for PAHs in food for approval and release in 2001. 28Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentStatements of the COT Statement on a Toxicity Study in the Rat of a Hydrogel Filler for Breast Implants Statement on Dietary Exposure to Dioxins and Dioxin-Like PCBsStatement on Dioxins and Dioxin-Like PCBs in Free-Range EggsStatement on the 1997 Total Diet Study - Fluorine, Bromine and Iodine Statement on HexachlorobutadieneStatement on Terephthalic Acid and Isophthalic Acids from Can Coatings 29Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentStatement on a Toxicity Study in the Rat of a Hydrogel Filler for Breast Implants Introduction 1. The Committee was informed that, because of concerns raised by clinicians about the safety of the fillers used in breast implants, the Medical DevicesAgency (MDA) had decided to review the safety data on a hydrogel pre-filledbreast implant manufactured for Poly Implant Prostheses. The MDAhadasked the Committee to consider the report of a study in the rat in which theanimals had received subcutaneous injections of the filler material and hadthen been observed for periods of up to 12 weeks. 1 The implant 2. The filler comprises 92% of physiological saline gelled with 8% of a polysaccharide. It is understood that the polysaccharide is based on a cellulosederivative and forms long, linear chains linked by bridges. This gel iscontained within a silicone elastomer shell. The rat toxicity study 3. The Committee was advised that the only toxicity study of any duration was one in which groups of five rats were injected once subcutaneously on either flankwith the gel filler material or with saline as a control. Groups of dosed andcontrol rats were killed after 3 days, 4 weeks and 12 weeks. Limited observationswere made during life and at necropsy. In the groups of rats that were killed at 4and 12 weeks no abnormal clinical signs or differences in body weight werereported for either treated or control animals. However, in the treated animalsresidues of the gel and poorly characterised tissue damage were observed at theinjection site. At these times there were histopathological changes in lymphnodes, livers and, to a lesser extent, the kidneys of the treated animals. 4. The Committee considered that, despite having been carried out in 1996, the study was unsatisfactory in its design, execution and reporting. It was the viewof the Committee that the changes in the lymph nodes represented a real effectand were consistent with a chronic inflammatory response. These changesrequire further study, including investigation of lymph nodes close to anddistant from the site of injection. In addition, there should be investigation ofthe lesions reported in the liver and kidney and of the reversibility of anychanges observed. 30Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentConclusions i) The Committee considered that the conclusion of the study, namely that there were no pathological findings in the organs examined, wasnot supported by the limited experimental results provided, which wereconsidered to be imprecise and inadequate. ii) The Committee agreed that the findings from the study could not be discounted. The Committee was not able to exclude the possibility thatthe reported lesions were indicative of a toxic or immunologically-mediated response. iii) The Committee considered that further testing should be undertaken involving the administration of single doses of the filler gel withlonger-term follow-up and with more detailed reporting compatiblewith current guidelines for chronic toxicity tests.

We have been informed of the results of a study conducted by the former Joint Food Safety and Standards Group of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries andFood and the Department of Health in which Total Diet Study (TDS) samplescollected in 1997 were analysed for the dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and (PCDFs), collectivelyreferred to as dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). 1 Tolerable Daily Intake 2. In 1992 we endorsed a Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) of 10 picograms/kilogram body weight(10 pg/kg bw) that had been recommended by the World Health Organization(WHO) Regional Office for Europe. We also recommended that whenconsidering mixtures of dioxins the TDI could be regarded as being expressedin Toxic Equivalents of TCDD (TEQs), calculated using internationally agreedToxic Equivalency Factors (TEFs) for dioxin congeners, ie 10 pg TEQ/kg bw. 2 3. In our 1997 review of the health hazards of PCBs, we were unable to set a TDI for total PCBs. However, we considered that the use of TEFs for certaindioxin-like PCB congeners offered a pragmatic approach to assess thepotential toxicity of these dioxin-like PCBs and that they should be consideredin combination with dioxins. 3 4. Recently, we have endorsed the TEFs recommended by a WHO European Centre for Environment and Health (ECEH) consultation for the seventeen2,3,7,8-substituted dioxin congeners and twelve dioxin-like PCB congeners. 4, 5 5. We are aware that a recent WHO International Program for Chemical Safety (IPCS)/ECEH consultation has recommended a TDI range for dioxins anddioxin-like PCBs of 1-4 pg TEQ/kg bw. 6We have not yet had the opportunity to review the data used by the consultation to derive the recentlyrecommended WHO-TDI. We will undertake such a review when a full reportof the consultation is available. In the interim we have considered the resultsof the 1997 TDS survey using both the current UK-TDI and the recentlyrecommended WHO-TDI. 32Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentEstimated dietary exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs 6. We have been provided with estimates of dietary exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs of adults, schoolchildren and toddlers ie children aged 11/2 to 41/2. The same methodology has been used to estimate dietary exposures from the 1997 TDS as was used to estimate exposures for these age groupsfrom the 1982 and 1992 TDS. 1 We note that where concentrations of these compounds in food were below the limit of detection, the concentration hasbeen assumed to be at the limit of detection. It is considered that thisapproach overestimates dietary exposures to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.We have been informed that dietary exposure of adults and schoolchildrenhas been estimated using food consumption data for these specific groups. 7, 8 7. While food consumption data for toddlers do exist,9 due to a current limitation in the methodology used to estimate exposures, the consumption of 'toddler-specific'foods cannot yet be determined. As a result, toddler food consumptiondata were not used directly to estimate toddler dietary exposures from previousTotal Diet Studies. 10 Toddler dietary exposure has been estimated previously by scaling the estimated dietary exposure of adults by the relative energy contentsof adult and toddler diet. The energy content of the latter was calculated fromthe toddler food consumption data. 9 For comparative purposes, this approach has also been used to estimate dietary exposure of toddlers from the 1997TDS. 1 However, toddler exposures have now also been estimated from the 1997 TDS (and retrospectively from the 1982 and 1992 TDS for comparativepurposes) directly using toddler food consumption data. We note that thisapproach does not take into account exposures resulting from the consumptionof 'toddler-specific'foods but we consider that it provides a more robustestimate of toddlers'dietary exposure than the earlier approach. However, werecommend that the methodology is revised as soon as possible so as to takeaccount of consumption of 'toddler-specific'foods and we ask to see theserevised exposure estimates at the earliest opportunity. 8. Dietary exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, estimated from the 1982, 1992, and 1997 Total Diet Studies, for average and high-level (97.5thpercentile) adult, schoolchild, and toddler consumers (using both approaches)are presented in the Table. The Table presents toddler dietary exposuresestimated from toddler food consumption data and also presents exposuresestimated by scaling adult consumption patterns by the energy content of thetoddler diet. Dietary exposures estimated using toddler food consumptiondata are higher than when estimated by scaling adult consumption patterns bythe energy content of the toddler diet. Exposures estimated from the 1982 and1992 TDS have been recalculated using the new WHO-TEFs so that the dataare comparable to dietary exposures estimated from the 1997 TDS. 33Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentCommittee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment9. The estimated dietary exposures to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs for both average and high-level consumers from the three age groups are at or withinthe current UK-TDI of 10 pg TEQ/kg bw. Furthermore, the estimatedaverage and high level dietary exposures for adult and schoolchild consumersare also below the upper value of the recently recommended WHO-TDI of 1-4 pg TEQ/kg bw. However, the estimated dietary exposures for toddlers whoare average consumers are at or slightly above the upper value of this TDI.The upper value of this TDI is exceeded approximately two-fold by alltoddlers who are high-level consumers. 10. The estimated dietary exposures to dioxin-like compounds, on a total TEQ basis, for all three age groups show a continuing downward trend, albeit lesssteeply compared with the decline between 1982 and 1992. However, thedietary exposures to dioxin-like PCBs estimated from the 1997 TDS are verysimilar to those estimated from the 1992 TDS. 34Annual report 2000 Year 1982 1992 1997 Consumertype Average High-level Average High-level Average High-levelAge-group Adults 7.2 13 2.5 4.3 1.8 3.1 Schoolchildren 8.6 15 3.0 4.7 2.2 3.5 Toddlers (estimated using toddler food consumption data) 1 1/2to 21/2 23 49 7.5 14 5. 1 1 0 21/2to 31/2 19 41 6.3 11 4.4 8.4 31/2to 41/2(boys) 17 33 5.6 9.2 4.0 6.9 31/2to 41/2(girls) 17 34 5.6 9.6 4.0 7.2 Toddlers (estimated by scaling adult consumption patterns by the energy content of the toddler diet) 11/2to 21/2 18 28 6.3 9.8 4.6 7.2 21/2to 31/2 17 25 5.8 8.6 4.2 6.3 31/2to 41/2(boys) 16 23 5.7 8.0 4.1 5.8 31/2to 41/2(girls) 15 23 5.3 8.0 3.9 5.8 Table: Estimated dietary exposures to dioxins and dioxin-like PCB from TDS samples (pg TEQ/kg bw per day)11. We have seen data which indicate that the decline in dietary exposure is real and not attributable to changes in analytical sensitivity or number of foodgroups analysed in different Total Diet Studies. This decline in dietaryexposure is primarily due to either a reduction in emissions to theenvironment or a change in food consumption patterns, or both. Environmental controls 12. Abatement measures have been taken to control the emission of dioxins to the environment and hence foods. In particular the imposition of strict emissionlimits on municipal waste incinerators have reduced emissions from thissector by an estimated 90%. The UK is introducing Regulations to give effectto EC Directive 96/59, which requires the phasing out and disposal ofremaining identifiable PCBs. The Regulations follow on from consultationlast year, and the publication of the UK action plan in 1997. 11 It is anticipated that as a result of these measures dietary exposure to dioxins and dioxin-likePCBs will continue to decline gradually. We understand that the Governmentis in the process of producing an UK position paper on dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, which will assess the effectiveness of current and future abatementmeasures. Recommendations 13. We are reassured by the evidence of a continuing decline in dietary exposure to dioxin-like compounds. We welcome the evidence that average and high-level adult and schoolchild consumers do not exceed the current UK-TDI orthe upper value of the recently recommended WHO-TDI. 14. We notethat estimated dietary exposures of toddlers do not exceed the current UK-TDI but that approximately 50% of toddlers will exceed theupper value of the newly recommended WHO-TDI. However, we notethat there are limitations in the methodology used to derive these estimatedexposures for toddlers, which means that such estimates should be viewedwith caution. We recommend that robust characterisation and estimates of toddler exposure, taking into account consumption of 'toddler-specific'foods,are carried out and we request that we see such information at the earliestopportunity. 15. We notethat the WHO-IPCS/ECEH consultation recommended that continued efforts should be made to reduce exposure towards the lower endof the newly recommended WHO-TDI range. We will undertake a review ofthe WHO-TDI when a full report of the consultation is available and we willpay particular attention to the relevance of the WHO-TDI to toddlers. 35Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment16. We recommend that dietary exposure to dioxin-like compounds should continue to be monitored at regular intervals to confirm that the overalldownward trend in exposure continues as a result of current and futureabatement measures. 17. The available data indicate that some 50% of toddlers in the UK will exceed the upper value of the WHO-TDI but not the current UK-TDI. However, wedo not consider that this exceedence necessarily poses a health risk and, inadvance of a detailed review of the WHO-TDI, we do not recommend anyintervention with respect to the diets of toddlers. This interim position isbased upon the following considerations: i) it is not yet clear to what extent the WHO-TDI is particularly relevant for toddlers; ii) evidence that some toddlers may exceed the WHO-TDI is based upon estimations of dietary exposure that need to be treated with somecaution; and iii) there is a continuing decline in the overall exposure to dioxin-like compounds. Conclusions 18. Estimated exposures to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs for adults, schoolchildren, and toddlers are all at or below the current UK-TDI.Estimated exposures for adults and schoolchildren are also below the uppervalue of the newly recommended WHO-TDI, although toddlers may exceedthis value. However, estimated exposures for all age groups havesubstantially declined since 1982 and we anticipate that exposures willcontinue to decline in the future due to the environmental controls already inplace and those planned. We conclude that the current concentrations ofdioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in food are unlikely to pose a risk to health.

We have been informed of the results of a study conducted by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in which free-range hen and duck eggs wereanalysed for the presence of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) collectively referred to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). 1 Survey design 2. Atotal of 45 free-range hen and duck egg samples, each sample consisting of six individual eggs, were collected from farms or private houses in Kent,Essex, Norfolk, and Buckinghamshire between November 1994 and April1996. We have been informed that the purpose of this exercise was toexamine the use of free-range eggs as indicators of environmentalcontamination, rather than to estimate dietary exposure to these compoundsthrough the consumption of free-range eggs. The sampling sites were selectedfor practical convenience rather than on the basis of concerns about localcontamination. We note that these free-range egg samples may not berepresentative of those on sale throughout the United Kingdom. Concentrations of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs 3. Concentrations of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in the combined yolk and white of hen eggs were in the range of 1.1-22 (mean 6.3, median 3.5) ngToxic Equivalents (TEQ)/kg fat. In the combined yolk and white of duck eggsconcentrations were in the range of 1.9-49 (mean 12, median 5.2) ng TEQ/kgfat. We note that in both cases the distribution of values appeared to beskewed. We have been informed that there were no obvious major pointsources of contamination in the immediate vicinity of these sampling sites toaccount for the higher values. We have been told that the most likely sourceof contamination of free-range eggs by these compounds is via the ingestionof soil and sediment by hens and ducks as they forage for food. However,environmental sampling at the sites of egg collection was not undertaken. 38Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentEstimated dietary exposures 4. We have been provided with estimated dietary exposures for toddlers, schoolchildren, and adults to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs based on theconcentrations of these compounds in free-range eggs in this survey. However,we consider that, because these free-range eggs may not be representative ofthose on sale throughout the UK, the data from this survey cannot be used toestimate dietary exposures to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs with anyconfidence from these sources. Nor can the data from this survey be used todraw any comparisons between free-range eggs and other hen and duck eggs,for which there are few data available. Conclusions 5. We consider that this survey of dioxins and dioxin-like PCB in free-range hen and duck eggs cannot be used to estimate the risk to health of consumers ofsuch eggs in the UK. 6. The concentrations of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in free-range hen and duck eggs might be used as an indicator of environmental contamination. Alarger, more rigorously designed study would be needed to investigate this. July 2000 COTstatement 2000/06 References 1 Food Standards Agency (2000). Dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in free-range eggs. Summary Report, located on the FSAwebsite at: http://www.foodstandards.gov.uk/maff/archive/food/infsheet/1997/no105/table2.htm 39Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentStatement on the 1997 Total Diet Study - Fluorine, Bromine, and Iodine Introduction 1. We have been informed of the results of a study conducted by the Food Standards Agency in which Total Diet Study (TDS) samples collected in 1997were analysed for the presence of three halogen elements, namely fluorine,bromine, and iodine. 1 Estimated dietary intakes 2. We have been provided with estimates of mean population, and mean and high-level (97.5th percentile) adult consumer dietary intakes of fluorine,bromine, and iodine. Mean population intakes are based on household, ratherthan individual, consumption data that are updated yearly and thus can be usedto follow trends in dietary intakes. Mean and high-level consumer intakes arebased on adult consumption data from the 1986/87 National Diet andNutrition Survey of British Adults. 2 We note that dietary intakes for age groups other than adults have not been estimated. 3. We note that the analytical techniques used to determine the concentrations of fluorine, bromine, and iodine in the TDS samples did not distinguish betweenthe different chemical forms in which these elements may exist in food. Fluorine 4. The mean population dietary intake of fluorine estimated from the 1997 TDS is 1.2 mg/person per day. Estimated dietary intakes for mean and high-level adultconsumers are 0.94 and 2.0 mg/person per day respectively. Dietary intakes forfluorine were last estimated in 1984 when the mean population intake,calculated from concentrations of fluorine determined in selected food samplesfrom the 1978, 1979, and 1980 total diet studies, was estimated as 1.8mg/person per day. 3 However, due to changes in the TDS design since 1981 and the limited number of samples that were used to estimate this intake in1984, a direct comparison between the 1997 TDS mean population intakeestimate and this earlier estimate cannot be made. There are no guidelines forfluorine against which to assess these estimated dietary intakes. However, wehave been informed that the Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM)will be considering fluorine in due course and we will await the findings of thatbody before considering any potential effects associated with these intakes. 40Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentBromine 5. We have not previously considered dietary intakes of bromine. The mean population dietary intake of bromine estimated from the 1997 TDS is 3.6mg/person per day. Estimated dietary intakes for mean and high-level adultconsumers are 3.8 and 6.2 mg/person per day. We have had the opportunity toreview an evaluation of bromine by the Joint Food and AgricultureOrganization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Meeting onPesticide Residues (JMPR), which established an Acceptable Daily Intake(ADI) range of 0-1 mg/kg body weight. 4 It is not certain whether bromine is essential5so we consider it inappropriate to recommend a range for intakes of bromine that includes zero. However, we consider that the upper value of thisrange represents a bromine intake below which intakes are unlikely to pose arisk to health. In this respect the upper value of 1 mg bromine/kg body weightper day, equivalent to 60 mg/day for a 60 kg individual, can be considered tobe a Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI). Estimated mean and high-level adultconsumer dietary intakes of bromine are within this guideline and aretherefore not a cause for concern. Iodine 6. We have considered dietary intakes of iodine on a number of previous occasions, most recently earlier this year when we considered a survey ofiodine in cows'milk. 6We concluded that the concentrations of iodine in cows'milk were unlikely to pose a risk to health,7despite calculations that suggested that dietary intakes of iodine by some toddlers may exceed theProvisional Maximum Tolerable Daily Intake (PMTDI) for iodine of 0.017milligrams per kilogram body weight (17 (g/kg body weight) asrecommended by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives(JECFA). 8Dietary intakes for mean and high-level adult consumers estimated from the 1997 TDS of 240 and 420 (g/person per day are within the JECFAPMTDI, which is equivalent to 1000 (g/day for a 60 kg individual, and aretherefore not a cause for concern. While dietary intakes for children aged 1 1/2 to 41/2have not been calculated from the 1997 TDS, we have been informed that intakes for this age group are likely to be comparable to the intakes weconsidered in relation to the survey of iodine in cows'milk. There is no newinformation that would lead us to alter our previous advice 7that estimated dietary intakes of iodine by toddlers are unlikely to pose a risk to health.However, we have been informed that the EVM are in the process ofconsidering iodine and thus we may wish to reconsider these results in thelight of the findings of that body. 41Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentConclusion 7. We conclude that the estimated total dietary intakes of bromine and iodine based on data from the 1997 Total Diet Study are unlikely to pose a risk tohealth. However, further information on the different chemical forms of theseelements in the diet would assist in risk assessment. We will await thefindings of a review of fluorine by the Expert Group on Vitamin and Mineralsbefore considering any potential effects associated with the intakes of thiselement.

The fully chlorinated hydrocarbon hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD, C4Cl6) is formed as a by-product during the manufacture of chlorinated solvents. 2. Environmental contamination with HCBD has recently been detected around a disused waste dump in a quarry at Weston in Runcorn, Cheshire. This wasused by ICI for about 50 years until the early 1970s. The release of HCBDinto the underlying strata and groundwater came to light as a result of aproject carried out by ICI to investigate the environmental impact of itsprevious industrial and waste disposal activities. HCBD has been detected inthe indoor air of properties close to the site. 3. We have been informed that there are 128 houses built close to the former dump which have been investigated and HCBD has been detected recently in theindoor air of 21 of these, at concentrations of under 10 parts per billion (ppb) inall houses apart from one, where a concentration of 1000 ppb was detected. Thecurrent limit of detection is 2 ppb in air. People living in most of the houseswhere HCBD has been detected have been moved to other accommodation.North Cheshire Health Authority has offered health checks to those residentswho were, at the time, living in houses where HCBD was detected. 4. In view of public health concerns, the Committee has been asked by the Department of Health to provide advice on the toxicity of HCBD. This isgiven below. Toxicology of HCBD 5. There is very little information on the toxicological effects of HCBD derived from studies on humans. Consequently, an assessment of the possible risks tohuman health has to be based on laboratory and animal data. However, mostanimal toxicity studies on HCBD have been conducted using oral exposureand there are few studies of exposure by inhalation, the prime route ofexposure for residents at Weston. 6. The results of studies of repeated oral administration indicate that HCBD can cause damage to the kidneys at doses of 0.5 milligrams/kilogram body weightper day (mg/kg bw per day) and above in female mice 1and at doses of 2 mg/kg bw per day and above in both sexes of rats.2Damage to other tissues (liver, nervous system) has been reported at a higher dose of 20 mg/kg bw per 44Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentday in rats.2In reproduction studies at this dose foetal toxicity, predominantly manifested as retardation of foetal growth, was also recorded in rats.3 However, these effects were attributed to maternal toxicity because adversedevelopmental effects were not induced at doses that were not toxic to thedam. Limited information from the animal studies indicates that exposure byinhalation results in the same toxic effects, with the kidney being the primetarget organ. 7. Thresholds for each of these adverse effects have been demonstrated in several studies. The Committee considered that the response in the kidneys of mice isthe most sensitive indicator of the toxicity of HCBD but that the response ofone female mouse dosed with 0.2 mg/kg bw per day for 13 weeks 1was not sufficient evidence to warrant the use of a lower figure for a No ObservedAdverse Effect Level (NOAEL). Therefore, the Committee considered that, fornon-carcinogenic effects, the NOAELis 0.2 mg/kg bw per day. 4,5 8. Members of our sister committee, the Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COM) have reviewed themutagenicity of HCBD. There are in vitrodata, mainly from studies using Salmonella TA100, that indicate that HCBD has mutagenic potential. 6,7 Negative results have been reported from in vivoassays in bone marrow 8,9but these were inadequate to draw definite conclusions. COM members consideredthat further in vivostudies were needed, particularly in the kidney, before any definite conclusions could be drawn. On the data currently available it would beprudent to assume that HCBD is an in vivosomatic cell mutagen. 9. Acarcinogenic response has been seen in the kidneys of rats in a study in which HCBD was administered continually in the diet for two years at a doseof 20 mg/kg bw per day (the highest dose tested). No tumours were observedin the kidneys of male or female rats administered doses of 2 mg/kg bw perday or lower. 2 10. In view of the advice from the COM that HCBD should be regarded as an in vivomutagen the COTwere unable to establish a safe level in relation to cancer or to identify a tolerable daily intake (TDI) for HCBD. Conclusions 11. From animal studies, the Committee agreed that a NOAELof 0.2 mg/kg bw per day had been established for the non-carcinogenic effects of HCBD. 12. The Committee considered that, in order to estimate the concentration in air that would result in humans inhaling a dose of 0.2 mg/kg bw per day, it wasnecessary to make the following assumptions: 45Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentthe toxicity of HCBD following inhalation exposure is essentially the same, both qualitatively and quantitatively, as the toxicity of HCBDfollowing oral exposure; there are no significant differences in the extent of absorption of HCBDby either route; and a 60 kg adult would inhale 20 cubic metres (m3) of air per day. On this basis the Committee considered that, as an approximation, a dose of 0.2 mg/kg bw per day would correspond to the continuous inhalation of aircontaining 0.6 mg/m 3of HCBD, equivalent to an air concentration of about 60 ppb. 13. In view of the evidence that there are qualitative similarities between humans and animals in the way that HCBD is distributed and metabolised in the body,the Committee considered that continuous exposure to a concentration ofHCBD in air of less than 0.6 ppb (ie the Margin of Exposure below 60 ppb isat least 100) can be regarded as being without appreciable adverse healtheffects in respect of non-carcinogenic and reproductive effects. 14. In respect of concerns about a potential carcinogenic effect, the Committee noted that exposures to less than 0.6 ppb HCBD were 10,000 times lower thanthe equivalent dose of HCBD which, when fed daily throughout a lifetime torats, had resulted in kidney tumours. The Committee considered therefore thatthe carcinogenic risk at these low exposure levels was minimal and was not ofappreciable health concern. However, given the uncertainties in the data, theCommittee considered that exposure should be reduced to as low a level asreasonably practicable (ALARP). 15. The Committee was informed that health studies are being undertaken of exposed residents of Weston 10and members of the ICI workforce.11There is also a proposal to develop a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model forHCBD exposure. 11In addition, the Committee was informed that a technique is being developed to allow analysis for HCBD at parts per trillionconcentrations in air. The Committee welcomed this information andconsidered that the results of these studies should inform a further review bythe Committee, in due course, of its conclusions on the health significance oflow-level exposures to HCBD.

The views of the Committee were sought on the health implications of the results of a survey1of terephthalic acid (TA) and isophthalic acid (IA) migration from can coatings into food. In particular the Committee was askedto give its views on the possibility that these compounds might haveendocrine disruptor activity. Background 2. TAand IA(see Figure) are starting materials in the manufacture of polyester resins, which are used in coatings on the internal surface of some metal cansdesigned to come into contact with food. Figure 1 Terephthalic acid (TA) Isophthalic acid (IA) 3. As part of the Food Standards Agency's continuing programme of surveillance on the migration of chemicals from food contact materials a two-part survey for TAand IAwas carried out. In the first phase of the surveyvarious canned foods were purchased and the cans were tested for thepresence of coatings made from polyester resins. In the second phase, furthersamples of the products in those cans which had polyester coatings wereanalysed to determine whether migration of TAand IAinto the can contentshad occurred. 1 48Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentTerephthalic acid (TA) Isophthalic acid (IA) COOH COOH COOHCOOHSurvey results 4. Twenty-eight products were identified as being in cans coated with polyester resin on all, or part, of their internal surfaces. In samples of the contents ofthese cans, TAwas found in 3 of 28 samples at or just above the limit ofquantification *and in 7 samples at levels between the limit of detectionand limit of quantification. IAwas detected in 4 of 28 samples at levels betweenthe limit of detection and limit of quantification. 5. Estimates were made of the potential intakes of TAand IAfrom canned foods studied in the second phase of the survey. Intakes were estimated for differentage groups according to the types of foods in which these substances werefound. The estimates used the analytical results for samples in which TAand/or IAwere found. Intakes were calculated by summing the intakes of97.5th percentile consumers for each food in which the given substance was detected, giving greatest weight in this summation to the two highestestimates of intake. The intake estimate was divided by bodyweight to derivecontaminant exposure in milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight (mg/kg bw)per day, bodyweights used were: 8.8 kg for infants, 14.5 kg for toddlers (1 1/2- 41/2years old) and 60 kg for adults. 6. The potential intake of TAby infants between 6 and 12 months old who were 97.5th percentile consumers was estimated as 0.0074 mg/kg bw per day. Fortoddlers who were 97.5th potential intake of TAwasestimated as 0.083 mg/kg bw per day. For adults who were 97.5th percentileconsumers the potential intake of TAwas estimated as 0.0025 perday. 7. The intake consumers was estimated as 0.0013 mg/kg bw per day. There are no estimates of intake by infants as noIAwas detected in baby foods. 49Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment* Limit of quantification: the lowest level at which the amount of a substance can be stated with confidence. Limit of detection: the lowest level at which a substance can be detected with confidence. 97.5th percentile consumers are those whose consumption of a specific food or group of foodstuffs corresponds to the 97.5th percentile point on a distribution curve for consumption of the given food orfoods.Toxicology of TA and IA 8. The European Commission's Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) reviewed studies of the toxicity and migration of both TAand IA. 9. In view of the availability of data from long-term studies the SCF was able, pending submission of full reports, to set a temporary Tolerable Daily Intake(TDI) for TAof 0.125 mg/kg bw, which was based on 3-month and 2-yeardietary studies in rats. 2The major finding in the long-term study with TAwas the occurrence of malignant and benign tumours of the urinary tract at highdoses. 3,4These were documented as being associated with the formation of stones in the urinary bladder which represents a potential non-genotoxicmechanism for the formation of such tumours. 10. On the basis of the available data from migration and toxicity studies submitted by industry the SCF has also set a restriction (for migration fromplastics) of 5 mg/kg food for IA. 2This limit was based on negative genotoxicity data and a 90-day dietary study in rats, from which a NoObserved Effect Level of 250 mg/kg bw per day was established. 11. The manufacturers of TAand IAsubmitted a commentary on the available reproductive and developmental toxicity data for both compounds. In this itwas proposed that the weight of the evidence from these studies does notsupport a role for these acids in modulating the endocrine system. 5 12. The Committee noted that the toxicity studies on TAand IAwere not carried out to modern standards. It was recognised that the limited nature of thepublished work would not allow them to address fully the questions that theyhad been asked. 13. It was requested that, in the light of the urinary tumours occurring in rats fed the highest dietary concentration of TA, the view of the Committee onMutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environmentbe sought on the potential in vivogenotoxicity of this compound. 14. It was noted that the estimated intakes of TAby infants, toddlers and adults who were 97.5th percentile consumers were below the temporary TDIestablished by the SCF. In addition, it was noted that the concentrations of IAfound in samples of canned food in the survey were below the migration limitset by that committee. 50Annual report 2000 Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the EnvironmentConclusions i) The Committee concluded that the concentrations of TAand IAthat had been determined in foods analysed in the survey were not of concern for publichealth on the basis of available information. ii) The Committee notedthe commentary of the manufacturers on possible endocrine disruptor activity of TAor IA. However, it was considered that thetoxicity studies were inadequate to exclude this possibility. It was thereforerecommended that appropriate studies should be carried out to determine whether TAor IApossess endocrine disruptor activity. September 2000 COTStatement 2000/08 References 1.
