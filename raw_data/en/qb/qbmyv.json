Very few drugs and even fewer types of surgery can effectively treat many of the conditions that people encounter related to their spine, their posture, or their nervous system. [Nault Chiropractic](http://www.docnault.com/about/worcester-ma-chiropractor-doctor-nault/) in Worcester offers holistic treatments to help you feel your best without taking medication. [Contact Nault Chiropractic](http://www.docnault.com/contact/) today to see how we can help you feel better naturally. [Holistic chiropractic](http://www.docnault.com/holistic-treatments/) care represents one of the best alternatives for people facing chronic pain, musculoskeletal problems, or nervous system-related issues. The effectiveness of holistic chiropractic care has been proven in the inspiring results that have been achieved. For example, sufferers of [chronic back pain](http://www.docnault.com/worcester-ma-sports-massage-therapist/back-pain/) have been free of pain after working with their chiropractor. Treating a patient's posture, and correcting misaligned bones has allowed the patient's body to naturally heal without the need for medicine or surgery. To better understand how holistic chiropractors can benefit you, let's examine what makes holistic chiropractors different from the other types of medicine you may already be familiar with. Why Can Chiropractors Produce Better Results? While there are many things that set chiropractors apart from other practitioners of modern medicine, the major differences can be condensed to just three things: - Unlike most types of modern medicine, the body as a whole is treated instead of the part that is problematic. - Treatment from a chiropractor can be used with traditional therapies to produce an effect that neither could by themselves. - Continued chiropractic care can reduce the incidence of future problems as a result of a healthier body. The reason these differences matter is because they're what make chiropractors unique. It enables them to produce results that traditional therapies would fall short of producing. How Does a Holistic Chiropractor Benefit You? The benefits from a [holistic chiropractor](http://www.docnault.com/holistic-treatments/chiropractic-techniques/) reside in what a chiropractor does differently from other doctors. They try to view your body as a whole with your symptoms as a side effect of some misalignment with your skeletal structure. For example, consider a patient with chronic back pain. Their chiropractor may determine that their pain is a symptom of several misaligned joints. They may adjust the back as part of the patient's treatment plan like you would expect, but what you may not expect is that they may make adjustments to the elbow, hand or knee joints. This happens because chiropractors work to fix the overall alignment of the skeleton rather than just trying to fix one or two troubled spots. This results in a greater degree of freedom for the patient, and the patient may end up feeling significantly better as a whole. Your chiropractor can benefit you in many other ways that are unique from the results traditional medicine can provide. You may lose weight as a result of your treatment plan, feel more limber and balanced, or you may simply be free of the aches and pains that have plagued you for as far back as you can remember. In the case of nervous system afflictions, your chiropractor's realignment techniques may make it possible to relieve pressure from certain nerves. This can restore function and feeling to parts of your body, which allows your body to feel more like it did before damage occurred. If you're ready to try an alternative that treats more than just one or two symptoms, then [make an appointment to see Dr. Nault](http://www.docnault.com/contact/) today. Your body will thank you for it. "}
