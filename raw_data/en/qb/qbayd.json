Hypothyroidism is an increasingly common thyroid disorder, especially among women. A sedentary city life with packed schedules and barely any time for exercise can slow your thyroid function down to dangerously low levels. If coupled with an unhealthy diet, your thyroid problems can lead to other health complications including heart disease. Hypothyroidism is marked by a significant and gradual weight gain. In this type of thyroid disorder, the thyroid secretes less quantities of its hormone leading to sluggish functioningof metabolism and digestion. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include slow heart rate, constant fatigue, muscle cramps, swollen neck, irregular periods, brittle hair and sometimes, depression. The biggest challenge faced by those who suffer hypothyroidism is reducing excess weight.Yet, losing weight is one of the main solutions to cure a thyroid problem. This can prove to be a dilemma. Let's look at some great tips that can get you going on your goal of weight loss with hypothyroidism. - Adopt a gluten-free diet Gluten is a type of protein, found in several types of grains, which gives bread and most bakery products their elasticity. It is however, heavy on digestion and can suppress thyroid function. A gluten-free diet would include rice flour, potato, arrowroot, buckwheat, soy, and corn. These days you even get gluten-free dairy and sweets. Stay away from wheat and wheat products, barley, and rye much as you can. - Push your body If you suffer from hypothyroidism, you will understand how sluggish it can make your whole body. Exercise can be a chore and you would rather spend those few free minutes taking an extra nap. This is where you need to push your body. Exercise is a crucial aspect of successful thyroid treatment. Even if you crave an afternoon nap, try to suppress the urge, and go for a walk instead. If your body tires out after a half hour workout, take a 5-minute rest, and then put in an additional 15 minutes. Unless you get out of your comfort zone, your metabolism will stay slow. - Say no to simple carbs Simple carbs and sugar cause a sudden spike in the body's insulin levels. This leads to insulin resistance that can wreak havoc with the body metabolism and cause thyroid problems. Simple carbs are found in sugar, all baked goods, biscuits, packaged fruit juice and breakfast cereal. Conversely, complex carbs are high in fibre and good for you. They release energy slowly into your bloodstream and balance metabolic function. Complex carbs can be found in whole grains, brown rice, nuts, broccoli, apples, beans, leafy greens, bananas, and carrots. - Eat small meals Hypothyroidism is marked by a slow metabolic rate and slow digestive process. This is what leads to weight gain. Break down your 3 big daily meals - breakfast, lunch, and dinner - into 6 to 8 smaller sized meals. Small meals put less pressure on your digestive system and help in breaking down fats more efficiently. When you eat, chew your food well and avoid rushing through your meal. - Include antioxidant foods Antioxidant foods help slow down the gradual damage caused by free radicals (waste matter) in the body. Free radicals can lead to major health complications including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Some great antioxidant foods you can include as part of your daily diet are sweet potatoes, peaches, apricots, carrots, tomatoes, citrus fruits, strawberries, garlic, nuts, eggs, chicken, and seafood. - Drink plenty of water This might sound like an oft repeated solution for almost any medical condition. However, there is good reason behind it. Dehydration slows down your metabolism and weakens thyroid function. Start your day with two glasses of warm water and end it will a glass of water before bedtime. Drinking a glass of water before you begin your meal is a sure way to help you eat less and cut back on carbs. - Get sufficient rest Always take time out for yourself. Cut back on extra time in front of the television in favour of a quick nap, a walk in the park or a relaxing cup of tea. Sleep a little extra on weekends. Your body won't heal itself unless it gets sufficient rest. Don't stress out by worrying about your thyroid problems. Stress often makes things worse and chronic stress can throw your hormones further off balance.

This makes them suitable for all age groups; especially young children and the elderly.
