NHM)456 15.3 Summary of Important Audit Observations 468i ANNUAL REPORT 2020-20212020 has been a most unprecedented year. No one, anywhere in the world could have predicted the kind of havoc COVID-19 created, not just in overwhelming the health systems but also challenging economic growth, industrial progress and overall life and morale of the population. Under the dynamic and farsighted leadership of the Hon'ble Prime Minister, Sh. Narendra Modi ji, India could tackle the pandemic through a wide range of public health and social measures along with timely identification, testing, isolation, quarantine and treatment facilities provided across the primary, secondary and tertiary level facilities. Hon'ble Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare steered the vision of Hon'ble PM, as a strong multi-sectoral effort with a 'whole-of-Government' and 'whole-of-society' approach to provide advisories, guidelines and services to the entire country even as the pandemic kept evolving. Today we have least number of Covid-19 cases, highest recovery rate, least number of deaths due to Covid-19 and now moving towards a Greater Win by developing Vaccines against the dreaded disease. Hon'ble PM of India launched the world's largest Covid Vaccination Drive on 16.01.2021. Government of India is committed to ensure the highest possible level of health and well-being of all, at all ages, through a preventive and promotive healthcare orientation in all developmental policies and universal access to good quality healthcareservices, without anyone having to face financial hardship. Towards this end, MoHFW is implementing various schemes, programmes and national initiatives to provide universal access to the quality healthcare. During the pandemic strategies and guidelines for enabling continued delivery of essential RMNCH+A services were developed and disseminated to all States/UTs. Select health facilities established as Quarantine Centres, Covid Care Centres and COVID Hospitals in the States which were duly supported by the Centre. Now, the health ministry is working closely with partners to ensure vaccines are accessed by the population in a systematic and phased manner, in line with global protocols. The approach is to increase access to the decentralized public health system by establishing new infrastructure in deficient areas and upgrading the infrastructure in the existing institutions. There is also need to strengthen the role of public sector in social protection against the rising costs of healthcare and the need to provide a comprehensive package of services without reducing the prioritization given to women and children's health. There has been a significant improvement in creation of new facilities and infrastructure, though adequate human resource at these facilities by qualified health personnel, still remains a challenge. Availability of drugs has improved at all levels and the robust logistic arrangement for procurement and storage of these drugs has been put in place. MoHFW efforts this year, enabled progress towards the commitments of the National Health Policy (NHP), 2017. The launch of Ayushman Bharat marked a significant landmark in the history of health in India. Ayushman Bharat is an important landmark in India's road to Universal Health Care, and when fully operational will ensure Introductionii ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021INTRODUCTION universal, accessible, equitable and affordable health care for all. It comprises of two inter- related components. The first component is the creation of 1,50,000 Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) by transforming PHCs/SCs to provide Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC). HWCs will enable a focus on wellness and health promotion, and provide an expanded range of primary healthcare services, including access to medicines and diagnostics, and be delivered close to the community. So far, approvals for more than 1,04,860 AB-HWCs have been accorded to the States/UTs (except Delhi) and 50,927 HWCs operationalized. Nearly 7.31 crore screenings for Hypertension, 5.93 crore for Diabetes, more than 6.96 crore for common cancers (over 3.67 crore for oral cancer, 1.34 Crore for cervical cancer and more than 1.95 crore screenings for breast cancer in women) have been done in these HWCs and as on 04.12.2020 approx. 44.35 lakh Y oga/Wellness Sessions have been conducted in operational HWCs. Under the second component of Ayushman Arogya Y ojana (AB-PMJAY), nearly 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families (almost 50 crore citizens of India) identified as per SECC database, are entitled for health cover of Rs. 5 lakh per family/year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization services. This is world's largest Public Healthcare Insurance Scheme. 32 States/UTs are implementing the scheme and over 1.5 Crore hospitalizations amounting to approx. Rs.18,600 Crores were authorized under the scheme by 31.12.2020. Additionally, over 1.6 lakh hospitalizations amounting to Rs. 345 Crores have been authorized under the Inter- State portability feature. So far, 13 crore e-cards (including cards issues by State Governments) have been issued under the Scheme to facilitate availing the benefits, easily. As part of Ayushman Bharat, the existing U-PHCs are being strengthened as HWCs and so far, 3339 HWCs have been made operational in urban areas, as on March, 2020.Ayushman Bharat School Health & Wellness Ambassador Initiative, a joint initiative of the MoHFW and Ministry of Education has been launched at the National level, focussing on promoting health and wellbeing in school going children to foster their growth, development and educational achievement. 2 teachers in every school will be trained as \"Health and Wellness Ambassadors (HW As)\" to create more than 2 lakh HW As across 1 lakh schools this year in the 191 targeted districts. The National Health Mission (NHM), which is our flagship health systems reform programme, provides a robust platform for implementation of a range of interventions focused on primary and secondary health care in rural and urban areas. NHM's efforts in strengthening health systems in States by allocating additional financial resources, flexibility in design and implementation, ensured sharper focus on particularly marginalized and vulnerable populations and enabled us to achieve impressive improvements in several key indicators of RMNCH+A and communicable diseases. Under the RMNCH+A strategy of NHM, significant improvements have been achieved with regard to reduction of MMR and child mortality rates. The MMR at national level has reduced to 113/ lakh live births during 2016-18, which was 122 per lakh live births during 2015-18 (SRS). Similarly, U-5MR has declined to 36 per 1000 live births and NMR to 23 per 1000 live births as per SRS 2018. The TFR is 2.2 (SRS 2018). NUHM seeks to improve the health status of urban population particularly urban poor and other vulnerable sections by facilitating their access to quality primary healthcare. U-PHCs and U-CHCs established as per norms and more than 4800 facilities in urban areas have been strengthened and construction of about 863 new U-PHCs and U-CHCs approved. The HR approved under the programme include 3,400 medical officers, 400 specialists, 16,000 ANMs, 9,100 nurses, 3500 pharmacists, 3900 lab technicians and 680 public health managers. About 74,000 ASHAs and 92,000 iii ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021INTRODUCTION MAS have been approved for effective community participation activities. 439 urban health facilities won the Kayakalp awards. Under Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme (PMNDP) Hemo-dialysis has been implemented in 505 districts of 35 States/UTs at 910 Dialysis Centres by deploying 5781 machines. Nearly 9.10 lakh patients availed dialysis services as on 30th November 2020. In PIP 2020-21, NHM approved peritoneal dialysis (PD) program support for 20 States/UTs for approx. 4000 patients under PMNDP . The implementation of BMMP in 31 States/UTs has helped in improving diagnostics services in health facilities by making equipment available with 95% uptime, thereby reducing cost of care and improving the quality of patient care in public health facilities. Presently, 10,599 of Dial-108, 605 of Dial-104 and 9,875 of Dial-102 Emergency Response Service Vehicles are supported under NHM, besides 5,412 empanelled vehicles for transportation of patients, particularly pregnant women and sick infants from home to public health facilities and back. To address the burden of mental disorders, the GoI is supporting implementation of the NMHP in 692 districts of the country for detection, management and treatment of mental disorders/ illness. Realizing the impact that COVID-19 may have on the mental health of the people, the Government has set up a 24x7 helpline to provide psycho-social support by mental health professionals, to the entire affected population, divided into different target groups viz children, adult, elderly, women and healthcare workers. In order to augment the existing mental healthcare manpower in the country, a Digital Academy as a virtual university has been established and medical officers, psychologists, social workers, nurses and other healthcare workers are trained to deliver mental health services and nearly 5,253 professionals have been enrolled.National Programme for Control of Blindness launched in the year 1976 was later renamed as National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment (NPCB&VI) in 2017 with a target to reduce the prevalence of blindness to 0.25% by 2025. The National Blindness Survey (2015-19) has shown reduction in the prevalence of blindness from 1% (2007) to 0.36% (2019). In order to minimize and avoid the spread of COVID 19, guidelines for safe ophthalmology practices were issued by the Ministry. The MoHFW , under COTPA, 2003 has notified the new specified health warnings to be displayed on all tobacco product packs, which came into effect on 1 st December, 2020. The graphic health warnings are a potent tool to create awareness about the serious and adverse health consequences of tobacco usage especially among the youth, children and illiterate persons. Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) include a spectrum of problems caused by the persistent misuse of mind alerting substances, and can range from a harmful use to dependence. The \"Standard Treatment Guidelines for the Management of Substance Use Disorders and Behavioural Addictions\" , as a resource material for the general physicians in primary care setting to provide them necessary know-how for assessment and management of these disorders, was released by Hon'ble HFM on 29 th July, 2020. Tuberculosis control is also gaining momentum in rural areas with availability of rapid molecular diagnostics at the block level for accurate and decentralized detection of TB. This has led to a 52% increase in the detection of drug-resistant TB. Active Case Finding campaigns of house-to-house search for TB cases among mapped vulnerable populations has helped bridge the gap of the \"missing million\" , reducing it to less than 3 lakhs now. The past year was a landmark in the progress towards ending TB by 2025 in India. The country has inched closer to achieving near-complete on-line notification of TB patients with over 24.04 lakh patients reported on the iv ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021INTRODUCTION NIKSHAY software system. For the second time in the history of independent India, a National TB Prevalence Survey is being undertaken to identify the actual burden of the disease, after almost 60 years. The programme rolled out two new drugs, discovered after 40 years- Bedaquiline for Drug Resistant TB patients, and Delamanid, for paediatric MDR TB patients to shorten the treatment duration. TB services and reach are being expanded through the AB-HWCs to identify new cases and ensuring treatment, adherence, and other public health actions for patients. For patient centric and community led response, TB Forums have been established at National, State and District levels and TB Champions instituted from a network of over 4 lakh treatment supporters and cured TB patients. In a significant first, the Government has disbursed more than Rs. 903 crore to over 38.3 lakh patients as monthly nutrition support through Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) under Nikshay Poshan Y ojna (NPY). A fresh strategy for Active Case Detection and Regular Surveillance has been introduced under National Leprosy Eradication Programme in July, 2020 to ensure early and regular detection of leprosy cases, and to prevent physical disabilities. Leprosy screening has also been integrated with RBSK and RKSK for screening of children (0-18 years) and with CPHC under AB-HWC level. Percentage of Grade II Disability (G2D)/visible deformity in new cases of leprosy is decreased from 2.41% in 2019-20 to 2.21% as on 30.09.2020. The G2D amongst new cases/million population is decreased from 1.96 as on 31.03.2020 to 0.81/ million population as on 30.09.2020. The country has recorded a reduction of 83% in malaria cases and 92 % in malaria deaths between 2000 and 2020. As per the World Malaria Report 2020, India has contributed to the largest drop in cases, and is the only country in the High Burden to High Impact (HBHI) Group to have shown a decline both in terms of Malaria cases and deaths consistently in the past three years. As compared to 2019, 39% and 31% reduction in Kala-azar and PKDL cases has been reported till October 2020. Nearly 98% KA endemic blocks have achieved the elimination target. Till November 2020, there has been a 76.7% reduction in number of Dengue cases, 88.6% decline in number of deaths due to Dengue and a 50.7% reduction in number of Chikungunya cases in the country as compared to last year. Regional offices of Health & Family Welfare (ROHFWs), established in the 19 State Capitals of the Country with the primary objective of ensuring proper liaison and coordination between the Centre and State Governments in the context of the implementation, evaluation, review and assessment of the data of the various NHPs. ROHFWs have played a vital role in combating COVID-19 by collecting and submitting daily reports with respect to various parameters and analysis of the trends indicated by the daily reports helped in objective assessment of the current situation and also to plan the future management for tackling the issues arising on account of COVID-19. RDs have also been involved extensively in visiting various health facilities for establishing Quarantine Centres, Covid Care Centres and COVID Hospitals in the States under their jurisdiction and are actively involved in surveillance at airports & developing protocols as per National Guidelines for screening activities at point of entries. The Department has been making continuous efforts towards ensuring the safety, quality and efficacy of drugs, including medical devices in the country for ensuring healthcare of its citizens. Legislative framework has been continuously improved upon in the form of various new rules/amendments under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1945 and Medical Devices Rules, 2017. Continuous monitoring and timely action by the central drug regulatory authority i.e. CDSCO, IPC and NIB have ensured that the drugs and devices manufactured in the country and used by citizens are safe and effective. v ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021INTRODUCTION FSSAI continued to undertake the regular functions as envisaged in the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 such as formulation of standards, enforcement, regulation of food import, notification of labs etc., training and capacity building of regulatory personnel and FBOs, International Cooperation in areas of food safety, Codex related work etc. It leveraged technology to bring transparency and efficiency in its functioning and provide support to stakeholders and continued its journey to ensure safe and healthy food to citizens through innovative programmes such as 'Eat Right India' movement. It is based on three key themes - Eat Safe, Eat Healthy, and Eat Sustainable. It is a people's movement that adopts a judicious mix of regulatory, capacity building, collaborative and empowerment approaches towards various interventions for food businesses and consumers. To scale up various initiatives in States, Eat Right Challenge for cities and districts has been launched and the Eat Smart Cities Challenge for 100 Smart Cities is also in the process. During Covid-19 pandemic, FSSAI has taken a series of steps to facilitate uninterrupted supply of safe food and certain regulatory compliances for Food Businesses have been relaxed/deferred as necessitated by the circumstances emerged during the pandemic period. A detailed guidance note 'Food Hygiene and Safety Guidelines for Food Businesses during Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic' has been released. FSSAI also released an e-handbook on \"Eat Right during COVID-19\" for citizens, which highlights safe food practices to be followed diligently and tips on health and nutrition. FSSAI is also disseminating information for public awareness through books such as 'Do Y ou Eat Right' and social media on fortified foods, dietary diversity and healthy recipes to combat micronutrient deficiencies and reduction of salt, sugar and fat to reduce NCDs. The 7th National Summit on Good, Replicable Practices was inaugurated through a video conference on 28 th December, 2020 and New HMIS 2.0 was launched along with the Operational Guidelines for TB services at AB-HWCs and on Active Case Detection and Regular Surveillance for Leprosy. During the year for the first time the data from HMIS portal has been transferred to Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India through web service (i.e through APIs). The SDG Health Dashboard was launched on 12.12.2020 on the occasion of Universal Health Coverage Day. Department of Health and Family Welfare won the Platinum Award under Open Data Champion Category of Digital India Award 2020. The most important aspect in providing Universal Healthcare, after Infrastructure Development is Skilled Human Resources for Health. MoHFW has taken many steps and has initiated reforms in this direction. The constitution of the National Medical Commission on 25 th September, 2020 has ushered in, a landmark reform in the sector of Medical Education. On similar lines, the Government is striving to bring institutional reforms in the sector of nursing and dental education by passage of reformative legislations to replace the existing Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947, and Dentists Act, 1948. In absence of any Central Regulatory Body for Allied and Healthcare Professionals, this ministry has taken an initiative and accordingly, the National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Professions (NCAHP) Bill, 2020 was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 15.09.2020 for maintaining standards of education and practice through the constitution of National Commission and corresponding State Councils for more than 50 allied and healthcare professions. The basic premise and principled change that is happening in all these professional education sectors is that the Regulator is now being 'selected on merits' , as opposed to Swasthya Suraksha Y ojana (PMSSY) aims at correcting the regional imbalances in the availability of affordable tertiary healthcare facilities in different parts of the country in general, and augmenting facilities vi ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021INTRODUCTION for quality medical education in the underserved States in particular. PMSSY , a Central Sector Scheme, is being implemented in a phased manner and has two components, namely Setting up of AIIMS Institutions and Up-gradation of existing Government Medical Colleges/Institutions (GMC/Is). So far, construction of 22 new AIIMS and 75 GMCs up-gradation Projects have been approved. are already fully functional and all key hospital facilities and services are functioning. Dedicated hospitals, blocks for treatment of CoVID-19 patients and COVID test labs were made functional in these AIIMS during this year. Setting up of remaining 16 AIIMS is in progress. In these newer AIIMS, limited OPD facilities have started Bhathinda, Mangalagiri and Gorakhpur. 1 st session of undergraduate MBBS course with 50 seats is staring from the current session (2020-21) at 4 new AIIMS viz. Guwahati, Jammu, Rajkot and Bilaspur in addition to 8 new AIIMS in previous years.

Expected Outcomes from the AB-HWCs Increased trust levels of people on service provision by public health care facilities through health systems strengthening and improvement Availability of assured health care services to ensure continuum of care Reduction in out-of-pocket expenditure of the common people Better awareness on preventive and promotive health care benefits of healthy lifestyle including Y oga and campaigns like Eat Right & Eat Safe etc. Enabling environment to increase health seeking behaviour of poor people 2. Launching Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Y ojana (AB-PMJAY): The scheme provides health insurance coverage up to Rs. 5.00 lakh per family per year to around 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families (nearly 50 crore individuals) who have been identified based on the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) data.13 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Key Highlights and Achievements Guidelines for four expanded packages of services developed in consultation with States/UTs incorporating their experiences while remaining three guidelines are currently under finalisation. Release of CPHC Guidelines Launch of Compendium of HWC operationalization on 12.12.2020 The App version of the AB-HWC portal was launched by the Hon'ble Union Minister for HFW on 12.07.2020 to enable geo-tagging the location of these AB-HWCs and entering the daily service delivery parameters by the frontline health care workers A 'Fit Health Workers Campaign' launched at these centres to enable the screening and early detection of NCDs in the frontline health care workers. This enabled the screening of more than 12.7 lakh healthcare workers in 502 districts till 01.12.2020 to enable them take preventive, promotive and curative measures and also caution them towards their risk categorisation for COVID-19. The frontline workers (FLWs) have been not only involved in ensuring essential services at these centres but they also play a crucial role in community-based surveillance and pandemic outbreak management related activities in the community. These centres conduct various wellness related activities like Y oga, Zumba and Meditation which not only enable improved physical health but also mental wellbeing of the community. It is envisaged that these centres will not only be the point of delivery for health care services, but at the same time enable the community to take health in their own hands. This is in addition to the 39 Health Calendar Days which are being observed within different health promotion activities In coordination with the School Education Department, a special School Health and Wellness Ambassadors Initiative has been launched to train two teachers per school as Ambassadors on preventive and promotive health care. This will soon be implemented in more than 200 districts in the coming year. Similarly, all States/UTs have started a training of 'Eat Right' and 'Eat Safe' module to the [primary healthcare team at these functional AB-HWCs] Regional reviews of all the States and UTs are being organised virtually at the national level to understand implementation challenges in expanding the roll-out during the COVID-19 pandemic. The best practices adopted by the States/ UTs to ensure the 14 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 continuity of health care services are also showcased and disseminated to other States / UTs for cross-learning Service Delivery at AB-HWCs So far, approvals for more than 1,04,860 Ayushman Bharat-Health & Wellness Centres have been accorded to the States/UTs (except Delhi) and as reported by the States/UTs on the AB-HWC Portal, 50,927 Health & Wellness Centres have been operationalized till 1st December, 2020 which includes 28,320 level AB-HWCs As per the data update done by the States/UTs in HWC Portal, till 04.12.2020, about 7.31 crore screenings done for Hypertension and about 5.93 crore screenings done for Diabetes at these AB-HWCs. Similarly, these functional AB-HWCs have done more than 6.96 crore screenings for common cancers (3.67 crore for oral cancer, 1.34 crore for cervical cancer in women and 1.95 crore screenings for breast cancer in women). Further, as on 4th December 2020, 44.35 lakh Y oga/Wellness Sessions have been conducted in operational HWCs The primary healthcare team at the SHC level AB-HWCs is headed by Community Health Officers (CHO), who are also BSc/GNM Nurse or Ayurveda Practitioner trained in primary care and public health skills and certified in a six months Certificate Programme in Community Health or Graduate from Integrated nursing curriculum. Other members of the team are male and female Multi-Purpose Workers (MPW) and Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs). The training programme is being carried out with the support from Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) and the State specific Public/Health Universities. About 276 IGNOU Programme Study Centres (PSCs) have been notified so far and another 272 PSCs notified under the State specific Certificate Programme in the states of Maharashtra (107), Tamil Nadu (07), Gujarat (59), Uttar Pradesh (66) and West Bengal (33). This has taken the total of PSCs 548 across the country Since the screening, prevention and management of chronic illnesses including NCDs, TB and Leprosy have been introduced at AB-HWCs, training and skill upgradation of the primary health team in all the functional AB-HWCs on NCDs and use of IT application is undertaken To promote wellness and healthy lifestyle, orientation of the public on wellness activities for lifestyle modification like increased physical activity (cyclathons and marathons), eating RIGHT and SAFE, cessation of Tobacco and drugs, meditation, laughter clubs, open gyms, etc, is being done. Besides these, Y oga sessions for people are being conducted at these centres on regular basis. Through the Annual Health Calendar, planned activities are held covering issues related to the health condition pertaining to the Special Day that is being commemorated. This is resulting in increased awareness around preventive measures that must be adopted by the public Telemedicine guidelines have also been provided to the States to initiate specialist consultations from the PHCs to the Hub Hospitals and the pilot of the application is being conducted in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.

Cumulatively, it is envisaged that more than 75 lakh Wellness Sessions would be conducted by 15th August 2022. Similarly, it is planned to conduct 7.5 lakhs health promotion activities including NCDs between 14th April to 15th August 2022 to generate awareness across the country on the importance of promotive healthcare Behavioural change communication strategies on 'Eat Right' and 'Eat Safe' to be taken to the communities17 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Implementation of Ayushman Bharat School Health and Wellness Ambassadors Initiative in all the schools and the students as Health and Wellness Messengers to take forward the importance of promotive healthcare with the parents and peers. It is planned that there will be more than 75,000 Ambassadors by 15th August 2022. Convergence with Fit India movement and carrying forward the importance of Fit Health Worker Campaign started last year on regular basis Implementation of Ayushman Bharat Continuum-of-Care Centres (ABCCs) as per the established protocol to have free and smooth follow-up of cases at the community through HWCs Preventive Healthcare through population-based enumeration of population for common NCDs and important communicable diseases such as Leprosy and TB. It is planned that more than 7.5 crore cumulative screenings of common NCDs, three common cancers of Oral, Breast and Cervical cancers and communicable diseases of TB and Leprosy through AB-HWCs will be achieved by 15th August 2022. 1.2.2.2 Human Resources Health care service delivery requires sufficient skilled human resources. There has been an enormous shortage of human resources in the public health care sector in the country. NHM has attempted to fill the gaps in human resources by providing nearly 2.65 lakh additional health human resources to the States including 11,921 GDMOs, 3,789 Specialists, 73,619 Staff Nurses, 81,978 Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANM), 44,314 Allied Health Professionals, 460 Public Health Managers and 17,222 Programme Management staff etc. Apart from providing financial support for hiring human resources, NHM has focused on multiskilling human resources and providing technical support in the form of technical guidance and training. It has also prioritised multiskilling of doctors at strategically located facilities identified by the States where there is shortage of specialists e.g. MBBS doctors are trained in Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC), Life Saving Anaesthesia Skills (LSAS) and Laparoscopic Surgery. Similarly, due importance is given to capacity building of nursing staff and auxiliary workers such as ANMs. Additionally, NHM supports co-location of AYUSH services in health facilities such as PHCs, CHCs and DHs. A total of 27,495 AYUSH doctors have been deployed in the States with NHM funding support. 1.2.2.3 Mainstreaming of AYUSH Mainstreaming of AYUSH has been in 7,785 PHCs, 2,748 CHCs, 496 DHs, 4,022 facilities above SC but below block level and 371 health facilities other than CHC at or above block level but below district level. A major achievement of NHM relates to filling the gap in human resources. More than 2.65 lakh additional health human resources have been added to the States including 11,921 GDMOs; 3,789 Health Professionals; 460 Public Health Managers; and 17,222 Programme Management staff etc. A total of 27,495 AYUSH doctors too were deployed to the States 1.2.2.4 Infrastructure Up to 33% of NHM funds in High Focus States can be used for infrastructure development. Details of new construction/renovation as on 30.06.2020 undertaken across the country under NHM are as follows:18 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Facility New Construction Renovation/Upgradation 40,620 * These facilities are above SCs but below block level 1.2.2.5 National Ambulance Services (NAS) Under the NHM, GoI provides technical and financial support for emergency medical services in States/UTs through a functional National Ambulance Service (NAS) network linked with a centralised toll-free number 108/102. Dial 108 is an emergency response system, primarily designed to attend to patients of critical care, trauma and accident victims etc. Dial 102 services essentially consist of basic patient transport aimed to cater to the needs of pregnant women and children though other categories which are also taking benefit and are not excluded. The JSSK entitlements e.g. free transport from home to facility, inter facility transfer in case of referral and drop back for mother and children are the key focus of the 102 service. Over the years there has been an overall improvement in ambulance service under NHM mainly in availability and accessibility. With the advent of 102/108 services (NAS) the EMS in India has expanded exponentially and geographically, shifting focus from being a \"transport vehicle concept\" to a \"lifesaving emergency medical transportation\"; injury centric to covering all emergencies; and urban-centric to being pan-India. All this has led to the improved response time, for every patient in reaching the hospital for timely care. Presently, 35 States/UTs have the facility where people can dial 108 or 102 telephone number for calling an ambulance. Presently, 10,599 Dial-108, 605 Dial-104 and 9,875 Dial-102 Emergency Response Service Vehicles are supported under NHM, besides 5,412 empaneled vehicles for transportation of patients, particularly pregnant women and sick infants from home to public health facilities and back. 1.2.2.6 National Mobile Medical Units (NMMU) The vision of the NHM is universal access to equitable, affordable and quality health care services. Health care service delivery through Mobile Medical Units (MMUs) under NHM is one of the key strategies to facilitate access to public health care at the doorstep particularly to people living in remote, difficult, under-served and unreached areas. Mobile Medical Units are envisaged to provide primary care services including preventive and promotive care for common communicable and NCDs, RCH services, carry out screening activities and provide referral linkage to appropriate higher facilities. The MMUs also undertake Information, Education and Communication (IEC) sessions 19 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 on a range of health topics related to RCH, communicable diseases, including vector borne diseases (VBD), healthy lifestyle and behaviour changes, etc. MMUs also provide point of care diagnostics such as haemoglobin (Hb), blood glucose, pregnancy testing, urine microscopy, albumin and sugar. Support has been provided in 504 out of 716 districts for 1,677 MMUs under NHM in the country. To increase visibility, awareness and accountability, all MMUs have been positioned as \"National Mobile Medical Unit Service\" with universal colour and design 1.2.2.7 Free Drugs Service Initiative Under this initiative, substantial funding is being given to States for provision of free drugs and to set up systems for drug procurement, quality assurance, IT based supply chain management system, training and grievance redressal etc. Detailed Operational Guidelines for NHM - Free Drugs Service Initiative were developed and released to the States on 02.07.2015. All the States and UTs have notified policy to provide essential drugs free of cost in health facilities. Drugs procurement, quality system and distribution has been streamlined through IT based Drug Distribution Management Systems in 30 States. All the States/ UTs have centralised procurement through a corporation/procurement body, 29 States/UTs have NABL accredited labs to ensure that quality of drugs is provided, 33 States/ UTs have facility-wise EDL, 14 States/ UTs have prescription audit mechanisms and 22 States have established call centre-based grievance redressal mechanism with a dedicated toll free number. 1.2.2.8 Free Diagnostics Service Initiative To address the need of accessible and quality diagnostics in public health facilities, MoHFW launched the Operational Guidelines on Free Diagnostics Service Initiative in consultation with experts and States officials before disseminating them among States/UTs in July 2015. The Government envisaged that this health intervention would reduce both direct costs and out-of-pocket expenditure. This Guideline supports States/UTs to provide essential diagnostics-laboratory services and radiology services (Tele-radiology and CT Scan Services) at their public health facilities. As of 01.11.2020, free diagnostics laboratory services have been implemented in 33 States/UTs (in 11 States/UTs it is implemented in a public private partnership or PPP mode and in 22 States/UTs it is in an in-house mode). Free Diagnostics CT Scan services have been implemented in 23 States/UTs (in 13 States/UTs it is implemented in PPP mode and in 10 States/UTs it is in an in-house mode). Free Tele-Radiology Services have been implemented in 11 States/UTs in PPP mode. In FY 2019-20, approval to the tune of Rs. 971.67 crore was accorded to 33 States/ UTs under the Free Diagnostics Service Initiative. The second edition of Guidelines on Free Diagnostics Initiative has been released which provides a broader view of the expanded basket of laboratory services envisaged under the NHM. A dissemination workshop was organised by National Health Systems Resource Centre (NHSRC) to guide States/UTs for implementation of guidelines. In the Programme Implementation Plan (PIP) 2020-21, NHM approved support to 11 States/UTs for implementation of revised guidelines of Free Diagnostics Initiative. The NHM supported States/UTs in strengthening existing laboratory services through Emergency Covid Response Proposals (ECRP) for testing under Free Diagnostics Service Initiative. The proposals primarily comprised of essential equipment like Rapid Kits, RT-PCR Machines, TruNaat Machines and budget for sample transportation for enhancing the diagnostic capacity. The funds to be spent under ECRPs 20 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 were given on the basis of approvals given by the Executive Committee of the State Health Society. 1.2.2.9 Biomedical Equipment Maintenance and Management Programme (BMMP) To address the issue of non-functional equipment across public health facilities, comprehensive guidelines were designed on BMMP and disseminated among States/UTs. As of 01.11.2020, BMMP has been implemented in 31 States/UTs (in 24 States/UTs it is implemented in PPP mode and 7 States/UTs it is in an in-house mode). The implementation of BMMP has helped in improving diagnostics services in health facilities by making equipment available with 95% uptime, thereby reducing cost of care and improving the quality of patient care in public health facilities. Biomedical Equipment Management and Maintenance Programme technical guidance document for in-house support and monitoring of PPPs is circulated to States/UTs. A two-day virtual dissemination workshop was organised in September,2020 to guide States/UTs on implementation of guidelines. Key Highlights during 01.1.2020 - 31.12.2020 In FY 2020-21, an amount of Rs. 354.79 crore (approx.) was approved by MoHFW to States/ UTs for effective management of Biomedical Equipment Maintenance BMMP technical guidance document for in-house support and monitoring of PPPs is circulated to States/UTs. To guide and support the State/UT's in the implementation of these guidelines, NHSRC conducted a dissemination workshop on 29-30 September, 2020. Along with this a national review of the programme was planned and a platform Dissemination workshop on BMMP held on 29-30 September, 2020 for State /UT's to share their best practices, which could be adopted by other State/UT's which were aspiring to strengthen their BMMP . As a response to the COVID-19 outbreak, a desk review of BMMP dashboards of States for availability of ventilators in various public health facilities was carried out. A real time dashboard was facilitated in the State/UTs where BMMP has been implemented. The dashboard helps maintain real time inventory of medical equipment as well as enables states to rationalise their resources and identify prospective medical products for procurement. States have been further suggested to carry out such analysis for other equipment also.21 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Based on the equipment analysis on BMMP dashboards, States/ UTs proposed procurement of medical equipment in ECRP on the basis of approvals given by the Executive Committee of the State Health Society. The MoHFW also drafted a COVID-19 repository for India on effective management of the pandemic. Major areas like manufacturing of ventilators, N95 masks, personal protection equipment (PPE) kits, procurement of equipment, research and development and service delivery were described in detail in the repository 1.2.2.10 Community Participation Accredited Social Health Workers (ASHA): The ASHA programme is a key component of the community processes element of NHM which intends to achieve the goal of increasing community engagement with the health system. The programme was initially launched in the year 2006 in 18 high focus States and tribal areas and later expanded to the rest of the country in 2009. It is a key component of the NHM. ASHAs are honorary volunteers who receive performance-based incentives for a varied set of activities (nearly 40 tasks approved at the national level) related to maternal and child health (MCH), communicable diseases and NCDs for community level health interventions. There are 10.61 lakh ASHAs across the country in rural and urban areas (except Goa and Chandigarh) under the NHM who act as a link between the community and the public health system. There are 10.61 lakh ASHAs across the country in rural and urban areas (except Goa and Chandigarh) under the NHM who act as a link between the community and the public health system Over the last 15 years, ASHAs have been widely acknowledged for their substantial contribution in improving access to care for community in areas ranging from RMNCH+A to communicable diseases and more recently to NCDs. ASHAs also played a key role in the country's response for prevention and management of COVID-19. During the pandemic, in addition to performing tasks related to the pandemic, ASHAs continued to support community members in accessing EHSs such as ANC, Immunization, safe delivery and treatment adherence for chronic illnesses. The Union Cabinet approved an increase in the amount of routine and recurring incentives under NHM for ASHAs that will now enable them to get at least Rs. 2000 per month against the earlier allocated Rs 1000. As part of the ASHA benefit package launched in 2018, social security benefits like life insurance, accident insurance and pension were extended to all eligible ASHAs and ASHA Facilitators ojana (PMSYMDY) respectively. In order to support the 22 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 ASHAs during the pandemic, all ASHAs and ASHA facilitators were also covered under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package for coverage under insurance scheme of Rs. 50 lakh in case of loss of life due to COVID-19 or accidental death on account of COVID-19 related duty. To support the ASHAs and ASHA facilitators for undertaking additional tasks related to COVID-19, incentives and benefits were modified as below: An incentive of Rs. 1000 per month was introduced to support ASHAs and Rs. 500 per month for ASHA Facilitators for undertaking activities related to COVID-19 Assured payment of routine and recurring incentive of Rs. 2000 per month All ASHAs and ASHA facilitators were covered under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package for coverage under the insurance scheme of Rs. 50 Lakh in case of loss of life due to COVID-19 or accidental death on account of COVID-19 related duty. Glimpses of activities undertaken by ASHAs for prevention and management of COVID-19 Packages of benefits for ASHAs and ASHA Facilitators More than 3,90,000 ASHAs and ASHA facilitators enrolled in PMSBY 2,90,000 enrolled under PMJJBY2,80,000 enrolled under PMSYMDY introduced as part of an ASHA Benefit Package in 2018Rogi Kalyan Samiti (RKS) or Patient Welfare Committee/ Hospital Management Society: This is a simple yet effective management structure wherein the committee is a registered society that acts as a group of trustees for the hospitals and manages their affairs. Financial assistance is provided to them through untied fund to undertake activities for patient welfare. As of June 2020, about 33,753 RKS had been set up involving community members in almost all DHs, SDHs. CHCs and PHCs.23 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committees (VHSNC): About 5.53 lakh VHSNCs had been constituted at the village level across the country to facilitate village level health care planning. Also, 12.55 crore Village Health Sanitation & Nutrition Days (VHSNDs) were held during the Mission period. Untied Grants to SCs:At the village level, the VHSNC monitors the services provided by the Anganwadi Worker (AWW), ASHA and SC. These Committees are envisaged to function under the ambit of the Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI) with adequate representation from women and weaker sections of society. The VHSNC acts as a sub-committee or statutory body of the Gram Panchayat. The same institutional mechanism is also mandated in urban areas. The VHSNCs are provided an untied fund of Rs 10,000 on an annual basis which is topped up based on expenditure of the previous year. As of June 2020, more than 5.53 lakh VHSNCs had been set up. The capacity building of VHSNC members with regard to their roles and responsibilities for maintaining the health status of the village is being done in many States. 1.2.2.11 24 x 7 Services and First Referral facilities To ensure service provision for MCH services at the PHCs have been made available 24x7. Nearly 10,430 PHCs have been made 24x7 DHs, 712 SDHs and 1543 CHCs and other level) have been operationalised First Referral Units (FRUs) under NHM. 1.2.2.12 Mera Aspataal This is a patient feedback system which was launched in September 2016 with a mandate to integrate Central Government Hospitals and DHs on the feedback portal. It has now been extended upto CHC, Rural & Urban PHC and private medical colleges and is currently functional in 34 States/UTs. As of 26.11.2020, 6279 facilities were integrated into the portal with integrated in FY 2019-20. 1.2.2.13 Swachh Swasth Sarvatra This is a joint initiative of the MoHFW and Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation and was launched in December 2016 to achieve better health outcomes through improved sanitation and increased awareness on healthy lifestyle. Under this initiative, one-time grant of Rs.10 Lakh is provided to the non-Kayakalp awardee CHC located in the open defecation free (ODF) Blocks as a resource for improving the deficiencies found in the Kayakalp assessment, so that by the time the next assessment is due they can become a Kayakalp awardee. 1.2.2.14 Kayakalp Award Scheme This under the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan' . The scheme encourages public health facilities to demonstrate high levels of cleanliness, adherence to hygiene, sanitation and infection control practices. Exemplary performances are recognised through cash prizes and citation. The scheme has made a significant and positive impact in terms of enhanced cleanliness in the facilities, improved aesthetics, enhanced patient satisfaction, hygiene promotion, etc. The number of health facilities meeting the benchmark score of 70% or more and qualifying for the Kayakalp awards has increased from 100 facilities in FY 2015- 16 to 6620 in FY 2019-20. As of 11.11.2020, nearly 12 scored more than 70%. A total of 6620 facilities were awarded under this scheme in FY 2019-20 as per data received from 30 States/UTs upto 11.11.2020. 24 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 In the year 2020, States/UTs are grappling to complete their peer and external assessments because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with the launch of methods and protocols for virtual assessment, the pace of progress has picked up. It is expected that most of the States would be able to declare the Kayakalp awards by the end of January 2021. As of 13.11 2020, Haryana is the only State to declare its Kayakalp awards for 2020-21 with 149 facilities scoring over benchmark score of 70%. Kayakalp progress over the years 1.2.2.15 The Prime Minister's National Dialysis Programme (PMNDP) In India, about 10-20% of patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) are expected to develop End Stage Kidney Failure (ESKF). ESKF in India is estimated to be 226 per million of the population (Modi and Jha, Kidney Int 2006). This roughly translates to an estimated 2,25,000 people, developing ESKF annually. MoHFW launched programme guidelines for Hemo-dialysis services under the PMNDP in 2016 for implementation of services at DH level under NHM. Guidelines of the National Dialysis Programme including the Model Request for Proposal (RFP) for PPP were developed and released on 7.04.2016.PMNDP (Hemo-dialysis) has been implemented in 503 districts of 35 States/ UTs at 882 dialysis centres by deploying 5,490 machines. A total of 8.52 lakh patients availed dialysis services and 86.37 lakh Hemo-dialysis sessions were held as of 30.09.2020. Programme Objectives: To provide free of cost dialysis services to Below Poverty Line (BPL) patients at public health facilities; and To provide discounted rates for dialysis services to Above Poverty Line (APL) patients All States/UTs were requested to incorporate proposals for the roll-out of PMNDP in their PIPs. Approvals were therefore provided to all the States for provision of free dialysis services to BPL patients. Based on the PIP proposals received from the States/UTs, over Rs 153 crore was approved in 2016-17; Rs 178 crore in 2017-18; Rs 194 crore for FY 2018-19; Rs 251 crore in FY 2019-20 and Rs 319 crore in FY 2020-21 for Hemo-dialysis services Key Highlights and Achievements Guidelines Issued for PD: Under PMNDP , Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been introduced and guidelines launched on 10.10.2019. With the introduction of PD, the home-based dialysis treatment sees minimal supervision and lesser disruption to normal lifestyle and so does not put additional incremental burden on the existing health care infrastructure. Also, PD reduces travel to the dialysis centre for treatment and allows greater flexibility and freedom in treatment schedule. In PIP 2020-21, NHM approved PD programme support for 20 States/UTs for approximately 4000 patients.25 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Special Attention Paid During COVID-19: The pandemic had a high chance of producing high morbidity in the elderly and in patients with associated co-morbidities. These patients are, therefore, not only more prone to acquire infection but also develop severe diseases as compared to the general population. A guideline for dialysis in reference to COVID-19 infection was formalised and shared with all States/UTs for compliance. The main focus was on precautions to be taken by the administration and dialysis staff of a dialysis unit while performing Haemo- dialysis of a general patient or one suffering from COVID-19. These guidelines helped the States in implementing good disinfection and disposal practices in the dialysis unit. 1.2.2.16 National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Implementation and Related Activities Quality in delivery of health care services is important for improving the health status of the population. It enhances accessibility, increases efficiency, strengthens clinical effectiveness and improves user satisfaction. With the aim of improving quality of care, the MoHFW launched the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) for DHs in 2013 and subsequently for other health facilities. These standards are accredited by the International Society for Quality in Healthcare (ISQua) and recognised by IRDA and NHA. Programme Objectives To improve quality of care in DHs and other health facilities Bring down hospital acquired infections (HAI) by promoting cleanliness, hygiene and sanitation. To promote the practice of cleanliness, hygiene and sanitation and controlling the HAI, the Kayakalp award scheme was launched in 2015 for Central Government institutions and State public health facilities. The same has now been extended to the HWCs in all States/UTs. Maternal and Newborn Health remains a priority for the country. For ensuring quality and safety in 'care around birth' , LaQshya initiative was launched in 2017. Incremental growth in LaQshya certified departments has led to national level certification of 264 labour rooms and 229 maternity operation theatres. Apart from this, recognising the need to capture the voice of patients for enhanced patient experience and continued learning, India launched its own centralised IT platform i.e. 'Mera-Aspataal'/ 'My Hospital' in 2018. So far, over 5,300 government health facilities and around 722 non-governmental health facilities have been integrated with Mera-Aspataal across 34 States and UTs. Under the Free Drugs Service Initiative, substantial funds have been given to States for provision of free drugs. All States/UTs have a notified policy to provide essential drugs free of cost in their health facilities. Drugs procurement, quality system and distribution have been streamlined through the Drug Distribution Management System in 29 States. Essential drugs are the integral part of IPHS guidelines to support the health care system in achieving SDGs. To provide Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) through AB- HWCs, Essential Medicines List (EML) for SHC and PHC have been finalised. To strengthen the FDSI, Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) guidelines are being revised for SCs, PHCs, CHCs, SDHs, DHs and being developed for Urban Health (U-PHC).26 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 As of 13.11.2020, a total of 1,585 public health facilities achieved their National Quality Certification (675 nationally certified and 910 health facilities certified at State level) In 2020, a total of 154 health facilities were NQAS certified as of 13.11.2020 Facilities certified for NQAS in 2020 Level of facility Number of facilities certified District Hospitals 26 Sub-Divisional Hospitals2 Community Health Centres23 Primary Health Centres90 Urban- Primary Health Centres13 Total 154 Key Highlights and Achievements LaQshya Certification: For improving care around birth and ensuring Respectful Maternity Care (RMC), 'LaQshya' Initiative was launched in December 2017.

This year's theme of WPSD - \"Health Worker Safety: A Priority for Patient Safety\" 1.2.2.17 National Health System Resource Centre (NHSRC) The NHSRC was set up in 2007, to provide technical support to the MoHFW on policy issues and development of strategy besides taking up capacity building of States. It functions under the guidance of a Governing Board headed by the Secretary, MoHFW , GoI and an Executive Committee headed by the Additional Secretary & Mission Director, NHM, MoHFW . The Regional Resource Centre, North East (RRC-NE), a Branch of the NHSRC, serves as the technical support organisation for the States in the North East Region. 1.2.2.18 Health Care Affordability Latest results of NSS Health Survey for the year 2017-18 indicate that the utilisation of Government facilities has increased as compared to previous NSS Health Round of 2014. Among those who sought medical advice for treatment, 28% in rural areas and 20% in urban areas visited government health facilities in 2014 whereas in 2017-18 it increased to 32.5% in rural areas and 26% in urban areas. The share of hospitalisation cases in public hospitals increased from 42% to 46% in rural and 32% to 35% in urban areas from 2014 to 2017-18. The utilisation of public facilities for institutional delivery increased from 56% to 69% in rural and 42% to 48% in urban areas. Health expenditure also declined in the Government health facilities. The average medical expenditure per hospitalisation in nominal terms declined from Rs. 5,636 to Rs. 4,290 in rural areas and from Rs. 7,670 to Rs. 4,837 in urban areas. For institutional delivery as well, average medical expenditure declined from Rs. 1,587 to Rs. 1,324 in rural areas and from Rs. 2,117 to Rs. 1,919 in urban areas. 1.2.3 NATIONAL URBAN HEALTH MISSION (NUHM) The National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) was approved on 01.05.2013 as a sub-mission under an overarching NHM with NRHM being the other sub-mission. The NUHM envisages strengthening the primary healthcare delivery system in urban areas and for providing equitable and quality primary healthcare services to the urban population with special focus on slum dwellers and vulnerable population. It also seeks to de-congest secondary and tertiary health care facilities (DHs/SDHs/CHCs) by providing robust comprehensive primary healthcare services in urban areas.28 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 NUHM covers all cities and towns with more than 50,000 population in district headquarters and State headquarters with more than 30,000 population. The remaining cities/ towns continue to be covered under NRHM. As part of Ayushman Bharat, the existing UPHCs are being strengthened as HWCs to provide preventive, promotive and curative services in cities closer to the communities. Under NUHM, the Centre-State funding pattern is 60:40 for all the States w.e.f. FY 2015-16, except all North-Eastern States and other hilly States viz. Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, for which the Centre-State funding pattern is 90:10. In the case of UTs, from FY 2017-18, the funding pattern of UT of Delhi and Puducherry has been revised to 60:40 and rest of the UTs without legislature are fully funded by Central Government. Implementation of NUHM is through the State Health Department or the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). In seven metropolitan cities, viz., Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad the implementation is through the ULBs. For the other cities, the State Health Department decides whether the NUHM is to be implemented through them or the other urban local bodies. So far, 1068 cities have been covered under NUHM in 35 States/UTs. 1.2.3.1 Programme Components 1) Service Delivery Infrastructure: NUHM envisages setting up of a service delivery infrastructure which is largely absent in cities/towns to specially address the health care needs of the urban poor and provides 2) U-PHC: These are to be established as per norm of one U-PHC for approximately 30,000 to 50,000 urban population. They are preferably located within or near a slum for providing preventive, promotive and OPD (consultation), basic lab diagnosis, drug/contraceptive dispensing services, apart from counselling for all communicable and NCDs 3) U-CHC and Referral Hospitals: One U-CHC to be established for every 2.5 lakh population (in non-metro cities above 5 lakh population) and for every 5 lakh population in metro cities. It would provide in- patient services and would be a 30-50 bedded facility. For metro cities, U-CHCs may be established for every 5 lakh population with 100 beds 4) Outreach services: NUHM also supports engagement of ANMs for conducting outreach services for targeted groups particularly slum dwellers and the vulnerable population for providing preventive and promotive health care services at the household and community level. Community Process: Following targeted interventions are envisaged under NUHM for slum dwellers and urban poor population: a) One ASHA per 1,000 - 2,500 population covering approximately 200-500 households to serve as an effective, demand-generating link between the health facility and the urban slum population b) Mahila Arogya Samiti (MAS) per 250 - 500 population covering approximately 50-100 households to act as a community-based peer education group in slums. They would be involved in community mobilisation, monitoring and referral with focus on preventive and promotive care. Comprehensive PHC through HWCs: To ensure delivery of Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) services under the HWC component of Ayushman Bharat, the existing UPHCs are being 29 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 strengthened as HWCs. Support for training of PHC staff (Medical Officers, Staff Nurses, Pharmacist, and Lab Technicians), necessary IT infrastructure and resources required for upgrading laboratory and diagnostics for expanded range of services is being provided to the States. A total of 3339 HWCs were operationalised in urban areas as of March, 2020. Training and review workshops were conducted for the roll-out of CPHC-HWC in urban areas in collaboration with NHSRC. 1.2.3.2 Key Highlights and Achievements of NUHM Physical Progress The programme is being implemented in the States/UTs for more than six years and accounts for the presence of augmented infrastructure and human resources dedicated towards urban areas. The January-March, 2020 quarterly progress data shows more than 4,800 facilities in urban areas which have been strengthened and construction of about 863 new UPHCs and UCHCs that have been approved. The human resource approved under the programme includes around 3,400 MOs, 400 specialists, 16,000 ANMs, 9100 staff nurses, 3,500 pharmacists, 3,900 lab technicians and 680 public health managers. About 74,000 ASHAs and 92,000 MAS have been approved for effective community participation activities. Training and capacity building activities have also been approved for building and strengthening institutional capacity. Kayakalp and Swachh Swasth Sarvatra (SSS) have also been expanded to cover urban areas and U-PHCs have been awarded Kayakalp awards. Financial allocation Since the launch of NUHM, from 2013-14 till 10.11.2020, funds to the tune of Rs. 7,788.48 crore and Rs. 6,205.36 crore have been allocated and released to the States and UTsrespectively, for implementation of programme activities1.2.3.3 Guidelines/Brochures developed The guidelines shared with the States/UTs on implementation of NUHM include NUHM Implementation Framework, Community Process Guidelines in the Urban context, Induction Module for MAS, Induction Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas, Capacity Building Framework, Vulnerability Mapping & Assessment, ANM Handbook, Quality Standards for U-PHCs, Extension of Kayakalp in Urban Areas, Extension of SSS in Urban Areas, Orientation Training Module, NUHM Brand Module, Outreach Session in Urban Areas, NUHM Financial Management Guideline, Framework on Convergence, NUHM Innovation Framework and Accounting Handbook for Mahila Arogya Samiti (MAS).

Launch of Health Management Information System (HMIS) 2.0 Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Hon'ble Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare digitally inaugurated the 7th National Summit on Good, Replicable Practices through a video conference on 28 th December 2020. In this function, Hon'ble Union Minister has also launched New Health Management Information System (HMIS) 2.0 along with the Operational Guidelines for TB services at AB-HWCs and the Operational Guidelines 2020 on Active Case Detection and Regular Surveillance for Leprosy. 34 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Hon'ble HFM explained the importance of digital and Information technology in delivery of Healthcare services. He said Digital transformation has enabled us to develop a national digital health ecosystem that supports Universal Health Coverage in an efficient, accessible, inclusive, affordable, timely and safe manner. The new Health Management Information System (HMIS) provides a seamless online platform through the provision of a wide range of data, information and infrastructure services, duly leveraging open, interoperable, standards-based digital systems. The optimal information exchange has helped in achieving better health outcome, better decision support system, and facilitating improvement in the reforms of public health care at State and National level. HMIS 2.0 has many new features, which will make it very effective in monitoring of our national health programmes. These features include real time data entry and real time monitoring of the system, Compatibility with multiple devices such as Mobile, Tab etc., Integration with other portal through API, Interactive Dashboards, GIS Integration with layer of village and National Identification Number (NIN) and Local Government Directory (LGD) compliance with unique identification of health facilities upto village/block level. 1.2.6 Mother and Child Tracking System (MCTS)/ Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) Portal & ANM-On- Line (ANMOL) To facilitate timely delivery of health care services to all the pregnant women, lactating mothers and children, web-based name-based tracking system called Mother & Child Tracking System (MCTS) was introduced across all States & UTs. They are meant to provide ready reference regarding the status of services/vaccination delivered to pregnant women and children. The Ministry has rolled out an upgraded version of MCTS, called RCH Portal which is designed for early identification and tracking of the individual beneficiary throughout the reproductive lifecycle and to promote, monitor and support the reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) schemes/programme delivery and reporting. The MCTS/RCH portal is capturing data of beneficiaries, which is used by multiple applications like e-Janma (Karnataka), ANMOL, MCTFC, Kilkari and Mobile Academy. The RCH Portal data is also used for direct bank transfer of JSY benefits to pregnant women and payments to ASHAs, wherever possible. A total of 19.24 crore pregnant women and since its inception,16.24 crore children have been registered in MCTS / RCH portal as on 17.12.2020. The RCH portal has been implemented in 34 States/UTs and the remaining two States (Rajasthan & Tamil Nadu) are sending data in the MCTS portal. A total of 19.24 crore pregnant women and since its inception,16.24 crore children have been registered in MCTS / RCH portal as on 17.12.2020. The portal is playing a vital role in key decision making and monitoring the implementation of health schemes in the country. It has helped health workers plan for service delivery and identification of beneficiary due for antennal check-up (ANC), postnatal check-up (PNC) and Immunization services. It helps in identification of high-risk pregnant women and tracking of health conditions and assistance during the delivery of pregnant women. Data of children's immunization requirement is also helping health workers in generating a work plan for delivering immunization services. This initiative has a positive impact in improving the health care service delivery in the country. ANMOL is a tablet-based application which empowers ANMs, the frontline health workers, in carrying out their day-to-day work efficiently and effectively by entering and updating service 35 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 records of beneficiaries on real/near real time basis. Further, ANMOL acts as a job-aid to the ANMs by providing them readily available information such as due list and dashboard along with guidance based on data entered etc. This standardises the maternal and child care services provided by ANMs who can also plan the VHSND along with vaccines and logistics required. Audio and video counselling facility of ANMOL helps in creating awareness among beneficiaries about the various government schemes and facilitates beneficiaries getting authentic knowledge about family planning, pregnancy and child care. The ANMOL application was launched by Hon'ble Union Minister of HFW on 07.04.2016. It is presently in three languages i.e. English, Hindi and Kannada. The application is being used by more than 48,987 ANMs since inception. The ANMOL application has been launched in 12 States and UTs and is being used by more than 48,987 ANMs since inception To enhance the performance of ANMOL, an ANMOL Intermediate Server (AIS) for ANMOL has been implemented for seamless data integration and synchronisation. The training of trainers (ToT) for ANMOL was completed the 11 States/UTs and Meghalaya and the same shall be made live shortly. 1.2.7 Mother and Child Tracking Facilitation Centre (MCTFC) The MCTFC was set up at the National Institute of Health and Family Welfare (NIHFW) and was made live on 29.04.2014. It is a major step taken by the GoI under the NHM in improving MCH care services. The centre is operational with 86 Helpdesk Agents (HAs) 2 Medical Specialists, 2 Supervisors and few administrative and IT staff. It is a tool for providing relevant information and guidance directly to pregnant women, parents of children and to community health workers, thus creating awareness among them about health services and promoting healthy practices and behaviour. As of 15.12.2020, more than 1.19 crore calls were made to beneficiaries through MCTFC for data validation, promotion and facilitation in availing MCH services and government schemes More than 12.19 lakh calls were made to ANMs and ASHAs for data validation and resolution of their queries and over 60.47 lakh voice messages on Maternal and Child care were delivered to beneficiaries The centre contacts the service providers and recipients of mother and child care services to get their feedback on various mother and child care services, programmes and initiatives like JSSK, JSY , RBSK and contraceptive distribution by ASHAs etc. The MCTFC also validates and verifies records of beneficiaries and health workers. The feedback helps MoHFW/State Governments/ UT Administration to easily and quickly evaluate programme interventions and plan appropriate corrective measures to improve health service delivery. In-bound calling has been implemented with short code 10588 to resolve queries of beneficiaries and health workers. At MCTFC, helpdesk agents also check with ASHAs and ANMs regarding availability of essential drugs and supplies like Iron Folic Acid (IFA) ORS packets and contraceptives etc. Information relating to upcoming programmes, initiatives and validation of data is also provided to beneficiaries and health workers.36 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 MCTFC calls supporting calling in English, Telugu, Bengali, Gujarati, Odiya and Assamese languages. 1.2.8 Surveys and Evaluation Activities 1.2.8.1 National Family Health Survey (NFHS) The NFHSs are conducted periodically under the stewardship of the MoHFW , GoI to generate data on important demographic and health indicators. The first round of NFHS was conducted in 1992-93 followed by subsequent rounds in 1998-99, 2005-06 and 2015-16. The present round of NFHS with reference period 2019-20 is in progress while work was temporarily suspended for major part of the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to meet the requirement of National, State and District level information, the Ministry needed to monitor the performance of health programmes/ schemes at closer intervals. It therefore took a decision in 2012, to conduct one integrated survey with a periodicity of three years in place of different surveys of similar nature (National Family Health Survey, District Level Household and Facility Survey, etc.) that were then carried out by the Ministry. In line with this decision, the 4 th round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) was conducted in 2015-16 as an integrated survey with a six-fold increase in sample size for providing estimates of key HFW indicators at the National, State and District levels besides information on the levels of fertility, nutrition, infant and child mortality by background characteristics at State/National level. Compared to the earlier NFHSs (i.e. NFHS-1, NFHS-2 & NFHS-3) which provided only National and State level estimates, NFHS-4 also provided district level estimates which are available in the public domain. They provide essential data on nutrition, HFW needed by the Central and State Governments and other stakeholders for effective policy and programme interventions. Further, NFHS-4 results also provide baseline information for the SDGs on health. The survey has emerged as a major data source for tracking the progress at disaggregated levels towards achieving targets, in particular SDG-3, by the stipulated time. The activities of next round of NFHS (NFHS- 5) have been in progress with 2019-20 as the reference period collecting data from more than 6 lakh sample households. The field work is planned in two phases covering about half the country in each phase with an aim to provide district level estimates for most of the indicators for all 707 districts (as of March, 2017). As in the case of previous rounds of NFHS, International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) is the Nodal Agency for conducting NFHS-5. The scope of NFHS-5 has been modified where required to make target population ranges and age references align with those of SDGs. Thus expanded age range of 15+ years is being considered for non-communicable diseases (eg. Diabetes, Hypertension etc.) and also for their risk factors. It has also been expanded by including questions inter-alia on disability, collection of Dried Blood Sample (DBS) for carrying out tests for Malaria, HbA1C, Vitamin-D and measurement of waist/ hip circumferences, etc. Inauguration of ToT for NFHS-5 field survey37 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 The main survey field work has been completed in all sample PSUs. The States and District factsheets comprising estimates of key indicators for 22 Phase-I States/UTs have been released by Hon'ble HFM on the occasion of Universal Health Coverage Day on 12.12.2020 and uploaded in the website of MoHFW . As regards Phase-II, the main survey field work was over in more than 34% of the Phase II districts on 20 th March 2020, before the survey field operations of NFHS-5 had to be suspended in remaining Phase II States/UTs on account of COVID-19 pandemic. The remaining activities of NFHS-5 restarted in November, 2020 with additional protocols and protective measures for carrying out the fieldwork in current COVID situation. The factsheet for the remaining 14 Phase-II States/UTs is expected to be released by May,2021 and all the activities of NFHS-5 is scheduled to be completed by December,2021.

Sustained development of the country can thus be achieved only if holistic care is taken of its women and children. Massive and strategic 39 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 investments have been made under the NHM for improvement of maternal health. Maternal health is an important aspect for development of any country in terms of increasing equity and reducing poverty. The survival and well being of mothers is not only important in their own right but also central to solving large broader, economic, social and developmental challenges. 1.3.2 Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) MMR in the country declined from 130 in 2014-16 to 113 in 2016-18 India's MMR was exceptionally high in 1990 with 556 women dying during child birth per 1,00,000 live births. Approximately, 1.38 lakh women were dying every year on account of complications related to pregnancy and child birth. The global MMR at the time was much lower at 385. There has however, been an accelerated decline in MMR in India. MMR in the country declined from 130 in 2014- 16 to 113 in 2016-18. India's share among global maternal deaths declined significantly as per the Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-agency Group (MMEIG) Report. SDG-3 pertains to Maternal Health where the target is to reduce MMR to less than 70 per 1,00,000 live births by 2030. As per MMEIG report, maternal deaths around the world dropped from about 4,51,000 in the year 2000 to an estimated 2,95,000 in 2017. This equates to an estimated global MMR of 211 per 100,000 live births, down from 342 in 2000, a 38% reduction. Globally, the World's MMR fell by nearly 45% over the past 27 years, to an estimated 211 maternal deaths per 1,00,000 live births in 2017, from an MMR of 385 in 1990 at an average annual decline of 1.7%, while India recorded a decline of 78% reduction in maternal deaths over 27 years.

The COVID-19 pandemic period saw a decrease in access to these services and about 10 lakh adolescents availed counselling and clinical services from AFHCs up to September 2020 (FY 2020-21). 1.4 CHILD HEALTH & IMMUNIZATION 1.4.1 Introduction The Child Health programme under the Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child Health and Adolescent Health (RMNCH+A) Strategy of the National Health Mission (NHM) comprehensively integrates interventions that improve child health and nutrition status and addresses factors contributing to neonatal, infant, under-five mortality and malnutrition. 51 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 The National Population Policy (NPP) 2000, the National Health Policy 2002, Twelfth Five Y ear Plan (2007-12), National Health Mission (NRHM/ NHM - 2005-2017), Sustainable Development Goals (2016-2030) and New National Health Policy, 2017 have laid down the goals for child health (Table- 1.4.1). Table 1.4.1 Child Health Goals Rate32 28 by 2019 - Under-5 Mortality Rate36 23 by 2025 25 Source: Sample Registration System (SRS) 2018 A) Situation of Child Mortality in India 1.4.2 CHILD MORTALITY The major causes of child mortality in India as per SRS reports (2010-13) are prematurity & low birth weight (29.8%), diseases Other anomalies (4.4%), Ill-defined or cause unknown (4.4%), Acute bacterial sepsis and severe infections (3.6%), Fever of unknown origin (2.5%) and All Other Remaining Causes (8.4%). Besides these, malnutrition is a contributory factor in 50% child deaths.1.4.2.1 Status of Neonatal health As per the latest Sample Registration System, Report, Under Five Mortality Rate in India is 36/1000 live births (SRS, 2018), IMR is 32/1000 live births (SRS, 2018) and Neonatal Mortality Rate is 23/1000 live births (SRS, 2018) U5MR has declined at a faster pace in the period 2008-2016, registering a compound annual decline of 6.3% per year, compared to 3.3% compound annual decline observed over 1990-2007 Nearly 65% of all deaths among children under age 5 occur in the neonatal period (i.e. within 28 days of birth) Nearly 72% of all infant deaths (i.e. 1 year of birth) occur in the first month of life Nearly 80% of all neonatal deaths occur in their first week of birth (Early neonatal period) only. National and State/UT details available are at Table-1.4.2 & 1.4.3 Neonatal, Infant and Child Mortality Rates Table- 1.4.2.1 (a) Indicators Rate / 1000 live births Early- Neonatal Mortality Rate (within 1 week)18 Neonatal Mortality Rate (within first four weeks)23 Infant Mortality Rate (within 1 year) 32 Under-5 Mortality Rate 3652 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 State-wise status of Neonatal, Infant and Child Mortality Rates Table- 1.4.2.1 (b) Status of Child Mortality at National and State/ UT level ENMR NMR IMR U5MR India Andaman & Nicobar Islands 9 Andhra Pradesh 15 21 29 33 Arunachal Pradesh 37 Assam 15 21 41 47 Bihar 20 25 32 37 Chandigarh 13 Chhattisgarh 22 29 41 45 Dadra &Nagar Haveli 13 Daman & Diu 16 Delhi 9 10 13 19 Goa 7 Gujarat 15 19 28 31 Haryana 15 22 30 36 Himachal Pradesh 10 13 19 23 Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh 12 17 22 23 Jharkhand 17 21 30 34 Karnataka 12 16 23 28 Kerala 5 5 7 10 Lakshadweep 14 Madhya Pradesh 26 35 48 56 Maharashtra 10 13 19 22 Manipur 11 Meghalaya 33 Mizoram 5 Nagaland 4 Odisha 24 31 40 44 Puducherry 11 Punjab 9 13 20 23 Rajasthan 20 26 37 40 Sikkim 7 Tamil Nadu 7 10 15 17 Telangana 13 19 27 30 Tripura 27 Uttar Pradesh 24 32 43 47 Uttarakhand 17 22 31 33 West Bengal 12 16 22 26 Source: Sample Registration System, RGI 2018 Report53 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 1.4.3 Interventions under Child Health Based on the identified causes of mortality, five major focus areas have been identified to improve child health outcomes. These are: Besides, Maternal Health and Family Planning interventions are also linked inextricably to child health outcomes. Therefore, the RMNCH+A strategic approach identifies strategies for the continuum of care across life stages as the over-arching umbrella under which these child health interventions have been built. Focus Area 1: Newborn Health Newborn Mortality Rate in India is 23/1000 live births (SRS 2018). Newborn deaths contribute to nearly 65% of the Under-5 deaths in the country. The major causes of newborn deaths in India are: Prematurity & LBW (48%), anomalies and Diarrhoea (3%). The India Newborn Action Plan (INAP) was launched in 2014 to make concerted efforts towards attainment of the goals of \"Single Digit Neonatal by INAP Week on 20.11.2020 by Hon'ble HFM INAP on National Newborn Week on 20.11.2020 by Hon'ble HFM with Senior Officers of MoHFW Strategic interventions under newborn health (i) Promotion of Institutional Deliveries and Essential Newborn Care: Since ante-natal and intra-partum events have a bearing on newborn health, institutional deliveries are being promoted with cash incentives in the form of JSY . Newborn Care Corners (NBCCs) have been operationalised at delivery points to provide essential newborn care at the time of birth. In order to reduce out-of-pocket expenses, Janani Shishu Swasthya Karyakram (JSSK) entitlements have been provided to ensure cashless diagnosis and treatment of pregnant woman 54 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 and her child till one year of age in public health facilities. This also includes free referral transport (ii) Home Based Newborn Care and Home- based Care of Y oung Children (HBNC/ HBYC); is for promotion of essential newborn care including breastfeeding practices, early identification and referral of neonatal illnesses by ASHAs. ASHAs are paid an incentive for visiting each newborn and post-partum mother in the first six weeks of life as per defined schedule. During April-September, 2020 (2020-21), more than 55.26 lakh newborn were visited by ASHAs under Home Based Newborn Care (HBNC) Program. Considering the effects of diarrhoea, pneumonia, under-nutrition and importance of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (W ASH) related interventions on overall child survival and development, addressing this gap in health system contact is crucial. Therefore, under Home Based Care for Y oung Child (HBYC) programme, additional five home visits are carried out by ASHAs with the support of Anganwadi Workers from 3rd month of birth onwards to ensure exclusive and continued breast feeding, adequate complementary feeding, age appropriate immunization and early childhood development. A total of 517 districts are now implementing HBYC Programme and more than 29.5 lakh young children (age of 3 months-15 months) have been visited by ASHAs during April- September, 2020 (iii) Facility Based Newborn Care (FBNC): This is being scaled up for care of small or sick newborns. 894 Special Newborn Care Units (SNCUs) have been set up in district hospitals and medical colleges to provide round-the-clock services to sick newborns. SNCU Online Reporting System has been established and more than 90% facilities are reporting online. 2,579 Newborn Stabilization Units (NBSUs) at the level of FRUs/ CHC level and 20,337 Newborn Care Corners (NBCCs) at delivery points have been operationalized in the continuum of care. During FY 2020-21 (April-December, 2020), more than 7.64 lakh sick and small newborn received treatment and nearly 80% successfully discharged. State wise details of newborn facilities are available at Table-1.4.4 (iv) Newer interventions : Few new interventions are being looked into to reduce newborn mortality have also been implemented, including Vitamin-K injection at birth, Antenatal corticosteroids in preterm labour, KMC and empowering ANMs to provide Injection Gentamycin to young infants for possible serious bacterial infections. (v) Stillbirth surveillance: This was rolled out in 2017 and guidelines for the same have been released. (vi) Social Awareness and Actions to Neutralise Pneumonia Successfully (SAANS):SAANS Initiative was launched on 16.11.2019 to accelerate action to reduce deaths due to Childhood Pneumonia. SAANS campaign rolled-out in the States/ UTs from 12.11.2020 to 28.02.2021 with the aim of accelerating action against Childhood Pneumonia by generating awareness around protect, prevent and treatment aspects of Childhood Pneumonia and to enhance early identification and care seeking behaviours among parents and caregivers.55 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Table-1.4.2.2: Status of Facility Based Newborn Care in India S.

Development delays affect at least 10% children and these delays, if not intercepted timely, may lead to permanent disabilities. Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) provides child health screening and early interventions services by expanding the reach of mobile health teams at Block level. These teams also carry out screening of all the children in the age group 0-6 years enrolled at Anganwadi Centres twice a year. RBSK covers 30 common health conditions. The States/UTs may incorporate a few more conditions based on high prevalence/endemicity. Estimated 32.8 Crore children in the age group of 0-18 years are expected to be covered in a phased manner. The strategic interventions to address birth defects, diseases, delays and deficiencies are: Screening of children under RBSK -Child health screening and early intervention services are provided with an aim to improve the overall quality of life of children through early detection of birth defects, diseases, deficiencies, development delays (4 Ds) and reduce out of pocket expenditure for the families. Dedicated mobile medical health teams (for screening purpose) at Block level, comprising of four health personnel viz. two AYUSH doctors (One Male, One Female), ANM/Staff Nurse and a Pharmacist. Under this intervention, during FY 2019-20, 20.3 Crore children were screened; 1.61 Crore children identified with any of 4Ds; were referred to secondary/tertiary facilities; 88.0 children availed services in secondary tertiary facilities. During 2020-21, due to COVID 19 pandemic field activities by Mobile Health Teams of RBSK Program got affected. Establishment of District Early Intervention Centres (DEICs) - DEICs are to be made operational in the Districts of the country for providing management of cases referred from the Blocks and link these children with tertiary level health services in case surgical management is required. 238 DEICs have been functional as on date. Establishment of Birth Defects Surveillance System (BDSS)-BDSSs areto serve as a tool for identifying congenital anomalies. It is as a collaborative effort between MoHFW , WHO and CDC. It is envisaged to establish at least one surveillance centre in each State / UT, preferably in medical college. Currently, 55 medical colleges are a part of the birth defects surveillance. Early Childhood Development (ECD) - (ECD) is a continuum of care process that begins with planning for pregnancy and must continue for at least the first two years of a child's life. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare earlier published a user-friendly resource on Journey of the First One Thousand Days for communication with pregnant women and care givers with information. 57 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 To make this information available for within the every family and caregiver, the Maternal and Child Protection (MCP) card which targets every pregnant woman and the child till the age of first 2 years of age has been revised to include information in an age appropriate pictorial description. The card now specifically included information on what the child does by a specific age, what the parents should do to stimulate the child and engage with the child and red flag signs in child development as guidance when to seek help. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has introduced a mobile app \" Ayushman Bhava\" in Hindi based on the same information of the MCP card for wider use. Focus Area 2: Child Health Nutrition Malnutrition is considered to be the underlying cause of 45% of child deaths 35.8% of Under-5 children are underweight, 38.4% are stunted and 21.0% are wasted. More importantly, 7.4% children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM), as per the latest available national health survey (NFHS 4, 2015-16) Only 41.6% newborns are initiated on breastfeed within one hour of birth while, 54.9% children are breastfed exclusively till 6 months of age. Complementary feeding was started for only 42.7% children on time (more than 6 months of age) (NFHS 4, 2015-16) As per available survey data (NFHS-4, 2015-16), only 50.6% children with diarrhoea episode in preceding 2 weeks received oral rehydration solution (ORS) and only 20% received Zinc during diarrhoea 58.6% of children in the age group 6 months to 59 months are anaemic (NFHS 4, 2015-16) Coverage of Vitamin-A has improved from in 2005-06 to 60.2% in 2015-16 as per NFHS data Strategic Interventions to tackle Child Health Nutrition A. Nutrition Rehabilitation Centres: 1077 NRCs have been set up at facility level to provide medical and nutritional care to SAM children who are Under-5 years of age with medical complications. In addition, the mothers are also imparted skills on child care and feeding practices so that the child continues to receive adequate care at home. In FY 2020-21 (January to September 2020), 75,177 sick SAM children received treatment at 1077 NRCs B. National Deworming Day (NDD): National Deworming Day (NDD) has observed bi-annually every year in the month of February and August with an aim to reduce the load of intestinal worms and related morbidity in the country. Under this programme all children and adolescents from 1-19 years of age are given deworming tablet through the platform of schools and anganwadi centres. The 10 th round of NDD was conducted in 25 States and UTs in February, 2020. 11.02 crore children and adolescents in the age group of 1-19 years had been provided Albendazole tablets against the target of 11.66 crore children and adolescents The 11 th round of NDD was conducted during August-October, 2020 in 33 States/UTs. 25.63 crore children and adolescents in the age group of 1-19 years were covered with deworming drug against the target of 28.82 crore children and adolescents. Since February 2016, a total of 221 crore doses of Albendazole tablets were administered under the programme. Last three years achievement under the programme is as under:58 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 NDD roundTarget (in crore) Fortnight (IDCF) Campaign: To increase awareness about use of ORS and Zinc in diarrhoea- an Intensified Diarrhoea Control Fortnight (IDCF) is being observed during monsoon season, with the ultimate aim of 'zero child deaths due to childhood diarrhoea' . During the fortnight, health workers visit the households of Under-5 children, conduct community level awareness generation activities and distribute ORS packets to the families with children Under-5 years of age. This year a diarrhoea prevention and management activities were are being conducted across in the States/UTs following COVID-19 protocols. The data compilation for the and 7.07 (77.5%)crore families with under five children received ORS packets at home out of targeted 9.12 crores. IDCF/Diarrhoea prevention activities for the 2020 round is in process. The State of Uttar not conducted the house to house activity, whereas UT of Ladakh is yet to share the report. D. Mukt Bharat (AMB) programme: In 2018, Anaemia Mukt Bharat strategy was launched to achieve the envisaged target of 3% reduction in anaemia prevalence every year under the POSHAN Abhiyaan. The strategy recommends 6x6x6 strategy to reduce anaemia prevalence (nutritional and non-nutritional) in six age groups namely pre-school children (6-59 months), children (5-9 years), adolescents girls and boys (10-19 years), pregnant and lactating women and in women of reproductive age group (15-49 years) in programme mode through life cycle approach. Achievements under IFA supplementation during 2020-21 (April - November 2020) 1.26 crore children of age group 6-59 months provided 8-10 doses of IFA syrup every month 67.8 lakh children of age group 5-9 years provided 4-5 IFA pink tablets every month 81.9 lakh children of age group 10-19 years (in school) provided 4-5 IFA blue tablets every month 20.6 lakh children of age group 10-19 years (out-of-school girls) provided 4-5 IFA blue tablets every month 1.54 crore pregnant women and 49.7 lakh lactating women were provided 180 IFA red tablets respectively The six interventions under Anaemia Mukt Bharat strategy are prophylactic iron folic acid supplementation, periodic deworming, intensified year-round behaviour change communication campaign including delayed cord clamping, testing and treatment of anaemia using digital methods and point of care treatment, mandatory provision of iron folic acid fortified foods in public health programmes and addressing non-nutritional causes of anaemia in endemic pockets, with special focus on malaria, haemoglobinopathies and fluorosis. The six institutional mechanisms are inter-ministerial coordination, national Anemia Mukt Bharat unit, national centre 59 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 of excellence and advanced research on anaemia control, convergence with other ministries, strengthening supply chain and logistics, Anaemia Mukt Bharat dashboard and digital portal - one-stop shop for anaemia. To address anaemia in children, bi-weekly IFA supplements are provided to children aged 6-59 months through ASHAs and Weekly IFA supplements to children of 5-10 years and adolescents 10-19 years of age. 180 doses of IFA supplements are also being provided to pregnant and lactating women during ANC and PNC period, respectively. Bi-annual Vitamin-A Supplementation is being done for all children below five years of age. E. Mothers Absolute Affection (MAA) programme : MAA programme focuses on promotion of optimum Infant and Y oung Child Feeding (IYCF) practices including early initiation of breastfeeding within one hour, exclusive breastfeeding up to six months, continuation of breastfeeding for two years and beyond and age appropriate and adequate complementary feeding after six months through capacity building of frontline health workers and comprehensive IEC campaigns. As per NFHS-4, 2015-16 data only 41.6% newborns initiated on breastfeed within one hour of birth while, 54.9% children breastfed exclusively till 6 months of age. The findings of latest NFHS-5 conducted in 22 States/UT released in December, 2020 reveals that the percentage of children under age 3 years breastfed within one hour of birth has improved in 10 States/UTs, however it has reduced in 12 States/UTs. The percentage of children under age 6 months exclusively breastfed has improved in 16 States/UTs and reduced in 6 States/UTsF. Bi-annual Vitamin-A Supplementation: Under Vitamin-A supplementation programme, all children below five years of age are given Vitamin-A supplementation. The findings of latest NFHS-5 conducted in 22 States/UT released in December, 2020 reveals that the percentage of children received Vitamin-A dose in last 6 months has improved in 19 States/UTs G. Lactation Management Centres (LMCs): When direct breastfeeding is not possible, the options include expressing the mother's own milk, procuring donor human milk and preparing formula feed. Feeding with human breast milk provides optimum nutrition, infection prevention, improves neuro-developmental growth, reduced hospital stay and economic benefits whereas feeding formula milk is associated with high risk of sepsis and NEC. Lactation Management Centre ensures availability of safe pasteurised donor human milk and expressed mother's own breast milk suitable for feeding sick, preterm and low birth weight babies. The MoHFW under NHM has initiated establishment of lactation management centres in public health facilities at three levels: i) CLMC (Medical Colleges/high load DHs), ii) Lactation Management Unit (DHs/SDHs) and iii) Lactation support Unit (Delivery points) for ensuring human milk for sick, preterm and low birth weight babies admitted in intensive care units such as NICU and SNCUs. CLMC provide all facilities to ensure that donor human milk is expressed, collected, processed and dispensed free of cost for feeding of the baby following the most appropriate technology and standard protocol. All these standard protocols and safety measures for these processes are elaborated in the \"National Guidelines on Lactation Management Centres in Public Health Facilities\" published by MoHFW . As of FY 2020-2021 (upto September, 2020), 15 CLMCs and 2 LMUs are established in 7 States. 60 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 As of FY 2020-2021 (upto June, 2020), 15 Medical Colleges/high load District Hospitals and 2 Lactation Management Centres are established in seven States. 1.4.4 UNIVERSAL IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMME (UIP) Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) in India is one of the largest public health programmes in the world. It targets around 2.9 crore pregnant women and 2.67 crore newborn annually. More than 1.2 crore immunization sessions are conducted annually. It is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions and largely responsible for reduction of vaccine preventable Under-5 mortality rate. Launched in 1978 as an expanded programme on immunization, it got its present name of Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) in 1985 when its reach was expanded beyond urban areas. It became a part of Child Survival and Safe Motherhood Programme in 1992 and came under the ambit of National Reproductive and Child Health Programme in 1997. UIP is an integral part of National Rural Health Mission since its launch in 2005. Under UIP , the Government of India is providing vaccination free of cost against twelve vaccine preventable diseases, of which: i) Ten are provided across the country against Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Polio, Measles, Rubella, severe form of Childhood Tuberculosis, Rotavirus diarrhea, Hepatitis-B and Meningitis & Pneumonia caused by H. Influenza Type-B ii) Two are provided in selected States or endemic districts against, Pneumococcal Pneumonia and Japanese Encephalitis (JE); of which Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine is in the process of expansion while JE vaccine is provided only in endemic districtsA child needs seven contacts till the age of five years to complete immunization under UIP . The detailed immunization schedule age-wise as well as vaccine-wise is given at Tables below (1.4.3.1 & 1.4.3.2). A child is said to be fully immunized if he/ she receives all due vaccines as per national immunization schedule within 1 st year of the age of the child. There are three main systems to measure full immunization coverage: i) Online web-based Health Management Information System (HMIS) portal wherein administrative coverage is reported through health facilities across the country. As per HMIS data for FY 2019-20, the full immunization coverage of the country stands at 92.8%. ii) Periodic surveys like NFHS, DLHS, Rapid Survey on Children (RSOC), Integrated Child Health and Immunization Survey (INCHIS) etc. As per the latest available survey (NFHS-4) the full immunization coverage in the country stands at 62%. iii) Concurrent monitoring of the Universal Immunization Programme is conducted through session as well as community monitoring. The trends in Full Immunization coverage (FIC) over the past years61 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Importance of Storing Vaccines A system of cold chain equipment is utilised to store vaccines and deliver immunization services from fixed centres or outreach sessions utilising the following infrastructure: Sub-centres: Around 1.5 lakh Cold Chain Points: Around 30,000 vaccine storage points in hospitals, CHCs, PHCs and other health facilities ILRs & Deep Freezers: Around 84,000 pieces of equipment to store vaccines District Vaccine Stores : Around 736 WIC & WIF: 264 cold and freezer rooms to store vaccines at bulk storage locations 1.4 4.1 Routine Immunization Coverage and Strengthening A. Mission Indradhanush: To increase the rate of increase of FIC to ensure no child is left without the benefit of vaccines, GoI launched Mission Indradhanush in December 2014 with the aim of increasing FIC to at least 90%. Mission Indradhanush is a targeted approach focused to reach all left out and dropped out children in pockets of low immunization coverage (like hard-to-reach areas, vacant sub-centres, areas with recent outbreaks of VPDs, resistance pockets etc.) It has completed seven phases (from April 2015 to March 2020) covering 690 districts wherein 3.76 crore children were reached and 94.6 lakh pregnant females immunized. As per the report of Integrated Child Health and Immunization Survey (INCHIS), the first two phases of Mission Indradhanush led to an increase of 6.7% in FIC in one year as compared to 1% increase/year in the past. This increase was more in rural areas (7.9%) as compared to urban areas (3.1%), thus, shifting the focus of the programme towards urban areas.B. Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) During a review of Mission Indradhanush in Pro- Active Governance and Timely Implementation (PRAGATI) meeting on 26.04.2017, directions were received to achieve the goal/target. Accordingly, MoHWF identified 121 districts, 17 urban areas and 52 districts of NE States (total 190 districts/urban areas across 24 States) where Intensified Mission Indradhanush was conducted. It was launched by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India on 8.10.2017 at Vadnagar, Gujarat. The activity was monitored closely by the Prime Minister and Cabinet Secretary. Intensified Mission Indradhanush involved preparation, implementation and integration of IMI sessions into RI micro-plans. The focus was on urban slums and districts with slowest progress, completion of due-list of beneficiaries on the basis of head-count surveys and convergence with other Ministries/ Departments with defined roles. Intensified Mission Indradhanush 2.0 The UIP has been further strengthened through IMI 2.0 to reach the unreached and partially vaccinated children in 381 districts across 29 States/ UTs. Four rounds of IMI 2.0 have already been conducted from December 2019 and March 2020, wherein 37.09 lakh children and 7.41 lakh pregnant women were vaccinated. A vibrant IEC strategy was developed by involving the Bureau of Communication (BoC) and utilising the platform of MyGov. C. Birth Dose Vaccination Protocol: Birth dose vaccination is an integral part of UIP . It is provided against the three VPDs of Hepatitis-B, Poliomyelitis and Childhood TB. Birth dose vaccination protocol for the same was developed and shared with the States/UTs for ensuring that no institutional delivered newborn gets left without the birth dose62 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 D. Recent Vaccines: A total of six new vaccines have been introduced. Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccine: In September 2019, the WHO, South-East Asia Region (SEAR) resolved to eliminate Measles and Rubella by 2023. India is committed to the goal of Measles and Rubella elimination as stated in the National Strategic Plan for Achieving and Sustaining Measles and Rubella Elimination in India. In 1985, India introduced the first dose of measles containing vaccine (MCV1) in the routine immunization (RI) programme and introduced a second dose of measles containing vaccine (MCV2) into the routine programme schedule in 2010. The Rubella containing vaccine was introduced as MRCV1 and MRCV2 in 2017. To accelerate efforts towards measles and rubella elimination, India launched a massive nation-wide MR vaccination campaign beginning in February 2017. Till date, the MR campaign has been completed in children have been vaccinated against the target of 33.07 crore with a coverage of 98%. Pneumococcal Vaccine (PCV): PCV was launched in May, 2017 for reducing Infant mortality and morbidity caused by Pneumococcal Pneumonia. The vaccine has been introduced September 2020, around 373.01 lakh doses of PCV have been administered to children in the areas mentioned above, since introduction. Rotavirus Vaccine (RVV): RVV has been introduced to reduce mortality and morbidity caused by Rotavirus diarrhoea. Till 2018, RVV was plan, all remaining 25 States/UTs have introduced RVV , thus it is available across the entire country. Currently, around 12.48 crore doses have been administered to children till September 2020. Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV): There are three types of Polio viruses namely Type-1, 2 and 3 for which the vaccine was provided under the UIP as trivalent oral Polio vaccine. Since the last case of wild Polio virus Type-2 was reported in 1999, therefore, Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) recommended to switch from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV (containing only type-1 & 3). The tOPV to bOPV switch happened in India on 25 thApril, 2016. As part of the Global Polio end-game strategy, to mitigate the risk associated with tOPV to bOPV switch, MoHFW introduced the Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) in UIP in November, 2015, which was expanded across the country by June, 2016. Currently, a two dose fractional schedule is being followed in the country with vaccination at 6 weeks and 14 weeks 63 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 of age. Till September 2020, around 15.11 crore doses of IPV were administered to children across the country since its introduction. Japanese Encephalitis (JE) Vaccine: The JE vaccination under UIP was introduced in India in 2006. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) carries out Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) surveillance including assessment of the JE burden. Based on this surveillance they identify endemic districts and communicate the same to the immunization division to plan JE vaccination in these districts. In the newly identified districts, one-time JE vaccination campaign is carried out in children aged 1-15 years to immunize the susceptible cohort. Subsequent to completion of the campaign, the JE vaccine is introduced in the UIP as two doses provided at 9-12 months and 16-24 months. A total of 336 JE endemic districts were identified, of which the JE vaccination campaign has been completed in 276 districts and around 15.8 crore children vaccinated. Adult JE vaccination administered satisfactorily. Endemic districts are also identified by NVBDCP where high numbers of JE cases are reported in people aged 15-65 years. In these districts, a one-time campaign for JE vaccination is carried out in adults to knock out the susceptible cohort. As many as 38 high burden districts were identified in three States for the Adult JE vaccination in endemic blocks in Assam, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal. The Adult JE vaccination campaign has been completed in 35 districts wherein more than 3.5 crore beneficiaries aged 15-65 years have been vaccinated. Tetanus & Adult Diphtheria (Td) Vaccine: Increase in immunization coverage in children led to a shift in the age-group of diphtheria cases to school going children and adults. Subsequently, Tetanus and Adult Diphtheria (Td) vaccine was recommended by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) in 2016. Thereafter, Td vaccine has replaced 2 doses of TT or single booster dose of TT given to pregnant woman and booster doses at 10 and 16 years of age. 1.4.4.2 New Initiatives in Vaccine Logistics & Cold Chain Management A. Capacity building: National Cold Chain Resource Centre (NCCRC), Pune and National Cold Chain &V accine Management Resource Centre (NCCVMRC), New Delhi were established to provide technical training to cold chain technicians in the field of repair and maintenance of cold chain equipment. These centres also impart training to programme managers on the immunization supply chain system, capacity building and supportive supervision along with conducting various studies to evaluate the system which paves the way for corrective measures. B. System strengthening: Two significant initiatives have been covered as part of system strengthening. Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN) rollout: The GoI rolled out an Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN) system that digitises the entire vaccine stock management along with logistics and temperature tracking vaccine storage from national to the Sub-district levels. This enables programme managers to have a real- time view of the vaccine stock position and its 64 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 storage temperature across all cold chain points providing a detailed overview of the vaccine cold chain logistics system across the entire country. The eVIN system has been rolled out across 717 districts in 32 States & UTs Haveli. At present, 28,122 cold chain points across 717 districts in the country routinely use eVIN technology for efficient vaccine logistics management. Over 47,254 vaccine cold chain handlers have been introduced to digitise record-keeping by training them on eVIN. Nearly 24,003 temperature loggers have been installed on vaccine cold chain equipment for accurate temperature review of vaccines in storage National Cold Chain Management Information System (NCCMIS): The NCCMIS helps track the cold chain equipment availability, functional status, inventory and critical cold chain indicators. To augment the cold chain space and strengthen the cold chain system in the country 11,010 Cold Boxes (Small), 13,609 Cold Boxes (Large), 2,70,230 Vaccine Carriers and 10,94,650 Ice Packs have been supplied to all States and UTs. 1.4.4.3 Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) System AEFI surveillance programme of the Immunization Division was assessed by WHO as part of the Indian National Regulatory Authority (NRA) Assessment in 2017. The pharmaco-vigilance function of NRA which includes vaccine safety and AEFI surveillance received the maximum possible maturity level rating of 4. National Quality Assurance Standards for AEFI Surveillance Programme is currently being expanded to 13 States in the country. Budgetary norms for specific QMS activities at State, District and PHC/ session site levels have been approved by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. Criteria for conducting internal, peer and external assessments at PHC/session site, District and State levels have been developed. National level SOPs have been updated and SOP templates at State, District and PHC/session site levels have been developed. To help in upscaling to States and Districts, QMS training packages at PHC/session site, District and state levels have been developed. State level training on QMS implementation for Karnataka and two Districts has been held. Surveillance and Action for Events following Vaccination (SAFE-V AC), the online reporting software for reporting of severe and serious AEFI cases has been implemented across the country since 01.01.2020 During FY 2019-20, 2661 serious/severe AEFIs were reported and till 30 September 2020, 766 serious/severe AEFI cases were reported As on 30.09.2020, 76 State AEFI committee meetings were held by 28 States in FY 2019-20 and 20 meetings have been held by 13 States in FY 2020-21 65 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 As on 30.09.2020 , the National AEFI Committee has approved the causality assessments of 5140 cases reported between 2012 and 2020 Update as on 30.08.2020 During FY 2019-20, 2661 serious/severe AEFIs were 30.08.2020, in present year, 766 serious/severe AEFI cases reported. As of 30.08.2020, 76 State AEFI committee meetings held in 28 States in FY 2019-20 while 20 meetings held in 13 States in FY 2020-21. As of 30.08.2020, the National AEFI Committee approved causality assessments of 5,140 cases reported between 2012 and 2020. To reduce the chances of dispensing error and to improve acceptability, guidelines on use of syrup Paracetamol to manage fever following immunization has been approved and issued to the States/UTs. The States and UTs are now procuring and dispensing syrup Paracetamol to children at the immunization session sites To reduce mortality and morbidity due to anaphylaxis following vaccination, a policy has been approved wherein field Health worker/ ANM is authorized to use a single, age-appropriate dose of Inj. Adrenaline for management of suspected Anaphylaxis States/UTs are being ranked based on performance of key AEFI surveillance process indicators. These are shared with the States/UTs every quarter with specific actionable points for improvement. This has led to improved AEFI surveillance processes in States/UTs owing to healthy competition \"Revision of national AEFI guidelines is underway. Thirteen of fourteen chapters are ready and approved by the Core Group of experts. The revised guidelines are expected to be approved shortly A training on conducting literature search and synthesis on vaccine safety was held in December 2019 in collaboration with WHO for participants from AEFI Secretariat, Central Drug Standard Control Organisation(CDSCO), Pharmacovigilance Programme of India (PvPI) and WHO 1.4.4.4 Awareness Generation and Social Mobilisation for Routine Immunization and New Vaccines To boost demand generation for immunization services and address vaccine hesitancy, dedicated Information Education Communication (IEC) strategies and packages have been developed under UIP . Key IEC packages for routine immunization include- '5 Saal 7 Baar Initiative' to provide information on vaccination schedule, importance of MCP cards, AEFI Risk Communication Framework to create awareness about risks if a child is not vaccinated, importance of vaccination and create vaccine confidence Routine Immunization FAQs to provide comprehensive information about immunization and dispelling myths related to it BRIDGE (Boosting Routine Immunization Demand Generation and Expansion) trainings for frontline workers to enhance inter-personal communication skills66 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 IEC packages for new vaccines including development of poster, banners, leaflets, audio-visual spots, social media creatives (Twitter handle @Vaccinate4Life and Facebook page Vaccinate4Life) pertaining to specific vaccine 1.4.5 PULSE POLIO IMMUNIZATION (PPI) With the global initiative of eradication of Polio following World Health Assembly resolution in 1988, Pulse Polio Immunization programme was launched in India in 1995. Children in the age group of 0-5 years were administered Polio drops during National and Sub-national immunization rounds (in high-risk areas) every year. There are 24 lakh vaccinators and 1.5 lakh supervisors involved in successful implementation of the Pulse Polio Programme across the country. About 167 million children are immunized across the country during each National Immunization Day (NID) and 75 million in SNIDs. A. Progress On 24 th February, 2012, WHO removed India from the list of countries with active endemic wild polio virus transmission after reporting of the last case of poliovirus in the country in January, 2011. Subsequently, on 27 th March, 2014, India along with 10 other countries of South-East Asia Region was declared Polio-free by the Regional Certification Commission (RCC) of WHO. The issued certificate stated that \"The Commission concludes, from the evidence provided by the National Certificate Committees of the 11 Member States, that the transmission of indigenous wild Polio virus has been interrupted in all countries of the Region\" . India has maintained Polio-free status as no wild polio virus case has been reported for more than 8 years after the last case reported on 13.01.2011. Last Reported Polio Case Polio Virus TypeDate of last cases and number of affected Districts during past 15 years is as below: Ye ar Cases of Polio Number of Districts 2006 676 114 2007 874 99 2008 559 90 2009 741 56 2010 42 17 2011 01 01 2012 00 00 2013 00 00 2014 00 00 2015 00 00 2016 00 00 2017 00 00 2018 00 00 2019 00 00 2020 00 00 Data as on: 10th November 2020 B. Steps to maintain Polio free status To maintain the Polio free status, the country is implementing the following strategies: Maintaining community immunity through high quality of National and Sub National Polio rounds each year, apart from routine immunization.67 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Hon'ble President of India giving Oral Polio Vaccine drops to an infant on 18.01.2020 Polio vaccination is provided to all eligible children round the clock through more than 100 special booths set up at international borders (both Rail and Road routes) those shares with India i.e. Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar. In these border posts, more than 1.47 crore children were vaccinated as on 31.10.2020 Travel advisory has been issued for Polio vaccination of international travellers travelling between India and 8 other countries i.e. Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Syria and Cameroon. Till October 2020, nearly 3 lakh travelers have been vaccinated with OPV An Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (EPRP) have been put in place under which Rapid Response Teams (RRT) are set up in every State/UTs for timely action in case of any occurrence of a Polio case in the country As a part of Polio Endgame Strategy, India has introduced Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) across the country to provide double protection against Polio Strengthening Acute Flaccid Surveillance (AFP) across the country and supplementary surveillance in the form of Environmental Surveillance in Assam (Guwahati), 2020-2021CHAPTER Varanasi,) and West Bengal (24 South Paraganas and Kolkata) which acts as surrogate indicator for Polio virus transmission The lessons learnt from the Polio programme are being implemented for strengthening of routine immunization by carrying out Immunization weeks and also the same learnings are being used for implementing \"Mission Indradhanush\" and recently Intensified Mission Indradhanush - a drive toward 90% full immunization coverage of India C. Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) Surveillance Currently, the following surveillance systems are present in India for VPD surveillance: 1) AFP (Acute Flaccid Paralysis) Surveillance: AFP (Acute Flaccid Paralysis) surveillance is the gold standard for detecting cases of Poliomyelitis. This is done to identify all reservoirs of wild Poliovirus and vaccine derived Polio virus transmission. This includes reporting of all AFP cases, investigating them and laboratory testing of all stool specimens collected from such cases for Polio viruses in specialized laboratories. Nearly 40,000 health facilities report children with AFP to the surveillance system. In 2019, 40422 AFP cases were reported and in 2020 (till 4 th November 2020), 15,722 AFP cases were reported in the country There are 8 WHO accredited laboratories in India for primary isolation of Polio virus (wild Polio virus and vaccine derived Polio virus), followed by Intratypic Differentiation (ITD) of isolates from AFP cases, if indicated These laboratories are: BJMC Ahmedabad, NIV Bengaluru, NIV Mumbai, Kasauli, KIPM Chennai, and SGPGI Lucknow. Besides the eight laboratories, there are two laboratories PMC Patna and IPM Hyderabad which do the concentration of sewage samples collected for environmental surveillance The COVID-19 pandemic has affected AFP surveillance performance across the country. As of week 44 of 2020, AFP rate for country is 4.2 (still above the global recommended level of 2 cases per 100 000 under 15 population). In 2019, AFP rate was 9.1 per 100 000 under 15 population. Stool adequacy rate (% AFP cases with 2 stool specimens within 14 days) in 2019 was 87% in 2019 while it is 82% in 2020 (data till 4 th November, 2020) MoHFW has sent detailed guidelines to all the States/UTs on how to conduct VPD surveillance (AFP , MR and DPT) activities during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic To supplement AFP surveillance, environmental surveillance is established at 56 sites spread over in 11 States 2) Measles-Rubella (MR) Surveillance: India is making significant progress towards the goal of Measles and Rubella elimination. Key strategies for achieving elimination are described in the National Strategic Plan for Achieving and Sustaining Measles and Rubella Elimination in India and include: achieving and sustaining 95% coverage with two doses of Measles and Rubella containing vaccine (MRCV) establishing a sensitive and timely MR surveillance system maintaining an accredited MR laboratory network69 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 ensuring adequate outbreak preparedness and responding rapidly to measles and rubella outbreaks strengthening support and linkages to achieve the above strategies MR surveillance started in India as laboratory supported outbreak-based surveillance in 2005, and was expanded to all States by 2015 in a phased manner. In 2016, India began transitioning from MR outbreak-based surveillance to WHO laboratory supported MR case-based surveillance starting with the state of Karnataka and expanding to all States by 2019. A pilot of fever and rash (FR) surveillance, with a broadened case definition, started in Karnataka in 2018 and expanded to two additional States, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha, in 2019. A sensitive case-based surveillance system is essential to monitor progress towards the elimination of Measles and Rubella. The objective of MR case-based surveillance is to detect, investigate, and classify all suspected cases and to respond to confirmed outbreaks. This will help in timely detection of even low levels of MR transmission, and will also help to ensure timely implementation of key response measures, such as active case searches and administration of Vitamin-A, to reduce morbidity and mortality. In addition, MR surveillance data generated on State specific epidemiology will guide future immunization strategies across the country including planning for supplementary immunization activities. There are > 47,000 reporting sites across the country in the reporting network, which includes private sector, non-formal sector, and temples in addition to government health facilities. The Measles Rubella Lab Network (MRLN) is comprised of 19 WHO accredited laboratories. Annual accreditation of labs in the network is done by WHO to ensure quality results.Summary of Measles & Rubella outbreaks in the country: Ye ar Measles outbreakRubella outbreaksMixed outbreaks 2016 803 294 76 2017 787 141 21 2018 952 120 24 2019 280 95 16 Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) surveillance is being conducted by ICMR 3) Laboratory supported surveillance for diphtheria, pertussis and neonatal tetanus (DPT) WHO-NPSP has established a case- based laboratory supported DPT surveillance system based on the operational knowledge acquired from AFP surveillance system in country which would be in collaboration with other surveillance systems like Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) and Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBHI) DPT surveillance started from three States (Haryana, Kerala and Bihar) in 2015 and has been rolled out in 14 more States/UTs, namely Chhattisgarh, Dadra and Nagar are approximately 78% of India's population. Five more States namely Mizoram, Nagaland, Puducherry, Sikkim and West Bengal have completed their VPD surveillance State workshop and will initiate reporting by December 2020. DPT surveillance is in the process of expansion to remaining other States by FY 2020-2170 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 WHO-NPSP has established a national reference laboratory for standardization of laboratory procedures and quality assurance, identification and strengthening of laboratories across the nation for diagnosis of Diphtheria and Pertussis For this purpose, CMC Vellore has been designated as reference laboratory for VPD surveillance. In addition, 7 network laboratories have been established. These are BMC Bangalore, Choithram Integration of WHO and IDSP surveillance system is being undertaken for the following:- Information of cases is shared on weekly basis Lab reports are also shared Joint VPD outbreak investigations by WHO and IDSP Preparation of joint outbreak report for VPDs to be shared with both the systems 1.4.5.1 Sustaining Routine Immunization during COVID-19 pandemic A. To sustain Routine immunization, conduct Sub-national immunization days for Polio and surveillance for Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic, special efforts have been made viz. clear strategy & guidelines have been developed and widely disseminated to States/ UTs B. Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN) system, that digitizes the entire vaccine stock management, their logistics and temperature tracking at all levels of vaccine storage - from national to the Sub- District, was functional in 24 States/UTs by FY 2019-20 while in FY 2020-21 eVIN has been expanded to the rest of the States/UTs to cover the entire country.

Over the decades the program has evolved to the current holistic and target free approach. The National Population Policy 2000 redefined the program as a medium of intervention for promoting reproductive and child health. The Family Planning program focuses on assuring complete knowledge and access to reproductive rights and services and enables women and men to make individual reproductive choices. The objectives, strategies and activities of the Family Planning Programme have been meticulously designed in line with the goals and objectives of various policies (National Population Policy 2000, National Health Policy 2002 and National Health Policy 2017) and compliments India's commitment at International Forums (viz. International Conference on Population and Development-ICPD, Sustainable Development Goals-SDG, FP2020 and others). 1.5.2 Factors that influence Population Growth Population growth is influenced by both socio- demographic as well as FP indicators: Table No. 1.5.1: Factors that influence population growth S.

Technological advances, improved quality and coverage for health care have resulted in a fall in the total fertility rate and growth rate (2011 Census showed the steepest decline in the decadal growth rate). Population increase and growth rate 1.5.3 Current Family Planning Efforts: Services under the National Family Welfare Programme Currently, the FP methods in India can be broadly classified into the categories of Spacing Methods, Limiting/Permanent Methods and Emergency Contraceptive Pills. Spacing Methods : These are reversible methods which can be adopted and discontinued as per an individual's choice Oral contraceptive pills (Combined oral contraceptive pill (Mala N), Centchroman (Chhaya) Condoms Intrauterine Contraceptive Devices (IUCD 380A - effective for 10 years, IUCD 375- effective for 5 years); and Contraceptive Injectable MPA (Antara Programme)76 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Permanent Methods : These methods are irreversible in nature. Female Sterilisation includes Minilap and Laparoscopic; and Male Sterilisation includes conventional and non-scalpel vasectomy (no incision no stitches). Other Commodities like Pregnancy testing kits Help detect pregnancy as early as one week after the missed period, thus proving an early opportunity for medical termination of pregnancy, thus saving lives lost to unsafe abortions; and These are available at the sub-centre level and also carried by ASHA. Service Delivery Points: All the spacing methods, viz. IUCDs, Injectables, OCPs and condoms are available at the public health facilities beginning from the sub-centre level. Additionally, OCPs, condoms, and emergency contraceptive pills are available at the village level also through trained ASHAs 2017-18 Programme (Source: HMIS) Permanent methods are generally available at primary health centre level or above. They are provided by MBBS doctors who have been trained to provide these services These services are provided to around 20 crores eligible couples 1.5.4 Key Strategies under Family Planning and Achievements 1.5.4.1 Introduction of new contraceptive choices In FY 2019-20, 19.53 lakh doses of Injectable MPA had been administered and 34.50 lakh Centchroman tablets had been distributed all over the country.

On the advice of the Planning Commission (Now NITI Aayog) and Ministry of Finance, a study was conducted by UNFPA to evaluate the Social Marketing Scheme which submitted the report in December, 2015. The recommendations of UNFPA were examined in the Ministry and the Social Marketing Programme was rejuvenated. The price of the SMO brand contraceptives i.e. Deluxe Nirodh (Government brand) was revised from Rs. 3.00 a pack of 5 pieces to Rs. 5.00 a pack of 5 pieces and SMO brand condoms from Rs. 2.00 a piece to a maximum of Rs. 3.33 a piece (Rs. 10.00 for a pack of 3 pieces). The price of the oral pills of the Government brand and Social Marketing Organisations (SMO) brand were also revised i.e. Mala -D (Government brand) from Rs.3.00 per cycle to Rs. 5.00 per cycle while the SMO brand price range was retained at a maximum price of Rs. 10.00 per cycle. SMOs have the flexibility to fix the price of branded condoms and OCPs within the range fixed by the Government. Condoms and Oral Pills are made available to people at highly subsidised rates, through diverse outlets. Promotional and packaging incentives which were being reimbursed to the SMOs were withdrawn after revision of prices of condoms and OCPs. The issue price of both were retained at Rs.0.40 per condom and Rs.1.60 per cycle of 83 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 OCPs respectively, which can be remitted by the SMOs by paying 35% while placing orders and balance 65% while issuing release orders to reduce financial burden on SMOs. The agreements with the SMOs are now signed for a period of three years to facilitate SMOs to plan their activities for a longer period. The extent of subsidy ranges from 70% to 85% depending upon the procurement price in a given year. Both these contraceptives are distributed through SMOs. Presently six SMOs Government brand (Deluxe Nirodh) and different SMOs brands of condoms (i.e. Rakshak, Kamagni, Sawan, Milan, Bliss, Ahsaas and Zaroor) are sold in the market. Similarly for Oral Pills, one Government brand (Mala-D) and different SMOs brands of pills (i.e. Ecroz, Apsara and Smartt Cycle) are sold. SMOs have sold the following quantities during 2019-20 and 2020-21: Sale of Condoms (Quantity in million pieces) ProvisionalSale PCPL, Kolkata - - Total 147.10 16.17 * Figures are Provisional 1.5.5.12 Centchroman (Oral Pills) Since December 1995, a non-steroidal weekly OCP , Centchroman (Popularly known as Saheli), to prevent pregnancy is also being subsidised under the Social Marketing Programme.

India accounts for 2.4% of the world's surface area yet it supports more than 17.5% of the world's population. A look at the census figures of the last four decades indicates a perceptible decline in the growth rate of the country's population. Though India's population increased from 36 crore in 1951 to 121.02 crore in 2011, it witnessed significant decline in both fertility and mortality. The crude birth rate, which was recorded at 40.8 per 1000 in 1951 declined to 20.4 in 2016, as per estimates available from the SRS. Also, TFR dropped from 6.0 in 1951 to 2.2 in 2017 (SRS). Trend in India's Population Growth Growth of Population in India Census Ye arPopulation (in crore)Decadal Growth (%)Average Annual Exponential Growth (%) 1971 24.80 2.20 1981 121.02 17.64 1.64 The growth of India's population since independence may be termed as \"RAPID\" as the average annual population growth rate hovered around 2% per year for almost four decades. The average annual population growth rate shot up from around 1.25% during 1941-51 to very close to 2 % during 1951-61 and to an all-time high of more than 2.2% during 1971-81. After 1981, the trend in the population growth rate was reversed. A population growth rate of 2% per year doubles itself in a period of about 35 years. This has, in fact been the case with India, between 1951 and 1986, India's population more than doubled from 361 million to 763 million. There has been a slowdown in the population growth in the recent past but the net addition to the population continued to increase. Population stabilisation is a stage when the size of the population remains unchanged. It 85 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 is also called the stage of zero population growth. There is often a gap of a few decades between achieving replacement level fertility i.e. TFR of 2.1 (two children per couple) and population stabilisation. Population momentum refers to the tendency of the population to continue growing beyond the time when the replacement fertility is achieved. Because of the population momentum, there is a time lag between achieving replacement fertility and achieving population stabilisation. 1.5.6.1 Factors that influence population growth Key indicators that influence population growth are CBR, TFR, Unmet need for FP , Contraceptive Use, Spacing between Births, Age at marriage and first child birth. The current status, as per the latest available data, is as follows: Unmet need for FP declined from 13.9% (NFHS-3) to 12.9% (NFHS-4) Age substantially declined from 47.4% (NFHS-3) to 26.8% (NFHS-4). Moreover, out of total deliveries, 7.9% were among teenagers i.e. 15-19 years which has also substantially declined from 16% (NFHS-3) Healthy Spacing between two childbirths (recommended period of 3 years or more) increased from 42.6% (SRS 2012) to 50.3% (SRS 2017) 1.5.6.2. India's intensified efforts to stabilise population India was the first country to have a National Programme on Family Planning in 1952. Various policy interventions were taken from time to time to address the increasing population. The National Population Policy (NPP) was devised in the year 2000 with the immediate objective to address the unmet needs for contraception, health care infrastructure and health personnel and further to provide integrated service delivery for basic reproductive and child health care. The medium-term objective was to bring TFR to replacement levels by 2010, through vigorous implementation of intersectoral operational strategies. The long-term objective was to achieve a stable population by 2045, at a level consistent with the requirements of sustainable economic growth, social development, and environmental protection. The GoI has been implementing the NHM in line with the policy framework of population stabilisation as envisaged in NPP-2000, by helping create a robust service delivery mechanism to address unmet need for FP . The GoI is also addressing the social determinants of health, paramount among which are female literacy, women's empowerment and age at marriage. The Government is committed to provide focused attention to demographically weak performing states through provisioning of all kinds of support including public awareness programmes under NHM. States are therefore free to project their priorities depending on the local needs to further the task of population stabilisation in the State specific project implementation plans. Further to ensure equity 184 HPDs have been identified and each year 30% additional budget is sanctioned for the same. The Government is also focusing on high fertility districts and a special strategy has been designed for 146 high fertility districts under MPV . Stabilising population is an essential requirement for promoting sustainable development. Making reproductive health care accessible is the foundation for stabilising population. In addition to various other parameters, population stabilisation helps in strengthening human capital by focusing on health inclusive of sexual and reproductive rights of the masses. 86 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 1.5.6.3 Perceptible Decline in Population and Related Indicators (over the last 5 decades) The improved quality and coverage of health care coupled with technologically advanced care and penetration of various health programmes across the country, both rural and urban, have resulted in a rapid fall in CBR, TFR and growth rate. Declining Fertility and Birth Rate The last 5 decades have seen significant improvements in the indicators: CBR declined from 40.8 per 1000 in 1951 to 20 in 2018 IMR decreased from 146 in 1951-61 to 32 in 2018 TFR declined from 6.0 in 1951 to 2.2 in 2018 Steepest decline in growth rate was recorded between 2001 to 2011 from 21.54% to 17.64% Decline in 0-6 population by 3.08% compared to 2001 18.14 Cr population was added during 2001-11 as compared to 18.23 Cr during 1991-2001 After decades of stagnation, there was a 4.1% point fall in the growth rate of population, from 24.99% in 2001 to 20.92% in 2011 among been earmarked in the NHP 2017, highlighting the Government's focus in aiding the process of population stabilisation: 1) Reduction of TFR at national and sub- national level to 2.1 by 2025 2) Reduction in MMR from current level to 100 by 2020 3) Reduction in infant mortality to 28 by 2019 The GoI through its multiple programmes and policies, is well on the way to attain population stabilisation in a reasonable time. 1.6 HEALTH POLICY & HEALTH INSURANCE 1.6.1 Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Y ojana Over the past few decades there has been improvement in various health indicators though out-of-pocket expenditure, which pushes millions of people into poverty continues to remain a concern. To address this and provide health cover of Rs. 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation to poor and vulnerable sections of the population, Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Y Y ojana (RSBY). Around 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore individuals) are entitled under AB-PMJAY for cashless and paperless access to services at the point of service i.e. empaneled hospitals. This health cover includes 3 days of pre-hospitalisation and 15 days of post-hospitalisation expenses. There is no cap on family size, age or gender to ensure that all members of the beneficiary families are covered. Also, benefits are portable across the country. The funding of the 87 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 scheme is shared between the Central and State Governments. The ratio of Central share to State share for all States, except North-Eastern States and Himalayan States and Union Territories with legislature, is 60:40. For North-Eastern States and Himalayan States, the ratio is 90:10. In the case of UTss without legislature, the Central contribution of premium is 100%.The entitlement of households is based on the deprivation and occupational criteria of the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) data for rural and urban areas, respectively. Further, families covered in the erstwhile RSBY but not in the targeted SECC database are also covered under AB-PMJAY . Beneficiaries covered as per SECC data Rural Areas Urban Areas I. Automatically included households (based on fulfilling any of the 5 parameters of inclusion): i. Households without shelter ii. Destitute, living on alms iii. Manual scavenger families iv. Primitive tribal groups v. Legally released bonded labour II. Families based on Standard Deprivation Parameter i. Only one room with kucha walls and kucha roof (D1) ii. No adult member between age 16 to 59 (D2) iii. Female headed households with no adult male member between age 16 to 59 (D3) iv. Disabled member and no able bodied adult member (D4) v.

Shop worker / Assistant / peon in small establishment / helper / delivery assistant / attendant/waiter x. Electrician / mechanic / assembler / repair worker xi. Washer-man/chowkidar The scheme is entitlement-based and registration or enrolment of beneficiaries under the scheme is not required for availing benefits. However, in order to create awareness amongst beneficiaries and facilitate availing of benefits, e-cards have been issued to beneficiaries. States/UTs implementing AB-PMJAY have the flexibility to add other categories of beneficiaries at their own cost under the State Schemes, which are being implemented in alliance with AB- PMJAY . This has increased coverage under the scheme to over 13.12 crore families. Implementation Structure At the Central level, National Health Authority (NHA) has been set up as an 88 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 attached office to MoHFW for implementing AB-PMJAY . It is headed by a full time CEO, in the rank of Secretary to the GoI. An 11 member Governing Board (GB), headed by the Minister for Health and Family Welfare has also been established as the decision making body of NHA State Health Agency (SHA) is the nodal agency responsible for implementation of AB-PMJAY in the state. In addition to State level posts, District Implementation Units (DIUs) have been setup to support implementation in districts. Implementation Modes in States/UTs States under AB-PMJAY are free to choose the implementation mode and can implement the scheme either through a Trust, or Insurance Companies or a combination of both in a mixed mode. States can also cover a greater number of families than those defined as per SECC data. For these additional families, the cost needs to be borne by the States. These State Schemes work in alliance with the AB-PMJAY . At present, 32 States/UTs are implementing the scheme. Insurance Mode (7) Trust Mode (21) Mixed Mode (4) Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & DiuAndaman & Minister Shri Narendra Modi launched the scheme on 23.09.2018 from Ranchi, Jharkhand. Since inception, till 31.12.2020, 32 States/Union Territories are implementing the scheme and over 1.5 Crore hospitalizations amounting to approx. Rs.18,600 Crores have been authorized under the scheme. Additionally, over 1.6 lakh hospitalizations amounting to Rs. 345 Crore have been authorized under the inter-State portability feature. So far, over13 crore e-cards (including cards issues by State Governments) have been issued under the Scheme for facilitating easy availing of benefits To increase accessibility of the scheme, a dedicated Call Centre, PMJAY app and a website are functioning. As of 31st December 2020, over 68 Lakh in-bound calls have been answered, and 1.5 crore lakh out-bound calls attempts have been made to the beneficiaries. 22 lakh mobile applications have been installed and 2.72 crore users checked the website mera.pmjay.gov.in As of 31st December 2020, a total of 32,684 grievances have been registered on AB-PMJAY grievance portal CGRMS of which 31,630 have been resolved.

The event was inaugurated by the Hon'ble Union HFM Dr. Harsh Vardhan. It witnessed the participation of luminaries such as Swedish Minister for Health and Social Affairs Ms. Lena Hallengren, WHO Director General Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, Nobel laureate Dr. Abhijit Banerjee among others. The event had an international session where officials from different countries implementing health insurance schemes shared their experiences. Multiple sessions were organised wherein SHA leadership showcased best practices and key learnings with regard to implementation of AB- PMJAY in their respective States/UTs. Union HFM, Dr. Harsh Vardhan unveiled a slew of initiatives during Arogya Manthan 2.0 including Arogya Shiksha - a digital platform to support capacity building initiatives for AB-PMJAY stakeholders, NHA 's Market Access Programme, NHA 's Annual Report and the PMJAY Coffee Table Book among others. \" Arogya Manthan 2.0\" on 22.09.2020 a four-day virtual event from 22nd to 25th September 202090 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Beneficiary Identification The BIS is one of the key components of PMJAY Information Technology system to facilitate verification of eligibility for beneficiaries through Application Programme Interface (APIs) and supports Aadhaar e-KYC (electronic Know Y our Customer) and non-Aadhaar based KYC for authentication. The enrolment process in Bihar was rather slow since the inception of the scheme. The Health Department and Panchayati Raj Department of the State came together to implement a special campaign i.e. \"Vishesh Abhiyan\" for BIS and e-card issuance to the beneficiaries of PMJAY . Vishesh Abhiyan for beneficiary identification and e-card issuance was successful in increasing the beneficiary base in Bihar. Till date, a total of 25 lakh families have been verified and provided with golden cards. Before 'Vishesh Abhiyan' , about 7,000 e-cards were issued per day, which now averages 20,000 per day. Hospital Empanelment Two types of empanelment criteria have been developed under the scheme based on the experience of the prevalent practice in other Government-funded health insurance schemes, State-specific regulations related to the quality of care and Clinical Establishment Act 2011. These criteria are as under: General criteria : For hospitals that provide non-specialised general medical and surgical care with or without ICU and emergency services. Special criteria (for clinical specialties): For each specialty, a specific set of criteria has been identified. However, in order to offer a specialised clinical service, the hospital must have necessary specific infrastructure and HR in place as mentioned in the special criteria developed under PMJAY for the same. So far a total of 24,137 hospitals have been empaneled under AB-PMJAY . Over 800 hospitals have been directly empaneled by collaborating with various central government ministries and institutions such as Ministry of Steel, Ministry of Coal, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Defence, Railways Board, New Delhi Municipal Corporation among others. In addition, over 60 private hospitals have been empaneled across NCT of Delhi, West Bengal, Telangana and Odisha where the scheme is currently not being implemented. Quality Assurance To ensure quality services are delivered via EHCPs, a Monthly Quality Audit Checklist has been developed for Empaneled Health Care Providers for periodic assessment and monitoring of the quality of services provided. NHA has partnered with Quality Council of India (QCI) to develop a portal for online quality certification of empaneled hospitals. These quality certifications include Bronze/Silver/Gold Quality certifications. NHA conducted field and online trainings to assist the EHCPs in achieving PMJAY Quality Certification. In coordination with QCI, an online system was developed for issuing PMJAY Quality Certificate to EHCPs applying for the same based on desktop assessment and onsite assessment. PMJAY Quality dashboard was launched to aid States/UTs to monitor the progress of EHCPs who have applied for PMJAY quality certification. So far, a total of 171 empaneled hospitals have been certified under these quality guidelines. 91 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Health Benefit Packages Initially, AB-PMJAY had 1393 treatment packages. These were reviewed and rationalised before HBP 2.0 came into existence with the approval of Governing Board of NHA. The newly drafted HBP 2.0 has 874 treatment packages containing 1,592 procedures, expanding access to various treatments and a scientific integration of implants and high-end consumables within the packages. HBP 2.0 has brought in multiple new concepts in the package design such as cross-specialty procedures, add-on procedures, stand-alone procedures, follow-up procedures, stratifications, special conditions. A total of 19 States/UTs have now migrated to HBP 2.0, 10 more States/ UTs are in the process of migration from HBP 1.0 to HBP 2.0. 635 Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) have been developed covering around 1592 PMJAY procedures and 214 of these STGs have been integrated into the PMJAY Transaction Management System (TMS). The IT integration includes rationalisation of mandatory documents for respective packages and addition of few questions. The objective of the STGs is to aid Pre- authorising Panel Doctor and Claims Panel Doctor of third party administrators (TPAs), insurance companies, SHAs while processing a pre-authorisation or claim by specifying mandatory documentation required and specific information to look for in these documents for the prescribed procedure; to help prevent and control fraud and abuse; to provide quality care by avoiding unnecessary care to the beneficiaries and assist in bringing uniformity in documentation across EHCPs and serve as a guidance tool for treating doctors, medical coordinators (MEDCO) and medical auditors.Beneficiary Awareness And Empowerment A detailed communication strategy has been developed and implemented at the national and regional levels. Various modes of communication such as leaflets, booklets, hoardings, TV , radio spots, interpersonal communication, etc., have been used as important elements for creating a comprehensive communication strategy for disseminating the desired messages across the target audience. Key actions for Beneficiary Awareness and Empowerment MoU with UTIITSL to fast track the generation of E-cards in the country Campaign for Migrant Workers - \" Ayushman Bharat Ki Chaanv-Shahar Ho Y a Gaon\" Collaboration with State Bank of India to deploy ATMs and digital banner advertisement on SBI's YONO app Outreach campaign \"Ek Crore Ayushman Karodon Muskaan\" from 19th to 25th May 2020. Webinar on the topic of \"One Crore Treatments and Beyond\" launched by Hon'ble HFM. Partnership with Akshaya Patra Foundation, Bharti Foundation, Novartis Social Business Awareness campaigns and workshops were conducted with youth groups in Higher Secondary Schools and Skill Development Centres across various districts of J&K. These workshops and campaigns were held with a view to involve youth in implementation and awareness of the scheme so as to bridge the gaps between larger sections of the society. Students volunteered for door-to-door campaigning and awareness of 92 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 the scheme in their respective areas. This activity proved to be a huge success. Within a week of implementing these campaigns and workshops, huge number of e-cards were generated. PMJAY National Call Centre (toll-free helpline - 14555) acts as the primary point of contact for various stakeholders. It provides beneficiaries information related to their queries and informs them about their entitlements under the Scheme. Beneficiaries can also register complaints through the helpline. The call centre deploys more than 500 agents for in-bound and out-bound calls. From October 2019 till date NHA 's call centre has answered more than 14 lakh calls and dialed 71 lakh calls under various PMJAY out-bound calling campaigns. A three-tier grievance redressal structure has been developed under PMJAY to ensure redressal of the grievances based on principles of natural justice, transparency and promptness. A bi-lingual web-based grievance redressal system has also been developed to enable a person to register their grievance on the designated portal or mobile application. Under PMJAY , more than 97% of the grievances are resolved through efforts made at District, State and National level. Capacity Building Capacity-building activities under PMJAY attempt to address more than just training and cover all aspects of building and developing sustainable and robust institutions and human resource. Capacity building has three components namely setting up sustainable institutional structures; building and strengthening the human resource and institutional capacity; and sustaining knowledge and skill through knowledge management and use of appropriate tools. A learning and development platform called \" Arogya Shiksha\" has been launched to digitise capacity building initiatives for stakeholders across the implementation ecosystem of AB-PMJAY . A continuous learning module called \"Nirantar Shiksha\" has also been launched to inculcate refresher training modules to various stakeholders. Additionally, NHA has also signed an MoU with Insurance Institute of India to launch a certificate course on health insurance claims management for stakeholders across the State Health Agencies. Fraud Prevention, Detection And ControlAB-PMJAY is being governed on a zero-tolerance approach towards any kind of fraud and the anti- fraud framework rests on the three key pillars of Prevention; Detection; and Deterrence. A comprehensive set of Anti-Fraud Guidelines have been laid down for frauds that could occur in PMJAY at different stages of its implementation. All the health benefit packages that are prone to fraud are reserved for public sector health care providers. The transaction data generated in empaneled hospitals is monitored on a real-time basis through advanced analytics and interactive dynamic dashboards. Based on the monitoring, utilisation data is analysed for over utilisation based on different triggers and the results are shared with State agencies in real time. Regular joint medical audits are conducted by the National Anti-Fraud Unit along with State Anti-Fraud Units to identify any wrongdoing. 93 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 A total of 196 hospitals have been de- empaneled as a result of audits undertaken by NAFU and SAFU and total penalties worth approximately Rs. 16.55 crores levied on errant entities, so far. NHA partnered with analytics firm SAS to develop algorithms and risk scoring models leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques to identify suspect transactions and entities. Using advanced tools such as Natural Language Processing and Optical Character Recognition and Image Analytics, unstructured data such as images, documents and clinical notes submitted were analysed to detect cases of potential fraud and abuse. SAS also supported NHA in the development of Fraud Analytics Control and Tracking System (FACTS) to detect fraud proactively, develop advanced analytics algorithms to identify suspect transactions, entities and e-cards. Risk Assessment, Detection and Analytical Reporting (RADAR) is an analytics tool developed by the National Anti-Fraud Unit which closely monitors transactions across States and Districts and has the capability to drill down to the most granular level to detect fraud done by specific outlier entities. It has a series of dashboards for anomaly and outlier detection, related to utilisation and e-card generation under PMJAY . Monitoring and Evaluation To analyse and monitor the performance of insurers and ISAs under the PMJAY scheme, the IMPACT team was set up. A dedicated dashboard to monitor the performance called IMPACT Portal was launched on 10.04.2020. This is a comprehensive portal displaying information related to infrastructure and human resource availability at State and District level. The IMPACT portal offers information on resource deployed, deliverables required as per MoU signed with NHA, performance and gap, query and rejection, performance matrix, pre-authorisation approval turnaround times (TAT), claim approval TAT, productivity of Pre-auth Panel Doctor, Claim Executive and Claim Panel Doctor etc., Query and Rejection Dashboard was developed to monitor adjudication efficiency in terms of appropriateness of queries raised by processing team to EHCPs and to ascertain whether claims were rejected for valid reasons. NHA issued new guidelines to fast-track the claim settlement, defining maximum TAT for various stages of claim and pre-authorisation process. A robust real-time online MIS was set up at the national level to review Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and achievement of results with respect to targets defined under the domains. NHA is working towards synchronisation with States to prepare PMJAY and State specific insurance scheme details in terms of benefits under the scheme, coverage, geographical location, reserved packages, infrastructure, etc. A separate section for each State has been developed and placed on PMJAY website covering State Profile, State at Glance, Factsheets, Best Practices and Tracer Packages. Cyber Security & Data Privacy In line with the proactive approach of inculcating security and privacy by design and building 94 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 a zero-trust architecture, NHA, in its second year, focused on creating a strong perimeter security. The pandemic of COVID-19 brought the confidentiality of health care data to the forefront. NHA took various information security initiatives to enable a secure remote operation and foster a cyber-security-conscious culture at the workplace. A tiered approach was adopted to ring-fence the NHA 's IT systems. Tier 1: Technological Counter-measures\"Security & privacy by design\" approach has been adopted for PMJAY right from the foundation level. The Scheme is equipped with excellent cyber-security tools and sophisticated technology for cyber-defense. These have enabled NHA to maintain the sanctity of the data and normalcy of IT operation even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tier 2: Proactive Analysis and VigilanceCombined user base for NHA application is massive and adds up to nearly 2 lakh users nation-wide. In the current context of COVID-19, internet has gone beyond the definition of commonplace evolving as a workplace enabler for organisations. Therefore, NHA has revamped its vigilance strategy for a proactive analysis and 24-hour/7-day threat-vigilance in the PMJAY ecosystem to avoid any malicious activity which can adversely impact health care operations. Tier 3: Strengthening the Weakest LinkNHA plays host to a critical infrastructure and hence has developed and implemented a stringent cyber security awareness programme for its employees and stakeholders. This ensures all employees are made aware of threats and signs displayed by any suspected malicious activity. Funds UtilisationFunds are released by MoHFW , GoI to NHA under three categories. Releases made to NHA and expenditures incurred during 2020-21 (till 15.11.2020).

Also, changes were undertaken in the AB-PMJAY IT system to allow State Governments to extend treatment to non-AB-PMJAY beneficiaries on AB-PMJAY IT platform. A Direct Lab 95 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Empanelment module was introduced for empanelment of ICMR registered labs to increase the number of testing facilities for AB-PMJAY beneficiaries. To ensure continued supply of essential health care services especially for non-COVID critical illnesses and to balance out reduction in supply of these services due to the pandemic, an express empanelment mechanism, Hospital Empanelment Module (HEM) Lite was launched for empanelment of hospitals. NHA leveraged its experience in running a state-of-the-art call centre by establishing, operating and managing the National COVID Helpline -1075 set up by the GoI to provide citizens with all necessary information and guidance. This was a centralised toll-free helpline to ensure all incoming queries get addressed and redirected to the respective states for action. More than 34 lakh calls were handled by the centre during mid-March 2020 to 30th September 2020. National Health Authority initiated a campaign on automatic voice-enabled tele-calling for COVID precaution advisory. The main objective being dissemination of important information to beneficiaries over 60 years of age across the country. A total of 5 crore numbers were reached out to. NHA also extended support by conducting a detailed verification of patients as per data shared by ICMR. A team of over 300 tele-callers was fully engaged towards this exercise and 31.36 lakh calls attempted by NHA on the data shared by ICMR till early August 2020. NHA also undertook the cleansing and verification of Aarogya Setu data whereby data that was provided in the ' Aarogya Setu' application by the citizens was validated through a 3-step process to obtain accurate and complete information. NHA also handled over 20 lakh calls on behalf of the Aarogya Setu application. NHA Innovation Unit To galvanise innovations for PMJAY , a dedicated Innovation Unit was created in partnership with the International Innovation Corps (University of Chicago Trust) and WISH Foundation in April 2019. To accomplish the objectives, NHA developed a two-pronged innovation strategy comprising the PMJAY Grand Challenge and the Market Access Programme PMJAY Grand Challenge: a unique, first-of-its-kind opportunity for start-ups engaged in sectors such as Medical Devices, Digital Health, Health Communications, Hospital Services and Hospital Management, Medical Workforce Training and Capacity-Building to provide their solutions for better implementation of PMJAY .

The States/UTs are responsible for implementation of programme, whereas the Directorate of NVBDCP , Delhi provides technical assistance, policies and assistance to States/UTs in the form of cash and commodities, as per approved norms. Malaria, Filaria, JE, Dengue and Chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes whereas Kala-azar is transmitted by sand-flies. The transmission of VBDs depends on prevalence of infective vectors and human-vector contact, which is further influenced by vector bionomics, ecological and social factors like climate, sleeping habits of human, type of vector, density and biting of vectors, migration of human population and development activities. Strategies for prevention and control of VBDs under NVBDCP Integrated Vector Management: Includes Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) in selected high-risk areas, Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) in high malaria endemic areas, use of larvi-vorous fish, anti-larval measures in urban areas including bio-larvicides and minor environmental engineering and source reduction for prevention ofbreeding. Disease Management: Involves early case detection with active, passive and sentinel surveillance followed by complete and effective treatment, strengthening of referral services, epidemic preparedness and rapid response. Supportive Interventions: Aims at BCC, Intersectoral convergence and Human Resource Development through capacitybuilding. Vaccination: Provided only for JapaneseEncephalitis Annual Mass Drugs Administration (MDA): Provided against LymphaticFilariasis 1.7.1.1 Malaria Malaria is a potentially life threatening parasitic disease caused by parasites known as Plasmodium vivax (P .vivax), Plasmodium falciparum (P .falciparum), Plasmodium malariae (P .malariae) and Plasmodium ovale (P .ovale). It is transmitted by the infective bite of female Anopheles mosquito. Two types of parasites of human malaria, P . vivax and P . falciparum are commonly reported from India. P . falciparum is the cause for complications and leads to death, if not treated immediately. The country has achieved a reduction of 83% in malaria morbidity and 92% in malaria mortality between 2000 and 2019. Comparison of data showed decline in incidence of malaria in 2015 and 2019, with a decline of nearly 71% in malaria cases and 80% in malaria deaths. In 2020 (upto September), there was 45.19% decline in malaria cases, 22.42% decline in falciparum malaria and 109 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 9.30% increase in malaria deaths as compared to the corresponding period in 2019.

The adult worms of these parasites live in the lymphatic system. The 113 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 three nematode parasites causing LF and Brugia are found in India. In mainland India, Wuchereria bancrofti, transmitted by the ubiquitous vector, Culex quinquefasciatus, has been the predominant infection contributing to 99.4% of the problem in the country. The infection is prevalent in both urban and rural areas. The vector species breeds preferably in dirty and polluted water. Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), commonly known as elephantiasis is a disfiguring and disabling disease, usually acquired in childhood. In the early stages, there are no symptoms. Lymphoedema or elephantiasis and hydrocele are the main clinical symptoms of chronic bancroftian filariasis . Normal daily activities become difficult due to frequent infections. Disease Burden The disease is endemic in 272 districts {15 districts (Odisha-7, Jharkhand-4, Telangana-4) included in 2020} in 21 States/UTs (16 States & 5 UTs). More than 670 mn people are at risk. State-wise Situation of ELFThe data for LF is updated annually at the end of every calendaryear. A total of 6,54,013 Lymphatic Filariasis cases were reported from 16 States and 5 UTs, wherein, Lymphoedema and Hydrocele cases are 4,97,481 and 1,56,532 respectively. A total of 1,41,202 Hydrocelectomy operations were reported under morbidity management including 22,344 operations during 2019 from 16 States and 5 UTs. Strategy for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis India adopted the twin pillars strategy for elimination of LF as per recommendation of WHO. This strategy includes: i) Transmission control - Interruption of transmission through annual Mass Drug Administration (MDA): To prevent occurrence of new infection and disease, annual single dose (MDA) of anti-filarialdrug i.e., DEC + Albendazole (DA)/ Ivermectin + DEC + Albendazole (IDA), is administered. ii) Disability Prevention and Management -For those individuals who already have the disease: Home-based management for lymphoedema and surgical correction for hydrocoele in hospital/camps are being provided. Regional Programme Review Group (RPRG) WHO virtual meeting held on 13- 16 July,2020 During 2020 (till October), 84 districts conducted MDA including 7 districts where MDA was conducted with triple drug i.e. Ivermectin + DEC +Albendazole 29 districts {Jharkhand (14 districts), Bihar (11 districts), Karnataka (3 districts) and A&N Islands (1 district)} observed MDA during COVID situation in August/ September, 2020 taking all precautionary measures as per COVIDguidelines During 2020 (till October), 5 districts cleared 2 nd TAS and 11 districts cleared 3rdTAS Achievements Status, as on date Total Lymphatic Filariasis endemic districts: 272 Districts conducted MDA in 2020: 84 (tillOctober) Districts cleared 1st Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS) and Stopped MDA: 98 Districts cleared 2 nd Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS): 87 Districts cleared 3 rd Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS): 42114 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Regional Programme Review Group (RPRG) WHO meeting (virtual) Daily evening briefing at PHC during MDAWall marking in MDA Jharkhand HCWs innovated \"Leaf Donna\" method, a leaf used like a bowl for drug administrationInvolvement of 600 field staff from one of the partners (CARE) for MDA in Bihar IDA Administration at Tapi, GujaratIDA Administration at Simdega,Jharkhand Newer Initiatives (2020): Triple drug (IDA), (DEC + Albendazole+ Ivermectin) Therapy was implemented in following seven districts Proposal enhancement of budget under ELF programme approved by EPC for consideration of MSG DENGUE AND CHIKUNGUNYA 1.7.1.4 Dengue is the fast spreading outbreak prone arbo-viral disease. Dengue Fever is transmitted by Aedes mosquito which is a day-biting mosquito and prefers to rest in hard-to-find dark areas inside the houses. Aedes aegypti is the principal vector; however, at present Ae. albopictus, has also been reported to play a role in Southern and NE States. There is no drug available to cure dengue infection. Disease Burden Dengue is endemic to all States/UTs (except Lakshadweep and Ladakh). Recurring outbreaks of Dengue Every year during the period July-November, there is an upsurge in the cases of Dengue in 115 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 northern parts of the country. However, in the southern and western parts of the country, the disease has become perennial.During 2019, a total of 1,57,315 cases and 166 deaths were reported from 28 States and 7 UTs, whereas, in 2020 (Provisional till 31 st October), a total of 24,507 cases and 13 deaths were reported from 26 States and 7 UTs. Maximum cases were reported from Punjab are reported from Kerala (5), Maharashtra (4) and one Uttarakhand Puducherry.

Dengue situation in the country from 2010 - 2020 (Provisional till 31st October) 1.7.1.5 Chikungunya Chikungunya is a debilitating viral illness caused by Chikungunya virus. The disease re-emerged in the country after a gap of almost three decades. It is also transmitted by Aedes mosquito, both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus can transmit the disease. Symptoms of Chikungunya fever are most often clinically indistinguishable from those observed in dengue fever. It is characterised by fever with severe joint pain (arthralgia) and rash. Joint pains sometimes persist for a long time even after the disease is cured. There is neither any vaccine nor drugs to cure the Chikungunya and the cases have to be managed symptomatically. Disease Burden After re-emergence of Chikungunya in 2006, the cases of clinically suspected Chikungunya cases were reported every year but gradually declined till 2014. However, due to the report of increased numbers of cases by few States, the disease showed an upward trend in 2015 (Karnataka) and 2016 (Delhi and nearby States). Currently, Chikungunya is endemic in 26 States and 6 UTs. During 2019 a total of 81,914 suspected Chikungunya cases were reported from 25States/UTs whereas in 2020 (till 31 st October), a total no. of 27,770 clinically suspected Chikungunya cases were reported from 22 States/UTs.

The Govt. of India also provides commodities like drugs, LLINs, insecticides/ larvicides etc. as per approved norms to all NE States as per their technical requirements. The additional support under Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) is provided to all the 147 districts of 8 States (7 NE States except Sikkim, and Madhya Pradesh) for implementation of the Global Fund supported \"Intensified Malaria Elimination Project\" for the grant period January 2018-March 2021. To strengthen the surveillance and proper implementation of anti-malaria interventions in difficult areas in high endemic districts of Mizoram and Meghalaya, 2 NGO Sub recipients (SRs) are included. Goal : To reduce malaria morbidity and mortality by at least 70% in project areas by 2020Objectives: a. Achieve near universal coverage of the population at risk of malaria with an appropriate vector control intervention (LLIN). b. Achieve universal coverage of case detection and treatment services (in project areas) to ensure 100% parasitological diagnosis of suspected malaria cases and complete treatment of all confirmed cases. c. Strengthen the surveillance to detect, notify, investigate, classify and respond to all cases and focus on all districts (in project areas) to move towards malaria elimination.121 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 d. Achieve near universal coverage in project areas by appropriate BCC activities to improve knowledge, awareness and responsive behavior regarding effective preventive and curative interventions. For strengthening early case detection and complete treatment at community level, ASHAs have been trained and involved in high malaria endemic areas along with Fever Treatment Depots (FTDs) and Malaria clinics. This is in addition to the treatment facilities available at the health facilities and hospitals. Anti-malarial drugs and funds for training are provided by Gol under the programme. As per the National Drug Policy, Chloroquine is used for treatment of all P .vivax cases and Artemesnin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) with Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (AS+SP) combination is being used for treatment of all P .falciparum cases in the country. However, in North-Eastern states, early signs of resistance to ACT-SP were noticed. Keeping in view the same, as per the advice of Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), an effective combination of Artemether- Lumefantrine (ACT-AL) is now being used for the treatment of P .falciparum cases in the North- Eastern States. Under integrated vector control initiative, IRS is being implemented selectively only in high risk pockets as per district-wise Micro Action Plans from the domestic budget. The Directorate has issued guidelines on IRS to the States for technical guidance. Guidelines on uniform evaluation of insecticides have also been developed in collaboration with National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR), Delhi. Over the years, there is a reduction in IRS covered population in view of paradigm shift to alternative vector control measures such as extensive use of Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLINs). Presently, all the sub-centers having API above 1 have been saturated with LLINs in all 7 NE States under GFATM funding support.B. Japanese Encephalitis: Japanese Encephalitis is endemic in all North-Eastern States except in Mizoram and Sikkim. The details of AES/JE cases are as follows: S.

Lymphatic Filariasis is endemic in 7 districts of Assam, whereas other States in NE region are non-endemic for filaria. These 7 districts of Assam were covered under the strategy of Annual Mass drug Administration (MDA) of Di-ethyl-carbamazine citrate (DEC) since 2004. However, since 2009, Albendazole was co-administered with DEC. All these 7 endemic districts of Assam have successfully completed 1 st Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS) and stopped MDA. Out of these 7 districts, 6 have successfully cleared 2 nd TAS also and one district, Dibrugarh failed in 2nd TAS during 2018 and have to observe two rounds of MDA.1.7.2 National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP) The NLEP , India is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme under the umbrella of NHM. The major concern of the Programme is to detect cases of leprosy at an early stage and provide complete treatment, free of cost, in order to prevent occurrence of Grade II Disability (G2D) in affected persons. Under NLEP , it is aimed to reduce G2D per million population to less than 1 per million population and to have zero G2D among new child cases aligned with the target given by Global Leprosy Strategy 2016-20. Several initiatives have been taken to encourage early case detection, to ensure complete treatment and contain the onset of disease in close contacts of the index cases (persons diagnosed with leprosy). 1.

Subsequently, the Programme was renamed as National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP) in 1992 so as to cover all Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD) and is being implemented in all States/UTs. The objectives of NIDDCP are to bring down prevalence of IDD to below 5% in the country and ensure 100% 127 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 consumption of adequately iodized salt (>15ppm) at the household level. No State /UT is free from IDD. 1.7.4.1 Significant achievements of NIDDCP 1) Enhanced Levels of Production: Iodized salt production and supply during FY 2020-21 (upto September, 2020) was 38.88 lakh lakh tonnes respectively; 2) Establishing Cells: For effective implementation of NIDDCP , 34 States/UTs established Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Cells in their State Health Directorate; 3) Setting up Monitoring Labs: In order to monitor quality of iodized salt and Urinary Iodine Excretion (UIE), 34 States/UTs set up Iodine Deficiency Disorders monitoring laboratories; 4) Observance of Special Days: Global IDD Prevention day was observed throughout the country on 21.10.2020. IDD Messages were released on the Ministry of HFW's GoI Twitter handle; 5) Increase in Estimations of Iodine Content in Salt: For estimation of iodine content in salt, during FY 2020-21 (upto September, 2020), 8847 salt samples were collected and analysed, out of which 7846 (89%) salt samples were up to the standards (Iodine content > 15 ppm); 6) Increase in Estimations of UIE: For estimation of UIE, during FY 2020-21(upto September, 2020), 1668 urine samples were collected and analysed out of which 1551 (93%) samples had urinary iodine level > 100\u00b5g/L (optimal); and 7) Improving Quality of Iodized Salt: At consumption level, during FY 2020-21 (upto September, 2020), 28,67,418 salt samples were tested and presence of iodine (adequate) found in 25,57,154 salt samples (89%). 1.7.4.2 IEC Activities through State Health Directorates State/UT Governments have been provided Grants-in-aid for undertaking IEC activities at the local level in their regional languages to ensure impact of IEC activities more effective, including celebration of Global IDD Prevention Day in all Districts. Most States/UTs conducted a range of IEC activities during the year to observe Global IDD Prevention Day on 21.10. 2020. 1.8 NATIONAL AIDS CONTROL ORGANISATION (NACO) Through its flagship National AIDS Control Programme (NACP), NACO provides leadership to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention and control in India through 36 State AIDS Control Societies (SACS) and one Mumbai District AIDS Control Society in States/UTs. NACO has implemented four phases of NACP and currently, NACP Phase-IV (Extension), 2017-21 is under implementation as a 100% central sector scheme. NACP response to HIV/AIDS epidemic in India comprises a comprehensive strategy of prevention, testing, treatment, retention in care and viral suppression. Each of these are supported through critical enablers of IEC, Laboratory Services and Strategic Information Management. Communities which are at the centre of response and equity, gender and respect for rights of communities which have been continuously adopted as guiding principles. Prevention: Targeted community led interventions for High Risk Groups namely Female Sex Workers (FSW), Men who have Sex with Men (MSM), Transgender/Hijra (TG/H), Injecting Drug 128 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Users (IDU) and Bridge Population (Migrants, Truckers) as well as inmates of closed settings like prisons, sudhar homes etc. is fundamental to AIDS response and aims to keep these populations HIV- free. Key interventions include awareness generation, safe behaviour promotion, Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) management, condom promotion, harm reduction and HIV testing. People who have STIs have higher risk of HIV infections and accordingly prevention and control of STI/Reproductive Tract Infection (RTI) is a mandate of NACP . These services are made available through designated STI/RTI Clinic (DSRC), branded as Surakhsa Clinic across the country. In the initial phase, since unsafe blood transfusion contributed to the spread of HIV/AIDS in India, blood transfusion services and safe blood practices were a critical part of NACP . Accordingly, safe blood (free of HIV , Malaria, Syphilis, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C) is ensured through blood transfusion services delivered through 1,131 NACO supported blood banks. Mainstreaming and Partnership is one of the key strategies in NACP to strengthen multisectoral response to HIV and AIDS. Till date, NACO has signed 18 MoUs with key Ministries/ Departments of GoI. Testing: NACP provides HIV testing services for early detection of HIV infections at more than 33,567 facilities. HIV testing is mandatorily accompanied by counselling making it a unique feature of the programme. HIV screening has been decentralised through community based screening (CBS) to enhance uptake of services by those at risk for HIV . Free counselling and testing of pregnant women is provided towards enabling early detection of HIV infection during pregnancy in order to prevent HIV transmission to infants born to HIV positive pregnant women. Further, Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) programmes provide early diagnosis of HIV infection among newborn babies of HIV infected pregnant women. Finally it formulates the way to Elimination of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV (EMTCT). Treatment: NACP provides free standardised Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) for all People living with HIV (PLHIV) as well as comprehensive management of opportunistic infections. NACO has adopted the 'Test and Treat' policy to enhance the uptake of treatment services. Along with first line, second and third line ART regimens are being provided for PLHIV who fail on first and second line regimen. Single window delivery of TB and HIV services have been initiated across all ART centres. Molecular diagnosis/testing (e.g. Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test-CBNAAT) is being offered to PLHIV identified as presumptive tuberculosis (TB) cases for early diagnosis of TB in collaboration with National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP). Laboratory Services: The state of health of a PLHIV on treatment can be safely determined by measuring number of copies of HIV virus in the blood. It indicates his/her response to treatment. Since its launch on 26.02.2018, the programme has progressively introduced routine viral load testing for all PLHIV , initially through a PPP and thereafter through 64 molecular laboratories set up by the Government in the public sector. Quality testing under NACP is ensured through a hierarchical network of laboratories for HIV diagnosis and monitoring of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count and viral load testing of PLHIV as well as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for early infant diagnosis. Strategic Information: Use of data is fundamental to the National AIDS Response. Evidence-based decision making is ensured through complementary systems of IT enabled client centric programme monitoring, epidemic monitoring and research focusing on high quality data collection, analysis and dissemination. 129 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Stigma and Discrimination: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Act, 2017 towards protecting and securing human rights of persons infected or affected by HIV/AIDS or vulnerable to the disease is under implementation.

Nationally, 58.96 (33.61-102.16) thousand AIDS-related deaths in the year 2019 showing 66.00% change in annual AIDS-related deaths since 2010. India is estimated to have had 20.52 thousandmothers who would require ART to prevent MTCT of HIV . While overall HIV prevalence is low, there are population groups which are more affected by HIV than the rest. The Figure below depicts HIV prevalence among population group of ANC attendees, inmates in central jails, FSWs, MSMs, IDUs, H/TGs, single male migrants (SMM) and long-distance truckers (LDT). For ANC and inmates in central jails, the last round of surveillance was conducted in 2019 while for FSW , MSM, IDU, H/TG people, migrants and LDTs in 2017. As evident, HIV epidemic in India continues to be concentrated among high-risk population. HIV prevalence among IDU is almost 28 times higher than that of overall adult prevalence. Similarly, HIV prevalence among H/TG, MSM and FSW has HIV prevalence which is 6 to 13 times higher than the adult prevalence. Among inmates in central jails, where population with high-risk behaviour are over-represented, HIV prevalence is almost nine times higher than the adult prevalence.130 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Figure 1.8.3 HIV prevalence in different population group 1.8.2 Administration and Organizational Structure NACO is headed by the Additional Secretary and Director General. In addition to the regular staff (37 Nos.) in Group \" A \" , \"B\" , \"C\" and \"D\" , there are contractual staff to assist the organization in discharging its assigned functions (for more details please refer to the website naco.gov.in) which is also linked to the Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) of the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievance and Pensions, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievance and Pensions.) 1.8.3 Financial Management NACP IV , which was co-terminus with 12th Five Y ear Plan and approved for continuation from April 2017 to March 2020 by Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs with an outlay of Rs.6,435 crore. The Programme has further been extended up to 31.03.2021. The details of expenditure (year- wise) from 2015-16 to 2020-21 are given below: Details of expenditure from 2019-20 to 2020-21 Financial Ye arRevised Estimates (Rs. Community Led Interventions The preventive efforts are targeted primarily towards sub-groups of the population identified to be at high risk of acquiring HIV infection and include FSW , MSM, TG/H, IDU, prison inmates and other closed settings and bridge populations such as Migrant and LDTs. They are provided with several preventive services through Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO)/ Community-Based Organisations (CBO) led TIs, 122 Link Worker Scheme (LWS), 225 Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) centres and interventions at 980 prisons. TI projects provide a package of prevention, support and linkage services to HRGs through drop-in-centre (DIC) and outreach-based service delivery models which includes BCC, screening and treatment of STI and syphilis, free condom and lubricant distribution, linkages to Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) and CBS for HIV testing, linkages with ART centres and care and support services for HIV positive HRGs. These are critical services and include creating an enabling environment with community involvement and participation, community mobilisation, ownership building and specifically, for IDUs (free distribution of clean needles and syringes, abscess prevention and management, OST and referral to detoxification/rehabilitation services.) The entire program is built on the peer-led approach in partnership with NGOs/CBOs. People from high-risk communities (peer educators) are engaged to deliver services and act as catalysts linking them for services and commodities. They identify the HRGs and provide the services and information through various IPC sessions. TSUs have been directed to provide on-site assistance and handholding to revise the outreach plan to cover hard-to-reach and hidden populations. SACS and Technical Support Units (TSU) extend mentoring, handholding, and technically support the TIs for quality service delivery and enhance the overall programme performance.131 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 1.8.4.1 Revamped and Revised Elements of Targeted Intervention for HIV Prevention and Care Continuum among Core Population To achieve the global HIV target of 2030 and provide comprehensive prevention, testing, and treatment packages to vulnerable populations, the TI strategy was revamped and a comprehensive TI Revamping Strategy Guide developed. The key programme elements of TI were retained and newer activities incorporated in the ongoing TI programme in the context of specific key populations, bridge populations and special groups with a view to achieve better results. The main principle for the revised and revamped TI strategy was a \"differentiated approach\" to prevention, that cautions against following a one-size-fits-all approach while carefully segmenting key population to enhance emphasis of risk and vulnerability that would help mitigate transmission of HIV with greater impact. New activities under the Revamped TI approach are Strengthened Outreach Activity, Community Based Screening and Bio-Medical Waste Management, Peer Navigation, Index Testing, Mapping and Population Size Estimation, Secondary Distribution of Needle and Syringes, Satellite OST Centres and Community Scorecard. 1.8.4.2 Progress on Quarterly Score Card for TIs Quarterly Score Cards are developed to achieve performance indicators and to monitor performance of individual TI projects for different FSW , MSM, TG/H, and IDU. Based on observations from the Score Card, NACO shares feedback with States. The Table below shows progress made from January to September 2020. It highlights very good performing interventions decreasing from the period of January to March 2020 to a lowest of 3% due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the initial lockdowns. These are now increasing gradually as restrictions are being lifted by the government.Summary of Scorecard for the period of January to September 2020 Quarter Poor Average GoodVer y Good Jan to March 2020 7% 17% purpose of the scorecard is to : Identify the gaps in achievements against the target in specific to thematic groups Improve the performance of the TI Guide the TIs in ensuring the better performance all the thematic groups Suggest SACS/TSU provide the appropriate hand holding towards effective implementation of TI programme in the States and achieve the goals of NACP . 1.8.4.3 Performance of TI Programme Scale-up of TIs and coverage: Based on the mapping of HRGs and subsequent validation of sites and size of the population, efforts have been made to scale up the number of TIs in strategic places. Either new TIs have been placed, or multiple typologies covered through composite interventions. By the end of September 2020, there were 1414 TIs in India. The number of new TIs increased in the case of TG/H and MSM population in FY 2019-20. Efforts have been made to cover new population through strategic relocation of TIs, keeping the existing population covered through Core composite TIs. Coverage of Core and Bridge Population in Lakh 132 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Based on the evidence of risks and vulnerability, more than 85% of the core group HRGs have been covered through TIs with primary prevention services like treatment for STI, condoms, needles/ syringes, BCC, enabling environment, with community engagement and linkages with care and support services during this reporting period. Considering the period of association of HRGs in the TI, the population was segregated into active and dynamic. The Dynamic population/ HRG refers to HRGs who are aware of their risk and vulnerability because of their long-term association or exposure with TIs. Therefore, the new population identified within the same geography would replace this dynamic population in the TIs, while TIs would continue to offer their routine services. The coverage and number of TI for the calendar year are mentioned in the below tables. The coverage of TI for HRGs among FSW , 61% respectively.

STI Diagnosed & Treated against Clinic Visit: Clinical services including regular medical check-up is one of the core components of TI project services. NACO guidelines suggest that every HRG from the core group, especially FSW , MSM and TG/H, should visit the STI clinic every quarter. i.e., four times a year, for regular medical check-ups and treatment of STI/RTI. The below Figure depicts the number of clinic visits made by HRGs from January to September 2020. The figure also shows the proportion of STI clinic attendees diagnosed and treated for STI/RTI through TIs. The clinic footfall for STI screening was found in the range of 51% to 62% among all core groups, however, STI/RTI cases diagnosed and treated was high among FSWs as 1.8% while TG population has recorded more than 1.61%. The clinical footfalls among Truckers and Migrants recorded 31% and 18% respectively from January to September 2020 and STI/RTI diagnosed and treated was 3.1% and 2.9% among Truckers and Migrants respectively. STI Diagnosed & Treated against Clinic Visit in Percentage among HRGs January to September 2020) Syphilis testing and reactivity among HRGs Syphilis screening and treatment helps in early diagnosis, management and an overall reduction in disease burden of syphilis among HRGs. NACO guidelines suggest all HRGs should be screened for Syphilis bi-annually. The below figure depicts the percentage of syphilis screening performed among HRGs through referrals from TI programmes against the target. The screened reactivity amongst HRGs has been less than 0.5 %. Syphilis reactivity among TG/H population was reported highest among all the core population from January to September 2019.134 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Syphilis testing and reactivity among HRGs (January to September 2020) Condom distribution among HRGs: Risk-reduction counselling and condom provisioning is an integral element of TI intervention, Condoms are distributed to HRGs as per their requirement that is being arrived through individual condom demand analysis through the NGOs/CBOs implementing TI programme. Peer Educators and Outreach workers engaged in TI programme emphasise on the consistent and correct usage of condoms in all sexual encounters through one-to-one and one-to-group IPC. The Figure below shows typology-wise number of condoms (free and social marketing) distributed to HRGs and how their distribution against demand was more than 55% in all typologies Condom distribution among HRG January to September 2020 HIV testing and positivity rate among HRGs: NACO guidelines suggest all core HRGs should be tested for HIV once every six months. The programme data reveals that HRGs who have been associated with TIs for more than five years have been regular to testing and keeping consistent efforts to remain negative across the majority of the States. However, positivity has remained a matter of concern among IDUs and the TG /H population. The below figure depicts the percentage of HIV tests performed among HRGs through referrals from TI programmes. The positive detection amongst HRGs has been less than 0.65%. The positivity the IDU was 48%, 48%, 35% and 46% respectively. However, testing among the Bridge Population remains a challenge because of their mobility, however, the inclusion of CBS in the strategy helped overcome this challenge to a larger extent as it enhanced reach beyond the target assigned. The positivity among Migrant and Truckers was 0.13% and 0.12% respectively. HRGs tested for HIV and positivity (January to September 2020) Community Based Screening (CBS) As a part of the revamped strategy, CBS is a robust approach to reach the first 90 targets. It is a testing strategy adopted by TIs and LWS to meet the testing gap found during regular testing. This will further help in the rapid expansion of HIV testing services to spouses and partners and to reach out to hard-to-reach population in the TI and non-TI catchment areas. The TIs have started the CBS activities at present. The coverage of HRG through CBS reached an approximate 6.67 lakh population where 3.8 lakh screenings were done through core TIs for existing HRGs and 11,692 hard-to-reach HRGs and 11,339 spouses and partners of HRGs were tested. The CBS among Migrants and Truckers were found to be approximately 2.5 lakh. 135 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Typology-wise coverage of CBS (January to September 2020) S.

Peer educators at the field as well as DICs distribute new needles and syringes as part of outreach and encourage IDUs to return used syringes and needles. This reduces the possibility of sharing injecting equipment, thus reducing risk for HIV transmission and other blood-borne infections. The used needles and syringes are disposed off as per the Bio-Medical Waste Management Guidelines (2016). Programme data shows that distribution of needles and syringes was observed by more than 79%, while return rate is observed to be around 70%. The distribution of condoms was affected due to COVID-19 from April to September 2020. Distribution and Return of Needles & Syringes during January to September 2020 1.8.4.4 Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) Programme for IDUs Since 2008 and the inclusion of OST as part of the overall harm reduction package for IDUs in the country, there has been a massive scale-up of OST delivery under NACP . From 56 centres in 2007 covering around 5,500 IDUs, the OST programme has been scaled up to 225 standalone centres covering about 41,587 active clients in 2020. There are two models of OST service delivery namely the NGO Model and the Collaborative Model. In the collaborative model, the OST services are delivered at the Government health facilities in coordination with the link IDU-TIs. For providing and assuring quality services, a continuous process of capacity building is being followed under the OST programme for IDUs. Additionally, satellite OST centres have been rolled out with a total of 85 Satellite centres currently functional across 6 states under NACO as part of the TI revamped strategies. 136 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 No. of OST Centres, from January to September 2020 State No. of CentresSatellite OST CentreCoverage Ahmedabad 1 52 Arunachal Pradesh 163 Assam 3 Bihar 2 210 4 665 Chhattisgarh 6 833 Delhi 11 2219 Goa 29 Gujarat 1 35 Haryana 9 Pradesh 1 93 Jammu 1 24 Meghalaya 5 1 970 Mizoram 17 47 3326 Mumbai 1 61 Nagaland 31 11 5801 Odisha 4 299 Punjab 30 Rajasthan Sikkim 4 16 1,918 Uttarakhand 5 561 West Bengal 8 2 854 All India 225 85 41587 Source: OST Monthly Reports 2020-21In the current FY 2020-21, the first step towards digitisation for both OSTCs and TIs was initiated through Project SOCH (Strengthening Overall Care for HIV) to create a beneficiary centric web and mobile-based system, to track and record beneficiary services and inventory transaction in the national HIV programme to improve service delivery and beneficiary health outcomes. Project SOCH was introduced to create a complete digital system for all processes under the HIV continuum of care. It was designed to observe a seamless beneficiary flow through identification, testing and treatment of PLHIV . Through this platform, TIs and OSTCs are now able to record service delivery digitally. Additionally, all inventory transactions are tracked to ensure quick information flow and visibility of all services imparted to the beneficiary. SOCH will thus introduce digitisation of beneficiary information, authenticity and validity of evidence and automated aggregation of data for all TI centres and OST centres. In the account of the COVID-19 pandemic, the provision of take-home OST medication was instituted (along with daily supervised OST) to reduce infection risk and overcome accessibility barriers. The 'Interim guidance document for take-home OST' was developed and the OST MOs were trained on the same in April 2020. It was followed by a series of webinars for their continued training and support. The 'Take home OST record sheet' a brief checklist to assist health 137 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 care staff at OST centres with periodic evaluation of clients on OST was also circulated. 1.8.4.5 Link Worker Scheme (LWS) - Reaching-out to Rural Populations NACO has been implementing the Link Worker Scheme (LWS) since 2006 to address HIV infection in the rural sector. The objectives are: Stakeholders meeting under LWS, conducted by ARUNA (NGO in Ganjam district) supported through Odisha SACS Reach out to HRGs and vulnerable men and women in rural areas with information, knowledge, skills on STI/HIV prevention and risk reduction Increase availability and use of condoms among HRGs and other vulnerable men and women Establish referral and followup linkages for various services including treatment for STIs, testing and treatment for TB, ICTC/PPTCT services, HIV care and support services including ART. Create an enabling environment for PLHA and their families, reducing stigma and discrimination against them through interactions with existing community structures/ groups, e.g. Village Health Committees (VHC), Self Help Groups (SHG) and PRIs.The scheme envisages the creation of demand for various HIV/AIDS-related services, linking of the target population to existing services (as the scheme itself does not create any service delivery points), creating an enabling and stigma-free environment, ensuring the target population continues to access information, services in a sustained manner, creating linkages with services of other departments through ASHA volunteers, AWWs, Panchayat heads etc. As of September 2020, LWS is covering approximately 1200 vulnerable villages in 135 districts across 16 states under the scheme. Over 57,202 FSWs, 6,406 IDUs, 6,069 MSMs, 394 TGs were reached in rural areas nationally. Additionally, the scheme covered nearly 2.78 lakh migrants, 70,104 truckers and 3.76 lakh other vulnerable populations. The programme reached 34,906 PLHIV; 78,798 ANC and around 31,338 TB cases. Around 2.85 lakh population were tested for HIV , and 2,39,385 cases sought treatment for STI. Population Covered under LWS from January to September 2020 Population Line Listed - 01 1.8.4.6 Employer Led Model (ELM) The ELM has been designed to provide HIV/ AIDS prevention to care services to informal labourers including migrants and truckers linked to the industries directly or indirectly. Objectives of ELM model are: To increase awareness and access to HIV and AIDS prevention to care services for informal workers To create an enabling environment by reducing stigma and discrimination against PLHIV To encourage and help prospective employers to integrate and sustain the HIV and AIDS intervention programme within existing systems and structures Sensitisation workshop on HIV/AIDS at JSPL Tensa Company in Sundergarh district by Odisha SACS under ELP Under this model, efforts were undertaken to involve major industries and associations to integrate comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention to care programme within their existing structure. State-wise mapping was conducted by SACS/TSU to find out prospective employers and MoUs were signed by SACS with respective employers. SACS/TSU have adequately built the capacity of the employers and supported them in conducting different activities for the informal labourers. The ELM is envisaged as a win-win situation for both employers as well as for the National Program. An employer does add value by addressing the HIV/AIDS risk and vulnerability of their own workers as well as workers in the supply chain. This not only fulfils the commitments under MDG but also makes their leadership keen about the National priorities With support of and concerted efforts of SACS and TSU toward the end of September 2020, NACO was able to partner with approximately 743 industries across 22 States, covering 3.1 lakh workers/ migrants for various HIV/AIDS related services. 1.8.4.7 TB-HIV case linkage activities in TI Programme Early identification of presumptive TB cases through screening among HRG population is an important complementary strategy to meet the national urgency in accelerating case detection to achieve the goals of the 'End TB' strategy. Active Case Finding activities yielded additional cases in different vulnerable groups in India thus HRGs too included in this and steps taken to cover the population with screening. The yield of cases depends on screening HRGs and bridge population. The TB screening has been initiated by TI and LWS working under NACP with robust guidelines. TB services are provided as referral services to most vulnerable populations which include Female Sex Workers (FSWs), Men who have Sex with Men (MSM), Transgender/Hijra (TG/H), Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) and Bridge Populations such as migrants and truckers. During routine outreach services, the peer educator (PE) and other outreach team members screen HRGs and bridge populations for TB symptoms and refer them to the nearest TB centre for confirmation and treatment. To promote intensified TB case finding at TIs, increase awareness and reduce stigma for both TB and HIV , four different models are proposed, based on the location and facilities available at TI level.139 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 It is expected that all HRGs are screened four times in a quarter and the bridge population is screened while visiting the clinic. From January to September 2020 a total of 19.17 Lakh core HRGs and 6.7 Lakh Bridge Population were screened for TB. The yield rate was found 1.8 % among HRG and 0.23 % among bridge populations. The details are mentioned in the table below.

National lockdown due to COVID-19 situation has affected the ongoing intervention in prisons and other closed settings. Majority of the prisons, Swadhar, Ujjawala and other State-run Homes restricted the entry for field staff. Medical and para-medical staff from the prison medical facilities were posted for COVID-19 duty which affected the functioning of SA-ICTC, F-ICTC, LAC and S-OST. SACS together with implementing partners (FHI360/SAATHII/I-TECH) have taken concerted efforts to ensure continuity and sustainability of the comprehensive HIV/TB services initiated for people living in prison and other closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. During January to September, 2020, 88,106 inmates were provided HIV counselling and testing services of which 338 inmates (0.38%) were diagnosed with HIV , 298 (88%) registered on ART. 122 TB cases and 79 STI cases were diagnosed and treated successfully.

About 40% of total HIV cases were (3,161) reported from Punjab alone. One fifth of the inmates tested for HIV were also tested for HCV (2,20,532) of which 7,883 (3.57%) HCV only 20% of HCV cases (1,583) were linked for treatment due to limited treatment facilities available in India. 50% inmates (0.55 million) provided with HIV counselling and testing services were screened for TB through 4S screening. 5% symptomatic cases identified through this process were tested for TB of which 1,947 (0.39%) inmates found TB positive, 1479 (76%) were successfully initiated on Directly Observed Treatment, short-course (DOTS). 2,285 STI cases were identified and successfully treated during this reporting period. There are 1,363 prisons line-listed by the project team for intervention, F-ICTC facilities have been made available in 426 prisons and LAC in 54 prisons. Satellite OST facility is being provided in 15 prisons. 1.8.4.9 Technical Support Units (TSUs) State Technical Support Units (TSU) were set up during the NACP-III in 2007 with assistance of donor partners. TSU is setup in States to complement and enhance the effectiveness of SACS with focus on HIV prevention, testing and treatment programme under NACP and complement the programme with evidence. Currently 17 TSUs (10 TSUs as per the new structure and 7 TSUs as per the old structure) are supporting 24 SACS which are managed by different agencies. This is besides the 8 North Eastern States being catered by North East TSU. World Bank Assistance to NACSP ended on 30.06.2020 and entire assistance to TSUs is being extended through Domestic Budgetary Support of GoI. Plan is under way to establish new TSUs for Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and North East states along with a separate TSU for Telangana, taking the total number to 22 in coming months. List of TSUs and management agency Providing Support TSU Supporting SACS Management - 01 Supportive supervision and monitoring visits: Technical Support Units (TSUs) have a robust system for TI supervision and monitoring. To meet these objectives, Programme Officers (PO) of TSUs are placed at regional level in the state who in turn provide handholding support to TIs through intensive and routine visits. On an average, one PO covers 10 TIs in hilly region (NE States) and 12-15 TIs in other parts of the country. It is expected that the PO shall visit all TIs in a month and in one quarter, s/he will complete one intensive visit (2-3 days depending on the TI), thus a total of 4-5 days per TI per quarter. TSUs carry out adequate intensiveTI visits: These visits are conducted once a quarter to ensure quality service delivery of prevention services. During the visit, TSUs conducted periodic validation of at least 10% of the HRG registered at the TIs and accessing prevention services available in the intervention area. Project Monitoring Committee (PMC): PMC is established to monitor the performance and functioning of TSUs at the state level. There were 22 PMC meetings conducted during the period April - September 2020 to review the performance of TSU and provide timely feedback for course correction if any and strategic direction needed to make optimum usage of resources available. In addition to PMC meetings, performance of TSUs are also assessed through TSU Annual performance assessment tool every year. The assessment tool carries the details performance of TSU and are being validated by Project Director SACS and concerned management agency. 1.8.4.10 District AIDS Prevention and Control Units (DAPCU) Using the HIV Sentinel Surveillance data (2004- 2006), all the districts in the country were divided into four categories (Category A, B, C and D) based on the disease burden. As per this, there were 156 Category A and 39 Category B districts (total 195 districts) across the country that required priority attention. NACO as part of major structural reform, established DAPCUs in 188 such districts to provide programmatic oversight through decentralized facilitation, monitoring and coordination of HIV/AIDS programme activities in the district. The major responsibility of DAPCU is facilitation, monitoring and coordinating NACP activities at the district and sub- district level by engaging with the health system to the extent possible for better synergy and optimal results. DAPCUs, through active engagement of the district administration engages allied line departments and the private sector in mainstreaming the programme and advocates district-specific initiatives even by leveraging local resources. This helps in linking vulnerable populations with various social entitlement and welfare schemes. DAPCU staff builds the capacity of the facility staff, monitors the referrals and linkages through regular supervisory visits to HIV facilities and monthly review meetings, addresses supply chain management issues through inter and intra-district transfers and makes troubleshoot visits, wherever necessary. With the changing epidemic scenario in the country, there is a felt need to restructure the institutional mechanism to monitor the implementation of NACP activities at the district level. DAPCU districts in North Eastern states viz. Mizoram, Manipur and Nagaland contributed significantly to the development of the District Integrated Action Plan. Such involvement of DAPCUs will ensure district ownership and use of field intelligence in the policy formulations at the state level. DAPCU staff were trained using virtual platforms on the management of HIV related services during Covid-19 scenario, right at the beginning of the pandemic in India. This ensured bridging 142 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 of gaps in service delivery in real time and avoid any inconvenience to the HRGs and PLHIVs to the extent possible. DAPCUs were instrumental in distribution of essentials during this pandemic to PLHIVs. They helped in the constitution of Community Advisory Boards (CAB) in many of the states as per the directions from NACO. Meetings of District AIDS Prevention and Control Committee, chaired by the District Collector or a representative from the district administration were organised through online platforms, ensuring that the issues with respect to service delivery were discussed and addressed at the highest level within the district. This pandemic witnessed migration and reverse migration of informal labours/ workers on a large scale. This opportunity was utilised to reach out to them, wherever possible to conduct ICTC and STI camps. DAPCUs also contributed significantly to the distribution of PPE Kits and dry ration to the sex workers enrolled under NACP , as per the guidance given by NACO based on the directions of Hon'ble Supreme Court. Timely coordination with the local food and civil supplies and other line departments ensured accomplishing the task. Condom ProgrammeDistribution of free condoms to the HRG population has been the mainstay of prevention programmes under NACP . In FY 2020-21, efforts have been made to distribute free condoms through HIV facilities also, apart from the TI project settings. In comparison to last year's budget allocation of Rs 40 crore, this year, an allocation of Rs 77 crores was done to meet the increased demand given the increase in number of TIs and provision of free condoms for HRGs at HIV facilities like ICTC, DSRC and ART centres. 1.8.5 IEC, Y outh & Mainstreaming 1.8.5.1 Information, Education & Communication (IEC) One of the key components under NACP is to expand IEC services for general population and HRGs with a focus on behaviour change and demand generation. IEC has been an important component of NACP . With the expansion of services for counselling and testing, ART, STI treatment and condom promotion, demand generation campaigns are continuing to be the focus of NACP communication strategy. IEC remains an important component of all prevention efforts and includes: BCC strategies for HRGs, vulnerable groups and hard-to-reach populations Increasing awareness among general population, particularly women and youth Mass Media Campaigns NACO as well as SACS has undertaken 360-degree multimedia campaigns on various thematic areas related to HIV i.e Y outh & HIV , Promotion of HIV counselling and testing, condom promotion, EMCT, stigma & discrimination, STI and promotion of VBD on Doordarshan, Cable and Satellite channels, All India Radio (AIR), and FM radio networks. To amplify reach of mass media campaigns, innovative technologies were utilised like dissemination of advertisements through cinema theatres and Internet. Outdoor Activity Outdoor activities like hoardings, bus panels, pole kiosks, information panels and panels in railways and metro trains were implemented by SACS package includes various type of materials like TVC, short animated videos, GIFs, Radio jingles, comic strips, posters and flip books etc. The material is developed to improve information seeking behaviour among HRGs and Bridge population, promote correct and consistent use of condom, seek regular testing including community-based screening, facilitate ART adherence, reduce stigma and discrimination and to promote HIV and AIDS (Prevention & Control) Act, 2017 The objective of this SBCC package is as below: 1. To influence and support behaviour changeamong key population and bridge population/high-risk population with respect to HIV services in India. 2. Enhance skills of service providers to conducted improved IPC sessions. B. Development of IEC material on Treatment Literacy: The ART reduces the HIV-related morbidity and mortality; prevents HIV transmission by suppressing the viral load improving the quality of life of PLHIV . ART being a life-long treatment, retention in care remains the essential component for achieving viral suppression. Keeping in view, NACO has developed IEC material on treatment literacy to promote treatment adherence and address related issues to the treatment. This material has been developed provide correct information about HIV 143 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 to disseminate information on HIV prevention and related services. Wall writings have been emphasised in many States to maximise the reach of HIV awareness to rural population. The National Toll Free Helpline No. 1097 has been promoted in all outdoor activities. Social MediaDigital interventions in present times are the cheapest mean of communication and certainly most powerful to increase reach to masses. To optimally utilise this opportunity, NACO is presently active on Facebook, Twitter & Y ouTube as @nacoindia.naco started with its Twitter handle and tried to develop, upload and share content around different themes such as safe behaviour, condom usage, stigma and discrimination, myths and misconceptions, important health days observed around the globe and days of other national and international significance. The idea behind exploring these digital platforms has been to bring upfront issues related to wellbeing of PLHIV and to eliminate stigmatised and discriminated attitude against these people and their families. Development of IEC Material A. SBCC package for HRG and Bridge population: NACO has developed SBCC package for key population, bridge population and service providers. The package includes various type of materials like TVC, short animated videos, GIFs, Radio jingles, comic strips, posters and flip books etc. The material is developed to improve information seeking behaviour among HRGs and Bridge population, promote correct and consistent use of condom, seek regular testing including community-based screening, facilitate ART adherence, reduce stigma and discrimination and to promote HIV and AIDS (Prevention & Control) Act, 2017 The objective of this SBCC package is as below: 1.

Members of RRCs were actively engaged in pandemic awareness activities, conducted throughout the state in quarantine centres and affected neighbourhoods. RRC Quiz Competition: To actively involve and engage members of RRCs in disseminating information related to HIV/AIDS, adolescent health, mental health and any other public health threat etc. and make them discuss these issues through the mode of quiz competition for RRC activity was planned for the current year. The level of team selection starts with organising quiz competition at district/state/regional/national level. National level quiz competition conducted on World AIDS Day, 2020 and regional level quiz competition in mid-November. Due to COVID situation, SACS are conducting district level and state level quiz competition through online mode. Out of school youth (OSY): Intervention aims to sensitise school dropouts who are not covered under AEP . This year, SACS has conducted most of the trainings through virtual mode in coordination with NYKS. It is implemented through NIOS (learners' engagement activities) and NYKS (state level engagements). The programme is functional in 22 states of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal with Ministries and Roll-out of MoUs: Mainstreaming & Partnership is one of the key strategies to garner support in NACP with regard to vulnerability reduction, integration of HIV related services in existing health infrastructure of non-health ministry's/ department and social protection for people infected and affected by HIV and HRGs and most at risk population. NACO has formalised partnership with 18 key Ministries/ Departments of GoI by entering into MoUs. Joint Working Groups (JWG) meetings are conducted at the national and State level with an objective to implement activities as laid out in the MoU. The State AIDS Control Societies (SACS) are given responsibility to conduct Joint Working Group in coordination with departments concerned and other key stakeholders to implement activities in mutual support. Joint Working Groups (JWGs) meetings were conducted. Departments who are having similar mandate were invited togather by SACS. JWGs are conducted in most of the States thematically as ; (I) JWG for Social departments (Social Justice, Disability Affairs, Rural Development, Housing & Poverty Alleviation, Higher Education, Labour etc.); (II) JWG for Infrastructural Departments/PSUs. (Shipping, Petroleum & Natural Gas, Commerce, Coal, Telecommunication, Electronics & Information Technology, Road Transport & Highways etc.) (III) JWG for Uniformed Forces (Defence, CAPF, Paramilitary, Home/State Police etc.), and (IV) JWG for Y outh (Sports, Y outh, Education etc.).146 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 B.

Both NACO and NCPCR agreed for collaborative action to address issues related to Child Living with HIV (CLHIV) and affected and vulnerable children. 1.8.6 STI & RTI Control & Prevention The prevention and control of STIs is a well-recognised, cost effective strategy for controlling HIV transmission and reducing reproductive morbidity. Early diagnosis: appropriate and complete treatment of STI/RTI reduces the transmission rate of HIV infection by more than 40%. Syndromic Case Management (SCM), with minimal laboratory tests is the cornerstone of STI/RTI management under NACP . The key strategies for STI prevention and control are Interrupt transmission where it spreads fastest and provides services for all who may need them. Currently, there are 1,165 NACO supported DSRC across the country (at least one DSRC per district). There are two arms of DSRC, namely Obstetrics & Gynaecology OPD and STI OPD under DVD clinics which provide services through the existing public health care delivery system. The details of number of individuals who availed STI services and diagnosed STI and pregnant women tested for Syphilis and diagnosed syphilis for 2020 (January to September) along with NE data is given below:STI/RTI testing and Sero-prevalence at DSRCs (January to September 2020) Indicator All India No. of individuals who availed RPR/ VRDRL service22,27,797 No. of individuals Reactive 8,751 Percentage individuals reactive 0.4% No. of individuals referred to ICTC for HIV test18,68,992 No. of individuals found HIV positive7,496 Percentage of individuals found HIV positive 0.4% Total ANC registrations reported in STI/RTI centre26,05,434 No. of PWs tested for Syphilis 22,50,580 treated for Syphilis65.3% Source: data *Out of total registration at DSRCs NACO's target is to manage 100.15 lakh episodes of STI/RTI in 2020-21, out of which the programme has achieved 22.3 lakh (22%) till September 2020. Pre-packed STI/RTI colour-coded KitsThe colour coded STI/RTI kits have been provided for free supply at all DSRCs and TI NGOs to standardise the treatment. The pre-packaging of drugs is being recognised as one of the global innovations in STI programme management. The drugs used to treat common STI/RTI are included in the National/State List of Essential Drugs. 148 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 STI/RTI colour-coded Kits Regional STI/RTI Training, Research and Reference Laboratories There are 10 functional Regional STI Training, Reference and Research Laboratories supported and strengthened by NACO. These are located at Osmania Medical College Hyderabad, Medical College Kolkata and Institute of Serology Kolkata, Government Medical College Nagpur, Government Medical College Baroda, Institute of Venereology, Chennai, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, BYL Nair Hospital, Topiwala National Medical College, Mumbai, Government Medical College, Guwahati, Assam, Post Graduate Institution of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh and Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi (which acts as the Apex Centre as well as Regional Laboratory for the country). The key function of these laboratories is to provide etiologic diagnosis of common STI/RTI syndromes, validation of syndromic diagnosis, monitoring of drug sensitivity of gonococci and implementation of Syphilis External Quality Assessment Service (EQAS). Training and Capacity building and regular onsite mentoring of STI/RTI service providers Standardised training curriculum for doctors, staff nurses, laboratory technicians and counsellors is in place. The training to these staff members is provided in a cascade form through a cadre of national, state and regional resource faculties across states. All faculty members have been trained using the same training material, following adult learning methods. The state and regional resource faculties in turn have conducted training of STI/RTI clinic staff in the designated clinic and TI NGO. Additionally, each district has district resource facilities for training doctors, nurses and laboratory technicians on STI/RTI management for sub district health facilities (PHC, CHC, and Sub -district hospital), and doctors in private sector also. Provision of STI/RTI Services in HRG Population The provision of a standardised package of STI/ RTI services to HRG population is an important component of TI projects. All the core group population receives package of services which include: * Free consultation and treatment for their symptomatic STI complaints * Quarterly medical check-up * Asymptomatic treatment (presumptive treatment) * Bi-annual syphilis and HIV screening Preferred Private Provider approach has been rolled out to scale up STI/RTI services to HRG population under TI Projects. These providers are selected by community members through group consultation. This approach has enhanced access to services for HRGs. Under this approach, all HRGs receive free STI/RTI treatment and providers receive a token fee of Rs.75 per consultation. All these preferred providers are trained using a standardised curriculum on syndromic case management. Colour coded STI/RTI drug kits have been made available to 149 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 providers for free treatment of sex workers, MSM and IDU while data collection tools have also been provided to them. Partnering with PSU and Professional Organisation The major proportion of patients with STI/RTI seek services from the vast network of private health care delivery systems ranging from freelance private practitioners to large public hospitals. Also, many populations are accessing services from public health care systems under other sectors like railways, ESI, Armed Forces, CGHS, Railways, Port hospitals as well as health facilities of public sector undertakings like Coal India Ltd, SAIL etc. In order to reach maximum number of people suffering from STI/RTI it is important to partner with the private sector and organised public sector. NACO has initiated partnership with organised public sector and private sector through professional associations to support the delivery of STI/RTI services so as to reach the populations presently not covered by the public health care delivery system. STI/RTI services have been rolled out in major port hospitals, ESIC, private medical colleges. 1.8.7 Blood Transfusion Services (BTS) During the initial phases of the HIV epidemic, unsafe blood transfusion contributed to its spead making BTS vis-a-vis safe blood practices part of the NACP mandate. NACO has been primarily responsible for ensuring provision of safe blood for the country since 1992. DCG (I), under MoHFW made mandatory testing of collected blood at blood centres for five types of Transfusion Transmissible Infections i.e. HIV , HBV , HCV , Malaria Syphilis. Safe blood (free of HIV , Malaria, Syphilis, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C). This was done through BTS delivered via the 1,131 NACO supported blood banks.The annual estimated clinical requirement of blood for the country is estimated at 14.6 million units of blood and the endeavour is to meet the blood needs of the country through voluntary non-remunerated donation and a well-coordinated and networked BTS. 1.8.7.1 \"The National Blood System should be governed by a National Blood Policy and legislative framework to promote uniform implementation of standards and consistency in the quality and safety of blood and blood products. Countries must have well-organised and coordinated BTS with coordination at national and/or sub-national levels. \" World Health Organization 1.8.7.2 A landmark Judgement of Supreme Court of India, dated 04.01.1996: \" A National Council on Blood Transfusion should be established. It should consist of Director General of Health Services, Drug Controller of India, representatives of Ministry of Finance, Secretariat under charge of a Director by Ministry of Health, will be policy formulating body related to all matters pertaining to operation of blood banks\" 1.8.7.3 Organisational Structure of BTS in the Country 150 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 The National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) is a society registered under the Societies Registration Act 1860. It has representation from the DGHS, DCI, representatives from IFD, JS-NHM, Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS), major medical institutions in the country, representatives from private blood banks and NGOs that run blood banks under AS & DG NACO, MoHFW . The functions of NBTC as the policy formulating apex body in relation to all matters pertaining to operation of blood centres are as follows: Commitment to provide safe and adequate quantity of blood, blood components and blood products through an organized blood transfusion service in the country Formulate and implement the National Blood Policy and implement the National Blood Programme in the country; make latest technology available for operating BTS and encourage appropriate use of blood and blood product; and encourage research and development of field transfusion medicine and related technology Take adequate regulatory and legislative steps in the blood transfusion process and provide an adequate resource policy framework of blood bank services in the country NBTC and State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) are the apex bodies responsible for BTS at national and state level respectively. State Blood Transfusion Councils (SBTC): There are 35 STBCs headed by Principal Secretary Health, which are to implement policy guidelines of NBTC, but are otherwise independent societies in themselves. The BTS comprise of 3,321 licensed blood banks across all states and sectors, of which a network of 1,131 blood banks are supported by NACO in the way of support for manpower. This includes blood centre counsellors and lab technicians, promotion of VBD, support for consumables like blood bags and TTI testing kits and one time support for equipment and consumables etc. Key Strategies: The Government has adopted a comprehensive approach towards strengthening BTS with few key strategies: Increasing regular voluntary non- remunerated blood donation to meet the safe blood requirements of safe blood in the country Promoting component preparation and availability along with rational use of blood in health care facilities and building capacity of health care providers to achieve this objective Enhancing blood access through a well networked regionally coordinated BTS; Establishing Quality Management Systems to ensure safe and quality blood and Building implementation structures and referral linkages During NACP , the availability of safe blood increased from 44 lakh units in 2007 to 12.5 million units by 2019-20. During this phase, incidence of donor HIV sero-reactivity has declined from 1.2% to 0.12% in 2019-20 in NACO supported blood banks. Overall 79% of blood was subjected to componentisation in NACO supported Blood Component Separation units in 2019-20 Collection and Availability of Blood from January to October 2020151 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Indicator 2018-19 2019-20 2020* Total collection (in millions) 12.4 12.5 8.1 Collection in NACO supported BB (in millions)8.6 7.3 4.7 VBD in NACO supported BB (%)76 76 74 HIV (%) 0.14 HBsAg (%) 0.78 0.78 0.73 HCV (%) 0.33 0.28 0.32 MP (%) 0.05 0.02 0.04 VDRL (%) 0.23 0.21 0.25 Component Separation in NACO supported BCSU (%)75.05% 79 81 Blood collection across all blood centres in India and blood collection in NACO supported blood centres During FY 2019-20, 12.5 million blood units were collected across the country and in NACO supported blood banks around 7.3 million units of blood were collected comprising 58% of the total collection of blood in the country. Blood collection in NACO supported Blood Centres through voluntary blood donationDuring FY 2019-20, around 7.3 million units of blood were collected in NACO supported Blood Centers and 76% of blood collection in NACO supported blood centres was through VBD. The VBD percentage was comparatively lower than previous years due to change in definition of VBD so as to exclude family donors. Component Separation in NACO supported Model Blood Centres and BCSUs Overall 79% of blood was subjected to componentisation in NACO supported Blood Component Separation units in 2019-20 and in the year 2020 nearly 81% blood was subjected to componentisation. TTI Sero Positivity in Blood Centres TTI reactivity of the blood collected in the blood centres shows gradual reduction for almost all TTIs except that of syphilis which showed an uptrend since 2016-17. 1.8.7.4 Activities of NBTC in 2020 include Approval of Annual Action Plan for BTS for FY 2020-21 for Rs. 96.96 crore 152 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 EQAS through three Proficiency Testing providers @ Rs. 4,000 per blood bank per year for 750 NACO supported blood banks Meeting of Expert Working Group for VBD held on 07.02.2020 Technical Resource Group meeting for BTS held on 03.03.2020 NBTC conducted a meeting in consultation with stakeholders SACS, NHM, DGHS, ICMR, WHO, CDC, CDSCO, IRCS and Transfusion Medicine experts for developing National guidelines for BTS in the country. NBTC circulated its first interim National Guidance for BTS in India in light of COVID-19 pandemic on 25.03.2020 followed by second interim National Guidance for BTS on 25 th June 2020 NBTC had undertaken an Inter-Ministerial coordination with Ministry of Home Affairs for taking steps to promote VBD and maintaining adequate stock of safe blood at blood centres across the country Hon'ble HFM reviewed the current Status of BTS in the country on 09.04.2020 NBTS had various review meetings with the SBTCs in view of COVID-19 pandemic National Review meetings were held with SACS in the five geographical regions of the country to review the status of BTS World Blood Donor Day was celebrated on 14.06.2020 in collaboration with SBTC across the country National Voluntary Blood Donation Day was observed through a National event on 01.10.2020 Quarterly Blood Donation Drives were conducted at NACO office in New Delhi Nation-wide VBD drives were conducted in partnership with voluntary organisations Bringing the processing charges for Blood and Blood Components under the ambit of Drugs (Price Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO) is under active consideration of MoHFW . The meeting regarding the same is conducted on 04.08.2020 with officials of National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) Discussions were held regarding collaboration with NITI AYOG on strengthening BTS in one aspirational district of UP (Sonebhadra) Promotion of Voluntary Blood Donation Special days such as World Blood Donor Day and National Voluntary Blood Donation Day were observed at national and State levels recognising the contribution of repeat non-remunerated repeat VBDs. NBTC created communication material with logo \"Raktdaan Kar Ke Dekho Accha Lagta Hai\" and began a social media initiative called \" Raktdaan India\" using different modes of communication. The objective was to spread awareness amongst people on blood donation and motivating them to participate in VBD camps and walks to encourage blood donation. These were used extensively in all IEC materials developed at the National and State level and on social media. 1.8.8 HIV Counseling And Testing Services, Including HIV TB Collaboration and PPTCT Under NACP , HIV Counselling and Testing Service (HCTS) is providing through HIV Counselling and Testing Service Centres (HCTSc) for general public as well as pregnant women free of cost*. These HCTSc are mainly located in health care facilities such as Government and private hospitals and health clinics. It is the primary place, where diagnosis of HIV infection 153 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 is done and HIV infected people are linked with HIV Care and Treatment Services (CST). It also provides an important opportunity to reinforce HIV prevention via counselling. The national programme for HIV prevention initiated this service in 1997 with the aim of identifying PLHIV and linking them appropriately and on timely basis to prevention, care and treatment services. The introduction of ART services for PLHIV/AIDS in 2004, gave a major boost to counselling and testing services in the country. The HCTSc include the following components HIV Counselling and Testing Services of General Individuals, PPTCT & EMTCT Community Based Screening (CBS) HIV/TB collaborative activities 1.8.8.1 HIV Counselling and Testing Service Centre (HCTS) There are many classifications of HCTS facilities in India, which include Standalone Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (SA-ICTC), Mobile ICTC, Facility Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (F-ICTCs), PPP ICTCs and Community Based Screening for HIV (CBS) for HIV including VHND. The HCTS Centre is the new terminology of ICTC after the release of the National HCTS Guideline, December 2016. It aims to offer HIV testing to every pregnant woman in the country, enhance detection of all HIV positive pregnant women and eliminate transmission of HIV from parent to child. Every year there is an increase in the number of F-ICTCs in the country, clearly highlighting integration of counselling and testing services under general health services, increase in geographical coverage of these services below block level, better accessibility and addressing issues relating to sustainability. *Some PPP HCTSc levied charge for HIV testing due to usage of their own test kit.Scale-up of HCTS during the period 2007-08 to 2020-21 (till September) 1.8.8.1.1 HIV Counselling and Testing Services of General Individuals During 2020 (till September), around 135.1 lakh general individuals were tested for HIV , out of which 79,200 were diagnosed HIV Positive. The Figure below shows year-wise general individuals tested for HIV and the rate of positivity. Figure 1.8.8.1.1: Scale-up of General Individuals (excluding pregnant women) tested and positivity in ICTCs during 2007-08 to 2020 (till September) 1.8.8.1.2 PPTCT and EMTCT The PPTCT programme was started in the country in the year 2002 with the aim of offering HIV testing to every pregnant woman (universal 154 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 coverage). As of September,2019 this service is being offered through more than 33,000 HCTS centres in the entire country. The aim of the HCTS centres, which offers PPTCT services, is to identify all estimated HIV positive pregnant women and eliminate transmission of HIV from mother-to-child. During FY 2015-16, NACO decided to implement EID service through all SA-ICTCs (fixed) nation-wide. Currently this service is available through more than 5,300 HIV confirmatory sites, i.e; SA-ICTCs. During 2020, till the month of September, about 157.5 lakh of pregnant women were tested for HIV and 5,525 new cases (including PNC mother) & 3554 known cases (Source MPR-CST) HIV positive cases were reported, out of a total of 9,079 HIV pregnant women reported, 91% or 8,296 were initiated on lifelong ART. During the same period, around 7,669 HIV exposed live births were reported, out of which 6,524 (85%) babies received ARV prophylaxis. Scale-up of pregnant women tested and found positive in ICTCs during 2006-07 to 2020 (till September) Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) A child may acquire HIV from the HIV infected mother-in-utero (during pregnancy), peripartum (during delivery), postpartum (through breastfeeding) or via parenteral exposure through infected needles and syringes. In children who acquire HIV in-utero and peripartum, disease progression occurs rapidly in the first few months of life, often leading to death. Studies suggest that in the absence of diagnostics, care and treatment, about 35% of HIV-infected children die in the first year of life, 50% by their second birthday, and 60% by their third birthday. The HIV exposed infants born to infected pregnant women have to undergo DNA-PCR tests using Dried Blood Spot (DBS) test. During 2020, till the month of September as many as 6,857 babies had undergone DNA PCR test with 6 weeks to 6 month. Out of this 48 were confirmed HIV positive Further, during the same period 5,746 HIV exposed babies who attained 18 months of age had undergone antibody test, of which 206 were confirmed HIV Positive and 176 were put on ART. 1.8.8.1.3 EMTCT: It is estimated 20,517 (2019 data) women living with HIV become pregnant in the country. If those were untreated, they would have 15- 45% chance of transmitting the virus to their children during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding. However, the risk drops to just over 1% if ARV medicines are given to mothers and children at stages when chances of transmission can occur. As treatment for PMCT is not 100% effective, elimination of transmission is defined as a reduction of transmission to such a low level that it no longer constitutes a public health problem. India is a signatory to achieving EMTCT of HIV and Syphilis by 2020. A roadmap for achieving EMTCT was prepared and has been steadily rolled-out under the current NACP . Looking at elimination of MTCT goals, NACO conducted data verification for EMTCT of HIV & Syphilis in the 6 identified States for Maharashtra demonstrating successful implementation and achievement of EMTCT. This was based on certain programme indicators which were outlined in the global guidelines on criteria and process of EMTCT verification.155 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 To accelerate the activities towards EMTCT data verification exercise in the States, NACO initiated the process of data verification in the identified EMTCT Phase-2 States and covered Assam, going on in 19 States (Phase-1 & Phase-2). 1.8.8.2 Community Based Screening approach: CBS is an important approach for improving early diagnosis, reaching first-time testers and people who seldom use clinical services, including men and adolescents in high-prevalence settings and HRG populations. To improve HCTS access and coverage, community-based HIV screening is carried out through various approaches such as: - Mobile HCTS Screening by ancillary health-care providers (ANC) Screening for HIV by TI (TI-ICTC) HCTS for prison inmates HCTS at the workplace Currently bulk of CBS efforts are by targeting HRGs via TIs, Other Development Partners and CSO. SOPs for CBS and training manual \"Testing through TI\" for Community Based HIV testing under National HIV Counselling & Testing Service Guidelines, 2016 has been shared with all states. As of September 2020, in India 2,569 CBS sites were established under different settings as mentioned above and reporting to NACP through SIMS.As per the current SIMS Report, 31 states are implementing CBS and provided HIV testing/screening services to 26,51,158 individuals including pregnant women from January 20 to September 20). 1.8.8.3 HIV/TB Collaborative Activities Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV are major public health problems globally and particularly in India. They are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among all infectious diseases. In 2019, India accounted for an estimated 71,000 (49,000- 98,000) incidents of HIVTB co-infected patients against the previous estimate of 92,000 HIVTB coinfected patients (63,000-1,26,000) in 2018 (WHO's Global TB report 2020). The GoI is committed to achieve fast track targets of 90-90-90 by 2020 and end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. The target of eliminating TB under SDGs has been advanced to 2025, five years ahead of the global timeline. A joint effort in the form of HIV-TB collaborative activity by NACP and NTEP , (previously called RNTCP-Revised NTCP) addressed the dual burden of TB and HIV initiated in six high burden states in 2001 and expanded across the country by 2008. Interventions were developed to ensure prompt detection of patients with TB-HIV comorbidity. These interventions helped reduce TB related fatalities by 82% (Baseline 2010) among PLHIV to meet the 2020 end TB target. The objectives of the collaboration were to have close coordination between NTEP and NACP at National, State and District levels and to decrease morbidity and mortality due to TB among PLHIV/AIDS. The framework adopted a four-pronged strategy: 1. Preventive activities focusing on INH Preventive Therapy (IPT) and Airborne Infection Control (AIC) measures 2. Early detection of TB/HIV with the use of molecular diagnostics (CBNAAT/ TrueNAAT)156 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 3. Prompt treatment of TB/HIV with Fixed Dosage Combination (FDC), including test and treat policy for PLHIV 4. Management of TB/HIV cases in special situations In year 2019, MoHFW has restructured TB-HIV collaboration committee into TB-Comorbidity Collaborative Committee at National, State and District level. This will again help in addressing other co-morbidities among TB/TB-HIV patients like malnutrition, diabetes, tobacco consumption etc. HIV-TB services are also provided as a referral service to the most HIV vulnerable populations. During routine outreach services, Peer Educators and other outreach team members screen HRGs and bridge populations (Truckers and Migrants) for TB symptoms and refer them to the nearest TB centre for early diagnosis and treatment. Achievements For early detection of HIV among presumptive TB patients, Provider Initiated Testing and Counselling (PITC) is being implemented across country More than 90% of notified TB patients know their HIV status (Public:93%, Private:80%) Nearly 64% of Designated Microscopy Centres (DMCs) are co-located/located in proximity to HIV testing facilities More than 6 lakh PLHIV are given access to rapid molecular testing via CBNAAT for TB diagnosis Single window TB and HIV services are being implemented through existing 576 ART centres and these services are being further scaled up. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Multi-Month Dispensation (MMD) of medicines, teleconsultations and newer ways of service delivery are being considered Services include counselling of PLHIV , Opportunistic Infection (OI) management and ART/CPT provision, TB screening among ART centre attendees using four symptoms tool. Based on TB status, PLHIV are being offered TB treatment or TB preventive therapy after careful evaluation by ART MO Over 90% PLHIV visiting ART centres every month are screened for any existing TB symptoms Linkage of HIV-TB co-infected patients to Cotrimoxazole Preventive Therapy (CPT) and ART are 95% & 93% respectively (January to September 2020) More than 10 lakh PLHIV have been initiated on TB Preventive Therapy since December 2016. To further expand service delivery, central government has issued Gazette Notification by GoI dated June 27, 2019 about mandatory requirement of ART centres and Drug Resistant TB services in all medical colleges. Key interventions to strengthen HIV-TB collaborative activities I. Intensified TB Case Finding (ICF) ICF at ICTC: Under ICF, all ICTC clients are screened by ICTC counsellors for presence of TB symptoms at the time of pre and post-test counselling. Clients who have symptoms or signs of TB, irrespective of their HIV status, are referred to NTEP diagnostic facility located in nearest/co-located institution. During FY 2020-21 (April-September 2020) as many as 6,98,405 (8%) of general clients (except pregnant women) receiving pre-test counselling/information were referred for TB testing from ICTC and 35,508 were detected as TB cases which is 5% of out of those referred.157 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 ICF at ART Center: PLHIV diagnosed with TB are linked to first line anti TB drugs daily regimen for TB patients diagnosed in the respective ART centers while those with need for second line drugs are linked to the nearest Drug Resistant TB site (District/Nodal DRTB site). 93% (5,272,677 out of 5,677,435) PLHIV attending ART centres were screened for ICF for four TB symptoms at ART centres and subsequently 5.2% (2,74,103 out of 5,272,677) were identified as 73% (2,00,625 , among 93% (1,87,318 out of 2,00,625) were for TB and 17,107 PLHIVs were diagnosed with TB i.e., 9% as per monthly ART centre report (Source: MPR-September 2020). II. Use of molecular diagnostic (CBNAAT or TrueNAAT) for early diagnosis of TB and Rifampicin drug resistance among PLHIV NAAT in the form of CBNAAT or TrueNAAT is preferred and sensitive rapid TB diagnostic tool recommended for TB diagnosis in PLHIV and is available in all districts of the country. TrueNAAT is a new diagnostic tool recently added for providing TB and DRTB detection at block level apart from existing network of 1,128 CBNAAT laboratories in the country. The scale up of this diagnostic modality will further help in early diagnosis of TB and Rif Resistance among PLHIV . TPT (Isoniazid Isoniazid (INH) is the most effective bactericidal drug. It protects against both progression of latent TB infection (LTBI) to active disease (reactivation) as well as from re-infection when exposed to active TB case. IPT coverage among eligible PLHIV is 52% (1,114,181) as on September 2020. Also, IPT is one of the 3I strategy globally recommended for prevention of incident TB among HIV infected individuals. It is a key public health intervention for the prevention of TB among PLHIV and has been recommended as part of a comprehensive HIV and AIDS care strategy. NACP also plans to adopt safer, shorter and effective regimen for TPT, once sufficient in country evidence is available for the same. Priority Areas for 2020-21: To universalise access to HIV testing and treatment, NACP is considering further expansion of HIV testing services so that diagnosis of HIV as well as TB can be offered in the same facility and HIV can be detected at an early stage. Another area of importance will be capacity building of new HIV testing centres and ART centres. This will enable health care workers to undertake regular reporting using digital platforms like SOCH/IMS SOCH, strengthening single window service delivery of ART centres, improve HIV testing coverage among TB patients in the private sector and coverage of TB Preventive Therapy (TPT) for eligible PLHIV . Interventions will also include intensifying TB case findings at TI/Prison/HRG settings, Integration of Nikshay online portal under NTEP and SOCH online portal of NACP and generating evidence for shorter and effective regimen for TB preventive therapy among PLHIV . 1.8.8.4 Quality Improvement activities for Basic Services under NACP I. Supervision and Monitoring Mechanism: Regular Supportive Supervisory visit was conducted by NACO officials to NACP facilities to review on-ground implementation of NACP 158 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 services. The monitoring and supervision visits were aligned to cover testing services, PPTCT services, HIV-TB coordination activities and STI RTI services provided under NACP . Supervision and monitoring of HCTS activities is being done at National and state level with the help of SIMS, PALS and IMS/SOCH software systems. II. Quality assurance and EQAS: Diagnostic services provided through ICTCs across the country are strictly monitored by a strong Internal and EQAS. III. Supply Chain Management: A robust inventory management system with a strong supervision of supply chain activities at National and State level is in place for ensuring timely supply of diagnostic kits with proper maintenance of cold chain and colour coded kits for STI management at DSRCs. The inventory status for all commodities at the State, District and Facility level is monitored on monthly basis at the National level IV . Review meetings: As part of the programme, the BSD, NACO has been conducting review meetings on BSD components at regular intervals both at National and State level on virtual platforms. This includes, review meetings for SACS (ICTC/PPTCT) and STI components, National TB HIV Joint review meetings, National TB HIV Coordination Committee (NTCC) and, National TB HIV Technical Working Group (NTWG) meetings. The main purpose of the meeting is evaluating performance of States/UTs under NACP . InnovationsAssisted Partner Notification: India is committed to achieving the 90-90-90 targets across the country and population groups by 2020.To reach the second and third 90, it is necessary to first achieve the first target i.e 90% of PLHIV know their status. This cannot be achieved unless the programme significantly scales up HIV testing and counseling in key geographies and populations with highest yield, using a blend of strategies including facility based services, use of mobile clinics /vans and community based testing etc. One of the Strategies under process to increase HIV testing under BSD is introduction of Index testing (or partner notification services). Index testing services are considered critical to achieve UNAIDS -first 90, has also been recognized by WHO. Global evidence shows that the yield (number of new PLHIV identified) from Index testing services ranges from 20-40% and similar results have been reported in North east India through Project Sunrise. Index testing (or partner notification services) is a voluntary case-finding approach that focuses on eliciting the sexual and/or needle sharing partners and biological children of consenting HIV-positive individuals and offering them HIV Counseling and testing services (HCTS). In the existing process, one HIV-positive person is encouraged through counseling to share the positive result with his/her spouse, sexual or needle -sharing partner(s) and bring the spouse or partner for counseling to ICTC. This process of helping the individual share the result might take more than one visit. Then the partner is linked to ICTC and is provided counseling and testing services depending on results he is further linked to ART if found positive. The present process is able to bring only approximately 45% spouses to the system. This is passive spouse referral in which HIV-positive clients are encouraged by a trained provider to disclose their status to their sexual and/or drug injecting partners by themselves, and to also suggest HTS to the partner(s) given their potential exposure to HIV infection. There is high level of uncertainty on disclosure of his status by index client to the partner which leads to the existing gap and could be a hindering to reach 1st 90. 159 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Way Forward: NACO has conducted sensitization meetings with states and is in the process of introducing Assisted Partner Notification (Index testing) in the program in phased manner. Operational correction of linkage loss from F-ICTC to SA-ICTC: To increase access of at-risk population to HCTS in a cost-effective manner, NACO in addition to establishing SA-ICTC at CHC and higher levels, has evolved a strategy with the RCH programme for integrating HIV screening at all PHCs and delivery points across India. They are labelled as Facility Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (F-ICTCs) linked to the nearest SA-ICTC. HIV screening at all F-ICTCs is implemented through their existing staff with due sensitisation, orientation, guidance, monitoring and supervision by the linked SA-ICTC. This mechanism of taking HCTS closer to people has increased the uptake of services while reducing transportation costs and waiting time. Further, integrating HCTS into the general health system will ensure sustainability, cost-effectiveness and facilitate mainstreaming of HCTS. This will also ensure achievement of the national objectives of eliminating HIV and syphilis among newborns. BSD, NACO organised an assessment with the support of partner organisations (Saathi & Plan) to investigate the reasons and suggest corrective measures to fill gaps in confirmation of screened reactive pregnant women for programmatic improvements. Way forward:Based on the recommendations from the findings from Root cause analysis of linkage loss analysis done in 12 identified States, SOPs for correction of linkage loss are being drafted and will be disseminated to the States.Innovations and Way forward on HIV-TB Activities under BSD Digital platforms for inventory management system: NACP created digital platform for inventory Management System (IMS-SOCH) since 20.08.2019 which is being utilised for dispensing drugs to PLHIV at ART centers (ARV drugs, anti-TB drugs and IPT drugs). In August 2020, NACP conducted a master ToT to build capacity of State/UTs for cascading training and use of IMS-SOCH portal for drug dispensation. NACP is also working towards integrating IMS- SOCH with Nikshay Aushadhi portal of NTEP so that drug related information is available on real time and paperless user-friendly supply chain management system is available Implementation of E-Learning Module on HCTS guideline: This will digitalize training of HCTS staff with the aim of introducing innovation in technology and ease of comfort for counsellors, lab technicians and other critical partners. NACO, in collaboration with UNAIDS has captured the National HCTS guidelines in an engaging, simplistic and retainable eLearning module in Hindi and English language to facilitate smooth scale up, efficient implementation and uptake of HCTS. Community Based Screening (CBS) of HIV: This is being scaled up through TI projects, VHND level screening of pregnant women and though CSOs. Community based screening has also been initiated through Care Support Centres (CSC). Way forward* Scale up HIV testing at TB service delivery points by operationalisation of F-ICTC at TB diagnostic laboratories for expansion of HIV testing services. * Improve HIV testing coverage among TB patients notified from the pivate sector in coordination with NTEP160 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 * Saturate eligible PLHIV population for TB preventive therapy, improve TPT completion rates using innovative digital solutions and evidence generation with further scale up of TB preventive therapy. * Introduce newer diagnostic like TB-LAM for TB detection among PLHIV with advanced disease * Strengthen capacity building at all levels for use of SOCH and IMS-SOCH for digitisation of patient records, monitoring of key performance indicators and review. * Promote use of digital learning platforms like e-NISHCHIT for sensitisation, training and review of ART centres and ICTC staff. * Implement risk assessment tools in ICTC to assess risk and vulnerability of self-initiated clients to reach first 90. * Scale up Community Based Screening of HIV and TB by TI Projects. 1.8.9 Care, Support and Treatment (CST) The Care, Support and Treatment (CST) component of NACP aims to improve the survival and quality of life of PLHIV with universal access to comprehensive, equitable and stigma free HIV care. CST services include free and universal access to lifelong standardised ART, free diagnostic and monitoring services (baseline laboratory investigations, CD4 testing, viral load testing, etc.), facilitating long-term retention in care, prevention, diagnosis and management of opportunistic infections, linkage to care and support services and linkage to social protection schemes. Facilities for ART Service DeliveryCare, Support and Treatment services are provided through a spectrum of service delivery facilities including Stand Alone ART Centres (SA-ARTCs), Centres of Excellence (CoEs), Paediatric Centres of Excellence (pCoEs), Facility Integrated ART Centres (FI-ARTCs), Link ART Centers (LACs), Link ART-Plus Centres (LAC Plus) and CSCs. There are active linkages and referral mechanisms between these centres to provide decentralised treatment and specialised care for the PLHIV . Types of Facilities for ART Service Delivery (as on September, 2020) ART Centres 576 (includes CoE, pCoE, ART plus, FI-ARTc, & PPP ARTc)CoE 11 pCoE 07 ART Plus93 PPP 27 Link ART Centre (includes LAC-Plus centres)1,264 Care & Support Centre 310 Beneficiaries of ART services Beneficiaries (Government Sector)Cumulative No. (as on September, 2020) PLHIV on ART 13,62,840 PLHIV on Second Line ARV drugs66,845 PLHIV on Third Line ARV drugs3,000 1.8.9.1 Achievements Scale up of facilities and services (2012-13 to 2019-20 & from January to September 2020) Improvement in ART retention cascade: ART retention cascade refers to the sequential steps of patients from diagnosis of HIV to linkage with ART care, ART initiation and retention of patients 161 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 who are on ART. After introduction of the 'Test & Treat Policy' in 2017, overall ART retention across the country improved significantly through intensified outreach activities (Mission Sampark & Intensified Mission Sampark) and interventions like implementation of Differentiated Service Delivery Models, quarterly feedback to States and ART centres based on 'Score-card' analysis of identified indicators, etc. NACO is closely monitoring the ART retention cascade as a quality indicator of State and facility level performance. Over the previous three years, the programme had seen noteworthy improvement in treatment retention. But the onset of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown affected testing services and all subsequent indicators of the care cascade from March to June 2020. However, after that due to partial unlock, indicators showed slight improvement. But the number of PLHIV alive on-ART has been decreasing gradually from March to September 2020. The three major stages in ART retention cascade are Linkage of Diagnosis to ART Registration at Treatment site, namely Treatment Initiation and Retention. HIV Diagnosis to ART Registration linkage entails those diagnosed positive at ICTC to be linked to ART centres for treatment and care. The programme has been making efforts to minimise this linkage loss. In the current year, around 94% of those diagnosed positive have been linked to ART registration at treatment sites. 1.8.9.2 Linkage of Diagnosis to Registration at Treatment siteART Initiation Rate: The programme has achieved remarkable improvement in the ART initiation rate, from 61% in 2013-14 to 91% in 2019-20. From January to September 2020, the ART initiation rate is 92.6% 1.8.9.3 Trend of ART Initiation Twelve-months retention: The data received from ART centres shows that the 12-month retention was 72% in 2017-18 and improved to 75% in 2018-19 but gradually decreased since then. The 12 months retention at the end of September 2020 was 70%. Differentiated Care The ART centre infrastructure under NACP expanded from 8 ART centres in 2004 to 576 as of September 2020. Currently, the national HIV programme provides free first line, second line and third line ARVs to approximately 13.63 lakh PLHIV . The implementation of \"Test and Treat\" policy since 2017, has resulted in expanded access to life saving ART but resulted in the following challenges: Overcrowding at ART centers Ensuring 12-month retention levels Enhancing adherence amongst on-ART patients These challenges were overcome through adoption of a 'Client centric' 'Differentiated Care' approach to service provision at ART centres. 162 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Monitoring and Feedback Mechanism The ART services have grown manyfold since the launch at 8 ART centres in 2004 to 576 ART centres in September 2020. These centres are providing free treatment to approximately 13.63 lakh PLHIV . Along with quantitative scale up, NACO has been working consistently towards maintaining the quality of services provided under the programme. The Score Card is being used to provide feedback every quarter and the performance of ART centres is reviewed at regular intervals. Score Card: The tool is developed with an intention to provide performance status of each ART centre on pre-decided critical indicators in an individual state at a single glance to programme managers at SACS. The performance under the indicators are denoted by colour coding where green denotes good performance, yellow average and red indicates performance deficit. These Scorecards are being sent quarterly to all SACS/ART centres. No. of ARTCs in different colour zones based on their performance 1. Quarterly Feedback Report: The report is developed by NACO to provide feedback on the position of the state's performance on the indicators critical in a way to achieve India's committed target of 90-90-90 by the year 2020. These reports are sent after every three months to states and contribute to bringing remarkable improvement in ART initiation, drug adherence, retention and mortality and morbidity reduction among PLHIV in states.2. Review of Special-25 ART Centres: Around 25 ART centres across the country catering to high/medium load of PLHIVs on ART were identified to be having poor performance consistently. Five of these centres were visited in January and February 2020, jointly by senior NACO officials and technical partners. The review of action plans made by these ART centres was undertaken and discussions held with ARTC staff and patients on how to improve adherence to ART and reduce loss to follow up and deaths of PLHIV on-ART. Key Achievements Introduction of Dolutegravir based ARV regimen in India under NACP was a major achievement. In keeping with the recommendations of WHO and the ART TRG (Adults & Adolescents), Dolutegravir based ARV regimens were prescribed for PLHIV from April 2020. 3. Other Activities: 15 th Meeting of Technical Resource Group, ART (Adult & Adolescents): The online ART TRG meeting for Adult and Adolescents was held on the virtual platform on 7-8 September 2020, to review ART strategies and ARV regimens ARV Forecasting and Quantification Working Group Meeting: The ARV drug forecasting and quantification meeting for adult and pediatric regimens was held on the online platform to discuss methodologies and assumptions related to ARV drug forecasting and calculating of drug requirements under NACP . The meeting was attended by working group committee members, NACO officials and representatives of development partners. Meeting of the Technical Specification Committee of ARV drugs: This meeting 163 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 was held with the objective of sanctioning approval to specifications of four new ARVs and the updated packaging guidelines. Other initiatives: Verbal Autopsy to assess cause-specific mortality rate among PLHIVs. Understanding causes of death among PLHIV could provide newer insights and help generate evidence and directions for future interventions and strategies. NACO has planned to conduct an exercise of verbal autopsy to ascertain the cause of death among a sample of the deceased PLHIV registered in the ART Centres. Following the National Consultation and capacity building workshop conducted in 2019 for ART staff comprising of SMO/ MOs, Counsellors, Regional Coordinator and TSU from North & North-East region along with CST NACO Officials, the second training workshop was conducted at Nagpur in January 2020 for Southern and Western zone. A total of 313 verbal autopsies were conducted between January and March 2020 till the activity was stopped due to restrictions imposed by COVID-19. Self-Verified Adherence (SV A): Adherence to treatment is the most important factor which determines the treatment outcome. Based on programme data, it has been observed that maximum loss to follow up and poor pill pick up is observed in the first 6-12 months. Hence, there is a felt need to have more intensive tools for adherence monitoring to trigger early support during this cr ucial time period. In the first phase of SV A pilot, a total of 20 ARTCs were included. The SV A intervention utilises the strategy of Augmented pill box packaging: One Toll Free number will be pasted on the existing medicine bottles. The patients will call on the number when they take the medicine and this will then get recorded on the dashboard. The calls made will be used for adherence monitoring. For patients who are not calling on toll free number, SMS or IVR reminders are sent to patients to remind them to take medications and to ART Counsellors to remind them to counsel their patients on adherence. In case the client does not call even after a reminder, the outreach worker will pay the client a visit for intervention. With this intervention, the programme plans to build the habit formation of the client on drug consumption behaviour and to avoid missing doses through reminder SMS. This will further lead to real time monitoring of the adherence of the patient thus, enabling early support action when the patient misses a dose. Gazette of India notification regarding establishing of ART Centres in Medical Colleges: Gazette of India published a notification on 25.06.2019 regarding establishing of ART Centres in all government and private Medical Colleges. The Amendment Notification in \"Minimum Standard Requirement MBBS Admissions Annually Regulation, 1999\" was done in Clause A.1.24 as \"Every Medical College should have ART Centre and facility for management of MDR- TB at the time of 4th renewal for admissions of 5th Batch of MBBS students\" . In this context, NACO is now pursuing all Medical Colleges (Government and Non-Government) to establish ART Centres. As of September 2020, as many as 27 ART centers have been established in Medical colleges across India, 16 of them between January to September,2020. 1.8.10 Laboratory Services Laboratory Services function at the cross-cutting interface of all other components of NACP . It is recognised that work related to laboratory services are not just confined to HIV testing but are overarching and have an impact on other interventions included those under prevention, care, support and treatment, procurement and supply chain management. Emphasis on quality assured laboratory service delivery is important to the success of NACP . 164 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Lab Services oversee routine viral load testing, Early Infant Diagnosis by HIV TNA (total nucleic acid) PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on Dried Blood Spot (DBS) and CD4 testing. 1.8.10.1 Viral Load (VL) Testing Towards the achievement of the third 90 (i.e. 90% of those initiated on antiretroviral treatment should have suppressed viral load), several steps were taken by NACP to offer the facility to all beneficiaries by following a two-pronged strategy: A. The Viral Load Testing facilities have been scaled up from the existing 10 public sector labs to 64 labs across the country. From January 2020 to September 2020 a total of 82,093 tests were done with a viral suppression of 89%. Given the scale up of viral load testing for monitoring PLHIV on ART, NACO developed two guidelines, namely the National Operational Guidelines for Viral Load Testing and National Guidelines for HIV-1 Viral Load Testing. Location of 64 Public Sector Viral Load Labs Viral load testing done and viral suppression by public labs since inception B. Public Private Partnership (PPP) model by engaging Metropolis Healthcare Ltd (MHL), Mumbai. A three-year contract was signed between NACO and MHL in February 2018. To monitor the VL tests done by Metropolis under PPP model \"Guidelines on NACO's Quality Monitoring System for outsourced VL tests' was developed. Till September 2020, a total of 9,87,360 tests were done since inception. From January 2020 to September 2020, as many as 3,44,097 tests were done with a viral suppression of 83%. Viral load testing and suppression under PPP model labs since inception 1.8.10.2 Early Infant diagnosis (EID): HIV- 1 PCR labs for children under 18 Months EID is an initiative under NACP that aims to diagnose HIV-1 infection in infants and children <18 months. HIV exposed infants cannot be tested using standard HIV antibody tests due to the presence of maternal antibodies (transferred during pregnancy or breast feeding) and absence of self-generated antibodies early in life (typically around 4-9 months). Thus, in infants below 18 months, direct detection tests for the virus must be conducted, and the current test of choice is the HIV TNA PCR.

The laboratory has the capacity to run an indigenous cost-effective national VL PT programme for the 64 HIV-1 VL laboratories. Biannual rounds of 5 panel members have been envisaged. In the early stages of the PT programme, the panels of each round are distributed separately. Once the programme matures, panels for both rounds are distributed simultaneously. The PT programme has been scaled-up for all functional VL laboratories, as of March 2020. In the 1 st round 40 VL labs participated with 97.5% of the labs showing satisfactory results (details of the results are shown below)1.8.10.5 External Quality Assurance (EQA) for HIV and CD4 tests The EQA was set up to ensure high reliability and validity to HIV and CD4 tests under the programme and higher levels of proficiency in the participating laboratories. NEQAS categorised the laboratories into four tiers, as follows: Apex Laboratory (Tier 1): National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), Pune National level: 13 (NRLs) (Tier 2). State level: 117 State Reference Laboratories (SRLs) (Tier 3) Districts-level: All standalone ICTC A complete network of labs has been established across the country. Each NRL has attached SRLs for which it has the responsibility of supervision. Each SRL, in turn, has ICTC which it monitors. One Technical Officer at every SRL is supported by funds from NACO to facilitate supervision, training and continual quality improvement in all SRLs and linked ICTCs. 1.8.10.5.1 EQA for HIV test is done in two ways: A. Panel/proficiency Testing: status of panel testing given below: Participation and performance of NRL in FY 2019-20 Participation 2019-20 was 84.6% and no discordance observed and ICTCs FY 2019-20 was 86.7% with of ICTCs was 90%, with a concordance of 99.9%. 167 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 established EQA for CD4 estimation for laboratories linked to ART centres. NARI, Pune functions as an apex laboratory for conducting the EQA for all these laboratories with two rounds every year. The average participation of CD4 labs in FY 2020-21 (for round one) is 96% and average performance is 95.4% as seen in the figure below. CD4 lab average participation and concordance (data in percentage) 1.8.10.7 Consortium for kit quality testing Evaluation of diagnostic kits for transfusion transmitted infections, before using in the field, is an important aspect of obtaining good quality kits. Towards this end, a consortium of four National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) was formed in 2010 with support of NACO. It has been working to achieve its mission of testing quality diagnostic kits for HIV and Hepatitis B and C virus which are being used in the national programme by establishing a uniform approach and procedure for testing. Four NRLs namely, ICMR- NARI, Pune; Enteric diseases (NICED), Kolkata; and National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru are members of the consortium. These laboratories form the 'Consortium for Quality' developed by NACO for kit evaluation. NACO signs an MoU with each of these consortium labs every five years. Being a Premier institute working in the field of HIV , ICMR-NARI is designated as secretariat of the consortium. Table below shows the number of kits evaluated by the Consortium from 2010 to 2020.

NACO is providing support to NRLs/ SRLs & CD4 laboratories for accreditation. Out of 130 referral laboratories (13 NRLs and 117 SRLs), 99 laboratories (13 NRLs and 86 SRLs) have been accredited by National Accreditation Board for Testing and calibrating Laboratories (NABL) as per ISO 15189: 2012 standards. Out of 53 CD4 laboratories co-located with either SRL or NRL, 40 laboratories are NABL accredited.168 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Accreditation status of HIV Reference Laboratories (as on15th October, 2020) 1.8.10.9 Improvement and Implementation of Quality Management System (QMS) at Standalone ICTCs in cluster districts Anticipating the need to maintain and enhance quality at SA-ICTCs, NACO introduced QMS in ICTCs by issuing of Certificate of Excellence. To extend the scope of QMS to ICTCs, it laid down quality standards and implemented a checklist for implementing quality in the ICTCs. The technical officer from the linked SRL labs visits ICTCs for QMS implementation and handholding. ICTCs are graded based on their performance and are awarded certificate of excellence by NACO. As of September 2020, a total of 198 SA-ICTCs have been certified by NACO. 1.8.10.10 New Initiatives NABL certification for SA- ICTC: To move further, NACO was in contact with NABL to introduce a Medical (Entry Level) Testing Laboratories (MELT) Recognition Programme under which 100 SA-ICTCs were identified by SACS to apply for entry level certification. This certification provides formal recognition of competent laboratories and enhances customer confidence in accepting testing results. 1.8.11 STRATEGIC INFORMATION Use of data is fundamental to the National AIDS Response. Evidence-based decision making is ensured through complementary systems of IT enabled client centric programme monitoring, epidemic monitoring and research focusing on high quality data collection, analysis and dissemination. India's successful response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic has been strongly guided by a robust strategic information (SI) management system. The details of activities done from January to November 2020 are as follows: I. Hon'ble HFM, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, participated in the virtual Ministerial Meeting of the Global Prevention Coalition (GPC) - HIV Prevention 2021-2025, on 18.11.2020 for taking stock, planning the future, hosted by UNAIDS and UNFPA. The meeting focused on strengthening HIV Prevention and Roadmap. India reaffirmed its commitment for expanding and amplifying HIV prevention efforts over next five years. II. To achieve NACP fast track targets, NACO envisaged nine output indicators and three outcome indicators. HIV testing increased from 1.25 crore to 2.65 crore among pregnant women and 1.6 crore to 2.89 crore among vulnerable population in last five years. Around 73 lakh blood units are being collected in NACO supported blood banks to ensure availability of safe blood in the country. In addition, during the same period, the number of PLHIV taking free lifelong ART increased from around 9.4 lakh to 14.86 lakh. III. Fast track targets (90-90-90): National Scenario vis-\u00e0-vis global average: India is committed to 'Ending the AIDS' epidemic as a public health threat by 2030. As per current available data: 76% PLHIV knew their HIV status (Global achievement 81%), Among people who knew their status, 84% were accessing treatment (Global achievement 82%) 169 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Among people accessing treatment, 84% were virally supressed (Global achievement 88%). IV . Global AIDS Monitoring report 2020: India has submitted country progress of National AIDS response to the UNAIDS Global AIDS Monitoring report 2020. These are designed to identify challenges and constraints, and to recommend actions to accelerate achievement of targets. The 2020 Global AIDS Monitoring is the fourth year towards the SDG. V . 17 th round of HIV Sentinel surveillance (HSS) Plus across 35 States/UT in India-Epidemic surveillance under NACP is done through a robust institutional mechanism under the leadership of TRG of HIV Surveillance and Estimation. The current 17 th round of HSS is proposed to be implemented at 1,478 sites including 856 ANC sites and 54 prison sites. VI. Behavioural Surveillance Survey (BSS)-Lite: The behavioural surveillance among HRGs under NACP has been done largely through various surveys including Integrated Biological and Behavioural Surveillance (IBBS) and Behavioural Surveillce Surveys (BSS). In 2014-15 Programme implemented IBBS programme to provide behavioral information on HIV/AIDS related knowledge, attitudes, practices as well as status of HIV and related health conditions among HRGs. Although IBBS was very successful in providing a comprehensive set of bio-behavioural indicators, it was complex and resource-intensive. The BSS-lite has designed and implemented for the population groups of FSW , MSM, IDU, and H/TG in 14 with the objective of estimating the prevalence of HIV related risks and safe behaviours, knowledge, attitudes and practices and service uptake among key population groups. VII. India HIV Estimation 2019: India undertakes HIV estimations biennially to provide latest estimates on HIV epidemic burden and directions using UNAIDS recommended globally used Spectrum model. The latest HIV Estimations 2019 will provide updated information on epidemiological indicators of HIV prevalence, incidence, PMTCT need as well as impact of the programme in terms of averting new HIV infections and AIDS related deaths. The evidence will be provided to the district, State and national level towards further augmenting the national AIDS response. These will be critical to measure progress on 2020 fast track targets as well as impact of NACP-IV (Ext). VIII. HIV Estimations are done under NACP through an institutionalised mechanism. A national working group under the chairmanship of Director, ICMR-NIMS and co-chairmanship of division head of Surveillance-SI, NACO implement HIV estimations. The methods and results are finally reviewed and recommended by the TRG on HIV Surveillance and Estimations under the chairpersonship of Addl. Secretary & DG (NACO & RNTCP). IX. District level HIV Estimations: Since 1998, HIV Estimations in India have evolved significantly in terms of technical rigour and have set global benchmarks many times. The process has informed the programme on critical indicators for various purposes including that for resource allocation. Now focus on sub-national i.e., district/region level planning, it is desirable to provide 170 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 district level PLHIV estimates in the country. During 2019-20, NACO has undertaken pilots at the district level PLHIV estimation through its institutes for HIV Surveillance and Estimation. X. NACO has developed district specific integrated action plan for states of Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Meghalaya. It includes full details and granularity with measurable indicators to be required in addition to routine activities. XI. NACO is developing a technical document on Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This guidance document has been developed after incorporating inputs from various working groups and in consultation with communities, private health-care providers, and technical experts. XII. National Consultation on HIV Interventions on Virtual Platforms and way forward was organised on key thematic areas such as 'Mapping and reaching the populations and at-risk groups on virtual platforms' , Strategies to engage virtual population in services' , to Treatment' and 'Ethical/data security considerations. ' XIII. NACO has developed Draft NACP Data Management Guidelines, 2020 to bring greater clarity on various aspects of Data Management in line with HIV/AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act 2017. The document is aligned with the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. 1.8.12 Procurement Under NACP , NACO provides free ARV drugs to approximately 1.39 million PLHIV . In addition, approximately 48 million HIV tests are conducted annually. NACO does the procurement of ARV drugs, HIV testing kits, blood bags and equipment etc. Procurements are done through procurement Agents, M/s RITES Limited & Central Medical Services Society (CMSS) and direct contract management. CMSS being an agency of the MoHFW specifically created for procurement purpose has been associated with NACO since 2016. Now, Procurement of most commodities under NACP is done through CMSS except those procured on direct contract basis. 1.8.13 Strengthening Overall Care for HIV-Patients The existing IT landscape for patient and inventory management across various components of the NACP was fragmented and disparate, with a wide range of technologies, vintage and level of maturity systems. In spite of multiple systems there were functionality gaps and external linkages with IT systems. These were used by other departments which were sub-optimal as also in terms of EHR standards leveraging tools and consolidated databases developed under several government initiatives for seamless flow of data across programmes. NACO took the initiative to create one integrated IT system to ensure seamless interoperability through the Global Fund Supported Project SOCH. Project SOCH (Strengthening Overall Care for HIV-Patients) is a digital transformation project that helps assist in tracking and achieving the global HIV target of 90-90-90. It involves integration of existing standalone systems to enable seamless tracking of beneficiary and inventory across HIV continuum, as well as enable electronic 171 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 data interchange with IT systems used by other programmes and departments intersecting with NACP at beneficiary and/ or inventory level. Integrated Block Diagram for SOCH With the completion of SOCH Phase I development, the TI Centres, Stand Alone ICTC, ART Centres, OST Centres, Viral Load Labs and EID Labs have been enabled for real time beneficiary registration and service delivery, identifying the High Risk population based on risk and vulnerability assessment capturing test results digitally and to provide test reports. This has further enabled real time monitoring of Inventory status which has been integrated with CMSS e-Aushadhi portal. As the Project moved ahead from its Minimum Viable Prototype phase, refresher training for ~2,500 frontline health care workers was conducted. 1.8.14 Capacity Building/Trainings Training of Counsellors, ANM and staff nurse under NACP The training of ANM/Staff Nurses (PHC) and Counsellors (ICTC/DSRC/ART) under NACP is supported by Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS) through the Global Fund grant project named \"Saksham Prerak. \" One-day classroom training with 9 sessions (9 hours), includes participatory approach with group activity and theme based exercise. Counsellors' Contact Training (CCT) was carried out on the skill component. Four consecutive days (preferably residential) of contact/classroom training with 13 sessions focused on skills, attitudes and perception combining role play, group activity, thematic exercises and supervised practice of counselling skills. A Counsellors' Online Training-eModule on Knowledge component included approximately 20-24 hours of online training. The Project headquarters is located at the Mumbai campus of TISS and there are 10 Regional Training Units (RTU) comprising of a Project Coordinator and three or more Capacity Building Specialists. They are based out of Chandigarh, been formed for TISS Saksham Prerak training with representatives from NACO, UNAIDS, PLAN, positive network, other GFATM partners and SACS overseeing the curriculum development and execution of trainings. With support from NACO and in coordination with respective SACS and NHM, TISS rolled out the ANM Training in November 2018 followed by the Counsellors' Contact Training (CCT) in September 2019 through it's 10 RTUs. The same skill based CCT and ANM trainings were initiated in virtual mode from October 2020 and were called \"Virtual CCT\" and \"Synchronous ANM Training\" retaining the same content and quality of the training. The V-CCT adopted online features viz, link for registration, direct online link for pre-test/post-test during training, break out room for case study discussion, polling and share screen. In October 2020, nearly 29 batches for V-CCT and 15 batches for Synchronous ANM training were completed in 19 States/UTs. The E-Module is in process and will be in Hindi and English.172 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Trainings update till September 2020 Training Achieved January 2020- September 2020 ANM- trainingHealth Facilities covered538 (ICTC/ DSRC/ART)1,794 1.8.15 Collaboration with Multilateral Organisations The partner and donor's involvement and participation in strengthening the national programme is crucial, and the collaboration brings evidence to the programme with new initiatives. One of the strengths of the programme has been an active and engaging partnership with development partners such as USAID, CDC, UNAIDS, WHO, World Bank and Global Fund, who have been working with the NACO to address HIV/AIDS by contributing technical expertise and financial resources. 1.8.15.1 The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-USAID & CDC PEPFAR has been a valued partner in the fight against HIV/AIDS in India since 2003. Today, PEPFAR India focuses on providing technical support along the prevention to care and treatment continuum. It works closely I at both national level, providing technical assistance for NACP , as well as State-level, providing technical assistance under the Cluster Strategy. PEPFAR in collaboration with NACO aims at catalysing progress towards epidemic control through different strategies viz., reach, test and treat undiagnosed; strengthen lab capacity; increase data analysis and use. Programme focus areas include Lab for life; Sunrise project in NE; Project Accelerate in cluster districts, Care, Support & Treatment; HIV-TB/ Lab, strategic information; HIV OVC; TB in private sector; innovative financing and stigma & discrimination. 1.8.15.2 National AID Control Support Project supported by World Bank The World Bank supported National AIDS Control Support Project (NACSP) came to a closure on 30.06.2020, with a Final Joint Implementation Review Mission conducted virtually from 25-30 June 2020. The mission included experts from WHO, UNAIDS, USAID and CDC apart from World Bank. Aide Memoire shared by the World Bank appreciated NACO's overall work under NACSP: India's HIV programme is a global exemplar and its success can be attributed to several factors, most notably investments in evidence-based prevention programming. NACO has done well to expand both prevention and treatment component since the project was restructured in 2017. Implementing an aggressive seek, prevent, test, and treat effort has renewed the relevance of, and revitalised the TIs. Like other disease control programmes, NACO has adopted measures to mitigate impact of COVID-19 on HIV/AIDS service delivery and outcomes. The progress towards achievement of three indicators for measuring the Project Development Objective was found to be satisfactory. NACO has maintained steady progress of project implementation with key achievements through expansion of revamped strategy for TI based on 173 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 'differentiated approach' nation-wide; successful piloting of HRG MPSE in four states and publication of top line results of BSS- Lite The mission served to prepare Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) report, which is undertaken at the end of every WB project. The final ICR report is awaited from the World Bank, towards formally closing the project. 1.8.15.3 SAHAS (Global Fund Grant 2018- 2021) The Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance is recipient of the Global Fund Grant (2018-2021) with NACO as lead implementer. NACO has been allocated a budget of USD 102.6 million and non-Government PRs have been allocated USD 52.7 million for the grant period. In this grant, various programmatic activities have been budgeted with a vision to move towards fast track targets of 90-90-90 by 2020 and its commitment to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. The grant has been allocated to the HIV Programme for activities like setting up a National Programme Management Unit; PPTCT; procurement refurbishment of ICTCs and for community based testing; procurement of ARV drugs; supply chain management; laboratory services; differentiated care centres; capacity building; and SOCH. 1.8.15.4 Blended clinical training programme The Blended Clinical Training (BCT) Project, aims to build the capacities and skills of government health care providers, including MOs, nurses, and laboratory personnel. Two key components of the capacity building are clinical training for multiple cadres (including MOs, Nurses and Laboratory personal) that is delivered online and offline; and ICT-enabled learning needs assessment, training scheduling and delivery, tracking of participant progress and refresher/mentorship needs through online assessments and participant certification on successful completion. This project is an initiative of NACO, with SAATHII as implementing partner. Key components include training for multiple cadres who will be trained through online and classroom based sessions. The online training will be done through ICT-enabled Learning Management System (LMS). In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person training will be minimised and feasibility of conducting virtual training explored. 1.8.16 NACP Services During COVID-19 Pandemic During the COVID-19 pandemic, NACO took swift and timely action by involving communities, civil society, development partners to reach out to the last mile with a robust implementation plan for ARV dispensation. The Government linked key populations and PLHIV to various social welfare schemes. Advisories and guidance notes were issued by NACO from time to time aligned with global guidelines in this context. NACO facilitated use of virtual interaction platform for NACO officials to engage regularly with SACS. Following key activities were taken up during the period: Considering MMD of medicines, teleconsultations and newer ways of service delivery. Signing an MoU with Plan India for the last mile solution for supply chain management of all ARV drugs and testing kits. This was done through the engagement of third party logistics to ensure physical delivery of the commodities till last facility (ICTC/ARTC). It proved to be a lifeline during the lockdown. The SACS took special permits for vehicles and their drivers for transport of ARV medicines and kits across states and 174 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 and districts. NACO, in coordination with SACS, Plan India team and TCI Ltd facilitated multiple emergency transportation of ARV drugs, as per requests received by SACS. Provision of take-home OST medication was instituted (along with daily supervised OST) to reduce infection risk and overcome accessibility barriers. The 'Interim guidance document for take-home OST' was developed and OST MOs trained on the same in April 2020. It was followed by a series of webinars for their continued training and support. The 'Take home OST record sheet' a brief checklist to assist health care staff at OST centres with circulation of periodic evaluation of clients on OST. NBTC circulated its 1 st interim National Guidance for BTS in India in light of COVID-19 pandemic on 25.03.2020 followed by the 2 nd interim National Guidance for BTS on 25.06.2020. National AIDS Control Organization and State AIDS Control Societies (SACS') in collaboration with various partner agencies, community based organization, network of people living with HIV have worked together to enroll key population (PLHIV , HRGs, & MARPs) in social protection schemes and access the benefits during COVID-19 lockdown. Efforts are made to reduce the impact of CoVID-19 pandemic among communities through facilitating access of nutritional support and other social protection benefits in crisis phase. 'Guidance note for extending social protection benefits to High Risk Groups (HRGs), Children Affected by AIDS (CABA), People living with HIV (PLHIV)' was developed and shared with State AIDS Control Societies. Virtual meetings were conducted on the regular basis. Line departments, industries of public and private sectors, civil society and community based organization were engaged to work together on social protection front during COVD 19. All events were observed through virtual platforms using social media, webinars, online quiz, and virtual competitions. Through this SACS were able to reach the youth via digital media. Members of RRCs were actively engaged in awareness activities, conducted across the state in quarantine centres and COVID affected neighborhoods. Enhancements in SOCH application due to COVID-19 challenges: Provision of transit dispensation functionality for dispensing ARV drugs at ART centres Provision of capturing details of OST drugs take-away Providing flexibility of back-dated data entry due to COVID-19 lockdown NACO's Organogram Addition of COVID-19 risk and vulnerability related questions for PLHIV such as, is the PLHIV experiencing Influenza like illness, symptoms like cough, fever, cold, sore throat 175 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 and difficulty in breathing (answer in Y es/ No); and did the PLHIV have any contact with COVID-19 positive patients in the last 14 days? (answer in Y es/ No) 1.9 OTHER NATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAMMES 1.9.1 National Programme For Prevention And Control Of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases And Stroke (NPCDCS) India is experiencing a rapid health transition with a rising burden of NCDs surpassing the burden of communicable diseases like water-borne or VBDs, TB, HIV , etc. The NCDs like cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes and other NCDs are estimated to account for over 60% of all deaths, making them the leading cause of death. NCDs cause considerable loss in potentially productive years of life. Losses due to premature deaths related to heart diseases, stroke and diabetes are likely to increase over the years. To prevent and control major NCDs, GoI is implementing the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) in all States with focus on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion, early diagnosis, management and referral. For activities up to district level and below NPCDCS, States are given financial support under NHM. The funds are being provided to States under NCD Flexi-Pool through State PIPs of respective States/UTs, with the Centre to State share in ratio of 60:40 (except for NE and Hilly States, where the share is 90:10). 1. Strategy The strategies of the NPCDCS are as follows: Health promotion through behaviour change with involvement of community, civil society, community based organisations, media etc. Outreach camps envisaged for opportunistic screening at all levels in the health care delivery system from SC and above for early detection of diabetes, hypertension and common cancers Management of chronic NCDs especially cancer, diabetes, CVDs and stroke through early diagnosis, treatment and follow up by setting up NCD clinics Build capacity at various levels of health care for prevention, early diagnosis, treatment, IEC/BCC, operational research and rehabilitation Provide support for diagnosis and cost effective treatment at primary, secondary and tertiary levels of health care Provide support for development of database of NCDs through a robust Surveillance System and to monitor NCD morbidity, mortality and risk factors 2. Up to District level interventions 2.1 NCD clinics are being set up at District and CHC levels, to provide services for common NCDs. In identified districts, Cardiac Care Units (CCU) and Day Care Centres are being set up to provide facilities for emergency cardiac care and cancer chemotherapy, respectively. Intervention on COPD and CKD are included in the programme. Regarding cancer, focus is on oral, breast and cervical. 2.2 During 2020-21 (up to 30.06.2020) as many as 667 district NCD cells, 667 district NCD clinics, 192 district CCCs, 217 district DCCs, 4,406 CHC NCD clinics were established. 176 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 Comparative position of infrastructure in past 5 years S.

Up to 30.06.2020, as many as 20,04,834 persons were screened and 11,673 awareness camps organised. Social media campaigns were organised on special days pertaining to NCDs i.e. World Cancer Day, World Kidney Day, World Stroke Day, National Cancer Awareness Day, World Diabetes Day, etc. on risk factors, prevention, management and promotion of healthy lifestyle through Twitter and Facebook177 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 \"National Framework for Joint TB-Diabetes collaborative activities\" has been developed to articulate a national strategy for 'bi-directional screening' , early detection and better management of TB and Diabetes co-morbidities To leverage mobile technology, an application called m-Diabetes is being used to generate awareness, to promote adherence to treatment and inculcate healthy habits among the masses with special focus on target groups. This application is being integrated with national software for NCD service delivery under CPHC. To leverage and strengthen ongoing efforts of hypertensive control interventions by NPCDCS under NHM and improve linkages between population based screening initiative with health care, the India Hypertension Control Initiative (IHCI), a collaborative project of ICMR, MoHFW , State Governments and WHO, has is being implemented in 52 districts in 10 States Bengal. Population based screening initiative with health care The initiative focuses on five critical components of effective hypertensive care which include standard treatment protocol, continuous medication supply, community-based treatment, patient centered care and strengthened information system to ensure follow up and patient tracking. Till31st October 2020, IHCI was implemented in nearly 2514 healthfacilities with over 9,35,458 patients registered. Implementation of ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) Protocol: Of thetotal mortality due to NCDs, mortality caused by CVDs stands the highest. It is estimated that about 26 lakh people die due to CVDs in a year. Further, Ischemic Heart Diseases and Strokes account for 80% of all CVDs. Contribution of CVDs to Disability Adjusted Life Y ears (DALYs) is highest at 14.1%, including 8.7% DALYs caused by Ischemic Heart Diseases. Myocardial infarctions are generally clinically classified STEMI and non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI), based on changes in ECG. For STEMI condition, timely intervention is critical to save lives by restoring blood flow to the heart. Therefore, interventions such as Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI) are required in the shortest possible time. In Hub and Spoke model, health facilities at lower levels act as spoke with facilities for taking ECG and Thrombolysis, and have defibrillator inter alia. Thrombolysing the patient in time gives wider window to manage patients at higher level facility including the Hub having a cath lab, where PCI interventions can be performed on the patient. To overcome problems of non-availability of specialists at health facility, strategy of task shifting and training of MOs/cardiologists/staff nurses and cath lab technicians in STEMI management protocol is adopted. Protocol based care for STEMI and NSTEMI patients improves treatment outcomes. The Governments of Tamil Nadu and Goa have successfully implemented the STEMI protocol. Few more State Governments have come forward to implement the protocol and based on the proposal received from them, financial assistance under NHM has been approved for 178 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER Prevention, Control, Screening and Management of Diabetes, Hypertension and Common Cancers (Oral, Breast and Cervical) Initiative (PBS): 3.1 PBS (Diabetes, Hypertension and cancer viz. Oral, Breast and Cervical Cancer) is being implemented as part of CPHC under NHM. Under this initiative, persons more than 30 years of age, are targeted. Prevention, control and screening services are being provided through trained FLWs (ASHA & ANM) and the referral support and continuity of care ensured though PHC, CHC, DHs and other tertiary care institutions. PBS can help in better management of disease by way of early detection, follow up, treatment and adherence. It will also generate awareness on risk factors of NCDs. The initiative has linkages with NPCDCS and tertiary care institutions like SCIs and TCCCs. 3.2 Training modules have been developed for various categories of health staff viz. nurses, ANMs, ASHAs and MOs. So ANM/MPWs, 10,135 staff nurses and 11,024 MOs have been trained on universal screening of common NCDs. (as reported in HWC portal). 3.3 Development of NCD Software: Software has been developed in collaboration with CSR initiative of M/s. Dell India & Tata Trusts for implementing PBS for prevention, control, screening and management of population-based screening of common NCDs. It has tablet- based application for ANM and web-based software for PHC and above facilities. National level ToTs for software was conducted in April, 2018, followed by State level training. Since the launch of the application, States have started procuring the tablets. Till 23.11.2020 as many as 1,41,002 tablets were procured; 53,601 health professionals trained on NCD application across the country, 15.-0 enrolled through NCD application and 4.2 crore screened and their records maintained (including State NCD Application). 4. Strengthening of Tertiary Care Cancer facilities scheme under NPCDCS. 4.1 Under the Strengthening of Tertiary Cancer Centre facilities Scheme of NPCDCS, financial assistance is provided for setting up State Cancer Institutes (SCIs) and Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCCs) in different parts of the country. Under the scheme, there is provision of providing a one time grant up to Rs.120 crore for SCI and up to Rs. 45 crore for TCCC, including State share. This grant is meant for procurement of equipment and building construction. The funds, sharing ratio between Centre and State is 60:40 while for NE and Hilly States the ratio is 90:10. 4.2 Under the programme, 15 SCIs and 20 TCCCs were approved upto March, 2018 in different States/UTs. Continuation of the scheme till 2020 was approved by CCEA in February 2019. As per the approval, support for already approved 15 SCIs and 20 TCCCs will be continued, besides support of setting up four new SCIs at Jabalpur, Haldwani, Bilaspur and Jammu during the current . 5. National Multisectoral Action Plan (NMAP) The NMAP for prevention and control of NCDs has been developed through series of consultations with various stakeholders including 179 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 other Ministries/Departments. The plan offers a roadmap and menu of policy options to guide multisectoral efforts towards attaining NCD targets mentioned in the National Health Policy, 2017 and National NCD Monitoring Framework. The action plan has identified action points for 39 Ministries/Departments.An Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC), to coordinate multisectoral actions has been set up. Further, Nodal Officers have been appointed in many Ministries for NMAP . 6. Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Program (PM-NDP) 6.1 National Dialysis Programme was launched during 2016-17 to support all district hospitals in PPP mode under NHM. Guidelines of National Dialysis Programme including the Model Request for Proposal (RFP) for PPP was developed and released on 07.04.2016. All States/UTs were requested to incorporate proposals for roll out of the PM-NDP in PIPs and approval was provided to all States in 2016-17 and 2017- 18 for provision of free dialysis services to the poor. 6.2 Under PPP for Haemo-dialysis services, the roles are defined as under: Service Provider should provide medical human resource, dialysis machine along with RO water plant infrastructure, dialyser and consumables Payer Government should provide space in DHs, drugs, power and water supply and pay for the cost of dialysis for poor patients 6.3 PMNDP has been implemented in 35 States/UTs in 503 districts at 882 centres by deploying 5,490 hemo-dialysis machines. A total 8.52 lakh patients availed dialysis and 86.37 on (Source: National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP) The NTCP was launched in 2007-08 with the aim of creating awareness on the harmful effects of tobacco use and second hand smoke to implement tobacco control laws and to provide affordable, easily accessible and evidence-based cessation services or treatment to tobacco addicts. NTCP is being implemented through a three-tiered structure i.e., the National Tobacco Control Cell, the State Tobacco Control Cells and District Tobacco Control Cells. The NTCP is being implemented in 677 districts across 36 States/UTs. 1.9.2.1 National Programme for Tobacco Control and Drug Addiction Treatment [NPTCDAT] With the aim of streamlining tobacco cessation facilities for providing seamless services to all substance abuse including tobacco and drugs, the tertiary component of NPTCDAT have been converged under the umbrella scheme of Financial support for Tertiary Care Programme for NCDs and e-Health, 2017-2020 (now extended to 31.03.2021). 180 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 1.9.2.2 Tobacco Control Tobacco is the foremost preventable cause of death and disease in the world today, killing half the people who use it. 26.7 crore adults (15 years and above) in India use tobacco in some form or other with overall prevalence of tobacco use at 28.6% wherein overall tobacco use among males is 42.4% and among females 14.2%. The tobacco-attributable deaths are about 13 lakh per year in India. Majority of CVDs, cancers and chronic lung diseases are directly attributable to tobacco use. Undoubtedly, tobacco epidemic is a major public health challenge in India, and is notable for the variety of smoked and smokeless products. The Government has been putting tremendous efforts to discourage use of tobacco products in order to reduce prevalence of tobacco use amongst the population. A comprehensive Act called Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 (COTPA 2003) under which sale of cigarettes or any other tobacco products to and by persons below the age of 18 years and within 100 yards of educational institutions; promotion/advertisement of cigarettes or any other tobacco products; and smoking in public places are banned. There is a provision to display large specified health warning covering 85% of the principal display area of tobacco product packs along with Quitline number on tobacco packs. Major Achievements during 01.11.2019 to 07.12.2020 Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes: The GoI prohibited electronic-cigarettes and like devices through 'The Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes (Production, Manufacture, Import, Export, Transport, Sale, Distribution, Storage and Advertisement) Ordinance, 2019\" on 18.09.2019 and the same was replaced by Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes (Production, Manufacture, Import, Export, Transport, Sale, Distribution, Storage and Advertisement) Act, 2019 on 05.12.2019. This prohibition has been brought with the objective of nipping the problem in the bud, anticipating the danger in case of spread of addiction due to e-cigarettes and as such decisive pre-emptive action was taken to prevent the problem rather than trying to solve it after it acquires unmanageable proportions. This prohibition will also complement government's efforts for tobacco control and will help in reduction of tobacco use and reduction in associated economic and disease burden. Rotation of Specified Health Warning: The Ministry under the COTPA, 2003 has notified the new specified health warnings to be displayed on all tobacco product packs, which came into effect on 01.12. 2020. Image 1 has been effective from December 2020 and Image 2 will be displayed from December 2021. The graphic health warnings are a potent tool to create awareness about serious and adverse health consequences of tobacco usage especially among youth, children and illiterate persons. There is ample evidence to show that effective warning labels increase knowledge about risks associated with tobacco use and can decrease intentions to use tobacco among adolescents, persuade tobacco users to quit and prevent ex-users from starting again.

Trauma Care Component Worldwide, accidental trauma is a major yet unrecognised public health problem. India, ranks 1st in the number of road accident deaths across 199 countries reported in the World Road Statistics, 2018 followed by China and US. As per the WHO Global Report on Road Safety 2018, India accounts for almost 11% of accident-related deaths in the world. Road traffic injuries are one of the leading causes of mortality in people aged 5-29 years. It is the 8 th leading cause of death for all age groups surpassing HIV/AIDS, TB and diarrheal diseases.In India, road traffic crashes are a major cause of disability, morbidity and mortality. As per the Road Accident Report for 2019, a total number of 4,49,002 accidents took place in the country during 2019 leading to 1,51,113 deaths and 4,51,361 injuries. In percentage terms, number of accidents decreased by 3.86 % in 2019 over that of the previous year, while accident-related deaths decreased by 0.20% and persons injured decreased by 3.86. The decline in road accidents and injuries reported during 2019 appear to have been a result of the Motor Vehicle Act implemented in States from 01.09.2019 which focused on road safety and included, inter-alia, stiff hike in penalties for traffic violations as well as electronic enforcement.194 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 The programme for trauma care started during 9thand 10th Five Y ear Plans as \"Pilot Project for Strengthening Emergency Facilities along the Highways\" .

Burn Injuries Component: Globally, burns are a serious public health problem. An estimated 2,65,000 deaths occur each year from fires alone, with more deaths from scalds, electrical burns, and other forms of burns, for which global data are not available. Over 96% of fatal fire-related burns occur in low- and middle-income countries. India has one of the largest burdens of burns with an estimated 70 lakh burn injuries cases per year, and an estimated 1.4 lakh deaths and 2.4 lakh disabilities, making burn injuries the second largest group of injuries after road accidents. (National Health Portal, India). These figures translate to a mortality rate of over 8.3/100,000 population, disfigurement and permanent disability in 250,000 people annually, and a loss of 5 million (50 lakh) Disability-Adjusted Life Y ears (DALYs). This high incidence has been attributed to illiteracy, poverty, and low safety consciousness in the population. The epidemiology of mortality after burns is unique in India; most burn injuries are in young adults and deaths are more common in women than men, contrasting trends observed in other low- and middle-income countries. Burns survivors are also known to be financially distressed, vocationally challenged and socially excluded. Death and disability due to burn injury are preventable to a great extent provided timely and appropriate treatment is provided by trained healthcare professionals. Keeping in view the magnitude of the problem, a pilot programme on burn care was initiated in the year 2010 by MoHFW , \"Pilot Programme for Prevention of Burn Injuries\" (PPPBI). This was initiated in three medical colleges and six districts hospitals. The goal of PPPBI was to ensure prevention of Burn Injuries, provide timely and adequate treatment in case of burn injuries, so as to reduce mortality, complications and ensuing disabilities and to provide effective rehabilitative interventions if disability has set in. The pilot project continued as full-fledged programme for tertiary care level during the 12 th Five Y ear Plan period. The financial assistance towards district hospital component was undertaken under the NHM. The programme since then has being extended under the umbrella scheme for tertiary care programmes upto 31.03.2021 for continued support to already approved Burn Units along with other activities of the programme. Programme Objectives To establish a network of burn units with adequate infrastructure facility for burn management and rehabilitation in all identified Government medical colleges and DHs To improve awareness among general masses and vulnerable groups especially women, children, industrial and hazardous occupational workers. To establish Burns data registry under NPPMBI with integration with National Injury Surveillance Centre for collection, compilation and analysis of burn injury data to bring down the incidence of burn injury cases To carry out research for assessing behavioural, social and other determinants of Burn Injuries in the country to facilitate effective need based programme planning, monitoring and evaluation To organise Burn Injury Training Programmes for doctors, nurses and paramedical staff associated in management of burn injuries from the identified DHs and Government medical colleges Key Highlights and Achievements for FY 2020- 21 (upto 31.12.2020) 1) Continuous Review Meetings were held with State Governments via video-conferencing to review the progress of implementation of Burn Programme in the States, wherein participants from Burn Units were invited for technical inputs/sessions on how to 197 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 manage Burn Injuryduring pandemic times. Also, in these meetings, it was informed that some of the Burn Units were utilized as COVID facilities 2) Project on \"Situational Analysis of Burn Injuries in India\" undertaken by the Programme Division in collaboration with AIIMS, New Delhi was finalized and the report submitted 3) Financial support to the tune of Rs 204.25 lakhs has been provided as second instalment to the States of Goa & Himachal Pradesh on reimbursement basis 4) As informed in review meetings, out of 50 Burn Units, 9 Units in medical colleges have become functional and construction is in progress in 20 medical Colleges 5) Technical & infrastructure norms of the programme are under revision by an expert group constituted for the purpose 6) Draft EFC of the Continuation of the scheme as a separate programme has been prepared in view of the data/recommendations received from the situational analysis report, NITI Aayog Report of an evaluation study conducted through E&Y LLC for all CSSs and suggestions given by the stakeholders 7) Standard Treatment Guidelines for management of Burn Injuries has been developed 1.9.10 National Organ Transplant Programme (NOTP) Transplant-aion of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994 The Transplantation of Human Organs Act (THOA), 1994 was enacted in the year 1994 and adopted by all States except erstwhile States of J&K and Andhra Pradesh, which have their own legislation in this regard. The main purpose of this Act was to regulate removal, storage and transplantation of human organs for therapeutic purposes and prevention of commercial dealings in human organs. The Act was amended in 2011 and the Transplantation of Human Organs (Amendment) Act 2011 came into force on 10-01-2014 in the States of Goa, Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, and Union Territories. Other States which have adopted the amended Act till date are amended Act is now named, \"Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA)\" , 1994. After reorganisation of erstwhile State of J&K, the THOTA 1994 is applicable to UT of J&K and Ladakh. Another development relates to recognising Brain Stem death as a legal death in India under the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, since 1994. Like many other countries, this has revolutionised the concept of organ donation after death. National Organ Transplant ProgrammeA huge gap exists between patients who require organ transplants and the organ donors that are available. There is need to promote deceased organ donation. After natural cardiac death only few tissues can be donated (like cornea, bone, skin) whereas after brain stem death, a person can donate many vital organs like kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, intestine and pancreas and tissues like corneas, skin, bones and heart valves etc. One organ donor can save up to eight lives and improve the quality of life of many others. The GoI is implementing National Organ Transplant Programme for promotion of organ donation from deceased persons so as to increase the availability of organs for transplant in order to 198 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 01 improve access to organ transplant in the country. An apex level organisation, National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO) has been established at Safdarjung Hospital Campus, New Delhi for setting up a country-wide networking of Transplant and Retrieval Hospitals and Tissue Banks and maintaining National Registry of Transplant cases, Organ Donors etc. NOTTO has a dedicated website www.notto.gov.in for providing information on organ donation and transplantation and online facility for registration of hospitals for networking and creation of a National registry. So far, 516 hospitals performing organ/tissue transplantation have been registered with the NOTTO website and allocated a unique ID. Online and offline pledging facility for organ and tissue donation has been made functional. A 24x7 days Helpline is operational with toll free No. 1800114770. The organ allocation policies and SOP guidelines are available on the NOTTO website https://notto.gov.in/guidelines.htm. This networking is important for successful procurement and distribution of organs in a transparent manner and to ensure that the donated organ, is viewed as a National Resource that must not be wasted. Five Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisations (ROTTOs) have been established in medical institutions, namely Government Multispecialty Hospital, Omnadurar in Chennai, Seth GS Medical College and KEM Hospital in Mumbai, Guwahati Medical College in Guwahati, Institute of PG Medical Education and Research in Kolkata and PGIMER in Chandigarh, who are champion institutions in the field of Organ Donation Transplantation. They are leading the States in their respective regions. Moreover, State level organisations are also being set up, one planned for each State. So far 12 State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (SOTTOs) have been sanctioned by and Jammu and Kashmir. Now the focus is to improve infrastructure and availability of trained manpower for organ transplant especially in Government institutions and facilitate all States to onboard their data on the web portal of NOTTO.

Surveillance in the Community Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) had issued advisory to all States/UTs on 211 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 02 17.01.2019 for Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) surveillance to pick up any travel related case reported in the community and follow up contacts of suspect/confirmed cases. Community surveillance was initiated initially for travel related cases and subsequently for clusters of cases being reported. A major intervention for the containment strategy is an intensive active house-to-house search for cases and contacts and their follow up which is being carried out in all containment zones. Accordingly, more than 2.68 crore persons were kept under surveillance. 2.2.7 Laboratory Support Laboratory testing of suspect cases and high-risk contacts was one of the crucial interventions in the Government's containment strategy. Starting with just one laboratory that had the capacity for testing samples for COVID-19, the network of existing laboratories was expanded vastly to test samples for COVID-19. As of 10.12.2020, total operational (initiated independent testing) government laboratories reporting to ICMR stands at 1191. In addition, 1038 private laboratories have been approved for COVID-19 testing. Besides the Gold Standard RT-PCR (in 1223 labs), TrueNAAT (in 875 labs) and CBNAAT (in 128 labs) techniques are also being used for testing. In addition, Rapid Antigen testing is being utilised for point-of-care testing. A total of 15,16,32,223 samples have been tested as on 10.12.2020. India is testing at a rate of 768 tests per million per day, which is 5.4 times 212 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 02 WHO's recommendation of 142 tests per million per day. The overall case positivity rate of samples tested so far stands at 6.44%. To scale up testing to the present levels, the indigenous technology was facilitated. As on 07.12.2020, 311 RT-PCR kits (including those from indigenous manufacturers) have been evaluated by ICMR, of which 144 have been validated for use. Similarly, for antigen testing, 50 antigen based Rapid Tests Kits (including 10 revalidated kits) have been validated and 14 have been found to be satisfactory. For serological testing, 27 manufacturers of IgG ELISA (Ezyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay)/CLIA (Chemiluminescence Immunoassay) Kits have been validated.

For appropriate management of suspect/confirmed COVID-19 cases, a three-tier arrangement of health facilities has been implemented in consultation with the State Governments. This includes: 1) Dedicated COVID Care Center (DCCC) with isolation beds for mild or pre-symptomatic cases 2) Dedicated COVID Health Centre (DCHC) with oxygen supported isolation beds for moderate cases 3) Dedicated COVID Hospital (DCH) with ICU beds for severe cases Hon'ble Union Home and Defence Ministers inspecting COVID-19 Facility Additionally, tertiary care hospitals under the Employees' State Insurance Corporation of India (ESIC), Defence, Railways, Paramilitary forces, Steel Ministry and others are also being leveraged for case management. Large temporary hospitals were set up using the Defence Research and Development Organisation's (DRDO) technology in Delhi and Bihar. As on 11.12.2020, a total of 15,375 dedicated COVID-19 treatment facilities with 15,41,821 dedicated isolation beds (including 2,70,738 oxygen supported beds) have been identified. Also, total of 80,583 ICU beds (including 40,545 ventilator beds) have been earmarked in these facilities. 2.2.8.1 Clinical Management Guidelines on Clinical management of COVID-19 was last updated on 03.07.2020 and widely circulated. These include case definition, prevention of infection control, laboratory diagnosis, early supporting therapy, management of severe cases and complications. No specific antivirals have been proven effective. However, symptomatic treatment for fever and pain, appropriate rehydration, supplemental oxygen therapy and use of drug Hydroxychloroquine has been advised for mild to moderate cases. In addition, provisions for investigational therapies has also been made using Remdesivir, Convalescent plasma and Tocilizumab has been made for managing severe cases under close medical supervision has been mentioned. Guidelines of clinical management released by Hon'ble HFM214 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 02 An All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Corona helpline 9971876591 was launched to guide doctors on medical management. AIIMS Delhi is running the COVID-19 National Tele-consultation Centre (CoNTeC) which can be reached by calling +91-9115444155. It is catering to doctors, from anywhere in the country, who want to consult the AIIMS faculty for the management of COVID-19 patients, as well as to the public in general. Telemedicine guidelines were issued on 25.03.2020 to provide tele-consultation to patients for mitigating their illness and preventing crowding in clinics. It may also help in triage, treatment and counselling for care of ill patients by health care providers in areas with limited access. Hon'ble HFM Dr. Harsh Vardhan greeting the police officials at Plasma Donation Camp at AIIMS on 19.7.2020 Expert group consultations are ongoing to review emerging evidence on organ system specific (respiratory system, renal system, cardiovascular and gastro-intestinal) sequelae of COVID-19. All institutions, AIIMS like institutions have been requested to undertake research to study long-term impact of COVID. The ICMR is establishing a National Clinical Registry on COVID that will provide insights into its clinical course, its spectrum and outcome of patients. Central Government hospitals in Delhi such as Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital (Dr.RML) Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College hospitals viz. Smt. Sucheta Kriplani and & SSKH, KSCH) and Safdarjung Hospital started COVID follow up clinics. A Post-COVID Management Protocol was released by MoHFW that followed a holistic approach which blended treatment from modern medicine as well as AYUSH system of medicine.2.2.8.2 Chemoprophylaxis MoHFW also recommended use of drug Hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis for asymptomatic health care workers managing COVID-19 cases, contacts of confirmed cases and Asymptomatic frontline workers. They include surveillance workers deployed in containment zones and paramilitary/police personnel involved in COVID-19 related activities. 2.2.9. Development of Drugs and Vaccines 2.2.9.1 Drugs With respect to drug development, the Principal Scientific Advisor to the GoI, has constituted a S&T Core Group on COVID-19. Under the aegis of the S&T Core Group on COVID-19, a Task Force has been constituted to focus on Repurposing of Drugs for COVID-19. The production of drug Hydroxychloroquine (recommended for 215 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 02 moderate cases and for prophylaxis) has been scaled up to meet in-country demand and to also seek permission for exporting to over 140 countries. 2.2.9.2 Vaccines Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and Department of Health Research have been pro-active in responding to the emerging situation to support advancement of vaccine candidates and related technologies. The GoI under \"Mission COVID Suraksha - The Indian COVID-19 Vaccine Development Mission\" shall focus on accelerated vaccine development through end-to- end solutions from pre-clinical development, clinical trials, manufacturing and regulatory facilitation for deployment. There are a total of 8 COVID-19 candidate vaccines in India which are under pre- clinical and clinical trials (3 of which are indigenous). Of these 5 vaccines are in various stages of clinical trials and 3 are in pre-clinical stage of evaluation. Hon'ble Prime Minister inspecting Vaccine Manufacturing Facility A National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID -19 Vaccine (NEGV AC) has been constituted to guide on prioritisation of population group/s for vaccination and delivery mechanism of the vaccine, including tracking of the vaccination process and selection of delivery platforms, etc. The Government will be working through National Cold Chain and Vaccine Management Resource Centre (NCCVMRC) and with support of UNICEF to currently assess the cold chain space requirement for COVID vaccines. An indigenously developed Co-WIN: Digital Platform for COVID 19 Vaccination Delivery has been developed. Currently GoI is also working on developing Operational Guidelines and training modules to impart trainings on the COVID-19 vaccination programme. Several strategic partnerships have been entered into, including one with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), through the DBT supported Ind-CEPI Mission. India is also member in the Facilitation Council of WHO's \" Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator\" as a 'market shaper' . 2.2.10 Logistics At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no indigenous manufacturers of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) with requisite standards. This capacity was up-scaled with involvement of Ministry of Textiles, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), Ministry of 216 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 02 Consumer Affairs, Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) and National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA). A multipronged strategy was followed to promote indigenous manufacturers and ensure market availability in addition to placing a ban on exports and ensure price control. A technical committee under DGHS reviewed and revised specifications for Coveralls in order to enable indigenous manufacturers to provide these in requisite number. So far, more than 1100 domestic manufacturers of PPE Coveralls have cleared the quality test. As per the current assessment, the production capacity of PPE Coveralls is nearly 5 lakh a day with potential for additional capacity creation to meet demand. In addition, the export of PPE Coveralls has now been made \"unrestricted\" in view of the large inherent capacity in the country. As part of the \"Make in India\" initiative, local manufacturers of ventilators have been identified and guided in meeting specifications and providing them handholding support for meeting requisite benchmarks (both essential and desirable). Release of \"White Paper Make in India\" post COVID-19 on 10.7.2020 Further, trainings were finalised along with other protocols, creating new supply chains, helping them in logistics issues with suppliers and State Governments and deciding about arrangement of consumables etc.Total orders for 1.92 crore PPEs have been placed by the Central Government so far. States/UTs and Central Government institutions are being supported in terms of supply of logistics. So far 1.69 crore PPE Kits, 4.08 crores N-95 masks, 11.16 crore tablets of Hydroxychloroquine, REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 02 ventilators and 1,02,400 oxygen cylinders have been supplied to States/UTs/ Central Government hospitals so far (as reported on 11.12.2020). 2.2.11. Human Resource and Capacity Building Various cadres of personnel and volunteers across sectors and departments that can be involved in not only COVID related work but also to ensure maintenance of other essential medical services have been worked out, pooling manpower resources from Defence, AYUSH, National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Service Scheme (NSS), Nehru Yuva Kendra (NYK), public sector enterprises and private sector. This army of COVID warriors has been engaged in different aspects of field operations. To build the capacities of human resources, including the medical manpower who help managing patients in hospitals; as well as non-medical personnel, frontline workers, who may be involved in non-medical duties such as logistics, surveillance etc., for COVID-19 management, training resources for medical and non-medical personnel have been made available on the website of MoHFW , Online training and webinars for Physicians and Nursing personnel is being conducted by AIIMS. Modules have also been made available on iGOT (online platform) by DOPT (https://igot.gov.in/igot/). The training modules have been translated to regional languages.

Hon'ble HFM addressing Press Conference in New Delhi Additionally, communication material is being hosted on the MoHFW website and shared through social media. Do's and don'ts are being widely circulated through SMS (550 crore SMSs have been sent) and caller-tune messages are being used through telecom subscribers in 13 languages (117 crore subscribers reached) Communication material and toolkits have been developed (pamphlets, poster, audio and AV films) and shared with the States/UTs. They cover basic information on COVID-19 along with preventive steps to be taken for all age groups; preventing perpetuation of myths; and stigma and discrimination. Wide publicity is being to the helpline numbers and a dedicated call centre/helpline (1075) has been started to guide community at large. These are being used by citizens very effectively and on a regular basis. Hon'ble Prime Minister of India, on 08.10.2020, launched the \"Jan Andolan for COVID-19 Appropriate Behaviour\" campaign in view of the upcoming festivals and winter season as well as the opening up of the economy from the lockdown. The campaign aims to encourage People's Participation (Jan Andolan). It endeavors to be a low-cost high intensity campaign with key messages of 'Wear Mask, Follow Physical Distancing and Maintain Hand Hygiene' . 2.2.13 Monitoring A robust system of data analytics is in place for monitoring on a daily basis so that all States and districts can manage their situation. They are being guided to handle cumulative cases, active cases, recovered/cured/migrated, growth rate, doubling rate, tests per million, confirmation percentage, CFR and infrastructure analysis (including COVID care beds, oxygen supported beds, ICU beds and ventilator beds). The States have also access to these data. The performance of the States and Districts are monitored and States lagging on these parameters or those that are below the National average are taken up for discussion with the State Authorities at various levels through video conferencing and also by visit of Central teams to designated States. 2.2.14. Research and Development Investment in research, healthcare and public health infrastructure have been considered as vital investment for the health and protection of the nation. Accordingly, funds are being allocated under Atma-Nirbhar Swasth Bharat Y ojana.

Under \"India COVID-19 Emergency Response Health System Package\" , provisioning of Rs 15,000 crores World Bank funds are taken up. The activities funded under this package includes: 1) Expansion of dedicated COVID treatment facilities including conversion of railway coaches to COVID Care Centers by Ministry of Railways 2) Providing insurance cover to COVID Warriors 3) Supporting laboratory infrastructure and testing 4) Undertaking surveillance and contact tracing 5) Procuring PPEs, N-95 masks and ventilators. In addition, States were also allowed to use funds from State Disaster Response Funds. Atmanirbhar Bharat underlines the commitment of the Government for increased investments in public health and other health reforms to prepare India for future pandemics. An Expenditure Finance Committee proposal is under consideration for about Rs. 64,179.75 crore. 2.3 COVID-19 V ACCINATION COVID-19 pandemic broke out in December 2019& spread across the world. The Government of India took proactive steps to respond to the pandemic and initiated the preparedness of the health systems to respond to all aspects of COVID-19 management. GoI followed 'test, track and treat' strategy diligently and continued the emphasis on preventive measures to contain the spread of the virus which includes wearing masks, hand wash/use of sanitizer, adequate physical distance, prompt testing on observing symptoms and prompt isolation ontesting positive.With consistent collaborative efforts between Centre & States/UTs, country witnessed a steady and continuous decline in new cases since mid-September 2020. Besides this, COVID-19 death rate in India wasamong the lowest in the world, and India had one of the highest recoverysglobally. Country's public health efforts were strongly supported by its research and development capacity in developing vaccines against COVID-19. India is one of the largest global suppliers of vaccines- producing nearly 60%of the world's vaccines. The National Task Force on Vaccine Development was established to set up the processfor CoronaVvirusVaccine development and provided the necessary impetus in this direction. Further, the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGV AC), constituted in August 2020, guided the process for vaccine administration.Besides these high-level Committees and Task Forces, there is an already existing overarching guidance mechanism of the country'stechnical group on vaccines and immunization-National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI). Keeping in mind the limited vaccines availability initially, and coupled with increased global demand, the NEGV AC prioritized certain population groups for vaccination. The prioritized groups aggregate to nearly 30 crore in number and include the healthcare workers (service providers & other workers in health facilities of both Government & private sector), frontline workers (State and Central Police department, Armed Forces, Home Guard and Civil Defence Organization including disaster management volunteers, municipal workers, prison staff and revenue workers involved in COVID-19 containment & surveillance), persons above 50 years of age and persons less than 50 years with associated co-morbidities. 220 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 02 Among the many vaccines under various phases of development in the country, two vaccines were granted Emergency Use Authorization by the Indian regulators in January 2021. One of these vaccines was developed and manufactured in India in collaboration with ICMR, and the other vaccine had involvement of prestigious global players during research and development. Both these vaccines have demonstrated safety and immunogenicity, are more cost-effective than those available outside the country and are also compatible with the existing cold chain infrastructure of the country in terms of vaccine storage temperature. The COVID-19 vaccination utilizes the existing infrastructure of the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP), including the cold chain system which was assessed and accordingly augmented to keep it ready for storage of the requisite quantity of vaccines.Similarly, the syringes stock was assessed and orders were placed to meet the additional demand for COVID-19 vaccination (supplies of syringes started from December 2020). A unique digital platform- Co-WIN (Winning over COVID) supports the vaccination activity, helping the programme managers in registration and tracking of every beneficiary for COVID-19 vaccination along with real time information on the available stocks of vaccine, their storage temperature, actual vaccination process, generation of digital certificates etc.Among the 30crore population that is to be vaccinated, the health workforce forms nearly 1 crore and nearly 2crore is the frontline workforce.GoI took regular reviews and was in constant touch with the States/UTs and concerned Ministries for timely upload of healthcare & frontline worker beneficiary data on Co-WIN portal. All States/UTs were provided guidance on establishing governance and monitoring mechanism through State Steering Committee, State Task Force, District Task Force, Block/Urban Task Force to this effect. Detailed operational guidelines on COVID-19 vaccines and the operational mechanisms were shared with all States/UTs, which included inter-sectoral coordination, governance& review mechanisms, Co-WIN platform & functionalities, session planning & management, session site layout & its organization, AEFI management, cold chain management, infection prevention & control practices, waste management, monitoring & supervision etc. Guidelines wereregularly updated with latest developments for further directions to the States/UTs. The COVID-19 Communication Strategy for vaccination was prepared that focused on building vaccine confidence through clear, consistent and transparent messaging and emphasized on providing correct information on COVID-19 vaccines, addressing vaccine hesitancy and vaccine eagerness and promoting COVID appropriate behavior. Communications National Media Rapid Response Cell was established at MoHFW FAQs for general public and healthcare & frontline workers were developed & uploaded on MoHFW website Media channels, radio jockeys, producers & programming heads, regional PIB heads were oriented on COVID-19 vaccination Experts identified for op-eds and articles to build vaccine confidence Fact check videos by key experts were preparedanddisseminated to providecorrect & factual information for general public Capacity building of entire human resource was conducted in a cascade manner, from training of trainers at national level to the vaccination teams working at the ground level. More than 7,600 participants were trained at State level; 221 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 02 around 61,500 trained at district level; more than 2 lakh vaccinators and 3.9 lakh other vaccination team members were trained on the process to be followed at the vaccination sites. A 24x7 National Call Centre was established to address queries from general public on COVID-19 and thevaccination process. It was also equipped to handle queries from Co-WIN application users on Co-WIN IT platform & troubleshooting. A dedicated technical support team handled Co-WIN platform related queries which could not be addressed by the call centre. The AEFI surveillance system under UIP was strengthened for COVID-19 AEFI management and reporting by inclusion of experts like cardiologists, neurologists in AEFI Committees at various levels, revision in contents of AEFI & Anaphylaxis Kits, training of alternate vaccinators on Anaphylaxis kit, frequent Committee meetings etc.Stakeholders across Ministries/Departments, professional bodies, medical colleges, NGOs, CSOs, media houses, private sector, youth & women network have been involved in this drive which is being coordinated as a Jan Bhagidari Andolan. Country utilized the experience ofimmunization programme and of conducting large-scale immunization campaigns, along with the experience of elections (booth strategy) to effectively cover large numbers and varied geographies.

Another office, named Regional Health Office (RHO) came into being in 1963 to coordinate and supervise the Family Welfare activities in 11 States. Later on in 1978, when the need was felt for an office of the GoI in the States to supervise, monitor and coordinate the matters of all Centrally sponsored HFW programmes, the RCOs and RHOs were merged to form 17 Regional Office for Health and Family Welfare (ROHFW). Further, to supplement the activities of CBHI, four four Health Information Field Units (HIFUs) were established within ROHFWs in 1981 and two more units added in 1986, subsequently making total of 6 HIFUs units. Further, Regional Leprosy Training Institute (RLTRI), Raipur was designated as a Regional Directorate of HFW to look after the work of State of Chhattisgarh in 2005. Further, the work of ROHFW in the State of Assam was assigned to the Deputy Director, Regional Drug Testing Laboratory (RDTL) in 2005 till an alternative arrangement could be made. The sub-units of the ROHFW include Health & Family Welfare (HFW); Entomological & Malaria section (NVBDCP); Regional Evaluation Team (RET); Malaria Operation Field Research Scheme (MOFRS) and Health Information Field Unit (HIFU). All the ROHFWs do not have all the sub units and so, their organisational structure is not uniform. 302 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 03 Locations of ROHFW and its sub-units in the field S.N.

This is being done with a view to sustain the production of medical and allied health care manpower to meet the requirements of health care delivery system at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels in the country. This chapter discusses the status of these sectors and various reforms therein. 4.2 MEDICAL COUNCIL OF INDIA The Medical Council of India was established under the provisions of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956. The main functions of the MCI were to make recommendations to the Central Government in matters of recognition of medical qualifications, determining the courses of study and examinations required to obtain such qualifications, inspection of examinations and maintenance of register of medical practitioners, etc. The working of MCI has been under scrutiny for a long time and the same was examined by various expert bodies, including the Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, which in its Ninety-second Report, in March, 2016, severely indicted the said Council. The Committee observed that the MCI failed to keep pace with time and recommended that the Govt. should bring a new comprehensive Bill in Parliament at the earliest so as to restructure and revamp the regulatory system of medical education and medical practice and thereby reform the MCI. In September, 2018, the MCI was superseded and placed under the administrative control of a Board of Governors for a period of two years. The Board of Governors consisted of 11 eminent professionals in the field of medical sciences. 4.3 NATIONAL MEDICAL COMMISSION (NMC) The National Medical Commission Act, 2019, for setting up a National Medical Commission and to repeal the Indian Medical Council Act 1956 received the assent of the President on 08.08. 2019. The said Act provides for constitution of a National Medical Commission along with four Autonomous Boards namely - Under Graduate Medical Education Board (UGMEB), Post Graduate Medical Board (PGMEB), Medical Assessment and Rating Board (MARB) and Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB). The National Medical Commission was constituted with effect from 25.09.2020 repealing the erstwhile Indian Medical Council Act, 1956. This is a historic reform that will steer the direction of medical education towards a transparent, qualitative and accountable system. The basic premise and principled change that has happened - is that the Regulator is now 'selected' on merit, as opposed to an 'elected' Regulator. The professionals with impeccable integrity, experience and stature have been now placed at the helm to steer the medical education reforms further. 318 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 04 The coming into being of NMC paves the way for continuation and deepening of reforms. The NMC Act provides for holding of an Exit Exam namely - the National Exit Test (NEXT) for medical graduates that will also serve as a licentiate exam, Screening Test for foreign medical graduates and also an exam for entry to post graduation. The NEXT would be an outcome based assessment of medical colleges that will ensure common standards for medical education. To promote affordable education, the NMC Act, 2019 empowers the Commission to frame guidelines for determination of fee and all other charges in respect of 50% seats being charged by private medical colleges and deemed universities. The said Act also provides for rating of medical colleges which would help the students aspiring to pursue medical education to choose the college in a better-informed manner. Further, to boost the primary and preventive health care in the country, the NMC Act provides for creation of a cadre of Community Health Providers who would have limited prescribing authority at the primary and preventive health care level to correct the regional imbalance and enable an efficient utilisation of health care resources. 4.4 NATIONAL BOARD OF EXAMINATIONS (NBE) The National Board of Examinations is an Autonomous Organisation under the Ministry of HFW , GoI, registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, with the objective of conducting postgraduate examinations in the field of modern medicine on an all-India basis, formulating basic training requirements for eligibility and developing patterns of teaching in postgraduate medical education.

It aimed to lay down science- based standards for articles of food and regulate their manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and import. These goals were meant to ensure availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) was established in September, 2008 as the apex authority on all matters of food safety and to ensure safe and wholesome food to consumers. 5.1.1 Activities Enforcement/ Regulatory Compliance States/UTs are primarily responsible for enforcement of FSSAI Act, Rules and Regulations. The State machinery for enforcement includes Food Safety Commissioners, Designated Officers, Food Safety Officers and Adjudicating Officers. Regular interaction is being held with State Government officials through meetings of the Central Advisory Committee in which all States are represented, Video conferences are being held with the participation of FSSAI in the State level steering committee meetings. Additional Food Safety Commissioners have been notified for Railways, Airports and Ports along with Designated Offices for Airports and Ports. All Food Business Operators (FBOs) in the country are required to be registered or licensed under Section 31 of the Food Safety & Standards Act, 2006 to commence or carry on any food business. There is an online process for issuance of licenses to Food Business Operators (FBOs). So far, 68,861 Central Licenses have been issued by the Central Licensing Authorities. The States/ UTs have granted 14,69,429 State licenses and registered 66,79,117 FBOs FSSAI has taken several steps towards simplification and rationalisation of licensing and registration processes: i. FSSAI launched a more comprehensive and swifter Food Safety Compliance System (FoSCoS) replacing existing Food Licensing and Registration System (FLRS) initially in 9 States/UTs with effect from 01.06.2020. To start with FoSCoS will be offering licensing, registration, inspection and annual return modules. This will be escalated to include more modules for functional needs such as advanced MIS, audit module, linkage with InFolNet, hygiene rating etc. It has since been launched in remaining 27 States/UTs w.e.f. 01.11.2020 for which a public notice was also issued on 12.10.2020. FoSCoS is conceptualised to provide a one point stop for all engagement of an FBO with FSSAI for any regulatory compliance transaction. ii. FSSAI has undertaken comprehensive review of Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration of Food Businesses) Regulations, 2011 and finalised Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and 332 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 05 Registration) Amendment Regulations, 2011 for draft notification. This will simplify and rationalise the licensing/registration process and ensure better compliance by the FBOs. These include perpetual license and registration subject to submission of Annual Returns and Declarations respectively, reduction in documents, realignment of various Kinds of Businesses (KoBs), rationalization of license fee, reduction of modification fee, special provision for new emerging models such as e-commerce, direct sellers etc. Certain provisions of the said amendment regulations relating to reduction of modification fee to Rs.1000 only and provisions regarding testing, inspection, audit, food safety supervisor and scheme for facilitator have since been re-operationalised iii. FSSAI has completely done away with physical submission of various documents required for licensing/registration under the FSS Act. Also, instructions have been issued recently that no additional document other than the list issued by FSSAI specified for a kind of business is to be sought by licensing authorities and in case of pre-requisite condition of additional document requirement by a local body or a State/UT, the same may be communicated to the public through a public notification issued by a Competent Authority or Commissioner of Food Safety of State/UT iv. To avoid postal delays, inconvenience and harassment to FBOs in getting physical signed copy of License / Registration, FSSAI has introduced issuance of system generated License/Registration to e-mail IDs of FBOs which shall bear a Quick Response (QR) Code as a security feature to verify the License/Registrationv. To protect the interest of consumers, instructions have been issued requiring the container/tray holding non-packaged/loose Indian sweets at the outlet for sale to display mandatory 'Best Before Date' . In addition, FBO may also display the 'Date of Manufacturing 'which shall be purely voluntary and non-binding. The order has been made effective from 01.10 .2020. However, the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi has stayed the order for the time being An Advisory dated 08.09.2020 has been issued to all Food Safety Commissioners/Central Licensing Authorities to file complaint in courts for violation of provisions of IMS act for violation of Sections 3,4,9 etc. of IMS Act relating to banning/prohibiting advertising, promoting and incentivising the use or sale of infant milk substitutes or feeding bottles or infant foods or inducement to health workers for promoting use of infant milk substitutes etc including funding of a seminar, meeting, conference educational course, contest, fellowship, research work or sponsorship FSSAI has issued instructions to Food Safety Commissioners for taking effective enforcement measures that are of immediate public concern. Instructions have been issued during the year to undertake surveillance, sampling and inspection at premises of FBOs at regular intervals to: i. Curb misuse of Golden syrup/Invert Sugar Syrup/Rice Syrup ii. Ensure that FBOs are manufacturing and selling blended edible vegetable oil (BEVO) with FSSAI license along with AGMARK certification. Also, no import of BEVO is to be allowed without AGMARK certification iii. Check manufacture and import of stapled tea bags except for 16 FBOs who were allowed further time limit333 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 05 iv. Ensure compliance with orders banning the use of Para Amino Benzoic Acid (PABA) in the products covered under Nutraceutical Regulations due to safety concerns v. Check on products for RDA values exceeding RDA limits prescribed by FSSAI, in case of license to products covered under FSS (Food or Health Supplements, Nutraceuticals, Foods for Special Dietary Use, Foods for Special Medical Purpose, Functional Foods and Novel Foods) Regulations, 2016 vi. Strictly monitor the production process of all vegetable oil refineries and blending units under their jurisdiction carrying out surveillance through indictors like presence of Glycerine in the oil mills, presence of Oryzanol in the Mustard oil products of such mills/FBOs vii. Strict compliance of the labelling of the products covered under FSS Regulations, 2016 with the standards specified under general labelling requirements under the FSS (Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 2011 To give relief to FBOs, a list of labelling defects categorised into exceptions (minor labeling defects of insignificant nature and without any food safety concern) and mandatory cases (against which adjudication action could be taken) has been prepared and shared with States/UTs. They have been advised to issue necessary instructions to State DOs and FSOs to deal with cases involving minor labelling defects not posing any food safety concern by issue of improvement notices under Section 32. FSSAI has developed State Food Safety Index to measure the performance of States on various parameters of Food Safety. The index is based on performance of States/UTs on five significant parameters, namely Human Resource and Institutional Data (weightage -20%), Compliance (30%), Food Testing Infrastructure and Surveillance (20%), Training and Capacity Building (10%) and Consumer empowerment (20%). For the year 2019-20, the ranking was released on 07.06.2020. Among the larger States, Gujarat was the top ranking State, followed by Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. Among the smaller States, Goa came first followed by Manipur and Meghalaya. Among UTs, Chandigarh, Delhi and Andaman Islands secured top ranks. With the release of the Index Rankings, States/UTs have become more vigilant and have been working towards improving in various parameters listed in the index. In order to address the gaps in the food safety eco- system of States/UTs and to promote the culture of safe and wholesome food through pooling of technical knowledge and best practices, as a shared responsibility, it is proposed to extend both technical and financial support to the States/UTs. Accordingly, an MoU for strengthening the Food Safety Eco-system in the country has been proposed to be signed between FSSAI and States/UTs. Proposals have been received from 23 States/UTs so far. Work plans are being finalised and assistance provided to the States/UTs after signing the MoU. 5.1.2 Standards and Regulations Globally Benchmarked Food Standards FSSAI has constituted 21 subject specific scientific panels under Section 13 of the FSS Act, including two new Scientific Panels on Packaging and Alcoholic Beverages for providing scientific opinion. There is also a Scientific Committee under Section 14 of the FSS Act, whose mandate includes providing scientific opinion to the Food Authority, general co-coordination necessary to ensure consistency of the scientific opinion and in 334 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 05 particular with regard to the adoption of working procedures and harmonisation of working methods of Scientific Panels. Opinion is also sought on multi-sectoral issues falling within the competence of more than one Scientific Panel and setting up working groups on issues which do not fall within the competence of any of the Scientific panels. These Forums meet as often as required to give scientific opinions and recommend on development of food standards. Development of standards is a dynamic process based on the latest developments in food science, food consumption pattern, new food products and additives, changes in the processing technology leading to changed specifications, advancements in food analytical methods and identification of new risks or other regulatory options etc. So far, FSSAI has developed over 500 food product standards and also reviewed and amended the standards as required. It has also expanded standards for food additives that now has over 9,000 provisos covering 350 additives and food processing aids by harmonising the standards of food additives with Codex Standards.

FSSAI is also planning to conduct the 7 th Food Analyst Examination and 4th Junior Analyst Examination during this FY . The tender for selecting the agency has already been floated. SurveysFSSAI has conducted a Pan-India Edible Oil Quality survey in the month of August, 2020. The result of the survey is being compiled. FSSAI has also conducted a pan India survey for detection of adulteration in khoya through FSW provided by FSSAI to States/UTs by placing these FSWs at Khoya Mandies for testing of samples. The result received from States/UTs are being compiled. FSSAI will soon conduct a pan India Milk Product Survey 2020 (MPS-2020) with the objective of assessing the quality and safety of milk products sold during the festival period in the country and identify hotspots of adulterated and unsafe milk products, if any. Effort will be made to put in place a continuous surveillance framework for assessing quality of milk products sold in the country. A Pan-lndia Sampling of Milk Products (Khoa, Paneer, Chhainna, Khoa based & Paneer based sweets) was conducted by FSSAI on 12 & 13 November, 2020 during the festival period ol Diwali to identify hotspots of adulteration. During this exercise 50 samples from each metro city and 5 samples each from other cities and districts were drawn and approx. 3100 samples have been collected. The test results of samples will be available in due course 337 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 05 5.1.4 Addressing Micronutrient Deficiencies through Food Fortification FSSAI is addressing micronutrient deficiencies by notifying standards for fortification of key staple viz. edible oil and milk (with Vitamin A & D) , wheat flour and rice (with iron, folic acid and vitamin B12 ) and salt with iron (in addition to iodine) for which it has notified Food Safety and Standards (Fortification of Foods ) Regulations, 2018 on 02.08.2018 . The standards prescribe minimum and maximum range of fortification. Apart from establishing standards, FSSAI is promoting food fortification by launching a +F logo to identify fortified food; by setting up a Food Fortification Resource Centre as a resource hub and by promoting large scale fortification in the open market and in Government Food Safety Net Programmes such as ICDS, MDM and PDS through advocacy. Advocacy is being done through National level and regional webinars with States/UTs, manufacturers of fortified staples etc. 'Daily Recommendations and Fortification-A handbook for States/UTs'( to clarify and support implementation of fortification) was released on the World Food Day by the Hon'ble Union Health Minister on 16.10.2020. Communication campaigns on fortification are being launched through TV channels and Radio spots, social media etc. IEC posters have also been released. Meanwhile FSSAI is supporting POSHAN Maah (Nutrition month) through social media too. Directions have been issued by the nodal Ministries /Departments for introducing fortification in Government Food Safety Net Programmes. Currently 22 States and five Union Territories have adopted fortification of several commodities in the government safety net programmes (SNP) namely, ICDS, MDM and PDS. Department of Food and Public Distribution has launched a Pilot Scheme-'Fortification of Rice under Public Distribution System' which is being implemented in 15 districts . Consolidated data on fortification is being monitored by FFRC. Voluntary fortification has already begun for five staples in the open market. With 114 large as well as MSME companies offering ~ 157 fortified products across commodities, FSSAI has proposed for mandatory fortification of milk and oil in the open market. Another important regulation to boot fortification of food, which is under formulation, will now cover standards for fortification of species identified milk like a cow buffalo, camel, goat sheep etc; for all kinds of multigrain atta and categories of processed foods covering cereal products, bakery wares, and juices -with various specified micronutrients, except in products that are high in fat, salt and sugar. 5.1.5 Imports As per Section 25 of the Food Safety & Standards Act, 2006, all imports of articles of food are subject to the provisions of the Act. It stipulates that no person shall import into India any article of food in contravention of the Act or any rules and regulations made thereunder. Exercising the power of the Act, the Central Government, on the recommendations of the Food Authority, notified the FSS (Import) Regulations, 2017 on 09.03.2017. Food import is being regulated at 150 points of entry. FSSAI has its presence at 22 points of entry under six locations namely Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Delhi, Cochin and Tuticorin and has its own food import clearance system (FICS) which is an online system, integrated with the customs ICE-GATE (Indian Customs Electronic Commerce/Electronic Data interchange (EC/EDI) Gateway) under SWIFT (Single window interface for facilitating trade). Customs Department implements the Risk Management 338 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 05 system (RMS), i.e. selective sampling and testing of food articles, under SWIFT in consultation with FSSAI. FSSAI has set the parameters for RMS to be applicable on imported food items. RMS is being applied in ICEGATE before sending the consignment/bill of entry (BOE) in FICS. At other 128 PoEs, Customs officers have been notified as Authorised Officers to regulate the clearance of food consignments as per the norms prescribed by FSSAI for which they have been provided requisite training. The food articles, when referred to FSSAI for clearance by the Customs Authorities, are subjected to scrutiny of documents, visual inspection, sampling and testing in order to determine whether or not they conform to the safety and quality standards established and laid down under various food safety and standards regulations. If the sample is found conforming to the standards, then No Objection Certificate (NOC) is generated and in case it is not conforming, a Non-Conforming Report (NCR) is generated. To regulate imports, some important instructions issued during the year include: To ensure the quality of honey and to contain the misuse of imported Golden syrup/Invert Sugar Syrup/Rice syrup in production of honey, all importers/FBOs, which are importing golden Syrup/Invert Sugar Syrup/Rice Syrup into India have been directed vide order dated 20.05.2020 to submit necessary documents to Authorised Officers at scrutiny stage before clearance, regarding details of manufacturers with end use as to whom the aforesaid imported food items will be supplied. FSSAI issued an order dated 07.07.2020 clarifying that import of Blended Edible Vegetable Oils (BEVO) without AGMARK certification is not allowed in India and further the BEVO shall comply with the rules and regulations made under FSS Act, 2006. To ensure that only non-GM crops are imported into India, pending framing of regulations related to GM in Section 22 of FSS Act, 2006, FSSAI issued an Order dated 21.08.2020 prescribing requirement of non-GM origin -cum-GM free certificate issued by Competent National Authority of the exporting country, for every consignment of imported 24 food crops as mentioned therein. The order shall be effective from 01.01.2021. FSSAI has taken a number of steps to rationalise and ease the process of import including introduction of a Risk Management System whereby only a limited percentage of products are sampled based on risk category of the food items; facility of advance filing of Bill of Entry to minimise clearance time and demurrage charges. It also looks at the issuance of Provisional (P-NOC) for perishable products with short shelf life and imported pre-packaged retail food articles, expanding list of rectifiable labelling information, complete mapping of ITC-HS codes of imported food items along with risk categorisation of each ITC-HS code etc. 5.1.6 Training and Capacity building To build capacities of food business to ensure food safety, promote self-compliance to FSS Act, Rules and Regulations and bring about a behavioural change and to inculcate a culture of food safety, FSSAI had introduced the Food Safety Training and Certification (FoSTaC) programme in 2017. It involves 19 short duration programmes of 4-12 hours for different kinds of food businesses with focus on good hygiene and manufacturing practices based on Schedule 4 of Food Safety & Standards Regulations, 2011.

Following this, the PoE officers were instructed to be vigilant, train their health team and arrange/identify dedicated ambulance for transfer of suspects and isolation facility/hospitals. Health screening through Self Reporting Forms (SRF) and temperature check through infrared digital thermometer of incoming international passengers from China and other high-risk countries was initiated at three airports, namey Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata on 17.01.2020, well before COVID-19 was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by WHO on 30.01.2020. Suspected passengers with COVID 19 symptoms were transferred to the designated isolation hospitals in PPE. Gradually the number of airports was increased from 3 to 30 depending upon the number of countries affected as per inputs from various sources, including the WHO situational analysis reports along with 12 Major Ports and 65 minor ports and seven Land Border Crossings.In addition, major airlines were instructed through the Ministry of Civil Aviation to make in-flight announcements of Dos & Don'ts on COVID-19. Relevant IEC materials on COVID-19 were distributed to all incoming passengers as pamphlets. Hoarding, signages were displayed at all the common areas of the airports. Self-reporting forms were made mandatory for international passengers coming from notified countries to be submitted in duplicate for further follow-up for contact tracing by Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP). Screening of passengers for COVID-19 continued till 23.03.2020 until the suspension of all international flights to India. A total of 15, 24,266 passengers from 14,154 flights were screened 76,221 passengers were shared with IDSP for contact tracing. On 25.03.2020, the GoI announced a national lockdown and consequent closure of commercial flight operations. Subsequently the entry screening was limited to crew members, pilots and passengers of special and/or cargo flights. About 86,379 persons were screened at 12 major, 65 minor seaports. Similar screening activities were performed at land borders through the State Health agencies. Vande Bharat Mission was initiated by the GoI for the evacuation of Indian citizens stranded abroad during the pandemic. All in-bound international passengers were quarantined in institutional facilities managed by the concerned State health department. So far, more than 10,10,666 incoming international passengers through 8,243 flights have undergone screening (data from 10.05.2020 to 27.11.2020). The surveillance activities are being coordinated by MoHFW , IDSP and State governments. Role of IH division of the Directorate General of Health Services: The pivotal role of coordination and streamlining the Health Screening, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine activities at PoEs was done at the Headquarters (IHR). Manpower 377 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 07 such as doctors and paramedics were mobilised from CGHS and state Governments to conduct surveillance activities. Before being deputed at the PoE, the healthcare workers were trained through a Structured Training programme under the guidance of headquarters. Guidelines and SoP's were made and shared with all stakeholders from time to time. Further, the Headquarters engaged the State governments for logistics supply of surveillance activities such as Handheld digital thermometers, PPE, sanitizers; self-reporting forms etc on need basis for all the PoEs. Daily screening data was gathered from all the PoEs in structured formats and compiled for data analysis for policy and decision making. Regular monitoring of the situation was assessed through video conferencing with all stakeholders from time to time. Secretary (HFW), Special Secretary Health, DGHS, Addl. DGHS and other officials actively monitored the situation across the country. 7.4 AGREEMENTS / MoUs The following MoUs/ MoCs were signed during the period 01.01.2020 - 09.12.2020: 1.

The representation of SCs, STs and Other Backward Classes in the Department of HFW and its Attached and Subordinate Offices; the Central Health Services (CHS) cadre administered by the Department of HFW as on 01.01.2019 is as below: Name of Cadre Total EmployeesSC ST OBC Others D/o Health & Family Welfare and its attached offices14407 3872 1125 23837027 Central Health Services (All Group A Posts)3617 611 281 599 2126 8.2 NATIONAL HEALTH MISSION (NHM) The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in 2005 to provide accessible, affordable and quality health care to the rural population especially to the vulnerable sections of society. In 2013, the NRHM was subsumed under the National Health Mission (NHM) as its Sub-Mission, along with the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) as the other Sub-Mission. In terms of infrastructure development, thrust has been given to reduce the gap in availability of facilities, particularly in Tribal areas. Overall, there has been 67.89% increase in facilities available in Tribal areas compared to 16.24% increase for all, between 2005 and 2019: Type of India 8.2.1 Relaxed Norms for Tribal areas Under NHM, tribal areas enjoy relaxed norms under several criteria and conditions. i. Relaxed norms for health facilities: The population norms for setting up health facilities in tribal areas are relaxed. Against the population norms of 5,000, 30,000 and 1,20,000 for setting up Sub-Centres, PHCs and CHCs respectively, in tribal and desert areas it is 3,000 for SC; 20,000 for PHC; and 80,000 for CHC. A new norm of \"time to care\" has also been adopted for setting up Sub-Health Centres in tribal areas under which a Sub- Health Centre can be set up within 30 minutes of walk from habitation; ii. Flexibility with the assigning of ASHAs: States have been provided with the flexibility of relaxing the norm of one ASHA per 1000 population to one ASHA per habitation in tribal/hilly and difficult areas. iii. Medical Mobile Units: While other States had Mobile Medical Units per 10.00 lakh population subject to capping of five MMUs per district, for tribal and hilly States this could be relaxed as per need. The norms for MMU have been further revised to relax the norm where extra MMU is allowed if the existing MMU exceeds 60 patients per day in plain areas and 30 patients per day in tribal/hilly areas. iv. High Priority Districts: All tribal majority districts whose composite health index is below the State average, have been identified as High Priority Districts (HPDs). These districts are to receive higher per capita funding, relaxed norms, enhanced monitoring and focused supportive supervision. They are encouraged to adopt innovative approaches to address their peculiar health challenges. 8.3 NATIONAL URBAN HEALTH MISSION (NUHM) NUHM, as a Sub-Mission of NHM, covers all cities and towns with more than 50,000 population and district headquarters and State headquarters with more than 30,000 population. The remaining cities and towns continue to be covered under the NRHM. As part of Ayushman Bharat, the existing UPHCs are being strengthened as Health & Wellness Centres (HWCs) to provide preventive, promotive and curative services in cities closer to the communities. So far 3,339 HWCs have been operationalised in urban areas as on March, 2020. Since the beginning of the Programme in FY 2013- 14, support has been provided for strengthening of more than 4,800 facilities in urban areas, construction of about 863 new UPHCs and approving UCHCs. The human resources under the programme include around 3,400 Medical Officers, 400 Specialists, 16,000 ANMs, 9100 Staff Nurses, 3,500 Pharmacists, 3,900 Lab Technicians and 680 Public Health Managers. About 74,000 ASHAs and 92,000 MAS have been approved for effective community participation activities. Training and capacity building activities have also been approved for building and strengthening institutional capacity. The services being provided through these facilities are available to all sections of the population including SC & ST. 8.4 NATIONAL TUBERCULOSIS ELIMINATION PROGRAMME; FOCUS ON TRIBAL AREAS Tuberculosis has been a priority public health issue identified to be addressed by the GoI. The National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) is implemented under the aegis of the NHM and provides free diagnosis and treatment 383 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 08 and delivers public health functions to reduce the incidence of TB in the country. The GoI has committed to achieve targets for TB under the SDGs by 2025, five years ahead of global timelines. Under NTEP , the benefits of the programme are available to all sections of society on a uniform basis, irrespective of caste, gender, religion etc. However, in tribal, hilly and difficult areas, special provisions have been made to expand diagnostics and treatment centres, programme management units, to improve access to TB patients and coverage of TB services under NTEP . 8.4.1 Key Highlights of the programme TB Programme Management Unit (TB Units): One Programme Manager has been assigned for every one lakh population in tribal, hilly and difficult area as against one for every 2 lakh general population. Every TB unit is supported with a supervisory staff for management of diagnosis and treatment services in the area. Microscopy Centres for diagnosis of TB: The norms for establishing microscopy centres has been revised from one per 1,00,000 general population to one per 50,000 population in tribal, hilly, and difficult areas. Compensation for transportation of patient and attendant in tribal areas: Rs. 750 is provisioned to TB patients notified from designated tribal areas to support travel to access TB diagnosis and treatment centres. A total of 83,172 beneficiaries in tribal areas have been paid Rs. 6.45 crore from April 2018 to March 2020. NTEP has introduced Active TB Case (ACF) finding in key/ vulnerable populations which includes tribal areas. Systematic active TB screening is being undertaken in these vulnerable populations for early identification of TB symptomatic and early diagnosis of TB. Since 2017, about 27,85,616 persons have been screened amongst tribal population and 1,424 additional TB patients have been diagnosed and notified. In year 2018, about 2,29,580 persons were notified amongst tribal population, out of which 2,24,588 were initiated on treatment. In year 2019, about 2,58,013 persons amongst tribal population were notified, out of which 2,50,207 were initiated on treatment. During year 2020 (Jan-August), about 1,27,816 persons have been notified so far amongst tribal population, out of which 1,21,960 have been initiated on treatment. A special project to reach out to the tribal population was initiated with support of the Global Fund in coordination with the ICMR. The Project titled \"Targeted Intervention to Expand and Strengthen TB Control in Tribal Populations under NTEP\" was undertaken in 17 districts of five States, namely Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Jharkhand. The most significant aspect of the project is the deployment of the Mobile TB Diagnostic Van (MTDV) equipped with X-ray facilities and Sputum Microscopy facilities which offer diagnostic services for Tuberculosis at the doorstep of the patient's home in difficult to reach areas of the tribal populations. As many as 35 such MTDVs were provided in these five States. The contribution to the total case notification by the MTDV was observed to be significant. Most importantly, the Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOP) of the patients reduced drastically which is highly significant and reflects on the aspect that offering services at the doorstep of the patients does improve the Standard of Care to the patients. The reduction in man-days for seeking consultative, diagnostic and treatment services when being serviced by the MTDV also reflects on the improved standards of care through doorstep services. 384 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 08 After completion of the project, MTDVs were further redistributed among 12 States to aid in screening communities and providing quality diagnosis near to the patient. Taking the learning from this project, NTEP has added 45 vans, distributed across the country, equipped with CBNAAT machines to support the States for undertaking Active Case Finding for diagnosis of TB patients and to use this facility to fill the gaps in diagnostics related to access under the diagnostics policy of NTEP . At present, 80 mobile TB Diagnostic Vans are functional across the country to cover hard-to-reach populations including tribal areas. 8.5 NATIONAL LEPROSY ERADICATION PROGRAMME (NLEP) National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP), India is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme under the umbrella of the NHM. The major concern of the Programme is to detect the cases of leprosy at an early stage and to provide complete treatment, free of cost, in order to prevent the occurrence of Grade II Disability (G2D) in the affected persons. Under NLEP , it is aimed to reduce G2D per million population to less than 1 per million population and to have zero G2D among new child cases aligned with the target given by Global Leprosy Strategy 2016-20. 8.5.1 Key Initiatives Several initiatives have been taken to encourage early case detection, to ensure complete treatment, and contain the onset of disease in close contacts of index cases (persons diagnosed with leprosy). Briefly, the activities for early case detection are as follows:8.5.1.1 For enhanced active & early case detection, so that there remain no cases of leprosy and eventually converted into Grade II Disability i. Introduction of new Operational Guidelines 2020 \" Active Case Detection & Regular Surveillance\" under NLEP to ensure active case detection throughout the year; ii. Further strengthen active screening for early case detection, on a more regular basis, convergence of leprosy screening under Rashtriya of children (0-18 years) has been done and the detailed screening guidelines have been issued to all the States/ UTs; iii. Convergence of leprosy screening under Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC), Ayushman Bharat for population-based screening of women and men of age 30 years and above iv. Urban Leprosy Screening under NUHM for peri-urban and urban slums area/ colonies' migratory population 8.5.1.2 Stop Discrimination against People Suffering from Leprosy Sparsh Leprosy Awareness Campaigns (SLAC) were launched at the village level to create more awareness so that the level of stigma and discrimination can be reduced in the case of diseases like leprosy. 8.5.1.3 Post Exposure Chemoprophylaxis Administration For prevention of leprosy amongst contacts the administering PEC has been strongly recommended. In addition, various services are being provided under the programme for 385 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 08 Disability Prevention and Medical Rehabilitation (DPMR) i.e., reaction management, provision of MCR footwear, Aids and Appliances, referral services for management of cases and reconstructive surgery at District Hospitals and Medical Colleges/Central leprosy Institutions. Under NLEP , it is aimed to reduce G2D per million population to less than one per million population and zero G2D among new child cases. As a result of focused active case detection combined with timely treatment and management, G2D per million population was 1.96 per million population and number of child patients with disability were 63 as on 31.03.2020. Under NELP , all the above-mentioned services are being provided uniformly to all segments of the society, including the STs and SCs population. However, statistics pertaining to the epidemiological status of ST & SC population are separately collected and analysed. 8.5.2 Epidemiological status Under the programme, state wise disaggregated data of tribal population is collected on monthly basis. In the year 2018-19 (as on March. 2019), out of total 1,20,334 new leprosy cases detected, 21,896 (18.20%) were STs and 23,848 (19.82%) were SCs. And during the year 2019-20 (as on March. 2020), out of total 1,14,451 new leprosy cases detected, 21,469 (18.76%) were STs and 21,184 (18.51%) were SCs. As on September, 2020 during the year 2020-21, out of a total of 26,210 new leprosy cases detected, 5495 (20.96%) were STs and 4650 (17.74%) were SCs. State-wise graph of leprosy cases among Scheduled Tribes population as on 31.03.2020 386 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 08 State-wise graph of leprosy cases among Scheduled Tribes population as on 30.09.2020 State-wise graph of leprosy cases among Scheduled Castes population as on 31.03.2020 387 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 08 State-wise graph of leprosy cases among Scheduled Castes population as on 30.09.2020 388 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 08 8.6 NATIONAL VECTOR BORNE DISEASE CONTROL PROGRAMME (NVBDCP) The NVBDCP is an umbrella programme for prevention and control of six VBDs viz. Malaria, Japanese Encephalitis (JE), Dengue, Chikungunya, diseases namely Kala-azar, Lymphatic Filariasis and Malaria are targeted for elimination. The States/UTs are responsible for the implementation of the programme, whereas the Directorate of NVBDCP , Delhi provides technical assistance and policy guidelines as also financial assistance to the States/UTs, as per approved norms. Under NVBDCP , promotive, preventive and curative (diagnosis and treatment) services are uniformly made available to all segments of population including SCs and STs in all the States/UTs of the country. Strategies for VBD control are based on the endemicity of diseases. Malaria is more prevalent in North-Eastern States, and central states of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Madhya Pradesh where SC, ST, and low socio-economic population is more. In such areas, special anti-malarial interventions including outreach activities for malaria prevention and control are undertaken, especially in remote and inaccessible areas. Additional support is being provided through externally aided Global Fund projects in these States. Fifty million LLINs (long lasting insecticidal nets) have been distributed among the population so as to saturate high malaria endemic areas of these States. An additional 22.4 million LLINs are being supplied/distributed during the current year 2019-20; and further 25.2 million LLINs are in the pipeline. LLIN usage has been highly appreciated and accepted by the community at large, resulting in drastic decline in the incidence of malaria in the country. The malaria disease burden has declined by 71% (from 1.16 million to 0.34 million) and malaria deaths by 80% (from 384 to 77) in 2019 compared to 2015. For Kala-azar elimination, support by multilateral development partners is being provided in all four endemic states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal where too there is a larger SC/ST population. 8.7 NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR CONTROL OF BLINDNESS & VISUAL IMP AIRMENT (NPCB&VI) The NPCB&VI is being implemented uniformly in all districts of the country. The following initiatives have been introduced under the programme keeping in view the North-East States, which have a predominant tribal population. Assistance is being provided for the construction 389 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 08 of dedicated eye wards and eye operation theatres (OT) in District Hospitals. i. Appointment of Ophthalmic manpower (Ophthalmic Surgeons, Ophthalmic Assistants and Eye Donation Counsellors) in States on contractual basis ii. In addition to Cataract, provision of grant-in-aid to NGOs for management of other eye diseases other than Cataract like Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma Management, Laser Techniques, Corneal Transplantation, Vitreo-retinal Surgery, Treatment of childhood blindness, low vision etc iii. Development of Mobile Ophthalmic Units in NE States, hilly States & difficult terrains for diagnosis and medical management of eye diseases iv. Development of tele-ophthalmology units v. Involvement of private practitioners at the Sub-District, Block and Village level 8.8 AB-PMJAY REGARDING FACILITIES FOR SCHEDULED CASTES AND SCHEDULED TRIBES Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Y ojana (AB-PM JAY) provides benefit coverage to poor and vulnerable population based upon the deprivation criteria specified in the SECC Database, 2011. The eligibility criteria is deprivation-based and not income-based.

Despite a few medical colleges in Assam, Manipur & Tripura, entire North East Region is facing acute shortage of both health infrastructure and man power, more so in super specialties, nursing and paramedics. A separate North-East (NE) Division in the Department of HFW and a Regional Resource Centre (RRC) at Guwahati, Assam were set up to provide capacity building support to the States in NE Region 9.2 NATIONAL HEALTH MISSION IN NORTH-EAST (NE) STATES Development of the NE States has been the Government of India's focus of attention given the difficult geographies and socio-economic profiles of States at Guwahati, Assam had been set up in 2005 to provide technical and managerial support to the NE States in planning, implementation, monitoring & supportive supervision of health programmes, capacity building and improved fund absorption under the umbrella of NHM.Flexibilities have been provided under RCH and NRHM flexi pools to take care of the specific developmental requirements of the region while ensuring that national priorities are also kept in mind. In order to address gaps in secondary and tertiary health care infrastructure requirements of the NE States, a scheme namely 'Forward Linkages for NRHM in North East' was introduced for the States of NE region during the 11 th Five Y ear Plan and continued till FY 2018-19. 9.2.1 Special provisions/norms under NHM The NHM Implementation Framework has relaxed the norms for the NE States given the difficult geographical terrain and topography that marks the physical and economic scenario of the region. i. Weightage for budgetary allocation under NHM for NE States: The resource allocation of funds under NHM-RCH Flexible Pool provides an additional weightage to the NE and Hilly States on account of socio- economic backwardness and health lag as compared to other States ii. Infrastructure Development: 33% of Resource Envelope under NHM can be utilised for the development and strengthening of infrastructure in NE States which otherwise is 25% for non-high focus States394 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 09 iii.

A new norm of \"time to care\" for setting up of SC within 30 minutes by walk from a habitation has been adopted for hilly districts, taking into account the wide dispersal of population iv. State share under NHM: For NE and Hilly States, the fund sharing pattern under NHM is in the ratio of 90:10 between the Central and State Government which is 60:40 for rest of the States v. Budgetary provisions: All Ministries/Departments are mandated to make provision of at least 10% of the Central Plan allocation for projects/schemes in the NE Region vi. ASHAs: Accredited Social Health Activists may be selected for every village with a population of 1,000. The NE States have been given the flexibility to relax population norms as well as educational qualifications on a case-to-case basis, depending on the local conditions without compromising on quality through capacity building 9.2.2 Achievements under NHM With respect to the NE States, the following notable achievements have been recorded across the health care spectrum. i. Health Facilities & HR: As per the Management Information System (MIS) Report for June 2020, 308 CHCs, 687 PHCs and 137 Centres working as First Referral Units (FRU) were operationalised on 24x7 under NHM.

Assistance to States The GoI provides 100% central assistance for programme implementation to the NE States including Sikkim. This includes commodities like drugs, LLINs, insecticides/ larvicides etc. as per approved norms and technical requirements.409 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 09 The additional support under Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) is provided to all the 147 districts of eight States (seven NE states, except Sikkim, and Madhya Pradesh) for implementation of the Global Fund supported \"Intensified Malaria Elimination Project\" for the grant period, January 2018 - March 2021.To strengthen the surveillance and proper implementation of anti-malaria interventions in difficult areas in high endemic districts of Mizoram and Meghalaya, two NGO Sub-recipients (SRs) have been included. Objectives to reduce Malaria morbidity and mortality Achieve near universal coverage of population at risk of malaria with an appropriate vector control intervention (LLIN) Achieve universal coverage of case detection and treatment services (in project areas) to ensure 100% parasitological diagnosis of suspected malaria cases and complete treatment of all confirmed cases Strengthen the surveillance to detect, notify, investigate, classify and respond to all cases and foci in all districts (in project areas) to move towards malaria elimination; an Achieve near universal coverage in project areas by appropriate BCC activities to improve knowledge, awareness and responsive behavior regarding effective preventive and curative interventions. For strengthening early case detection and complete treatment at community level, ASHAs have been trained and involved in high malaria endemic areas along with Fever Treatment Depots (FTDs) and Malaria clinics. This is in addition to the treatment facilities available at the health facilities and hospitals. Anti-malarial drugs and funds for training are provided by Gol under the programme. As per the National Drug Policy, Chloroquine is used for treatment of all P .vivax cases and Artemesinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) with Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (AS+SP) combination is being used for treatment of all P .falciparum cases in the country. However, in NE states, early signs of resistance to ACT-SP were noticed. Keeping in view the same, as per the advice of Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), an effective combination of Artemether-Lumefantrine (ACT-AL) is now being used for the treatment of P .falciparum cases. Under the integrated vector control initiative, IRS is being implemented selectively only in high risk pockets as per district-wise Micro Action Plans from the domestic budget. The Directorate has issued guidelines on IRS to the States for technical guidance. Guidelines on uniform evaluation of insecticides have also been developed in collaboration with National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR), Delhi. Over the years, there is a reduction in IRS covered population in view of paradigm shift to alternative vector control measures such as extensive use of Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLINs). Presently, all the sub-centres having API above 1 have been saturated with LLINs in all seven NE States under GFATM funding support. The goal is to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality by at least 70% in project areas by 2020. 9.8.2 Japanese Encephalitis Japanese Encephalitis is endemic in all North- Eastern States except in Mizoram and Sikkim. 410 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 09 The details of AES/JE cases are as follows: S.

NACO is concerned about the rising HIV incidence among the People Who Inject Drugs (PWID). As such, it is of the view that merely sustaining the present efforts will not be enough to achieve epidemic control and stop new infections and mortality from AIDS in the next few years. In this regard, PEPFAR/CDC India Project Sunrise was launched in February 2016 to complement and support the NE State AIDS Control Societies (SACS) to demonstrate innovations across the prevention to care and treatment continuum to halt the spread of the epidemic. Specifically, key innovations introduced and scaled by Project Sunrise, some of which 418 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 09 have been taken up into the national programme through the revamped TI strategy, include low threshold opioid substitution therapy (OST) strategies (satellite OST, OST take home dosing, flexi-timings, index and social network model for testing hard to reach KP; prison and HIV/ TB/OST interventions and post release linkage to OST and ART services. To continue the progress of Project Sunrise to reduce new infections in the next phase, 'Project Sunshine\" (October 2020- September 2025) is being launched with the goal to implement innovative operational strategies to Integrate and Scale Up Prevention and Treatment Interventions towards achieving HIV Epidemic Control in the States of Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland. Project Sunshine is being implemented in collaboration with NACO, State AIDS Control Societies (SACS), NGOs, community networks and other key stakeholders to accelerate the response to HIV in NE region.

The programme is being implemented in a decentralised manner through respective State/ District Health Societies. Benefits of the scheme are meant for all, including tribal population. The aim of the programme is to improve ear-care services in these States. At present all the districts have been sanctioned for implementation of NPPCD programme in Nagaland, Mizoram, Assam, Manipur, Sikkim and Tripura. A total of 18 out of 25 districts in Arunachal Pradesh and three out of total 11 districts in Meghalaya have been sanctioned for implementation of NPPCD programme.

The overall Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB) data recorded three points improvement from 896 in 2015-17 to 899 in 2016-18. Further, 15 States out of the 22 that were surveyed showed improvement with a maximum of 15 points recorded in Rajasthan followed by Himachal Pradesh (12 points), Gujarat (11 points), Haryana, Assam, and Jammu & Kashmir (10 points). However, other States will need to strive harder to improve their SRB by expediting efforts in this regard. The same is depicted in the graphs below.10.1.2 Pre-conception and Pre- natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994 To check female foeticide, the Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1994, was brought into operation from 01.01.1996. The Act has since been amended to make it more comprehensive. The amended Act came into force with effect from 14.02.2003 and has been renamed as \"Pre-conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994\" (PC&PNDT Act). The technique of pre-conception sex selection has been brought within the ambit of this Act so as to pre-empt the use of such technologies, which significantly contribute to the declining SRB. Use of ultrasound machines has also been brought within the purview of this Act more explicitly so as to curb their misuse for detection and disclosure of sex of the foetus, lest it leads to female foeticide. More stringent punishments are prescribed under the Act, so as to serve as a deterrent against violations of the Act. The aappropriate authorities are empowered with the powers of Civil Court for search, seizure and sealing the machines, equipment and records of the violators of law including sealing of premises and commissioning of witnesses. 10.1.3 Implementation of the PC&PNDT Act in States/UTs As per Quarterly Progress Report (QPR) of September, 2020 submitted by States/UTs, 424 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 10 69,447 diagnostic facilities including Genetic Counselling Centre, Genetic Laboratory, Genetic Clinic, Ultrasound Clinic and Imaging Centre have been registered under the PC& PNDT Act.

With the advent of 102/108 services (NAS) the EMS in India has expanded exponentially and geographically, shifting focus from being a \"transport vehicle concept\" to one that is a \"lifesaving emergency medical transportation\"; injury centric to covering all emergencies; and urban-centric to being pan-India . All this has led to improved response time, for every patient in reaching the hospital for timely care. Presently, 35 States/UTs have the facility where people can dial 108 or 102 for calling an ambulance. Presently, 10,599 Dial-108, 605 Dial-104 and 9,875 Dial-102 Emergency Response Service Vehicles are supported under NHM, besides 5,412 empaneled vehicles for transportation of patients, particularly pregnant women and sick infants from home to public health facilities and back. 10.4 KILKARI AND MOBILE ACADEMY Kilkari, which means \"a baby's gurgle\" , delivers free, weekly, time-appropriate 72 audio messages about pregnancy, child birth and child care directly to families' mobile phones from the second trimester of pregnancy until the child is one year old. Kilkari has been rolled out in the 13 States Uttarakhand. Approximately 30.06 crore successful calls (average duration of content played in each call approximately 1 minute) were made under Kilkari till 15.12.2020. Mobile Academy is a free audio training course designed to expand and refresh the knowledge base of ASHAs and improve their communication skills.

The SNA strategy aims to create awareness and disseminate information about the health seeking behaviour, and about the benefits available under various schemes/ programmes of the Ministry. Towards this end, different modes of communication have been leveraged to reach out to rural and urban masses. 11.2 STRATEGIC INFORMATION EDUCATION COMMUNICATION (IEC) PLAN The Ministry has designed a strategic framework for targeted IEC activities using a 360 degrees communication approach. All possible means of media including mass media, mid-media, inter-personal activities and social media are used to disseminate information about various health schemes. The year-long IEC/Communication Plan has been conceptualised to focus on health- days and health-themes. While some activities were taken up to coincide with specific dates observed as 'Health Days' , others were week and month-long plans for focused multi-media campaigns on schemes of the Ministry. These activities centered around topics such as Ayushman Bharat, Immunization, TB Fortnight (IDCF), Breastfeeding Week, Tobacco Control, etc. Targeted campaigns were carried out for seasonal ailments such as Dengue, H1N1 etc. Realising the potential of Social Media for real time and free of cost amplification of messages, the SNA Division has actively engaged on various social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Y ouTube, Instagram) which were specially leveraged for spreading awareness on all aspects of COVID-19 for the benefit of the people. 11.3 PRINT The SNA Division has been regularly publishing advertisements on health issues, in all the leading newspapers of India, including regional languages. The aim of such advertisements is not only to encourage people to adopt healthy behaviours but also to raise awareness and disseminate information regarding availability and access to quality health care provided by the Government. In the year 2020-21, post the outbreak of COVID-19, several print advertisements were released to inform people about the Do's and Don'ts, testing, home quarantine and other COVID-29 Appropriate Behaviours. Meanwhile, another campaign that was launched with success was on the Polio Sub-National Immunization Day (Polio SNID). 11.4 TELEVISION The SNA Division has leveraged this medium extensively to generate public discourse on health-related themes and to spread positive health messages. During 2020-21, several messages pertaining to various aspects of the pandemic were telecast on Doordarshan News. Several panel discussions and live phone-in programmes 444 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 11 were also telecast on DD News and Lok Sabha TV .

The Ministry co-coordinated the production and telecast of a one-hour programme \"Healthy India\" through the Lok Sabha Channel once a week. Like-wise a one-hour live special programme on COVID-19, \" Arogya Bharat\" is being telecast on DD News every Saturday. The Ministry also participated in Sankalp-II on DD National. The Union Health Minister and senior officers of the Ministry along with doctors / health experts from Government hospitals participated in these programmes.

These included Tobacco Control, Dengue, Malaria and Chikungunya, Family Planning and Polio SNID. The Bureau of Outreach and Communication (BOC), Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MoIB) along with the BOC, supported MoHFW in making media plans for telecast/broadcast of the spots through satellite channels / Private FM and Community Radio Stations as well as for print advertisements. 11.6 SOCIAL MEDIA Social Media is being leveraged by the Ministry for coverage of events as well as dissemination of health messages. MoHFW uses four popular social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Y ouTube and Instagram. Videos related to health are being uploaded regularly on Y ouTube with their links tweeted through its twitter handle as well as shared on Facebook for even wider reach. The Y ouTube channel of the Ministry has a wide array of videos including short films, video updates and speeches of the Hon'ble Prime Minister and Hon'ble Health Minister. It has more than 50 crore views. The Y ouTube platform is also leveraged for live relay of important events. During the pandemic, it was widely used to disseminate information in the form of short videos. Public engagement on the Ministry's Social Media platforms has been extremely positive. The Facebook page that was started in July, 2018 gained more than five million followers. Similarly, the likes received on the Ministry's Facebook page were around two lakhs at the beginning of the FY and doubled to more than five million at the end of November, 2020. With respect to Twitter, the followership increased from 13 lakhs in April, 2020 to around 21 lakhs in November, 2020. The Instagram account of the Ministry was created in March, 2020 and acquired a followership exceeding three lakhs in November, 2020. The Y ouTube subscribers that were around 1.5 lakh at the beginning of the FY have now crossed 3 lakhs. 11.6.1 Dissemination of Information on COVID-19 The Government intended to strike quick and far with factual information based on impactful messaging to sensitise the public towards COVID-19. This translated into a roll-out of a pre-caller tune that provided information on COVID-19 across all States and UTs, with support of five national telecom companies, namely BSNL/MTNL/Idea-Vodafone/ Airtel/ Reliance). The pre caller tune amplified the Do's and Don'ts pertaining to COVID-19 across 117.2 crore mobile telephone connections and disseminated key messages via SMS. Simultaneously several TV spots and radio spots as mentioned earlier were broadcast across key National and Regional networks and channels.445 ANNUAL REPORT 2020-2021CHAPTER - 11 Hon'ble Union Minister for HFW personally monitoring and providing guidance on Swastha Nagrik Abhiyaan activities.
