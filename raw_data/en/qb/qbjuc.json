In recent years the Chinese medicinal mushroom Ganoderma lucidum , also called ling zhi or reishi, has been marketed in Western countries with claims to improve cardiovascular risk factors. These factors include elevated blood glucose, elevated blood pressure and abnormal lipid profiles. Research about the effects of Ganoderma lucidum in humans is limited. The s tudies that exist m ight have methods or reporting that introduce potential for bias. Therefore, the effectiveness of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of cardiovascular risk factors has not been clearly established. Aim The aim of this research was to evaluate the efficacy a nd safety of Ganoderma lucidum for the treatment of pharmacologically modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. Method Two studies were conducted in this research. The first study was a randomised controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safe ty of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of hyperglycaemia and other cardiovascular risk components of the metabolic syndrome. Eighty -four participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome from Sydney, Australia were randomised to one of three intervention groups : Ganoderma lucidum , Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps dosage was 3 grams Ganoderma lucidum per day for 16 weeks. The study utilised a clinical trial design with randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding of participants, therapists and assessors. The primary xiii outcome measure was blood glucose and the other components of the metabolic syndrome were the secondary outcomes for this study. The second study was a systematic review to evaluate effects of Ganode rma lucidum on cardiovascular risk factors. Included trials required participants to have received treatment for at least one cardiovascular risk factor. Twenty -two English and Chinese language databases were searched for randomised and controlled clinical trials. Specified journals and reference lists were hand -searched and experts in the field were contacted to locate additional sources. The primary outcome measures were blood glucose, blood pressure and lipid profile. Two authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and cross -checked the data extraction and analysis results. Results Seventy -three participants completed the clinical trial. No effects attributable to Cordyceps sinensis were detected, and therefore the data for the two acti ve intervention groups were combined for all further analyses. Ganoderma lucidum did not reduce glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) or fasting plasma glucose during the 16-week treatment period. The treatment effect for HbA1c was 0.13 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval [ CI] of -0.35-0.6) ( p=0.6), and for fasting plasma glucose 0.03mmol/L (95 per cent CI of -0.9-0.96) ( p=0.95), both in favour of the control group. Clinical trial secondary outcomes were blood pressure, triglycerides, high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C), metabolic syndrome diagnostic status and health -related quality of life. For each of these, no statistically or clinically significant differences between Ganoderma lucidum groups were detected . There was no overall increa sed risk of adverse events for persons taking Ganoderma lucidum (161 per cent v. 160 per cent ; RR 1.01, 95 per cent CI not estimable). However, Ganoderma lucidum was associated with increased risk of a subset of mild events of headache, fatigue, and gastro intestinal effects (57 per cent v. 33 per cent ; RR 0.37, 95 per cent CI 0.15 -0.94). The systematic review identified four trials eligible for inclusion, with 375 participants. One of these was our unpublished randomised controlled trial, which xiv was awarded a low risk of bias. The other three studies had an unclear risk of bias. Due to incomplete reporting, only one outcome from one study was suitable for meta -analysis with our clinical trial results. Results from the pooled data of 134 persons found Ganoder ma lucidum was not associated with a clinical or statistical reduction in HbA1c (WMD: -0.10 [95 per cent CI -1.05-0.85]). Conclusion Evidence from this randomised clinical trial and systematic review does not support the use of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of cardiovascular risk factors in people with diabetes mellitus. 1 Chapte r 1: Introduction 1.1 Background to the R esearch The number one cause of death in the world is cardiovascular disease (World Health Organi zation , 2011 a). This term most commonly refers to the chronic diseases caused by atherosclerosis, and most notably includes coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. These conditions result in significant burden on morbidity, quality of life , economic status and mortality for both individuals and populations. The r isk factors for cardiovascular disease are numerous and varied. The most important pharmacologica lly modifiable risk factors are high blood glucose, high blood pressure, an abnormal lipid profile and obesity (Australian Institute of H ealth and Welfare, 2009; Graham et al., 2007; Heart Foundation & National Stroke Foundation, 2008; International Cardio vascular Health Alliance, 2011; World Health Organization, 2011 a). In 1988, Reaven (Reaven, 1988) suggested these factors were not imparting risk independently of each other. Research has since established that hyperglycaemia, hypertension, high triglycer ides, low HDL -C and obesity have a complex metabolic relationship with insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and with each other (Alberti, Zimment & Shaw, 2005) . This disorder was named the meta bolic syndrome. Recognising this multi factorial nature of risk has had significant implications for the effective management of cardiovascular disease in individuals and populations. Modifiable risk factors, including those of metabolic syndrome, can be effectively treated with lifestyle modi fications (Australian Institute of H ealth and Welfare, 2009; Graham et al., 2007; Heart Foundation & National Stroke Foundation, 200 8; World Health Organization & US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007) . Unfortunately, it is rare for these eff ects to be successfully sustained in the long term and as such, pharmaceutical interventions are required for the majority of individuals. There is no single medication for treatment of metabolic syndrome, or 2 for other multi factorial components that increa se absolute cardiovascular risk. Treatment targets and strategies might be modified by the multi factorial risk context, but treatments are still prescribed for individual components. Medications that treat cardiovascular risk factors might be associated wi th contra indications, adverse events, increased risk for co -existing factors, insufficient efficacy and polypharmacy concerns. Considerable interest was generated when preliminary evidence proposed Ganoderma lucidum , a traditional Chinese medicinal mushro om, might improve multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Ganoderma lucidum , also called ling zhi or reishi, is not a new health intervention. In China, it has been used to promote health, prolong life and prevent and cure systemic diseases for 2 ,000 years. This special mushroom is still called the 'king of herbs ' and was honoured with first ranking in the oldest herbal directory Shen Nong 's Herbal Classic (Wachtel -Galor, Szeto, Tomlinson & Benzie, 2004) . In contrast, the focus on Ganoderma lucidum in Wester n countries is quite recent. Research has been conducted to determine the potential of Ganoderma lucidum for a variety of health and medical applications. With regard to cardiovascular effects, animal and in vitro studies demonstrated Ganoderma lucidum could reduce blood pressure, blood glucose, triglycerides and improve cholesterol profiles (Berger et al., 2004; Kanmatsuse et al., 1985; Zhang & Lin, 2003) . Although clinical trials to evaluate cardiovascular effects in humans have also produced positive results, the methods of research and reporting have unclea r, or high, potential for bias. Ganoderma lucidum is not only prescribed by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. Currently in Australia, it is well marketed and sold through the internet to increasingly interested Western consumers. A second fungus, Cordyceps sinensis , is claimed to increase the potency of Ganoderma lucidum and may be added to some formulations. Despite marketing claims, the effectiveness and safety of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of individual, or multiple, major pharmacologically modifiable risk factors of cardiovascular d isease has not been determined. 3 1.2 Aims and Research Questions This doctoral research aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ganoderma lucidum for the treatment of pharmacologically modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. Two research studies were conducted; a randomised controlled trial and a systematic review. Both studies were developed, con ducted and researched within a Western medicine cont ext. That is, the intervention, diagnostic criteria, outcome measures and clinical interpretation were designed to provide cli nically meaningful results for W estern medicine practitioners in an Australian health context. This differs from research performe d according to traditional Chinese medicine theory. Although both studies aimed to evaluate effects on a range of cardiovascular risk factors, we decided that participants for the clinical trial should also have metabolic syndrome. This provided opportun ity us to examine effects in persons with this particular grouping of cardiovascular risk factors , in addition to individual risk factors. For the systematic review, trials were included if participants were treated for any one of the specified cardiovascu lar risk factors. 1.2.1 Randomised Controlled Trial The aim of the randomised controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ganoderma lucidum , with or without Cordyceps sinensis, for treatment of hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular risk factors, in persons with metabolic syndrome. This included the determining size, direction, and uncertainty of effect for each risk factor. As metabolic syndrome has five equally important components and no validated summary value, one component was selected for the primary research question. Treatment of hyperglycaemia was chosen for the primary focus, because this component had the most compelling evidence base for benefit from Ganoderma lucidum . 1.2.1.1 Primary Question 4 In lucidum (and Ganoderma lucidum reducing blood glucose levels? 5 1.2.1.2 Secondary Questions a) In persons with metabolic syndrome, is ma lucidum (and Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis ) effective for improving the other four diagnostic criteria of metabolic syndrome?

This included determining the size, direction, and uncertai nty of effect for risk factors and adverse events, and the consistency of these effects between studies. There was no requirement for particip ants to have metabolic syndrome; however , studies must have evaluated at least one primary outcome measure for inc lusion in the systematic review. 1.2.2.1 Primary Question Is Ganoderma lucidum effective for? Reducing blood glucose Reducing blood pressure Improving lipid profile 1.2.2.2 Secondary Questions Is Ganoderma lucidum effective for ? Reducing obesity measures Reducing inflammatory markers Reducing insulin levels Reducing fibrinogen Reducing homocysteine Improving health -related quality of life 1.2.2.3 Safety Question Does treatment with Ganoderma lucidum for cardio vascular risk factors result in? 7 Increase in a dverse event symptoms and signs Evidence of liver dysfunction Evidence of renal dysfunction 1.3 Structure of the Thesis The research presented in this thesis will be introduced by a literature review of four sections (Chapter 2). The research questions were designed to evaluate Ganoderma lucidum for multiple cardiovascular risk fa ctors as individual components or within the context of the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, particular focus has be en placed on hyperglycaemia as the primary condition of interest for the clinical trial. The literature review aims to represent these multiple conditions and different contexts by sections on cardiova scular risk factors (Section 2.2 ), metabolic syndrome (Section 2.3), and components of metabolic syndrome (Section 2.4 ). The fourth section of the literature review introduces and evaluates evidence regarding the intervention, Ganoderma lu cidum (Section 2.5 ). As the systematic review will include critical appraisals of studies evaluating Ganoderma lucidum for cardiovascular disease, this topic is dis cussed in the literature review with brevity. Chapter 3 presents aims, methods, results and discussion for the randomised controlled trial that evaluated effects of Ganoderma lucidum on persons with cardiovascular risk factors, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Similarly, Chapter 4 will outline the aims, methods, results and a brief discussion of the systematic review that evaluated effects of Ganoderma lucidum on persons with cardiovascular risk factors. The systematic review was conducted through the Cochrane Collaboration. There are writing, style and section specifications for Cochrane systema tic reviews and I have chosen to retain these characteristics in this thesis, though they may differ sligh tly from the preceding chapter. From these research findings, the discussion of Chapter 5 will synthes ise and summarise the evidence for the thesis topic. The evidence summary will consider strength and consistency of these new findings, within the context of t he existing body of knowledge , and the limitations of the research, clinical implications and 8 future directions for research will be presented. Chapter 6 will provide the concluding summary for this doctoral research. 9 Chapter 2 : Literature Review 2.1 Introduction This chapter reviews the literature most relevant to this thesis. Firstly, Section 2.2 introduces cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. These are further explored in Section 2.3 , where cardiovascular risk is considered in the context of the metabolic syndrome. The r isk components of the metabolic syndrome are individually described i n Section 2.4, with a particular focus on hyperglycaemia. The intervention of this research, Ganoderma lucidum , is discussed in Section 2.5. Because clinical studies about Ganoderma lucidum are fully appraised for the systematic review in Chapter 4, these are reviewed only briefly in the literature review. 2.2 Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease 2.2.1 Cardiovascular Disease 2.2.1.1 Definition and Pathogenesis of Cardiovascular Disease Cardiovascular disease is a group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels, and is the number one cause of death in the world (World Health Organization, 2011 a). Although a range of pathologies may affect circulatory vessels, the term cardiovascular disease is most commonly used in the literature to represent th e chronic diseases resulting from atherosclerosis. These notably include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial disease. This definition of cardiovascular disease, as used in this thesis, will not include the less common congenital, infectious and venous conditions that have separate aetiologies and presentations. Atherosclerosis is a chronic progressive disorder of the arterial wall that causes cardiovascular disease. The disease involves lipids, cholesterol, calcium and o ther cellular debris accumulating in the intimal layer of the arterial vessel s (Tousoulis et al., 2011 ). Inflammation and impaired cellular activity are also central to the 10 development of arterial plaques, which result in malfunctioning and narrowing of arterial vessels throughout the body (Haslett, Chilvers, Boon, Colledge & Hunter, 2002; Pearson et al., 2003) . Cardiovascular disease may be considered a continuum from the presence of one or multiple risk factors causing progressively worsening atherosclerosis that eventually leads to organ damage or failure (Dahlof, 2010) . The target organs most affected by ath erosclerosis are the heart, brain and limbs. Coronary heart disease causes myocardial ischaemia, angina and heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease leads to transient ischaemic events and stroke. Intermittent claudication and gangrene are the consequenc es of atherosclerosis in the lower limbs. 2.2.1.2 Burden of C ardiovascular Disease Cardiovascular disease accounts for 29 per cent of global deaths (World Health Organization, 2011 a). The economic burden of the disease is approximately 3 per cent of worldwide gross domestic product (International Cardiovascular Health Alliance, 2011) . Using 2007 data, t he World Health Organi zation (WHO) estimated that of the 17.1 million people who died from cardiovascular disease, 7.2 million deaths were from c oronary hea rt disease and 5.7 million were due to stroke (World Health Organization, 2007) . Those data also showed similar disease prevalence for men and women. In the latter half of the 1970s , the rates of age-adjusted cardiovascular disease improved across most industrialised countries ; however , this trend has plateaued since the 1990s (Ford & Capewell, 2007) . It has been reported that in the United States (US) increased rates of hypertension (especially in women), diabetes and obesit y are negating improvem ents in smoking , physical activity and cholesterol levels (Capewell et al., 2010) . It is a myth that non communicable cardiovascular disease only affects rich societies. Four out of five deaths from cardiovascular di sease occur in middle -to-low income coun tries (International Cardiovascular Health Alliance, 2011) . Although the media may focus on communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV -AIDS and malari a, these diseases result in fewer combined deaths than from cardiovascular disease (Anderson & Chu, 2007) . In particular this trend may be due to the growing prevalence of diabetes and obesity in economically developing world regions 11 (Hossain, Kawar & El Nahas, 2007) . Other worldwide social determinants thought to increase the prevalence of cardiovascula r disease include g lobalisation, urbanisation , ageing and stress (World Health Organization, 2011 a). Cardiovascular disease, as a chronic disease, does not always kill. It has been estimated that 128 million persons are affected, which is approximately ei ght times the disease mortality rate (Ezzati et al., 2005) . This is likely to be an underestimation. In the US there has been a significant decline in the mortality rate, but for the most part this is not due to prevention of disease, but rather survival f rom serious cardiovascular events (Thom et al., 2006) . For individuals, families, communities and countries there are significant negative health, social, emotional and economic consequences of cardiovascular disease. The International Cardiovascular Healt h Alliance (2011) has estimated that by 2025 cardiovascular disease will be the greatest cause of disability, measured as disability -adjusted life -years, in the world. Health -related quality of life has been evaluated with the Medical Outcomes Study 36 Ite m Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) in eight countries across Europe, Japan and the US (Alonso et al., 2004) . This research confirmed that persons with ischaemic and congestive heart disease, hypertension and diabetes had poorer health - related quality of li fe than those without cardiovascular risk factors or disease (Alonso et al., 2004) . In Australia, cardiovascular disease is also the leading cause of death. In 1996 the disease was designated as a National Health Priority Area by the Australian Government (Heart Foundation & National Stroke Foundation, 2008) . Using national 2004 -2005 survey data, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported that approximately 3.7 million Australians have cardiovascular disease, at a cost of 11.2 per cent of the health budget or 1.7 per cent of gross domestic product (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2008) . Of these, 92 per cent had coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension or peripheral vascular disease. The Institute also reported that cardiovascul ar disease is responsible for 34 per cent of deaths and disables a further 1.4 million Australians product (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2008) . Similar to other industrialised countries, Australia has experienced a decline in disease rates since the 1960s, but now the rate of this decline appears to be 12 slowing. Improvements in cardiovascular health have largely been due to advances in medicine and reduced smoking and hypertension rates; however , increases in obesity, physical inactivity and diabetes are set to reverse this trend (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009) . Of further concern are health inequalities between Australian population groups , with indigenous and disadvantaged groups experiencing death rates up to 70 -80 per cent higher than other Australians (Heart Foundation & National Stroke Foundation, 2008) . 2.2.2 T ypes of Risk Factors for Cardiovascular D isease 2.2.2.1 Categorisation of Risk Factors Cardiovascular risk is usual ly measured by clinical diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, morbidity events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, and mortality rates. A risk factor may be defined as anything that increases a person 's chance of developing a disease. A risk factor sh ould have clear clinical endpoints, defined variability and population norms, standardised measurements, and be able to improve disease prediction above that possible by existing risk factors (Folsom et al., 2006; Pearson et al., 2003; Rasnake, Trumbo & He inonen, 2008) . Categorisation of a factor is according to the level of cardiovascular risk and whether that risk is modifiable. Cardiovascular risk factors may be due to genetic, environmental or lifestyle influences. Table 2.1 presents the major modifiabl e risk factors, oth er modifiable risk factors, non modifiable risk f actors and novel risk factors as categorised by the WHO (2007) . Biomarkers of risk factors may also be used as surrogate endpoints in cardiovascular research, when they have been establishe d as valid predictors of disease (Rasnake et al., 2008) or when longitudinal evaluation through to disease expression is not feasible. 13 Table 2.1 : WHO classification of cardiovascular risk factors Major modifiable risk factors Other modifiable risk factors Nonmodifiable risk factors 'Novel ' risk factors High blood pressure Low socio economic status Advancing age Excess homocysteine in the blood Abnormal blood lipids Mental ill health Heredity or family history Inflammation Diabetes mellitus Psychosocial stress Gender Abnormal blood coagulation Obesity Alcohol use Ethnicity or race Tobacco use Use of certain medication Physical inactivity Lipoprotein (a) Unhealthy diet Left ventricular hypertrophy Note : Cardiovascular risk factors .

Reprinted with permission. 2.2.2.2 Major Modifiable Risk Factors Major risk fact ors are those that have a significant independent impact on the two main presentations of cardiovascular d isease: coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease (stroke). The term 'modifiable ' conveys that the risk factor can be prevented, controlled o r treated. As such, modifiable risk factors have significant importance for individual and population health strategies for improving cardiovascular health. There is consensus that the greatest risk for cardiovascular disease comes from having high blood p ressure, an abnormal lipid profile, diabetes mellitus, obesity, an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity or being a tobacco smoker (Australian Institute of H ealth and Welfare, 2009; Graham et al., 2007; Heart 14 Foundation & National Stroke Foundation, 2008; International Cardiovascular Health Alliance, 2011; World Health Organization, 2011 a). This group of risk factors are thought to be responsible for approximately 90 per cent of myocardial infarctions (Yusuf et al., 2004) . In Australia, tobacco smoking is also recognised as the single most pr eventative cause of general ill health and death (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009) . Significant overlap exists between risk factors, influencing and compounding each other towards organ disease. T he WHO (2009) estimates that 80 per cent of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are due to the behavioural risk factors of poor diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use. However these risk determinants have underlying influences that have led to their presence and, in turn, they also create further risk factors. As one example, the underlying determinant of poor education increases the risk of obesity, which in turn increases blood pressure , which increases the likelihood of stroke. Further detai l on individual major modifiable risk factors is presented in Section 2.4 . 2.2.2.3 Other Modifiable Risk Factors The other modifiable risk factors that have greatest impact on ca rdiovascular outcomes are socio economic status, mental health and alcohol us e. Lower socio economic countries and groups are disproportionally affected by cardiovascular disease. Eighty -two percent of deaths from cardiovascular disease occur in low - and middle -income countries (World Health Organization, 2011 a). Although excess ca loric intake and decreased activity drive increased risk in affluent societies, the key risk factors for poorer countries are lack of education, poor access to services, competing health priorities and involvement of infection (World Health Organization, 2 009). There is also thought to be a relationship between malnutrition and obesity. Research suggests that underweight children are actually at greater risk of adult obesity and cardiovascular disease (Hossain et al., 2007) . The greatest increases in cardiovascular disease prevalence and expenditure are predicted for the lower socio economic regions of India, Southeast Asia and the Western P acific region 15 (Hossain et al., 2007; World Health Organization, 2009) . In Australia, t he rates of cardiovascular mortality are at least 70 per cent higher in disadvantaged communities compared to less disadvantaged groups (Haslam & James, 2005) . Mental health disorders that are known to increase cardiovascular disease include depression, anxiety, life stress and social isolation effects (Graham et al., 2007; World Health Organization, 2004) . These psychosocial risk factors have a complex indirect relationship with physiological risk factors. In Australia, mental illness is estimated to be responsible for 13 per cent of the overall disease burden (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009) , but its true effects on physical health are difficult to define. However, depression has been shown to increase the risk of coronary heart disease , independent of any intermediary behavioural effects that might be associated with mental illness (Bunker et al., 2003) . A causal relationship has not yet been established (World Health Organization & US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007) . However, depression is considered a barrier to adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviours, thereby increasing the risk conferred by other factors (Hayes, 2006) . While depression increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, conversely, cardiovascular disease also increases the risk of depression (Clarke & Currie, 2009) . Stroke is also the leading cause of vascular dementia in Australia (Heart Foundation & National Stroke Foundation, 2008) , presenting significant health challenges for individuals with confound ing mental and physical risk factors. Long term excessive alcohol consumption also contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease. Results of a recent systematic review of prospective cohort studies found that light to moderate alcohol consumpti on might be protective against cardiovascular damage (Ronksley, Brien, Turner, Mukamal & Ghali, 2011) . This does not undermine evidence that long term excessive alcohol consumption confers significant cardiovascular risk (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009; Heart Foundation & National Stroke Foundation, 2008; World Health Organization & US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007) . Alcohol increases blood pressure and triglyceride levels, increases caloric intake and may complicate eff ects 16 of high blood cholesterol and glucose (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009) . 2.2.2.4 Non modifiable Risk Factors Risk factors such as age, sex, ethnicity and family history are beyond an individual 's control . Age is the strongest independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and especially stroke, for which risk doubles every 10 years once 55 years old (Graham et al., 2007) . However, the declines in Australian mortality rates from coronary heart disease and stroke have been gre atest in the older age group of 55 -75 years (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009) . Differences in mortality and morbidity rates between men and women depend upon age, ethnicity and cardiovascular outcome measured. Overa ll, there is a similar global cardiovascular burden for both men and women (Graham et al., 2007; World Health Organization, 2011 a). Women at an older age are at greatest risk and there are concerns that women have been under -represented in clinical and res earch settings (Stramba - Badiale & Priori, 2005) . Genetic effects may be due to family history of cardiovascular disease or the ethnic group to which an individual is born. The WHO (2007) states that the risk of stroke is increased for Blacks, Hispanic Ame ricans, Chinese and Japanese populations and cardiovascular death rates are higher for South Asians and American Black populations. Ethnicity is involved with complex socio economic and environmental risk factors. It is well accepted that cardiovascular ris k changes with ethnic migration, such that an individual 's risk approaches that expected in their destination community (World Health Organization & US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007) . There is also increased risk if a first degree blood relative developed cardiovascular disease before age 55 years (males) and 65 years (females) (Myers, Kiely, Cupples & Kannel, 1990; World Health Organization & US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007) . The more family members with cardiovascula r disease and the younger they developed the disease, the greater an individual 's overall risk (Graham et al., 2007) . 17 2.2.2.5 'Novel ' Risk F actors Over 300 risk factors have been identified as contributors to cardiovascular disease (World Health Organization & US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007) . 'Novel ' or 'emerging ' risk factors are those that are currently being researched to determine the extent and nature of their role for cardiovascular risk. They are also used less consistently for assessing cardiovascular risk in the clinical setting. A novel risk factor that is present or elevated due to disease, but has not contributed to the disease, is usually classified as a risk marker. In the literature , the terms risk marker and risk mediator a re often used interchangeably. An interesting and diverse range of potential risk factors, ranging from sleep quantity to radiation, are being researched for their potential contribution to the development of cardiovascular disea se. However, the emerging factors most rep orted in the literature are pro inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, markers o f acute phase inflammation, pro thrombotic and blood coagulation factors, homocysteine, lipoprotein (a), small dense low-density lipoprotein, and presence of coronary artery calcification (Graham et al., 2007; Grundy et al., 2004; Hoffmann, Tucker & Parker, 2009; Pearson et al., 2003; World Health Organization & US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007) . The markers of acti vated inflammation and haemostasis are thought to be particularly associated with myocardial infarction events (Graham et al., 2007) . Novel risk factors might also affect the status of major modifiable risk factors. The Third Report of the National Cholest erol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP -ATP III; Grundy et al., 2004) recommends abnormal lipid profiles should be more aggressively managed when novel risk factors are also present (Grundy et al., 2004) . The relationship between inflammation a nd atherosclerosis is well established. The inflammatory marker C -reactive protein may have the strongest correlation with cardiovascular events after adjusting for other independent risk factors (Folsom et al., 2006; Hoffmann et al., 2009; Pai et al., 2004; Pearson et al., 2003) . However, evidence does not support routine clinical assessment because C -reactive protein does not contribute significantly to disease prediction (Folsom et al., 2006; Pearson 18 et al., 2003; Rasnake et al., 2008) . It is also con founded by reverse causality, influenced by separate systemic inflammatory processes and varies greatly by gender and ethnic groups (Albe rt & Ridker, 2006; Cook, Buring & Ridker, 2006) . Assessment of C -reactive protein might be most useful for prediction o f recurrent events in persons already diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (Pearson et al., 2003) . 2.2.2.6 Evaluation of Absolute Risk Cardiovascular risk factors cluster in individuals . Seventy percent of those at risk have more than one risk factor (Dahlof, 2010) . Modest elevations across multiple factors are more common, though less noticeable, than a dramatic elevation in just one factor (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009; National Vascular Disease Prevention Alliance, 2009; World Heal th Organization & US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007) . Diagnosis of metabolic syndrome recognises the clustering of obesity, impaired glucose and dyslipidaemia risk factors. Further information about metabolic syndrome is presented in Sect ion 2.3. By evaluating absolute cardiovascular risk, an individual 's comprehensive risk factor profile may be converted into a risk score. An assessment of absolute risk is regarded as more accurate and effective than assessment of individual risk factors for the prediction of cardiovascular disease outcomes (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009; National Vascular Disease Prevention Alliance, 2009; World Health Organization & US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007) . Absolute risk reflects t he complex synergistic relationship between the aetiology and development of factors . Psychosocial risk factors, which also cluster in individuals (Graham et al., 2007) , are included in the risk profile. D ata from the 2003 Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillan ce System found a linear relationship between the number of risk factors and self -reported health -related quality of life (Li et al., 2008) . Absolute cardiovascular risk tools have been developed for use by primary care health professionals in t he clinical setting. These paper or electronic tools are usually based on the Framingham Risk Equation (Anderson, Odell, Wilson & Kannel, 1991) . 19 A systematic review by the National Vascular Disease Prevention Alliance (NVDPA; National Vascular Disease Prevention Alliance, 2009) found that the Framingham Risk Equation had higher or equivalent predictive ability than other tools compared in eight included studies. The Framingham tool is the basis of the Australian Guidelines for the Assessment of Absolute Cardiovascular Disease Risk for use in Australian populations. Risk factors included in this tool are similar to those recognised by the WHO (see Table 2.1, World Health Organization & US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007) , but also include urine microalbumin and protein, and evidence of atrial fibrillation. Left ventricular hypertrophy, concomitant medication use and lipoprotein (a) are modifiable risk factors not included in the assessment tool. Risk scores have different accuracy in diffe rent populations (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009; National Vascular Disease Prevention Alliance, 2009; World Health Organization & US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007) . It should be noted that high level evidence is not cu rrently available for Australian subpopulations and therefore further guideline estimations are required for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups. 2.2.3 Risk F actor Modification 2.2.3.1 Risk Factor Modification for Individuals Cardiovascular disease is largely preventable (National Vascular Disease Prevention Alliance, 2009) . Atherosclerosis develops over long time periods and is quite advanced by the time symptoms and complications occur (Graham et al., 2007) . As such, cardiova scular prevention guidelines usually involve individual and population -based strategies at three levels; to prevent atherosclerosis, prevent atherosclerosis developing into cardiovascular disease, and prevent cardiovascular disease causing acute life -threa tening events. The terms primary and secondary prevention are now less commonly used because they do not reflect the continuum of risk and disease (Graham et al., 2007) . Risk factor modification has been shown to significantly decrease morbidity and morta lity rates and is central to prevention of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular events (Australian Institute of H ealth and Welfare, 2009; Graham 20 et al., 2007; Heart Foundation & National Stroke Foundation, 2008; World Health Organization, 2007) . The WHO states 'no level of risk can be considered safe ' (World Health Organization, 2007, p. 7) . Individual -based strategies aim for positive change in biomedical risk factors and risk behaviours for a person. The traditional approach was for such management to be contained within the doctor -patient domain. Today, broader strategies including multi disciplinary and psychosocial approaches are also recommended to affect change across multiple risk factors in an individual (Australian Ins titute of H ealth and Welfare, 2009; Graham et al., 2007) . Risk factor modification in an individual may begin with health assessments, lifestyle advice and education, and lead to referral to allied or specialised health professionals, medic ation or surgica l intervention. The type, extent and number of risk factor modifications depend upon individual risk factor severity and absolute determination of risk. Primary lifestyle changes include cessation of smoking, reducing alcohol intake to a moderate level, i ncreasing regular physical activity and making healthy food choices. Diet improvements focus on reducing total caloric intake, total fat and salt, eliminating trans -fatty acids and increasing vegetables, fruits, pulses and wholegrains. These lifestyle chan ges may improve cardiovascular health directly or indirectly by reducing obesity, blood pressure, cholesterol and blood glucose (Australian Institute of He alth and Welfare, 2009; Graham et al., 2007; Heart Foundation & National Stroke Foundation, 2008 ; World Health Organization & US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007) . Using predictive modelling, Capewell et al. (2010) concluded that the greatest reductions in cardiovascular mortality come from controlling tobacco use and improving diet. Profiling absolute risk provides more accurate prediction but is also thought to lead to improved cardiovascular health outcomes (National Vascular Disease Prevention Alliance, 2009). In a review of randomised controlled trials a nd meta -analyses, Jackson, Lawe s, Bennett, Milne & Rodgers (2005) found moderate improvement of several risk factors were more likely to be effective than major improvement in a single risk factor. An additional benefit to managing total risk is that when management of one risk factor, such as blood pressure, is resistant to treatment, total 21 cardiovascular risk can still be reduced by targeting other components more aggressively (Graham et al., 2007) . 2.2.3.2 Risk Factor and Disease Modification by Pharmacotherapy There is considerable overlap between pharmacotherapy for risk factor modification and pharmacotherapy for disease management. This is because both approaches are aimed at preventing cardiovascular events. There is no one drug which can effectively manage cardiovascular diseas e or its risk factors. The medications used to manage the most significant modifiable risk facto rs are presented in Section 2.4. Medications may improve individual or multiple risk factors, or ca rdiovascular physiology. Cardio protective drugs are used at all stages of illness, but are most prescribed for persons at higher risk of disease. The main p harmacotherapy options are anti platelet therapy, statins, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blocker s, beta blockers and thiazide - like diuretics. Hormone replacement, vitamins B, including folic acid, C and E supplements are not recommended for reduction of cardiovascular risk (World Health Organization, 2007) . The anti platelet medication aspirin is the least expensive drug for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (World Health Organization & US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007) and is therefore important for use in the developing world. Low dose aspirin should be used in indiv iduals at high risk of a cardiovascular event. However, as cardiovascular risk decreases, the risks of haemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding might outweigh the benefits. To date, the WHO (2007) recommends that individuals should not be given as pirin if they have less than 30 per cent chance of experiencing a cardiovascular event in the next decade. Similarly , the European Guidelines of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Clinical Practice (Graham et al., 2007) also recommend aspirin use only in persons with esta blished cardiovascular disease. This group also suggests aspirin is appropriate when event risk is markedl y increased despite well controlled blood pressure. The addition of clopidogrel to aspirin is generally not recommended 22 for stable a therosclerotic disease, but may be used when aspirin is contra indicated (Napoli & Cacciatore, 2009) . The A USHEART study (Heeley et al., 2010) evaluated cardiovascular disease management in Australian ge neral practice. A combined antiplatelet, antihyperten sive and statin therapy was used as the evidence -based reference management for persons with established cardiovascular disease and high risk of cardiovascular events. Heeley et al. (2010) reported substantial undertreatment of patients with this dis ease p resentation in Australia. Prevention of cardiovascular disease has become an increasing priority for international governments and health organisations (Heart Foundation & National Stroke Foundation, 2008 ; United Kingdom Department of Health , 2008; World Health Organization, 2007) . A singular focus on diagnosis and treatment of persons with cardiovascular disease is unlikely to yield improvements for communities. Individual and population -based strategies are required to concurrently tackle the challenge o f significantly reducing morbidity and mortality rates (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009; World Health Organization, 2007) . Strategies include implementation of laws, price and product regulation, consideration of the built environment, pub lic aw areness campaigns and community -based interventions (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009) . Population -based strategies acknowledge the role of social determinants of health, such as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and environment. In parti cular, the term 'health promotion ' refers to individuals and communities taking control of decision making to enable change in determinants of their own health (Keleher & Murphy, 2004) . 2.2.3.3 Risk Factor Modification for P opulations As with individual -based approaches, population strategies that aim to improve a single risk factor are considerably less effective than those that improv e multiple risk factors (The National Vascular Disease Prevention Alliance (Diabetes Australia, 2004) . Targeting those in the population at highest absolute cardiovascular risk is likely to achieve the greatest reduction in cardiovascular events (Australian Institute 23 of Health and Welfare, 2009; World Health Organization, 2007) . However , prevention frameworks are recommended to include both short term strategies aimed at high risk populations and longer term strategies aimed at lower risk groups (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009) . Internationally, the United Kingdom 's (UK) population -based and individual -based framework has been regarded as a significant success for cardiovascular outcomes. In that country, cardiovascular deaths have reduced by 40 per cent since 1993; an outcome reached 5 years ahead of predicted schedule (United Kingdom Department of Health, 2008) . A national plan to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in Australia has drawn on this model . Time for Action (Heart Foundation & National Stroke Foundation, 2008) plans to develop coordination of services, multidisciplinary and integrated mo dels of health care, evidence -based approach to all programs, primary prevention of modifiable lifestyle risk factors, and early detection for each risk factor. Although the effectiveness of mental health interventions for reducing cardiovascular events has not been established, the relationship between depression and chronic illness has been included in Australian population -based strategies (Australian Institute of Health an d Welfare, 2009) . 2.3 The Metabolic Syndrome 2.3.1 Definitions of the Metabolic Syndrome The metabolic syndrome is a group of cardiovascular risk factors that are inter - related, cluster in individuals, and synergistically increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Despite over 10,000 journal publications about the metabolic syndrome, the disorder is difficult to define. In 1923 Eskil Kylin of Sweden suggested that hyper tension, hyperglycaemia and hyperuricaemia often presented concurrently in individuals (Bonora, 2007; Byrne & Wild, 2005) . During the following decades , other risk factors were researched for their relationship , not only with cardiovascular disease , but al so each other. Most notably, a paper by Reaven in 1988 (Reaven, 1988) launched the modern era of metabolic syndrome research. Reaven suggested the term i nsulin resistance syndrome , or Syndrome X , for the complex metabolic 24 relationship between elevated bloo d sugar, high blood pressure, obesity, abnormal blood fats, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease . Different groups would d efine and redefine metabolic syndrome. The clustering associations that have been well researched and endorsed are hyperglyc aemia, hypertension, high triglycerides, low high -density lipoprotein cholesterol and obesity (Albert i et al. , 2005) . Other risk factors such as microalbuminuria, or those found in prothrombotic and proinflammatory states , are clearly (Obunai, Jani & Dangas, 2007; Sciarretta et al., 2007) but are not required for diagnosis . Some controversy surrounds the inclusion of insulin resistance, the type of obesity measure, cut -off thresholds and gen eralisability to different population groups. Insulin resistance is known to be metabolically central to the syndrome. However , it requires measurement by euglycaemic insulin clamp and its predictive contribution to cardiovascular events might not be worth y of inclusion (Cabre et al., 2008; Expert Panel on Detection Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, 2001) . Some definitions have replaced this criterion with obesity because it is easily measured, has a good correlation with insulin resistance and is a good predict or of cardiovascular risk (Cabre et al., 2008; Expert Panel on Detection Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, 2001) . However, anthropometric measures have more variation across population group norm s, which complicates selection of the most valid and predictive obesity measure (Alberti et al., 2009) . Differences originate from each group 's different purpose for the metabolic syndrome definition. Cabre et al. (2008) found that each set of criteri a for the metabolic syndrome had strengths and weaknesses for prediction of different cardiovascular outcomes. The WHO provided their first definition in 1998 (Balkau & Charles, 1999) . They decided insulin resistance was the ce ntral metabolic disorder to which other risk factors were a ssociated. This differed from the NCEP -ATP III criteria, which did not include insulin resistance in the ir 2001 definition (Expert Panel on Detection Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, 2001) . Two systema tic reviews (Galassi, Reynolds & He, 2006; Gami et al., 2007) later confirmed that the WHO definition is more likely to predict cardiovascular 25 events and death than other definitions. The NCEP -ATP III definition is widely used in America whil e the WHO criteria are commonly applied in Europe (Pi-Sunyer, 2007) . This author 's research, which will be presented in following chapters, was planned in 2005. For our metabolic syndrome definition we chose the NCEP -ATP III criteria. This was because it was more r epresentative of feasible clinical practice , and was consistent with other Australian research that also used definitions including central obesity rather than insulin resistance (Cameron et al., 2008) . Confusion over definitions has complicated compariso n of research results, evaluation of criteria and uptake of metabolic syndrome screening in the clinical setting (Assmann, Schulte & Seedorf, 2008; Brietzke, 2007; Byrne & Wild, 2005) . Since 2005 key stakeholder groups have aimed for a worldwide consensus definition. In 2009, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) , American Heart Association, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, World Heart Federation, International Atherosclerosis Society and International Association for the Study of Obesity harmonised their definitions to the same criteria adapted from the NECP -ATP III definition (Alberti et al., 2009) . This is with exception to waist circumference for the measurement of obesity. The scientific panel recommended each groups ' existing circumferen ce cut -off thresholds continue to be used whil e further discussion and research is considered . Table 2.2 provides this consensus update definition , along with the WHO and NCEP -ATP III definitions. Currently , the WHO (2012 c) and the European Group for the S tudy of Insulin Resistance (Balkau & Charles, 1999) still have criteria that include insulin resistance. Outside of Europe, consensus definition negotiations will continue to focus on ethnic and geographic threshold modifications (Alberti et al., 2009) . 26 Table 2.2 : Definitions of the metabolic syndrome Definition WHO (World Health Organiz ation, 1999) NCEP -ATP III (NCEP Expert Panel on Detection, 2001) Consensus Update to NCEP -ATP III (Alberti et al., 2009) Criteria Diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance AND two other factors Three or more of the following factors : Three of more of the following factors : Dysglycaemia (mmol/L) Fasting glucose 6.1 and/or 2 hours postchallenge glucose 7.8 or diabetes Fasting glucose 6.1 Fasting glucose 5.6 or treated for elevated glucose Blood pressure (mm Hg) 140/90 >135/85 or treated for hypertension >130/85 or treated for hypertension Dyslipidaemia (mmol/L) Triglycerides 1.7 HDL -C <0.9 (men) <1.0 (women) Triglycerides 1.7 HDL -C <1.0 (men) <1.3 (women) Triglycerides 1.7 or treated for elevated triglycerides HDL -C <1.0 (men) <1.3 (women) or treated for reduced HDL -C Central obesity WHR 0.9 (men) 0.85 (women) and/or BMI >30 kg/m2 Waist 102cm (men), 88cm (women) Population specific guidelines Insulin resistance Glucose uptake with hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp in lowest population quartile Not applicable Not Other factors Microalbuminuria (urinary rate >20 g/min Not applicable Not applicable Abbreviations: BMI is body mass index, WHR is waist hip ratio, HDL -C is high - density lipoprotein cholesterol . 27 2.3.2 Prevalence of the Metabolic Syndrome Prevalence rates are affected by the chosen definition and cut-off thresholds, potential for bias in research survey design, and confounding factors such as age, gender and co -morbidities. In 2004 , Byrne and Wild (Byrne & Wild, 2005) provided a cautious estimate that the global prevalence of metabolic syndrome wa s between 10 per cent and 23 per cent . This range was determined from the data from 48 studies and included estimates modelled from syndrome component prevalence rates. Most metabolic syndrome data was available for developed countries or urban areas of developing countries. There was significant regional variation but an overall higher prevalence for Aboriginals, Hispanics, South Asians and Black African -Caribbeans. Lower rates were found for countries of North Asia and Europe (Forouhi, 2005) . For Asian po pulations, however, when the waist circumference cut -off thresholds are lowered to population -appropriate values, rates become closer to those of America (Byrne & Wild, 2005) . Men usually had higher metabolic syndrome percentages. Exceptions to this were f ound in studies from countries with higher obesity rates for females than males (Byrne & Wild, 2005) . For children and adolescents, worldwide increases in obesity and diabetes have resulted in parallel increases in metabolic syndrome (Kassi, Pervanidou, Ka ltsas & Chrousos, 2011; Washington, 2008) . Some of the largest observation studies have been conducted for the US population. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) estimated 37 per cent of women and 30 per cent of men had metabolic syndrome , using the NCEP -ATP III criteria (Assmann et al., 2008) . The Framingham Study produced similar results and also found prevalence increased by 50 per cent (age- adjusted) over an 8 year follow -up period (Wilson, D 'Agostino, Parise, Su llivan & Meigs, 2005) . In this sample, the prevalence for men with metabolic syndrome increased from 21 per cent to 39 per cent , and women from 13 per cent to 31 per cent. There can be significant variation within a regional group based on ethnicity. For example, Mexican Americans in the US or South Asians in the UK are likely to have double the prevalence of their Caucasian neighbours (Forouhi, 2005) . It is thought that both genetic and environmental features cause these variations between 28 metabolic syndr ome rates. These minority groups also experience higher cardiovascular risk (Forouhi, 2005) . Australian prevalence rates have been determined from the AusDiab population - based survey of 11,247 participants (Barr et al., 2007) . Similar to other developed countries, it was estimated that approximately 29 per cent of the adult population has metabolic syndrome. This survey used the IDF 2007 (International Diabetes Federation, 2006) definition of metabolic syndrome, which is similar to NECP -ATP III but has obe sity as a compulsory, rather than optional, component. In the US, the percentage of persons over 50 years with metabolic syndrome increases to 44 per cent (Alexander, Landsman, Teutsch & Haffner, 2003) , which might be generalisable ag popula tions, such as Australia. 2.3.3 Pathophysiology of Metabolic Syndrome There is no acknowledged central mechanism for metabolic syndrome. However, the pathophysiological processes of the syndrome components are highly synergistic, and might involve revers e causality. These disorders are shown in Figure 2.1. Insulin resistance is well accepted as a common underlying feature for much of the syndrome 's 2004) . Insulin is a hormone that facilitates glucose absorption in the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue to produce energy. Insulin resistance occurs when there is decreased insulin secretion in the pancreas or impaired function at the target cell s. In response to the latter, extra insulin is produced by the pancreas, causing hyperinsulinaemia. Diabetes will develop once the pancreas is unable to maintain high levels of insulin secretion or insulin function is significantly impaired in the tissues. Insulin resistance, compensatory hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia cause further imbalance of metabolic functions that support the cardiovascular system. These include lipid, coagulation and fibrinolysis factors that regulate normal . 29 Figure 2.1 : Pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome Insulin resistance leads to lipolysis in adipose tissue , causing a flux of free fatty acids. These, in turn, increase insulin resistance and glucose production in the liver. The relationship between free fatty acids and glucose is strong enough that high concentrations of the former suggest that diabetes is als o present (Ayyobi & Brunzell, 2003; International Diabetes Federation, 2006) . Free fatty acids alter the lipid profile by increasing levels of atherogenic triglycerides, small dense low- density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. Levels of atheroprotective high - density lipoprotein cholesterol and Apolipoprotein A -1 are reduced Ventura, 2009; Obunai et al., Insulin Resistance Adiposity (Obesity) Dyslipidaemia Inflammation Thrombophilia Oxidant The pathogenesis of insulin resis tance and excess abdominal obesity overlap greatly. Abdominal visceral and hepatic fat cells act as a metabolically active organ, which produces free fatty acids as well as cytokines, and proinflammatory and prothrombotic factors (Brietzke, 2007) . Although all aspects of dyslipidaemia might increase insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk, triglyceride s and high -density lipoprotein cholesterol are considered to have the strongest associative relationship with metabolic syndrome (Alberti et al., 2009; Ass mann et al. 2007; International Diabetes Federation, 2006) . Other factors produced by adipose tissue include tumour necrosis factor - and interleukins IL -6 and IL -8 (Meshkani & Adeli, 2009) . Markers of inflammation have been increasingly implicated for in volvement with cardiovascular disease. Consistent with this, inflammatory markers have also been recognised as contributors to metabolic syndrome. C -reactive protein is elevated in persons with the syndrome (Ford, 2003; Lee et al., 2004; Meshkani & Adeli, 2009) and correlates with measures of insulin resistance (Ziegler, 2005) . Other proinflammatory and prothrombotic markers have been associated with metabolic syndrome, diabetes and obesity. These include plasminogen activator inhibitor -1, tumour necrosis f actor -, interleukins IL -6 and IL -8, the white cell count and fibrinogen (Ford, 2003; Graham et al., Adeli, 2009; Pischon et al., 2007) . The contribution of these factors to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis i s well documented, but their mechanism in metabolic syndrome is less clear. Inflammatory cytokines might impair insulin regulation of glucose, free fatty acid s and triglycerides in the liver (Kassi et al., 2011; Ziegler, 2005) . Some markers, including C -reactive protein, may cause imbalance and functional resistance to the hormones leptin, resistin and adiponectin (Eckel et al., ; & Adeli, 2009; Sciarr etta et al., 2007) . Despite strong evidence for presence of elevated infla mmatory markers in metabolic syndrome, evidence for syndrome causation or prediction of cardiovascular events has been mixed (Meshkani & Adeli, 2009; Pischon Temelkova -Kurktschiev et al., 2002) . As such, no inflammatory or thrombotic risk factor is included in current metabolic syndrome definitions. Other pathophysiological markers for metabolic syndrome are elevated urate, 31 microalbuminuria al., al., 2008; Redon et al., 2008) . Hypertension is included in definitions of metabolic syndrome but its relationship with insulin resistance is described less than for other components. Insulin resistance is thought to increase the activity of the sympathetic nervous system an d stimulate the renin -angiotensin -aldosterone system. The changes in renal sodium balance and vasoconstriction increase vascular pressure and endothelial dysfunction (Eckel et al., Kassi et al., 2011; Redon et al., 2008) . Recently, researchers have c onsidered the role of chronic stress and oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome. The hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal axis responds to stress by increasing cortisol levels, insulin resistance and blood pressure (Kassi et al., 2011; Ros mond, 2005) . Increased levels of reactive oxygen species are also thought to stimulate the angiotensin -aldosterone pathway and increase insulin resistance. Elevated levels of leptin have also been suggested as a possible cause of hypertension (Lavie et al. , 2009) . The metabolic disorders presented in this section contribute to the atherosclerotic process. Hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and chronic inflammation contribute to the hypercoagulated state, impaired haemostasis and endothelial dysfun ction of vascular tissue. In addition to cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome has been associated with increased risk of fatty liver and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, gallstones, polycystic (Ahmed & Byrne, 2005; Fleming, 2005) Aetiology of the Metabolic Syndrome The m etabolic syndrome is frequently described as a lifestyle disease. Although such statements simplify the complex health and social chal lenges, there is strong evidence that lifestyle factors are strongly associated with the syndrome. In a study of 1,038 Finnish men, Laaksonen et al. (2002) found that those engaging in more than 3 hours of leisuretime physical activity, daily, were 48 per cent less likely to 32 develop metabolic syndrome. Cardiorespiratory fitness was also inversely associated with developing the disorder. These outcomes were independent of effects by confounders, including obesity. Panagiotakos et al. (2004) evaluated the ef fects of a healthy diet and moderate physical activity separately. The odds ratio for developing metabolic syndrome was 0.81 among persons who consumed a healthy Mediterranean diet, compared to those who did not. The odds ratio was 0.75 for developing meta bolic syndrome if a person had little to moderate physical activity compared to a sedentary lifestyle. Studies vary as to whether results are mediated through, or separated from, obesity. This large Greek study did not adjust for obesity. However, the r esults were determined independently from the effects of age, gender, education, smoking, inflammation and coagulation factors. The Framingham Offspring Study (McKeown et al., 2004) provided evidence that some effects of diet and physical activity are not mediated through effects on obesity and fat distribution. This study found a strong inverse independent relationship between consumption of wholegrains and fibre and the development of metabolic syndrome. Results are varied as to whether alcohol increases the risk of developing metabolic syndrome. A large Korean study found a positive association between alcohol and metabolic syndrome (Yoon, Baik, Park & Kim, 2004) . However , Swedish research with 4 ,000 participants found that moderate wine drinkers had less likelihood of developing metabolic syndrome than nondrinkers, especially for women (Rosell, de Faire & Hellenius, 2003) . The wine drinkers from this study were found to have healt hier lifestyles than the nondrinkers. Although alcohol consumption has been found to increase blood pressure and triglyceride levels (Yoon et al., 2004) , these results might not be generalisable. It is likely that as for cardiovascular risk, the metabolic syndrome risk conferred by alcohol is influenced by quantity and type, ethnicity, cultural context and gender. The extent to which 'nature ' or 'nurture ' contribute s to metabolic syndrome is not known. A range of gene variants for fat and glucose metabolis m are likely to be associated with metabolic syndrome. However, it is not yet possible to estimate to 33 what extent outcomes are determined by genetic pre disposition compared to lifestyle and environmental factors . There is some information regarding the rel ated concern of low birthweight. Epidemiological studies have shown there is a relationship between low birthweight, diabetes and insulin resistance across varying cohorts (Cripps & Ozanne, 2005) . The 'thrifty phenotype hypothesis ' suggests an underweight foetus will adopt metabolic strategies (e.g. , storing fat) for survival, which become long term metabolic impairments. Poor foetal nutrition and low birthweight have been linked to dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension (Cripps & Ozanne, 2005) . An alternative hypothesis was proposed by Hattersley and Tooke (1999) , who consider that an insulin -resistant phenotype contributes to low birthweight before the adult expression of insulin resistance. Metabolic syndrome may present as a co -morbidi ty of other endocrine disorders that share pathophysiological features. Insulin resistance is a major contributor to polycystic ovary syndrome (and hyperandrogenism), although not included in the clinical definition (European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, 2004) . Polycystic ovary syndrome and metabolic syndrome both involve insulin resistance, chronic inflammation and defects in adipose lipolysis (Sattar & Fleming, 2005) . Two thirds of person with Cushing 's syndrome also have metabolic syndro me (Chanson & Salenave, 2010) . High cortisol levels and obesity lead to similar metabolic cascade disorders in both conditions. Evidence is conflicting about the relationship between metabolic syndrome, menopause and hormone replacement therapy. However, s ome studies suggest menopause increases the risk of metabolic syndrome, independent of increase in postmenopausal obesity (Sattar & Fleming, 2005) , Considering the nature of metabolic syndrome, it is expected that those with co-morbidities of diabetes, dys lipidaemia, hypertension and cardiovascular disease have higher rates of metabolic syndrome than the rest of the population. These will be detailed in Section 2.4. 2.3.5 Controversy A bout the Metabolic Syndrome Over recent years, debate has intensified over the meaning and usefulness of having a metabolic syndrome diagnosis. When Reaven first suggested a metabolic disorder 34 was associated with cardiovascular disease, he was advocating a construct that challenged t he assessment approach of the time (Reaven, 2011) . Previously , cardiovascular risk was focussed on elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Recognition of the metabolic syndrome has successfully expanded cardiovascular risk considerations by researche rs and clinicians. However, for this syndrome to be used as a diagnostic assessment, it must be reliable, valid and useful. The key issues regarding diagnostic utility of the metabolic syndrome are outlined in Table 2.3. Table 2.3 : Questions about diagnos tic utility of the metabolic syndrome Is there a shared mechanism that explains the metabolic syndrome? Do varying definitions and cut -offs confuse generalisability? Does the metabolic syndrome predict cardiovascular disease? Does the metabolic syndrome predict cardiovascular disease better than its combined components (i.e. , is the whole greater than its parts)? Is the metabolic syndrome useful for predicting co -morbidities (e.g. , diabetes)? Does a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome lead to improved mana gement options? Does a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome improve health outcomes? Section 2.3.3 discussed the pathophysiology processes of metabolic syndrome. Some proponents of the syndrome accept insulin resistance as an adequate common mechanism, but m any experts find this hypothesis lacking (Alberti et al., 2009; Brietzke, 2007; 2011; Obunai et al., 2007) . However, a diagnosis might be clinically useful without full scientific understanding. Section 2.3.1 presented the different definitions and cut -off thresholds for components of the metabolic syndrome. Such variations are not conducive to generalisability. Also, valuable diagnostic information may be lost by using arbitrary cut-off values fo r dichotomous classification, as currently used by all metabolic syndrome definitions (Preiss & Sattar, 2009; Sattar et al., 2008) . Although groups are harmonising criteria towards a worldwide definition, it is likely that a range of 35 obesity cut -offs will still be required for different populations. Feasibility has also been a significant driver of change for definitions of the metabolic syndrome, such that measures of insulin resistance have been removed and waist circumference has been included. The usefulness of a metabolic syndrome diagnosis depends upon the specified purpose of that diagnosis. Many clinicians consider metabolic syndrome as not only a risk factor for, but also a predictor of, cardiovascular disease. In 2007, Gami et al. (2007) condu cted a systematic review of metabolic syndrome risk for cardiovascular events and mortality. The review included 37 longitudinal studies of 172,573 individuals. Meta -analysis of these studies found that metabolic syndrome had a relative risk (RR) for cardi ovascular events of 2.18 (95 per cent CI 1.63 -2.93) and cardiovascular death of 1.91 (95 per cent CI 1.47 -2.49). The risk was stronger in women (RR 2.63) compared to men (RR 1.98). Most importantly, the association remained after adjusting for individual ca rdiovascular risk factors (RR 1.54, 95 per cent CI 1.32 -1.79). The authors noted that attrition bias was a source of study variability and overestimated cardiovascular risk. However, sensitivity analysis confirmed studies that reduced this bias still had a pooled risk similar to that of the overall analysis. These results support those previously found by a systematic review of 21 studies in 2006 (Galassi et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007) . The evidence from these reviews (Galassi et al., 2006; Gami et al., 2 007), as well as the most methodologically rigorous included studies (Lakka et al., 2002; Malik et al., 2004; McNeill et al., 2005; Sattar et al., 2008) confirmed that metabolic syndrome has predictive value for cardiovascular events and death. The more di fficult question is whether that risk is greater than the sum of the risk of individual components. All metabolic syndrome components are independently associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (Ninomiya et al., 2004) . However, if the risk o f metabolic syndrome as a single entity is not greater than its components, its purpose becomes questionable. Gami et al. (2007) interpreted from their analyses that the metabolic syndrome did confer cardiovascular risk beyond that of its component risk fa ctors. Inchiostr o, Fadini, De Kreutzenberg, Citroni & Avogaro (2007) took issue with this judgement. Their criticism was based on adjustment of risk according to traditional 36 risk factors, rather than the specific components of the metabolic syndrome. Indiv idual studies have provided varying results as to whether the syndrome as a whole confers additional predictive value. There has been no methodologically sound comparison of the metabolic syndrome with any other cardiovascular risk tool. Though not the or iginal intention, the metabolic syndrome has been found to be highly predictive for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Wilson et al. (2005) found that for persons with metabolic syndrome, the RR for developing type 2 diabetes exceeds 4.0 in both men and women. In 2 008, Sattar et al. (2008) reviewed the results from the PROSPER (Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) and BRHS (British Regional Heart Study) studies of nondiabetic participants with metabolic syndrome. Hazard ratios for developing diab etes were 4.41 and 7.47 in the PROSPER and BRHS studies, respectively. Prediction of diabetes by impaired fasting glucose was superior to metabolic syndrome in the PROSPER study, but similar in the BRHS study. These authors also considered that the predict ive value of metabolic syndrome was reduced by having single cut -offs and dichotomous classifications. In his 2009 commentary, Reaven (2009) suggested that in some clinical settings it could be easier to assess metabolic syndrome than to apply the 2 hour o ral glucose tolerance test. The m etabolic syndrome is recognised worldwide as a valid cluster of disorders. It was provided legitimacy when it received an International Classification of Disease in the ICD-9 (Disease 277.7) (World Health Organiz ation, 2012 c). In the clinical setting, the discovery of one component should prompt clinicians to evaluate for other components (IDF Consensus ; Graham et al., 2007). There is, however, insufficient evidence to justify using metabolic syndrome as a risk predictio n tool in place of existing methods. (Brietzke, 2007; Graham et al., 2007; Khan, World Health Organization, 2007) . There is also no cure or single effective treatment for the metabolic syndrome. Most importantly, there is no reasonable evidence that a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome improves health outcomes. Irrespective of these, considerable focus remains on the metabolic syndrome as a disease entity in research and cl inical settings. Recognition of this significant cluster of metabolic disorders 37 continues to be regarded as important for the understanding, prevention and management of cardiovascular risk (Alberti et al., 2009; Bonora, 2007; Gami et al., 2007; Graham et al., 2007; International Diabetes Federation, 2006 ; Khan et al., 2000 ). Further research is required to determine if the metabolic syndrome diagnosis is an impediment to using more effective risk paradigms or whether it can really improve health outcomes. 2.3.6 Health -related Quality of Life in Metabolic Syndrome Health -related quality of life is a multidimensional concept that includes domains of physical and mental health. Measures are self -reported and provide a client -centred perspective about the imp act health has on an individual 's functioning and wellbeing. There is no validated quality of life measurement tool for metabolic syndrome. Researchers have predominantly used the Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short Form Health Survey (SF -36) (Ware, 2007) to measure quality of life in persons with metabolic syndrome. When diabetes is the condition under evaluation, the Diabetes - 39 (D -39) is the instrument most frequently employed. Huang et al. (2008) tested the psychometric properties of the SF-36 and D -39 in people with diabetes and found both were superior for different domains and aspects, leading them to endorse the use of both a disease -specific and generic instrument for measuring quality of life in this cohort. The effect of the metabolic syndrome o n health -related quality of life has been evaluated across a range of countries. Each study confirmed that people with metabolic syndrome have a reduced quality of life compared to those who do not have metabolic syndrome. Ford and Li (2008) studied adults living in the US using the HRQOL -4 tool developed by the Cent ers for Disease Control and Prevention. The odds ratio for those with the syndrome to have fair to poor health was 1.97 (95 per cent CI 1.21 -3.13), compared to those without the syndrome. This r esult was determined after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, educational status and smoking status. Similar results were published for Greek (Tziallas et al., 2012) , Iranian (Roohafza, Sadeghi, Talaei, Sarrafzadegan, 2012) and Swedish (Frisman et al. , 2009) populations. The study by Frisman et al. (2009) suggested 38 reduced health -related quality of life was not due to social stress and psychological factors, but largely due to sedentary lifestyle. Huang , Chi, Sousa, Wang & Pan (2010) studied the effects of disorders co -existing with the metabolic syndrome. It was found that in a cohort of persons with metabolic syndrome, those who also had depression had much poorer health -related quality of life. Similar findings have been published reg arding the relationship between diabetes and health -related quality of life. A systematic review published in 2009 by Schram, Baan and Pouwer (2009) identified 20 studies that used generic, diabetes -specific and domain -specific measurement tools in persons with diabetes. Each of the included studies reported lower quality of life for individuals with diabetes, and a negative association between depression and at least one quality of life domain. Brown et al. (2004) used the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveilla nce System to determine that people with diabetes were three times more likely to report poor or fair health, than people without diabetes. Data from the AusDiab study (Tapp, O'Neil, Shaw, Zimmet & Oldenburg, 2010) highlighted that reduced health -related function occurs during, and even before, the stages of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes onset. A Swedish review of articles by Wandell (Wandell, 2005) found that reductions in quality of life were associated with macrovascul ar and associated nonvascular co -morbidities, as opposed to microvascular complications. The studies by Tapp et al. (2006) and Wee et al. (2005) found greater effects on physical health domains but not mental health domains. In contrast, Paschalides et al. (2004) specifically established that anxiety, depression and negative beliefs about illness influenced both mental and physical functioning. Evidence supports that the impact of chronic health conditions, including diabetes, on quality of life is very sim ilar across different countries (Alonso et al., 2004) . The studies described above used recent recall techniques within a cross -sectional research design. Their limitations include potential recall bias, unmeasured confounders and underacknowledgement of longer term influences. Although such a study design is appropriate, cross -sectional studies cannot determine causation. Therefore, the metabolic syndrome or diabetes cannot be conclusively attributed with reduction in health -related quality of life in the se studies. However, the body of 39 evidence has produced consistent results that depression and mental health should feature prominently in clinical care. Further, quality of life might predict and influence health outcomes in these cohorts. For researchers, this evidence supports ongoing inclusion of client -centred quality of life research outcomes. 2.4 Components of the Metabolic Syndrome 2.4.1 Diabetes in the Metabolic S yndrome 2.4.1.1 Diabetes Pathology and P revalence Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic disease characterised by elevated blood glucose levels. There are several disease types. The three main presentations are type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes. In addition, two stages of glucose regulation dysfu nction precede diabetes. Impaired fasting glucose has plasma glucose levels that are consistently elevated above normal. Impaired glucose tolerance has a higher level of glucose dysfunction that is strongly associated with insulin resistance, but does not yet meet the definition of diabetes. The diagnostic criteria for these states, as published by the WHO and IDF (World Health Organization, 2006) , are outlined in Table 2.4. 40 Table 2.4 : WHO/ IDF Diagnostic thresholds for dysglycaemia Diabetes Fasting plasma glucose Oral glucose tolerance test* 7 mmol/L or 11.1 mmol/L Impaired glucose tolerance Fasting plasma glucose Oral glucose tolerance test* <7 mmol/L and 7.8 mmol/L and <11.1 mmol/L Impaired fasting glucose Fasting plasma glucose Oral glucose tolerance test* 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L and (if measured) <7.8 mmol/L *Venous plasma glucose 2 hours afte r ingestion of 75 g oral glucose . The world prevalence of diabetes has more than doubled over the last three decades (Danaei et al., 2011) . The proportion of adults with diabetes is estimated to be 6.4 per cent, increasing to 7.7 per cent by 2030 (Shaw, Sicree & Zimmet, 2010) . In Australia, estima tes based on data from the 2007 -2008 National Health Survey suggest 4.4 per cent of adults have been diagnosed with diabetes (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2011b) . This percentages does not include persons who are unaware they have the disease. Type 2 diabetes mellitus can be asymptomatic for many years, and therefore in Australia there may be one person with undiagnosed diabetes for every person who receives a diagnosis (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2008) . The i ncreasing prevalence of diabetes is largely due to lifestyle effects (Nolan, Damm & Prentki, 201 1) but also population ageing, increased awareness and reporting, and improved survival rates (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009a) . Type 1 diabetes mellitus often begins in childhood, but only in the last 20 years has type 2 diabetes mellitu s become a health disorder for children and adolescents (Nolan et al., 2011) . One in 20 Australian pregnant women develops gestational diabetes (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2008) . Although hyperglycaemia usually normalises after childbirth, gestational diabetes is a risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes (World Health Organization, 2007) . 41 Type 1 diabetes is characterised by severe insulin deficiency that usually arises between birth and young adulthood. It is not clear how genetic a nd environ mental factors lead to the auto immune destruction of insulin -producing pancreatic beta cells (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2008 , 2010) . Although the direct consequences of type 1 diabetes mellitus are very serious, this type usuall y presents in young, otherwise healthy individuals. Nearly 90 per cent of persons with diabetes in Australia have the type 2 presentation (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2011b) . This form of the disease is most common in persons over 40 years of age and is characterised by insufficient insulin levels or impaired insulin function. It is this type of diabetes that is associated with insulin resistance and clustered cardiovascular risk factors (Alberti et al., 2009; Sattar et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2005) , as presented in Section 2.3. There are exceptions however, and the term 'double diabetes ' has recently been used to describe persons with diabetes mellitus type 1, who also have the cardiovascular risk factors associated with diabetes mellitus type 2 (Cleland, 2012) . The risk factors for impaired glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes mellitus mirror those of metabolic syndrome. They include obesity, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, inade quate physical activity, smoking, poor diet, mental illness and sleep disorders (Colagiuri, Dickinson, Girgis & Colagiuri, 2009) . In Australia, there is increased risk for indigenous popul ation groups and those with non -English speaking backgrounds (Austra lian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2008) . Type 2 diabetes mellitus and prediabetic hyperglycaemia can have a long period of damaging pathophysiology without any clinical presentation (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2008; Barr et al., 2007; World Health Organization, 2007) . Therefore, all case detection guidelines aim for early diagnosis by risk assessment, rather than clinical presentation. In Australia, the AUSDRISK (Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool) was introduced in 2008 an d is recommended for use in persons over 40 years, or over 18 years for Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders (Chen et al., 2010) 42 2.4.1.2 Diabetes M easurem ent and O utcomes Hyperglycaemia and impaired glucose regulation are detected and monitored with three laboratory measures: fasting plasma glucose, the oral glucose tolerance test and HbA1c . Fasting plasma glucose is ideally measured from venous plasma after a minimum fasting period of 8 hours. Fasting plasma glucose is the recommended diagnosti c test for detection of diabetes (Colagiuri et al., 2009) . The oral glucose tolerance test measures plasma glucose 2 hours after consuming 75 g of glucose. This procedure provides ad ditional information about post prandial glucose regulation. In Australia, the oral glucose tolerance test is not recommended for stand - alone diagnosis of diabetes but is used in addition to fasting plasma glucose to diagnose prediabetic stages of dysregulation (Colagiuri et al., 2009) . The third test, HbA1c, is an indirect measu re of average plasma glucose levels over the previous 10-12 wee k period. Due to its high intra subject reliability and validity for treatment targets, HbA1c is the gold standard test for monitoring glycaemic control in persons with diabetes (Colagiuri et al., 2009; World Health Organization, 2011c) Recently, the WHO endorsed that HbA1c was also suitable for detection, and specified 6.5 per cent as the threshold for diabetes diagnosis (Misra & Garg, 2011; World Health Organization, 2011c) . The cut -off values for diabetes classification using fasting plasma glucose and oral glucose tolerance tests are presented in Table 2.4. Diabetes has severe complications. Hyperglycaemia causes progressive damage to microvascular, macrovascular and neurological tissues. The resultant clinical disorders include cardiovascular disease, blindness, renal failure, lower limb ulceration and amputation, periodontitis and erectile dysfunction (World Health Organization, 2006) . The WHO estimates that 50 per cent of people with diabet es will die of heart disease and stroke (World Health Organization, 2011b) . In Australia, using data from 2005, diabetes mellitus was found to be involved in 9 per cent of deaths; including 3 per cent when diabetes was the primary attributable cause (Austr alian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2008) . An Australian with diabetes is twice as likely to have a heart attack and three times more likely to have a stroke than Australians without diabetes (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2008) . 43 Most people with diabetes also have metabolic syndrome (Alberti et al., 2009) . Those with a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, but not diabetes, are at high risk of deve loping the diabetic component. When the WHO definition is used, the association is clear. Glucose intolerance is a compulsory inclusion and is itself a powerful predictor of diabetes. However, other metabolic syndrome definitions also predict diabetes (Kahn et al. , 2005; Reaven, 2009) as discussed in Section 2.3.5. A meta -analysis by Galassi et al. (2006) found that in participants with metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular risk was highest for those who also had diabetes. Cabre et al. (2008) calculated odds ratios for developing cardiovascular disorders in persons with diabetes and metabolic synd rome. Ranging from 2.28 to 3.48, depending on metabolic syndrome definition, these results were slightly higher than had been previously published. This might be due to the inclusion of diabetes -related microvascular outcomes, such as nephropathies, neurop athies and retinopathies, in addition to the usual mac rovascular outcomes evaluated. It was once assumed that significantly lowered glycaemic levels were better for all health outcomes in persons with diabetes. Trials such as ADVANCE (ACCORD Study Group, 2008; ADVANCE Collaborative Group, 2008; U nited Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Group, 1998a, 1998b) and UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Group, 1998b) confirmed that tighter glycaemic control (less than 6.5 per cent HbA1c) prevented mic rovascular outcomes more than macrovascula r outcomes. Although the analyse s and results of these trials differed, they suggested a singular focus on reducing glucose levels below 7 per cent HbA1c in all persons was not appropriate. Treatment targets should follow diabetes guidelines, but vary for individuals, depending on age, co -morbidities, and risk of hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular disease (Colagiuri et al., 2009) . 2.4.1.3 Diabetes T reatment Management of diabetes begins with lifestyle modification, followed by pharmaceutical intervention if required and appropriate. Systematic reviews have shown that diet (Nield et al. , 2007) and exercise (Thomas, Elliott & Naughton, 2006) can lower blood glu cose levels independent ly of any weight loss. Ebrahim et al. 44 (2011) calculated an odds ratio of 0 .71 (95 per cent CI 0.61 -0.83) for education to reduce coronary heart disease in diabetes. The education intervention s addressed tobacco use, diet and exercise. As the median duration of follow -up was 12 months (range 6 months to 12 years), there was insufficient evidence that the effects might be sustain ed in the long term. Although the aim was prevention, rather than treatment, the Diabetes Prevention Program showed lifestyle interventions were substantially more effective than metformin (Diabetes Prevention Program Group, 2002) . Lifestyle interventions are further discussed in Section 2.4.5 within the context of the metabolic syndrome. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is treated with insulin. For type 2 diabetes mellitus, there are eight classes of drugs that lower peptide 1 analogues and insulin . Consistent with the increase in diabetes prevalence, the use of these antihyperglycaemic medicines has increased greatly in Australia ove r the last 20 years (Cameron et al., 2008) . Biguanides, most notably metformin, lower blood glucose by suppressing glucose production in the liver and stimulating glucose uptake in the tissues. Sulphonylureas and meglitinides stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion, whilst alpha glucosidase inhibitors slow carbohydrate absorption from the intestine. This differs from the glitazones , which may be considered disease modifying in type 2 diabetes mellitus (Nolan et al., 2011) . They increase glucose uptake by se nsitising the liver and skeletal muscle to insulin action. For each of these drug types, effectiveness has been established for reducing blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Colagiuri et al., 2009; Inzucchi et al., 2012) . Metformin is th e most commonly prescribed anti diabetes drug (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2008; Inzucc hi et al., 2012) either as a monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetes agents, such as the glitazones. Combining medications is considered more effective than maximising the dosage of just one (Colagiuri et al., 2009) . If insulin is required for increased glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes, it may be 45 initiated as basal therapy or as premixed insulins, use d in combination with oral antidiabetic medications. Clinicians face c hallenges when prescribing anti diabetes medications. These include contraindications, non tolerance, inadequate glucose control, hypoglycaemic events, weight gain, gastro intestinal effects and uncertainty regarding macrovascular benefit (Colagiuri et al., 2009; Inzucchi et al., 2012; Nolan et al., 2011) . The most common adverse effects are hypoglycaemia and weight gain, with evidence suggesting that the risk of both increases when b lood glucose is intensively managed (ACCORD Study Group, 2008; Gaster & Hirsch, 1998) . Perhaps consistent with this, Woolf et al. (2000) and Nolan et al. ( 2011) found the greatest weight gain in those using insulin therapies. The u se of sulphonylureas, meg litini des and glitazones is also associated with weight gain (Dluhy & McMahon, 2008; Jones, 1 990; Tahrani, Bailey, Del Prato & Barnett, 2011) , while gastro intestinal side effects are the primary concern for the biguanides and alpha glucosidase inhibitors (Tahrani et al., 2011) . Glitazones are an effective add -on therapy for diabetes (Nolan et al., 2011) but have received a particular focus regarding safety in recent years. Rosiglitazone, marketed as Avandia, had its licence withdrawn by the European Medicin es Agency in 2010, and its use restricted by the US Food and Drug Administration. This was in response to evidence that rosiglitazone was associated with an increased risk of heart attack and heart failure (Colagiuri et al., 2009; Lehman, Yudkin & Krumholz . In Au stralia, rosiglitazone remains available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme through a streamlined authority mechanism (Therapeutic Goods Administration, 2011) . A second glitazone, pioglitazone, has a more favourable cardiovascular safety profile but the long term risk -benefit ratio for both glitazones remains unclear (Lehman et Man nucci, Tahrani et al., 2011) . Similarly, the long term safety and effectiveness of new incretin -based treatment s, such to be established (Inzucchi et al., 2012; Nolan et al., 2011; Tahrani et al., 2011) . 46 2.4.2 Obesity in the Metabolic Syndrome Obesity is a condition of excess weight. The p revalence rates of obesity are increasing in both developed and developing countries (World Health Organization, 2007) . Using BMI , overweight is defined as between 25-29.9 kg/m2 and obesity is greater , or equal to, 30 kg/m2. The epidemic is such that experts suggest obesity will overtake tobacco use and hypertension as the leading cause of death in developed countries, such as the US (Lavie et al. , 2009) . There is concern that obesity and its risks have been underestimated in Asian countries due to ethnic variation in healthy weight ranges. Evidence also suggests morbid obesity is increasing at a greater rate than overweight and mild obesity in developed co untries (Lavie et al., 2009) . In Australia, 60 per cent of adults were overweight or obese in 2000 , as determined by the AusDiab study (Camer on et al., 2003) . This study also found the Australian annual direct cost of overweight and obesity was $21 billion . Australia does not have recent objective estimates of prevalence (Heart Foundation & National Stroke Foundation, 2008) ; however, it is unlikely that national obesity rates have reduced since this time (Preventative Health Taskforce, 2008) . Overweight an d obesity occur when there is an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure over a period of time. The location of excess weight is important. Excess fat around the waist includes significant amounts of intra -abdominal visceral adipose tissue (Ayyobi & Brunzell, 2003) , which differs from subcutaneous fat, found elsewhere in the body. Intra -abdominal adiposity is now known to be the source, and not just the expression, of the hormonal component of metabolic syndrome (Brietzke 2007 ). Graham et al. ( 2007) affirm '...fat, in particular intra -abdominal visceral fat, is a metabolically active endocrine organ ' (p. 2,391). The main metabolic dysfunction processes of visceral fat include the production of pro inflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance. Prospect ive epidemiological studies have confirmed that a strong association exists between overweight and obesity and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (Australian Institute of He alth and Welfare, 2008; Graham et al., 2007; World Health Organization, 2007) . Obesity might be the strongest link between the components of 47 the metabolic syndrome, and impart its risk through these risk components (Graham et al., 2007) . In particular, the complex relationship between obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome can make separate consideration of these entities difficult. The NHANES III study found that 3 per cent of persons within a healthy weight range had metabolic syndrome, but this prevalence dramatically increased to 22.5 per cent for persons even mildly overweight (BMI 25 -26.9kg/ m2) (St Onge, Janssen & Heymsfield, 2004) . A study of Finnish youth reported that measures of obesity were valid predictors fo r risk of developing metabolic syndrome as an adult (Magnussen et al., 2010) . The AusDiab study (Cameron et al., 2009) determined that meaningful risk was conferred by obesity on all metabolic syndrome components. The risk ratios for components are provide d in Table 2.5. Table 2.5 : Risk for obese persons to develop co -morbidities (Cameron et al., 2009) Metabolic syndrome component Risk ratio (Women) Risk ratio (Men) Diabetes mellitus 3.6 3.3 Hypertriglyceridaemia 3.2 1.7 Low levels of HDL cholesterol 2.3 1.8 Hypertension 2.6 1.8 Myocardial infarction 1.4 2.7 There is controversy about whether obesity should be measured by whole body or central adiposity measures. Overall size is measured by total body weight or body mass index (BMI), which is a ratio of weight and height measures (weight in kilos divided by the square of height in metres). Measurements that reflect central adiposity are waist circumference and hip -to-waist circumference ratio. Of these, waist circumference and BMI are used most commonly (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009b) . Waist circumference is more easily measured and a stronger predictor of health outcomes, but has hi gher risk of measurement error (Dalton et al., 2003; World Health Organization, 2011b) . Most g uidelines currently 48 recommend using both measures for assessment of excess weight and cardiovascular risk (Australian Institute of H ealth and Welfare, 2008; Graham et al., 2007) . Obesity measurements also have a useful role in diabetes. Both waist circumfe rence and BMI are predictive of, and strongly associated with, type 2 diabetes mellitus (Cameron et al., 2009; Hossain et Gaskill, Haffner & Stern, 1997) . Therefore, in settings where glucose level testing is not feasib le, anthropometric measures may discriminate youth and adults at risk of diabetes (Magnussen et al., 2010 ; Qiao & Nyamdorj, 2010; Tirosh et al., 2011; Wei et al., 1997) . There are probably more benefits from weight loss than from improvement of any other risk factor of metabolic syndrome. Just as obesity imparts risk via other components, so too weight loss significantly reduces risk through effects on other components (Australian Institute of Hea lth and Welfare, 2009b; Graham et al., 2007) . The cornerston e of weight loss management is lifestyle modification (Australian Institute of Healt h and Welfare, 2009b; Colagiuri et al., 2009; Graham et al., 2007; World Health Organization, 2007) . Systematic reviews have confirmed that diet modification and increased physical activity cause weight loss (Colagiuri et al., 20 09; Orozco et al., 2008; Shaw, O 'Rourke, Del Mar & Kenardy, 2009) . The National Physical Activity Guidelines for Australians (Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care, 1999) recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate - intensity physical activity on most days of the week. Additional evidence advocates inclusion of resistance exercise, such as lifting weights, to reduce adiposity, and improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic regulation (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2008) A range of diets might lead to weight loss (Graham et al., 2007; Nordmann, et al., 2006) . These include diets with reduced total caloric intake, reduced glycaemic index and restriction of fat or carbohydrate content. Healthy diets are also high in plant food content, including vegetables, fruits and legumes, and are low in salt, sugar, saturated fat and alcohol (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2008 , 2009) . The challenge regarding lifestyle modification is that diet, physical activity and weight loss improvements are generally not sustained beyond 12 months. Within 2 -5 years most people regain the excess weight (Wadden & Sarwer, 1999) . A range of psychological interventions, such as cognitive behaviour 49 thera py, are being researched to determine if they improve the magnitude and duration of weight loss achieved by lifestyle modification (Shaw et al., 2009) . Because few people successfully achieve weight loss in the long term with lifestyle modification, medic al practitioners may also prescribe medications to manage obesity. The development of pharmacotherapies for weight loss has been controversial. For such a high prevalence disorder, there have been relatively few treatment options , and each has been associa ted with safety concerns (Glandt & Raz, 2011; Graham et al., 2007; Powell, Apovian, & Aronne, 2011) . In most countries, phenylpropanolamine, rimonobant and sibutramine have either been denied approv al or been withdrawn. Despite modest efficacy and side eff ects, Orlistat (Xenical) has prevailed as the most commonly used anti-obesity medication. It is mechanism of action is to prevent absorption of fat by inhibiting pancreatic and gastric lipases. In a meta -analysis of 22 trials, participants taking Orlistat lost 2.89 kg more t han the control group over a 12 -month period (Li et al., 2005) . In Australia, Orlistat is available as a Schedule 3 therapeutic agent, to be dispensed with professional advice from pharmacists. Gastrointestinal side effects may be experi enced by up to 30 per cent of patients, although these effects diminish over time (Glandt & Raz, 2011) . Antidiabetic drugs, such as metformin and GLP -1 agonists , might also be used for their weight loss effects. Research into a new generation of anti -obesi ty drugs is underway. A range of pharmaceutical agents and combinations are being trialled, but long term efficacy and safety have not yet been established. There is also an increasing amount of evidence considering the safety and efficacy of gastric bandi ng and gastric sleeve surgery in morbid obesity. 2.4.3 Dyslipidaemia in Metabolic Syndrome The term dyslipidaemia may be used to represent atypical function of one or more substances involved in lipoprotein metabolism. It most commonly refers to abnormal levels of triglycerides, low -density lipoprotein cholesterol, high -density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoproteins (Eckel et al. , 2005) . Most prevalence data is drawn from measures of total cholesterol, for which 5. 5 mmol/L is the common threshold for hypercholesterol aemia (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2011a; Expert 50 Panel on Detection Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, 2001) . Using 2008 data, the WHO estimates that 39 per cen t of adults have high cholesterol worldwide (World Health Organization, 2011a) . Unlike obesity and diabetes, total cases of dyslipidaemia are thought to have plateaued (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009b; Roth et al., 2011) , possibly due to effective medications rather than prevention. Prescription rates of cholesterol -lowering statins have markedly increased over the past ten years in Australia, where 50 per cent of adults have high cholesterol. These estimates are derived from the 1999 -2000 AusDiab study data , which revealed that over 6 million Australian adults had serum cholesterol levels higher than 5.5 mmol/L (Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, 2009) . Dyslipid aemia is primarily caused by genetic predisposition, excessive intake of saturated fat and unhealthy diet factors (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009b; World Health Organization, 2012a) . The relationship between dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular disease is so clear that causality, rather than association, has been established (Expert Panel on Detection and Treatm ent of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, 2001; Graham et al., 2007) . This relationship is independent from obesity, which is thought to impart much of its risk via lipid profile changes (Graham et al., 2007) . Guidelines recommend that assessment and treatment targets should focus on total or low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (Graham et al., 2007; Grundy et al., 2004; World Health Organization, 2007) . In the metabolic syndrome, the profile of abnormal lipid metabolism differs. High levels of triglycerides and low levels of high -density lipoprotein cholesterol are the expression of metabolic syndrome dyslipidaemia. Excessive low -density lipoprotein cholesterol might also be present (Alberti et al., 2009; Ayyo bi & Brunzell, 2003; Expert Panel on Detection Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults, 2001) . The AusDiab study provides evidence of this clustering of triglycerides, high -density lipoprotein cholesterol and diabetes (Cameron et al., 2009) . In persons without diabetes, triglycerides were elevated in 23 per cent of males and 15 per cent of females, but these proportions increased to 59 per cent and 50 per cent respectively for those with diabetes. Similarly, rates of insufficient high -51 density lipoprotein cholesterol increased threefold from 17 per cent of males and 4 per cent of females to 47 per cent and 15 per cent respectively when diabetes was present (Cameron et al., 2009) . Cardiovascular risk clearly decreases when cholesterol le vels, especially low -density lipoprotein cholesterol, are reduced. In a systematic review of 108 trials, Briel et al. (2009) found a 7 per cent RR reduction for coronary heart disease with every 10 per cent decrease in low -density lipoprotein cholesterol l evels. Baigent et al. ( 2010) found that coronary artery disease risk reduced by 25 per cent in 5 years following a 10 per cent reduction in total cholesterol. Triglycerides and high -density lipoprotein are also independent risk factors for cardiovascular d isease (Briel et al., 2009) but the clinical benefit associa ted with their pharmaceutically -mediated improvements are less clear (Ayyobi & Brunzell, 2003; Briel et al., 2009) . There does not seem to be any cardiovascular risk reduction additional to that a ttributed to low -density lipoprotein cholesterol. However , it has been suggested that the functionality of each lipid molecule is affected by improvement in other molecules, such that effects become difficult to separate. As such, guidelines still specify that triglycerides, high - density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as low -density lipoprotein cholesterol be assessed and targeted for treatment in pe rsons with the metabolic syndrome. Statins, such as simvastatin, have been established as a safe and effect ive treatment for high cholesterol (Graham et al., 2007; World Health Organization, 2007) . Their capacity for cholesterol reduction correlates with the severity of hypercholesterolaemia, such that the higher the initial cholesterol level, the grea ter the p otential improvement. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists Collaboration (2008) performed a systematic review of 14 trials . They found statin therapy could safely reduce the incidence of stroke and coronary events by one fifth per mmol/L reduction in low -density lipoprotein cholesterol. T his study also found that the benefits were similar in a wide range of particip ants. In particular, the benefits for cardiovascular disease and mortality were no different between those with and without diabetes (Patel, Joshi & de Galan, 2009) . Efficacy was also established by the systematic review by Taylor et al. ( 2011) . Although the statins are considered a safe medication, this systematic review found eight of the 14 clinical trials did not report adverse 52 events. Th e reviewers also reported that the evidence is less robust regarding the role of statins in preventing or managing low risk levels of hypercholesterolaemia. Statin s are also considered very cost -effective and p opulation health experts have suggested they are underutilised globally (World Health Organization, 2012a) . Fibrates may be used for treatment of triglyceride levels in persons with metabolic syndrome. They may be used in combination with statins, though there is an increased risk of myopathy (Ecke l et al., 2005) . Statins might also be combined with niacin and thiazolidinediones to manage the metabolic syndrome form of dyslipidaemia, but there is not clear evidence of effectiveness of such combinations in metabolic syndrome (Ayyobi & Brunzell, 2003) . Nicotinic acid, ezetimibe and omega -3 fatty acid supplements m ight also be used for their effects on both triglyceride and high -density lipoprotein cholesterol. As with all components of metabolic syndrome, lifestyle modification is endorsed by guidelines f or management of dyslipidaemia. Weight reducing diets and exercise has been found to reduce total and low -density lipoprotein cholesterol and increase high - density lipoprotein cholesterol (Brunner, Rees, Ward, Burke & Thorogood, 2007; Shaw, Gennat, O 'Rour ke & Del Mar, 2006; World Health Organization, 2007) . Improvements in metabolic function, including lipid profile, can be detected prior to any weight loss (Graham et al., 2007) . However, the compliance limitations of lifestyle modifications are the same as for obesity. Accordingly, there is no strong evidence that improvements are sustainable beyond 12 months. 2.4.4 Hypertension in the Metabolic Syndrome Blood pressure is a measure of the force exerted on the artery walls during the systolic and diastolic stages of heart muscle contraction. For most people, high blood pressure is due to a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors, though in a minority hypertension is secondary to medication or disease (National Heart Foundation of Australia National Blo od Pressure and Vasc ular Disease Advisory Committee , 2010) . Elevated blood pressure is one of the most important causes of premature death worldwide (World Health Organization, 2012b) . Hypertension, specifically 53 longstanding uncontrolled hypertension, causes ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, renal disease, cognitive decline and premature death (Graham et al., 2007; Newcastle Guideline Development and Research Unit , 2011) . This represents 4.5 per cent of the world disease burden (World Health Organization, 2007) . In Australia, the AusDiab study provides the most recent data on hypertension prevalence. Thirty percent of Australian adults (33 per cent men and 27 per c ent women) over 25 years of age were found to have high blood pressure (Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, 2009) . It was also discovered that males were more likely to have hypertension that was undetected or untreated, than women were . Blood pressur e measurement can be associated with reliability and validity error. Guidelines have been produced to minimise potential sources of measurement error. Strategies target patient preparation, the measurement environment, measuring blood pressure in both arms , correct body and clothing position, equipment protocols and timing of measurement stages (National Heart Foundation of Australia National Blood Pressure and Vasc ular Disease Advisory Committee , 2010) . Mercury sphygmomanometers are regarded as the most ac curate, but are being phased out in Australia due to environmental concerns about heavy metal contamination. For digital sphygmomanometers, regular servicing and calibration is required to maintain accuracy. A diagnosis of hypertension should be determined from multiple measurements of blood pressure. When 'white coat ' effects are suspected, ambulatory monitoring may be required. This 24 hour measurement is also indicated when determining pres sure changes over time period. International definitions of hype rtension vary. Any threshold for diagnosis of hypertension is somewhat arbitrary as the relationship between blood pressure level and car diovascular risk is continuous (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009b) . For every 2 mmHg blood pressure inc rease, the corresponding risk increase is 7 per cent and 10 per cent for ischaemic heart disease and stroke, respectively (Newcastle Guideline Development and Research Unit, 2011) . The Heart Foundation (National Heart Foundation of Australia National Blood Pressure and Vasc ular Disease Advisory Committee , 2010) recommend the upper threshold of normal 54 should be less than 120 mmHg for systolic pressure and less than 80 mmHg for diastolic pressure. Blood pressure values above this threshold are categorised int o one of four grades of hypertension of increasing severity. In some guidelines, blood pressure thresholds for treatment are lower when diabetes is also present (Redon et al., 2008) . It has been suggested that hypertension is les s involved in, and less im portant to, the metabolic syndrome than other components (Kahn et al., 2005) . This might be because hypertension appears less affected by insulin resistance. Although its exact role in the metabolic syndrome is somewhat controversial, there is notable co - existence with excessive body weight, dyslipidaemia and dysglycaemia (Liu et al., 2007; Redon et al., 2008) . Diagnosis of metabolic syndrome further increases risk of cardiovascular and renal disease in people with hypertension (Redon et al., 2008) . Liu et al. (2007) compared the hazard ratios of individual and combination metabolic syndrome risk factors for de veloping cardiovascular disease in the Chinese population. They found the highest hazard ratios for developing cardiovascular events in persons with m etabolic syndrome were for those with the combination of high blood pressure and low high -density lipoprotein cholesterol. Subclinical organ damage such as stiffening, and increased urinary retion have been noted in persons with metabolic syndrome, even without hypertension (Sciarretta et al., 2007) . The common pathogenetic mechanisms between hypertension and metabolic syndrome are unclear, but are likely to involve abnormalities of sympathet ic overstimulation, the renin -angiotensin -aldosterone system, abnormal renal sodium processes and endothelial dysfunction (Redon et al., 2008) . The primary aims of hypertension management are to prevent end -stage kidney failure, chronic heart failure and prevent stroke. Treating hypertension reduces the risk of all cardiovascular complications , and in particular, decreases the risk of stroke by 35 -40 per cent (Collins et al., 1990) . Antihypertensive therapy is usually life - long. Pharmacological i nterventio ns include ACE inhibitors, nitrates and other vasodilators. Appropriate type, timing and dosage depends upon the grade of 55 hypertension, the presence of other metaboli c syndrome components, especially diabetes, established cardiovascular or target organ damage, and absolute cardiovascular risk (Graham et al., 2007) . ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists are equally effective for lowering blood pressure and preventing cardiovascular disease (National Heart Foundation of Australia National Blood Pressure and Vasc ular Disease Advisory Committee , 2010; Newcastle Guideline Development and Research Unit, 2011) . Combination therapy with other agents is recommen ded if target pressure levels are not achieved with monotherapy. Some combination therapies introduce an increased risk of insulin resistance and diabetes. For this reason, the Heart Foundation now recommends ag ainst the use of beta blockers ( National Hear t Foundation of Australia National Blood Pressure and Vasc ular Disease Advisory Committee , 2010) . Similarly, unless there is compelling indication, guidelines recommend diuretics should be avoided in those under 65 years of age, due to the increased risk o f diabetes with long term use (Redon et al., 2008) . A diverse range of adverse effects may be associated with antihypertensive medicines , including renal dysfunction, abnormal hepatic enzyme and electrolyte levels, impotence and heart dysfunction or failur e (World Health Organization, 2007) . As for other metabolic syndrome components, management of hypertension is best achieved with lifestyle intervention. For every 1 per cent decrease in body weight, blood pressure lowers by 1 mmHg (National Heart Foundation of Australia National Blood Pressure and Vasc ular Disease Advisory Committee , 2010) . Smoking cessation, alcohol reduction, and diet and exercise modifications have been previously discussed. Those with hypertension might also benefit from relaxation therapy and reduction of dietary sodium and caffeine consumption (Newcastle Guideline Development and Research Unit, 2011) . In a meta -analysis of 44 randomised trials that evaluated the benefits of exercise, a blood pressure reduction of 7.4 mm Hg (systolic) and 5.8 mmHg (diastolic) was achieved in persons with hypertension (Fagard, 2001) . 56 2.4.5 Treatments for Metabolic Syndrome Currently, there is no single effective treatment for the management of the metabolic syndrome as a single disease entity. However , lifestyle modification has the potential to synergistically improve each metabolic syndrome component. At least 80 per cent of people with diabetes are overweight or obese (Colagiuri et al., 2009) . Weight loss is therefore the cornerstone of management for metabolic syndrome (Mann, 2005) . Weight reduction improves insulin sensitivity, glycaemic control, lipid profiles, blood pressure, mental health and quality of life (Colagiuri et al., 2009; Hanefeld, 2005; Pi -Sunyer, 2007) . Improvement is not just for risk factor surrogate endpoints. Weight loss also improves cardiovascular disease outcomes (Lavie et al., 2009) . Diet modification is a particularly important aspect of lifestyle modification for the metabolic syndrome, because it is the exag gerated glycaemia and insulin responses that lead to the cascade of metabolic disorders. Dietary strategies focus on reducing processed sugars, consuming carbohydrates with a lower glycaemic index, increasing protein, eliminating trans -unsaturated fats and reducing saturated fats (Mann, 2005) . Exercise is effective because it reduces obesity, directly improves insulin sensit ivity, lipid profiles, hypertension, fibrinolytic profiles, and glucose transporters . This is thought to be partly due to stimulation of the growth hormone/ insulin -like growth factor -I axis (McHugh, 2005) . Although the media has highlighted growth hormone as a possible treatment for metabolic syndrome and obesity, this has not been substant iated by research (McHugh, 2005) . The Diabetes Prevention Program (Orchard et al., 2005) compared a combined diet and physical activity intervention against metformin and placebo. The incidence of metabolic syndrome was reduced by 41 per cent for the lifes tyle intervention group, and 17 per cent for the metformin group, when compared with placebo . Unfortunately, l ifestyle modification and weight loss is a minefield of genetic, environmental, emotional and physical challenges that are very difficult to susta in in the long term. Over 50 per cent of those with metabolic syndrome do not meet treatment targets without pharmacological intervention (Hanefeld, 2005) . As a disease entity, the m etabolic syndrome is not a valid target of pharmacological therapy (Isaac sohn, Troendle & Orloff, 2004) . Criteria for diagnosis, as outlined in 57 Section 2.3, are often used as treatment targets, though guidelines for individual factors and absolute cardiovascular risk might also be employed. Research findings have been inconsist ent as to whether components should be managed more aggressively in the presence of metabolic syndrome. Evidence is clearer that individuals with diabetes, or with higher cardiovascular risk, benefit from intensive blood pressure and lipid lowering, but th at these assumptions cannot be made for lower risk patients (Holman, Paul, Bethel, Neil & Matthews, 2008; Patel et al., 2009; Timble, Hayward & Vijan, 2010) . Irrespective of the treatment guideline s used, any single component must be considered in the cont ext of co -existing cardiovascular risk factors and personalised to individual needs and situations (Eckel et al., 2005; Timble et al., 2010) . People with the metabolic syndrome might also be at high risk of polypharmacy harm due to the number of drugs requ ired, and this too must be consid ered for optimal patient care. The aims for the medications used in the metabolic syndrome are to treat an individual component, but to also have neutral or potentially positive effects on other metabolic components. These include Orlistat and sibutramine (for obesity, but with positive effects on dy sglyc aemia and dyslipidaemia ), metformin (for dysglycaemia, on obesity and dyslipidaemia ), acarbose (for dysglycaemia, but with positive effects on hypertension), ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor I blockers (for hypertension, but with positive effects on dysglycaemia), glitazones (for dysglycaemia, but with positive effects on dyslipidaemia, inflammation and hypertension), s tatins and fibrates (for dyslipidaemia, but with positive effects on low grade inflammation) (Graham et al., 2007; Hanefeld, 2005; World Health Organization, 2007) . As previously discussed, these treatments might also be contraindicated, unable to reach tr eatment targets or present adverse effects. The ultimate aim of metabolic syndrome treatment is to prevent or reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease and its associated morbidity and mortality, and to improve quality of life. Often, little is known about the safety and efficacy of treatments for these outcomes in metabolic syndrome. This is because most research has evaluated the efficacy for risk factor surrogate outcomes and not long term health consequences. Additionally, research studies and sub sequent guidelines for treatment 58 have focussed on individual components in people with metabolic syndrome (Hanefeld, 2005) . Estimates for management efficacy of metabolic syndrome as a single entity can only be inferred by studies evaluating treatments for multiple cardi ovascular risk factors in a non metabolic syndrome context. In a move towards the prevention of cardiovascular disease, cardio protective drugs may be added to those for elevated glucose, lipids and blood pressure (Graham et al., 2007) . Data from research, including the ACCORD and ADVANCE studies, suggests that in those with diabetes, greatest car diovascular risk reduction may be achieved by effective blood pressure control and the concomitant use of aspirin and statins (Dluhy & McMahon, 2008) . Sattar et al. ( 2010) specifically evaluated the use of sta tins in persons with diabetes. A meta -analysis of 13 trials found that while statin therapy was associated with slightly increased risk of develop ing diabetes, there was also a decreased risk of c oronary events. The benefit -harm ratio was considered to favour statin use in those at moderate -to-high risk of cardiovascular disease. However, high dose statins should be used with caution in persons at risk of devel oping type 2 diabetes mellitus. Resea rch efforts for a metabolic syndrome treatment have been directed towards a polypill with fixed dose combinations. Meta -analyses of trials have not established the advantage of a single drug when compared to multiple agents (World Health Organization, 2007 ). There is also concern that a polypill could increase the risk of overtreatm ent in those at low risk, under treatment in those at higher risk and the burden of adverse events (Ebrahim et al., 2011; Napoli & Cacciatore, 2009) . Early research showing that thiazolidinediones might impact on the metabolic syndrome with its disease modifying properties was promising . These glitazones have been found to reduce glycaemia, improve differentiation of fat cells, and reduce lipolysis and cytokine secretion. How ever, they have also been associated with weight gain and adverse effects (Fonseca, 2003) . Around the world, there are still considerable research efforts aimed at producing a polypill for the metabolic syndrome. 59 2.5 Ganoderma lucidum for Cardiovascular Risk Factors 2.5.1 Use of Ganoderma lucidum The u se of complementary and alternative medicines is increasing worldwide. In Australia, the most recent national consumer survey found 67 per cent of the population reported using a complementary medicine in the previous 12 months (National Prescribing Service, 2006) . The National Institute of Complementary Medicine (National Institute of Complementary Medicine, 2009) estimates Australians are spending four times more money on complementary me dicines than on pharmaceuticals in terms of out of pocket expenses. Some of the reasons provided for using complementary medicines are perceptions that they are safer, more 'natural ' and more holistic than W estern medicines (Williamson, Tudball, T oms, Garden & Grunseit, 20 08). There is also evidence that Australians have less concern s about safety, efficacy and medication interact ions for complementary medicine than for other pharmaceuticals (Williamson et al., 2008) . Ganoderma lucidum is a woody mushroom that is highly respected in traditional Chinese medicine as the 'king of herbs '. Ganoderma lucidum was ranked as the most important herb in the oldest directory , Shen Nong 's Herbal Classic , and can also be found in the Pen-ts'ao Kan -mu (Compendium of Materia Medica), written in the Han and Ming dynasties, respectively (Wachtel -Galor et al., 2004 b). These are the only known historical references but they suggest Ganoderma lucidum , also called ling zhi or reishi, has been used in Asia for over 2,000 years. As with most herbal interventions, it is regarded as both medicine and food to bring the body into balance, promote health, prolong life and prevent and cure many systemic diseases. The Chinese Medical Herbology and Pharmacology text suggests that Ganoderma lucidum (Chen & Chen, 2004) does improve cardiovascular health. The mushroom is described to increase cardiac contractility, reduce blood pressure and \"nourish the heart and strengthen qi and blood to treat heart and spleen deficiencie s\" (Chen & Chen, 2004, pp.770). Worldwide annual turnover of Ganoderma lucidu m was estimated at $2.16 billion (US) in 2004 (Lai, Gao & Zhou, 2004) . Because there is no government or private 60 reimbursement of this product, no published data exists on the e xtent of Ganoderma lucidum use in Australia. When recommended by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, Ganoderma lucidum would be prescribed according to traditional Chinese medicine theory. It is also likely to be taken as one of many constituents i n a complex herbal intervention. In Australia, it is likely that most Ganoderma lucidum is purchased as a single intervention through Chinese medicine pharmacies, health stores, and complementary medicine or Ganoderma lucidum -specific internet sites. In these contexts, Ganoderma lucidum is usually taken for W estern medical diagnoses in a self-prescribed capacity. The intervention may still be purchased in the more traditional form of a decoction, tea or coffee, but is increasingly manufactured as an extract i n tablets and capsules for the W estern mar ket. Extracts may be prepared in water or organic solvents. Ganoderma lucidum products claim to treat a wide range of conditions, including diabetes and blood pressure , and are suggested to improve cardiovas cular health. Particularly when self -prescribed, consumers might not be aware of adverse effects, and might not associate chronic or delayed effects with the herbal intervention. Furthermore, evidence suggests that 50 percent of consumers do not discuss th eir complementary medicine use with their regular doctor (Williamson et al., 2008) . 2.5.2 Active Constituents of Ganoderma lucidum Ganoderma lucidum is a non edible, hard woody type of mushroom. Karsten classified its genus in 1881 as a member of the Basidiomycota division of the Fungi kingdom (Huie & Di, 2004) . Table 2.6 provides the complete botanical classification of Ganoderma lucidum . Table 2. 6: Botanical classification of Ganoderma Kingdom Fungi Division Basidiomycota Class Agaricomycetes 61 Order Family Ganodermataceae Species Asian Ganoderma lucidum group The Ganoderma mushroom is a complex of pharmacological active variables and the effects and effectiveness of the whole product is likely to differ from any single component acting alone. The mushroom has a fruiting body (basidiocarp), a mycelium and include polysaccharides, triterpine non essential amino acids, sterols, lipids, antioxidants, vitamin s B1, B2, B6, iron, calcium, and zinc. Preliminary evidence suggests that these constituents, either i ndividually or synergistically , produce hepato protective effects (Lee et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2004; Silva, 2004; Song et al., 2004; Su, Shiao & Wang, 2000) . There are some claims that spores contain higher quantities of active constituents. This has not been determined by research and any medicinal benefit is unclear. As with most herbal medicines, matching single con stituents with specific disease - modifying effects is very difficult. For Ganoderma lucidum , researchers suggest that there are two groups of prominent bioactive components that have effects on the cardiovascular system. These are the triterpenes and polysacc harides. Ganoderma lucidum is the only known source of triterpene fatty acids called ganoderic acids. Of the 200 that have been identified, ganoderic acids A, B and C are thought to have hypoglycae mic anoderic a cids F, B, D, H, K, S and Y are most likely hypotensive in their action (Morigawa, Kitabatake, Fujimoto & Ikekawa, 1986) . The likely mode of action of ganoderic acid (g anoderol) B on glycaemia is - glycosida se inhibition , thereby affecting carbohydrate digestion (Fatmawati, Shimizu & Kondo, 2011) . Ganoderic acids might inhibit many enzymatic activities, including those of ACE (Huie & Di, 2004) , and might suppress sympathetic efferent activity (Lee & Rhee, 199 0; Rhee & Lee, 1990) . Ganoderic acid S has been identified as an 62 of platelet aggregation (Shimizu, Yano, Saito & Feng, 1990) . Most ganoderic acids are also thought to be active inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis (Komoda, Shimi zu, Sonoda & Sato, 1989) . The second constituent group that might have effects on the cardiovascular system is the polysaccharides. Over 150 molecules, including beta -D-glucans, hetero polysaccharides and glycoproteins have been identified in Ganoderma lucidum (Chang & Buswell, 1999) . Evidence suggests these structurally diverse macromolecules also have hypoglycemic effects (Tomoda et al., 1986; Zhang & Lin, 2004) . Most research into Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides has focus sed on their anti-immune and anti-inflammatory prop erties. The proposed benefits on the latter might inhibit anti -inflammatory processes of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Ho wever, research by Huie and Di (2004) suggests that although constituent identification is importa nt, efficacy might be optim ised by use of the Ganoderma lucidum product as a whole, and not by its individual constituents. Creating standardi sed herbal medicines is inherently challenging. Compared to synthetic pharmaceuticals, so me diversity should be e xpected; however , the degree of variation can be significant or unknown. The s afety and effectiveness of a product depends upon the quality of the material and production process, over which there may be little regulation. There can be discrepancy and dive rsity in classification, naming, definitions, policy, manufacture and marketing. Products may have come from different countries with different regulations and practices. The re is particular concern about poor quality source material, misidentified herbs, inadequate processing methods, and herbal products bei ng adulterated or contaminated (Shaw, Ladds, Duez, Williamson & Chan, 2012; World Health Organization, 2008) . Unlike synthetic medicines, herbal medicines such as Ganoderma lucidum are chemically rich a nd complex. Using the same herbal ingredient does not ensure bioequivalence. Even with correct identification of genus, species and plant part, herbal medicine is rarely standard ised according to the active constituents (Shaw et al., 2012) . Geographical fe atures also affect efficacy and safety. Growing conditions, climate, pollution and collection methods alter the chemical profile s of herbal medicines. Furthermore, any stage of manufacturing might alter the effects of the herb. In 63 particular, preventing ac tive constituent deterioration or contamination by microbial or chemical means is a priority (Zhang et al., 2012) . Any, or all, of these factors, may affect the efficacy and safety of Ganoderma lucidum . 64 2.5.3 Effects of Ganoderma lucidum Animal and in vitro studies The majority of the research into the effect of Ganoderma lucidum glycaemia is based on animal and in vitro experiments. Zhang et al. (2003) found three significant effects in mice. Pretreatment with Ganoderma lucidum protected pancreatic islets from free radical damage, decreased serum glucose levels and increased serum insulin levels. The same group published a further study in 2004, and again reported an increase in insulin and a decrease in serum glucose levels in both norm al and diabetic mice over a 6 -hour period (Zhang & Lin, 2004) . These e ffects were both time and dose -dependent, but the differences were not as great as for the comparison agent, glibenclamide. These results co nfirmed those found by Hikino et al. in 1985 (Hikino et al., 1985) , who found the fractionated components of Ganoderma lucidum , ganoderan s A and B, exhibited a significant hypoglycemic action on both normal and diabetic mice. This author 's second publicati on further investigated the mechanisms of g anoderan B on other variables involved with carbohydrate metabolism in mice (Hikino, Ishiyama, Suzuki & Konno, 1989) . Ganoderan G caused hypoglyc aemia by increasing plasma insulin levels and accelerating glucose m etabolism in peripheral tissues, as measured by glycokinase, phosphofructokinase and glucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase levels. Studies in rats have also exhibited the hypoglycemic potential of Ganoderma lucidum . Two small experiments (Kimura, Okuda & Arich i, 1988; Liang & Peng, 1998) , produced results showing that Ganoderma lucidum significantly reduce s blood glucose levels and tolerance to glucose loading in rats. Human studies There have been three studies to evaluate the effects of Ganoderma lucidum on hyperglycaemia in humans. In a double cross -over trial, Winther et al. (Winther, Mehlsen, Rein, Hansen & Goino, 2003) investigated the effect of Ganoderma lucidum over 4 weeks in 16 patients with non -insulin -dependent diabetes 65 mellitus. This trial did not use random isation or alternate allocation of groups. No change was found in glucose parameters, though there was a decrease in C-peptide levels suggesting reduced insulin levels. The results of a larger clinical trial were published by Gao et al. in 2004 (Gao, Lan, Dai, Ye & Zhou, 2004 b). Seventy -one patients were randomly allocated to a placebo or intervention group for treatment with 5.4 g of Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide over 12 weeks. The addition of concomitant medication was discouraged , but allowed if stable. The authors reported that HbA 1c, fasting plasma glucose and 2 - hour post prandial glucose were significantly reduced from baseline (within -group difference), and pos tprandial glucose, fasting insulin, post prandial insulin and C - peptide were significantly improved when compared to the placebo group (between - group difference). This article reports a clear and appropriate screening and data collection protocol, but has other significant threats to validity in its design and reporting. There was no statement of whether the trial was single - or double -blinded, no clear primary outcome variables, no power calculation, no comparison or adjustment for baseline group differences, lack of intention -to-treat analysis, and continuous data was converted to categorical data. Most importantly, comparisons between the placebo and control groups were secondary comparisons. The authors concluded that the treatment was efficacious in lowering blood glucose levels. However, despite some meaningful trends, the primary diabetes endpoints HbA 1c and fasting plasma glucose were not statistically different to the control group. These results were for a polysaccharide -specific extract of Ganoderma lucidum and might produce different results than that of the broader Ganoderma lucidum bioactive extract compounds. After commence ment of the trial presented in this thesis, another cli nical trial was published. Wan g, Tschen and Sheu (2008) evaluated the effects of Ganoderma lucidum (3 g per day) in 50 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus over 12 weeks. No clinical or statistical dif ference was found between groups for HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose. Analysis of post prandial measures produced contrasting results. For 2 hour postprandial blood glucose a statistically significant reduction of 0.7 mmol/L (95 per cent CI 0.29 -1.11) was found for those taking pla cebo. However, for another 66 postprandial measure , plasma glucose under the curve at the 4th hour, the difference was 49.4 mg/dL/h (95 per cent CI -77.21 to -21.59) in favour of the intervention group. It is uncertain whether the latter result is clinically meaningful because there is a paucity of information regarding normal and atypical curve values for glucose tolerance testing values at the 4 -hour time point . It was also deemed highly likely that the data for fasting plasma glucose contained an error. Wang et al. (2008) reported the endpoint mean of the placebo group as 187.9 (49) mg/dL. Our comparisons and calculations suggest this standard deviation (SD) value i s not 49 mg/dL, but rather 4.9 mg/dL. Consequently, there is also uncertainty for conclusions based on this data. 2.5.3.2 Antidyslipidemic Effects of Ganoderma lucidum Animal and in vitro studies Berger et al. ( 2004) conducted a study on the effects of Ganoderma lucidum on minipigs, believing these animals have a more similar lipid metabolism to humans than other experimental animals. Cholesterol was lowered in both minipig and in vitro experiments, and included decreases of total cholesterol, low -density lipoprotein cholesterol and high -density lipoprotein cholesterol. A concern about this paper was the reporting of high -density lipoprotein decrease as a beneficial result, when this is contrary to widely accepted standards for management of dyslipidaemia. A study of hyperlipidaemic rats (Yang, Jeong & Song, 2002) showed exobiopolymers and endo biopolymers from submerged mycelial culture of total cholester ol, low -density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride s, and phospholipid levels significantly. In contrast to the previously described study, the high -density lipoprotein cholesterol to to tal cholesterol ratio increased compared to the control group. Kabir , Kimura and Tamura (1988) also demonstrated that Ganoderma lucidum could significantly lower serum and liver total cholesterol levels , but found triglycerides were unchanged a s a result of the intervention. 67 Human studies There are four trials that provide evidence regarding lipid and cholesterol changes from treatment with Ganoderma lucidum in human subjects. The random ised controlled trial by Winther et al. (2003) , which did not find a difference in blood glucose as outli ned above, also reported no difference between groups for low- density lipoprotein cholesterol. Similarly, Wachtel -Galor et al. ( 2004 b) found a decrease in lipid levels in 18 healthy persons, but this was not statistically significant. However, t he main purpose of that study was to establish safety and tolerability in a sample of healthy individuals. One might anticipate minimal change for a healthy cohort. Additionally, this trial used a lower dosage than that of other studies , over a 4-week period. Gao et al. (2004 a) also evaluated lipid profile changes as part of a study for Ganoderma lucidum efficacy in coronary heart disease. This research team investigated the polysaccharide extract of Ganoderma lucidum with a dosage of 5.4 g per day. The authors cl aimed successful results and reported a significant decrease in total cholesterol, though no comparisons were made with the placebo group. Results for triglycerides, low -density lipoprotein cholesterol and high -density lipoprotein cholesterol were not repo rted. These variables might have been unchanged as a result of treatment. Also in this article, the authors discuss findings from animal studies that found total cholesterol reductions, but make no mention that total cholesterol was unchanged in their diab etes trial of very similar design and published in the same issue of the International Journal of Medicina l Mushrooms. 2.5.3.3 Antihypertensive Effects of Ganoderma lucidum In 1985, one of the earliest c linical trials was conducted of the efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum (Kanmatsuse et al., 1985) . Fifty -three participants were recruited to investigate effectiveness for treatment of hypertension. Group 1 participants had essential hypertension and were compared with Group 2 participants who had either mild hypertension or normal blood pressure. Blood pressure significant ly decreased in Group 1. However , by current standards the overall trial 68 quality is poor for method s, results and reporting. In particular, the research design is inappropriate for an interve ntion study because the control group is for the condit ion, and not the intervention. Blood pressure was an outcome of interest for the 2004 study of Ganoderma lucidum polysacchari de for coronary heart disease previously outlined (Gao , Chen, Dai, Ye & Zhou, 2004 a). Though a statistical improvement was noted from baseline, again no comparison against the placebo group was reported. Two groups , totaling 54 participants , were also not compared in a trial by Jin et al. (1996) , which found blood pressure signif icantly decreased from baseline in pre viously non responsive hypertensive patients. As within -group differences might primarily report improvement from placebo effect, Hawthorne effect, regression toward the mean, natural recover y and process effects, these changes do not represent the treatment effect. As such, the true treatment effect of Ganoderma lucidum for hypertension has not been established by these studies. 2.5.4 Safety of Ganoderma lucidum Ganoderma lucidum has been regarded as a safe, non toxic Chinese medicine for over 2,000 years. It is listed within the safest class (C lass 1 Drug) in the American Herbal Products Association Botanical Safety Handbook , which states the mushroom may be safely consumed when used appropriately (McGuffin, Hobbs, Upt on & Goldberg, 1997) . In Australia, Ganoderma lucidum is listed with the Therapeutic Goods Association (TGA) for purchase and consumption without prescription or medical supervision. There is no scientific data for safe and effective dosage of Ganoderma lucidum. Recommended amounts are been derived from historic sources, Chinese medicine tradition, expert opinion or marketing trends. These levels vary between 1.5 g and 9 g of dried extract per day (Chang & Miles, 2000; Teow, 1996) . Most human clinical tria ls to investigate Ganoderma lucidum have included safety haematological and biochemical (including hepatic and renal) biomarkers (Chen et al., 2005; Gao et al., 2004 a, b; Gao, Dai, Chen, Ye & Zho u, 2003; Gao et al., 2005; Gao, Zhou, Chen, Dai & Ye, 2002; Gau, Lin, Lee & Wang, 1990; Kwok, Ng, Li, 69 Lam & Man, 2005; Tang et al., 2005; Wachtel -Galor et al., 2004 a, b). No pathological abnormalities were detected in these trials and there were also no moderate, serious or severe adverse events, as defined by the ICH-E2A Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting (International Conference of Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pha rmaceuticals for Human Use , 1994 a). Mild herbal sensitivity side effects were noted for some participants in these trials and included dry mouth, sore throat and nausea as the most commonly cited side effects, though vomiting, headache, diarrhoea, dizziness, insomnia and shortness of breath have also been reported. One study has been conducted for the sole purpose of evaluating the safety and tolerability of Ganoderma lucidum in healthy subjects. Wicks et al. ( 2007) conducted a double -blind randomised placebo -controlled trial with 16 participants who received 4 g of extr act of placebo daily, for ten days. Outcome measures included a questionnaire, electrocardiogram, blood chemistry panel, complete blood count, and urinalysis. No adverse effects of clinical importance, or differences between intervention and control groups , were found. There has been one report of a severe adverse event due to Ganoderma lucidum in the literature (Yuen, Ip, Ng & Lai, 2004) . A women de veloped hepatotoxicity after a month of supplementation with Ganoderma lucidum . It was suggested by the author that as the patient had taken different formulations of this mushroom previously, the adverse effects were likely due excipient ingredients. There are no known herb -drug interactions for the use of Ganoderma lucidum , though reasonable care must be taken when used in combination with agents with the same treatment aim, and therefore synergistic potential for stronger effects. Similarly, it is advised that Ganoderma lucidum not be taken with pharmaceuticals for antiplatelet or hypotensive effects. Thi s advice is cautionary, as there is no high level evidence of true treatment effects for these outcomes. There is also no evidence regarding the safety of Ganoderma lucidum in pregnant or lactating women, and therefore this is generally not recommended. 70 2.5.5 Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis Some Ganoderma lucidum products combine the mushroom extract with a second herbal medicine, Cordyceps sinensis . One of the most interesting herbal medicines, Cordyceps sinensis is a fungus that grows parasiti cally on a caterpillar. It is another renowned mushroom with broad ranging medicinal properties that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for many centuries. In a similar manner to Ganoderma lucidum, it has also b ecome increasingly utilised in W estern countries. Animal and in vitro research suggests Cordyceps sinensis might be antisenescent, anti- atherosclerotic, antioxidant, and protective against renal disease and toxicity (Bao, Wu & Zheng, 1994; Zhu, Halpern & Jones, 1998) . Cordyceps sinensis is believed to increase the potency of lucidum and independently confer further antidiabetic, antidyslipidaemic and antihypertensive benefits. There is currently no evidence that evaluates the medicinal properties of Ganoderma lucidum as Cordyceps sinensis mushroom has been found to cause beneficial reductions of blood glucose levels, improved insulin sensitivity and improved oral glucose tolerance in animal studies (Balon, Jasman & Zhu, 2002; Zhao et al. , 2002) . Lo, Tu, Lin and Lin (2004) demonstrated that the fruiting body of Cordyceps sinensis could attenuate diabetes -induced weight loss, polydipsia, in addition to decreasing serum fructosamine concentration and im proved oral glucose tolerance. The polysaccharide s CS-F30 (Kiho, Yamane, Hui, Ookubo, Usui, Ukai & Hirano, 1999) have been identified as the constituents causing hypoglyc emic activity in diabetic mice. Preliminary evidence suggests that Cordyceps sinensis also has potential to improve lipid profiles. In two studies comparing cholesterol -fed mice and controls, total cholesterol, very low -density lipoprotein cholesterol and low -density lipoprotein cholesterol were found to significantly decrease, and high -density lipoprotein cholesterol was shown to increase (Koh, Kim, Chang & Suh, 2003; Xu & Zhang, 1987) . The polysaccharide CS -F30 has been shown to lower plasma triglyceride 71 levels in mice, in addition to its hypoglycaemic properties (Kiho et al., Cordyceps sinensis prevented cholesterol deposition in mice aorta by inhibiting low - density lipoprotein oxidation by free radicals, rather than by reducing lipid levels. There has been one large randomised controlled human clinical trial (273 participants) for dyslipidaemia (Shao, You, Guo, Wang & Zhu, 1985) . Significant improvements in total cholesterol (17.5 per cent , p<0.001) and increased high - density lipoprotein (27.2 per cent , p<0.001) were reported. Unfortunately, only those participants with interim improvements cont inued to the end of the 2-month investigation period, thus neg ating the value of the results. The only study to evaluate the effect of Cordyceps sinensis on hypertension found that the mushroom could reduce mean arterial pressure in rats in a dose -depende nt manner, by directly relaxing the arterial beds (Chiou, Chang, Chou & Chen, 2000) . The authors suggest this effect was secondary to endothelium -mediated release of factor. Cordyceps sinensis has been regarded as safe and non toxic in its long application as a traditional Chinese medicine , and is also classified as a Class 1 herb for safe and regular consumption (McGuffin et al., 1997) . However, there have been few clinical trials in humans to test this assumption. Safety was evaluated in the 273 participants of the lipid study by Shao et al. (1985) . The intervention group took a standard dosage of Cordyceps sinensis for 1-2 months. Three participants out of 273 stopped taking the drug due to diarrhoea, d izziness and a skin rash, respectively. Two persons from the treatment group and two persons from the control group were found to have an increase in alanine aminotransferase and three persons had a decrease in platelet count: one from the treatment group and tw o persons in the control group. Cordyceps sinensis is actually prescribed for its renal and hepatic protective effects (Wojcikowski, Johnson & Gobe, 2004) , suggesting that the mushroom improves, rather than introduces, toxic effects. There are no kn own interactions of concern for the use of Cordyceps sinensis . As for Ganoderma lucidum , caution is recommended when taking Cordyceps sinensis in combination with other herbs or pharmaceutical 72 interventions with the same treatment aims, to avoid strong synergistic effects. There is no evidence regarding the use of Cordyceps sinensis in pregnant or lactating women and therefore this herbal medicine is not recommended for this group. 2.6 Conclusi on Cardiovascular disease is the world 's leading cause of death. The major pharmacologically modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease are elevated blood glucose, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity. Other risk factors such as family history, socio economic status and mental health impact strongly on these. In the past 25 years, the construct of the metabolic syndrome has been applied to diagnosis and management of cardiovascular risk. Although definitions vary, the metabolic syndrome essential ly represents the major pharmacologically modifiable risk factors. This might have contributed to a shift in focus from low -density lipoprotein cholesterol to the importance of other features of dyslipidaemia (high - density lipoprotein cholesterol and trigl ycerides), hypertension , and in particular, the drastic increase in type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Although evidence suggests absolute risk factor profiling is more predictive of true cardiovascular risk, the metabolic syndrome may be regarded as a risk subgroup, for which the definition might offer diagnostic and management advantages. There is no single treatment for the metabolic syndrome, or other presentations of co - existing major risk factors. Lifestyle modification involving diet and physical activity remains the most important and effective treatment for individual and multiple cardiovascular risk factors. However, most people are unable to sustain lifestyle modification as their primary treatment and, as such; the majority of those at risk o f cardiovascular disease require multiple pharmacological interventions. These treatments might not be suitable for all patients, might not achieve treatment targets or be associated with adverse effects. Evidence from animal and in vitro studies suggests that Ganoderma lucidum has properties that are potentially beneficial for three of the important components of metabolic syndrome: hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. This 73 renowned traditional Chinese mushroom has been used in Asia for over 2 ,000 years, but has recently been marketed and used for managem ent of W estern medical conditions, including cardiovascular risk factors. Ganoderma lucidum is often produced as a combination intervention with a second fungus, Cordyceps sinensis . The majority of studies performed in humans have a high potential for bias, due to design or reporting weaknesses. The safety and efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum , with or without Cordyceps sinensis , for treatment of cardiovascular risk factors has not yet been establish ed. 74 Chapter 3 : Study One Ganoderma lucidum for Type 2 Diabetes M ellitus and Metabolic Syndrome: A Randomised Controlled Trial 3.1 Introduction Chapter 3 presents the first of two studies outlined in this thesis: 'The safety and efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum for type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome '. This randomised controlled clinical trial was conducted between 2007 and 2010. Although the intervention is a traditional Chinese medicine treatment, the research diagnostic criteria and outcome measures aim to evaluate efficacy for use in a Western clinical setting. This randomised controlled trial will be outlined in three sections. The m ethod, results and discussion will be presented in Section 3.2, Section 3.3 and Section 3.4, respectively. D iscussion points relevant to the results of this trial alone will be outlined in Section 3.4. Further discussion on is sues informed by both studies reported in this thesis will be provided in Chapter 5. 3.2 Method 3.2.1 Aims The aim of the randomised controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ganoderma lucidum , with or without Cordyceps sinensis, for the treatment of hyperglycaemia and cardiovascular risk factors in persons with the metabolic syndrome. This in cluded determining the size, direction, and uncertainty of effect for each risk factor. As the metabolic syndrome has five equally important components and no validated summary value, one component was selected for the primary research question. Treatment of hyperglycaemia was chosen for the primary focus because this component has the most compelli ng evidence base for potential benefit from Ganoderma lucidum 3.2.1.1 with Cordyceps sinensis ) effective for reducing blood glucose levels in persons with metabolic syndrome ? 3.2.1.2 Secondar y Questions a) In persons with metabolic lucidum (and Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis ) effective for improving the other four diagnostic criteria of metabolic syndrome by: Reducing blood pressure ? Reducing triglycerides ? Reducing obesity ? Increasing high -density lipoprotein cholesterol ? b) Does treatment with Ganoderma lucidum (and Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis) reduce the proportion of persons in this sample who meet the diagnostic criteria of metabolic syndro me? c) In persons with Ganoderma lucidum the health -related quality of life? 3.2.1.3 Exploratory Question In person s with the metabolic Ganoderma lucidum (and Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis ) effective for improving ot her cardiovascular risk factors by: Reducing C -reactive protein levels ? Reducing total cholesterol ? Reducing low -density lipoprotein cholesterol ? Increasing apolipoprotein A ? 76 Reducing apolipoprotein B ? 3.2.1.4 Safety Question In persons with the metabolic syndrome, does treatment with Ganoderma An increased number and type of adverse events Increased out -of-range safety pathology results 3.2.2 E thical Considerations This research received ethical approval from the University of Western Sydney (UWS) and was registered with the Australasian Clinical Trials Registry (now called the Australia n and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry) and the TGA . Reference numbers from these organisations are listed in Table 3.1. Table 3.1 : Clinical trial reference numbers Approval/Registration Organisation Project reference number Human Research Ethics Committee UWS HREC 05/118 Safety Trial Registration TGA Trial Registration Australasian Clinical Trial Registry ACTRN012606000485538 To uphold principles of integrity, respect, beneficence and justice, this research was conducted in accordance with: The International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences & World Health O rganization, 2002) . The trial protocol is based on the guidelines in this publication. 77 The Australian National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Research Involving Humans (National Health and Medical Research Council , 1999).

As a result of this trial there might be benefit to the community and potentia l benefit to individuals. As adverse effects are rare and mild, the benefit -risk relationship was expected to favour benefit for the participant. It was intended that if one of the interventions was found to be more effective at the end of the trial , it wo uld be offered to participants allocated to the placebo group. 78 3.2.3 Participants and Setting The study popul ation were adults over 18 years who had metabolic syndrome. For the aims of this study, it was desirable that the participant group was relatively homogenous with regard to their health profile s and disease risk factor presentation s to improve the internal validity of the results. Howev er, a broad representation of Australian adults , according to demographic and social factors , was sought to allow generalisab ility of the study findings to the community. Participants of each gender, a wide range of ages, ethnic and social backgrounds were represented in this study. A range of recruitments strategies were employed (see Section 3.2.6.1). Participants were from all regions of Sydney ; however the n orth, central and greater Western Sydney regions were best represented. All participants attended appointments at the Cardiac Health Institute (CHI) , Sydney, Australia. 3.2.3.1 Participant Inclusion C riteria To participate in this study, persons had to: Be at least 18 years of age Be able to provide informed consent in English Have high fasting seru m glucose 6.1 mmol/L Meet the NCEP -ATP III diagnostic criteria for for metabolic syndrome. Therefore, in addition to the high fasting glucose participants must have had at least two of the following: Waist circumference > 102 cm (m en)/88 cm (women) Fasting serum triglycerides 1.7 -ATP III (Hunt, Resen dez, Williams, Haffner & Stern, 2004) is widely used for metabolic syndrome diagnostic criteria in Australia and is considered valid and appropriate for metabolic syndrome research. To meet these criteria for metabolic syndrome, persons must have three of the five components of the syndrome ( high blood glucose, increased waist circumference, high triglycerides, 79 reduced high -density lipoprotein cholesterol and high blood pressure). For enrolment in this trial participants had high blood glucose and therefore only two of the remaining four crite ria were required. Participants were able to continue taking any medication that lowered blood sugar, bloo d pressure and cholesterol or was prescribed for weight loss, as long as dosages remained stable for the duration of the trial. 3.2.3.2 Participant E xclusion C riteria Participants were excluded from the trial if they: Had a known allergy to mushrooms Had taken Ganoderma lucidum or Cordyceps sinensis in the past 12 months Were pregnant or breastfeeding Had any medical or social condition or circumstan ce that might prevent completion or compliance with the requirements of this trial Had any significant active medical or psychiatric condition, whic h the medical practitioner deemed made the person unsuitable for involvement in this trial e.g. , malignancy, heart disease Had significant renal impairment (serum creatinine >160mmol/L) Had active hepato -biliary conditions including hepatitis (A, B or C) or significant hepatic impairment. In the event of abnormal serum ALT (alanine aminotransferase) or AST (aspartate aminotransferase), further consultation, with consent, took place between the principal investigator with the trial physician, and when necessary other relevant clinicians (e.g., the participant 's general practitioner, hepatologist) to de termine suitability for enrolment Had major sur gery in the past month or would have surgery during the trial Had an organ transplant Had a history of abnormal haemorrhaging or had taken an anticoagulant in the last 3 months Were using insulin treatment or have done so in the past 3 months 80 Had any other active medical condition which might significantly interfere with glucose levels, such as systemic infection (e.g. , tuberculosis, hepatitis, chronic s inusitis or any chronic sepsis) Had a recent history (3 months) of hypoglycaemic events This study was based on evidence that has suggested both interventions might reduce blood sugar levels. Therefore, persons with unstable glycaemic levels, or those prone to hypoglycaemic episodes, were excluded from the study . This included those taking insulin. Insulin treatment was also an exclusion criterion because of the high treatment response and instability of glucose levels. Other conditions deemed likely to significantly affect glucose levels were also exclusions to enrolment in this trial. Both mushrooms are thought to have cardiovascular benefit by way of their anticoagulant properties , hence persons on anticoagulant medication were also excluded from this study. Although previous trials support the safety of Ganoderma lucidum and Cordyceps sinensis , any herbal medicine may cause impairment of liver or kidney function . However, persons with the metabolic syndr ome are also likely to have non alcoholic fatty liver disease (Clark, 2006; Marchesini et al., 2001) . The above exclusion criterion for hepato -biliary disease is an amendment to an original exclusion criterion that was too restrictive for a metabolic syndrome cohort ( see Appendix 7 for full details ). 3.2.3.3 Privacy and Data M anagement In accordance with e thical guidelines, the anonymity, confidentiality an d privacy of participants was , and will continue to, be protected. All publication material will refer to general trial results as aggregate data and no individual participant names or identifying informa tion have been, or will be, released. During the clinical trial, the source data records were kept in the office of the principal investigator at the CHI. After data collection, these were relocated to a secure cabinet in the principal investigator 's offic e at UWS . Electronic data is password protected by the principal investigator. Data will be kept for a minimum of 15 years; after 5 years they will be 81 archived by Records and Archives Management Service of UWS as per the university's current policy. Data m anagement procedures for this trial may need to change in accordance with updates to UWS privacy and confidentiality and data management, policies. 3.2.4 Interventions 3.2.4.1 C omposition of Intervention s Participants took one of three interventions in this clinical trial: Ganoderma lucidum, Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis or placebo. The herbal interventions were provided by Concord International Party Limited (later Allife Party Limited), Sydney Australia. The Ganoderm a lucidum component of the intervention contained both mushroom and spore extract. The compositions of these interventions are detailed in Table 3.2. Although the weight for Intervention 2 is higher than that of Intervention 1, the difference is due to the weight of the excipient, compared to the Cordyceps sinensis addition. The amounts of Ganoderma lucidum extract and spore are the same for Interventions 1 and 2. Each intervention was manufactured as oral capsules. 82 Table 3.2 : Inter vention composition pe r capsule Capsule fill weight Primary components Kg/per cent per batch Mg per capsule Intervention 1 Ganoderma lucidum 460 mg \u00b17.5 per cent * 3.05/ 20 92 Excipient 2.77/ 19 87 Total = 15 kg 460 mg \u00b17.5 per cent Intervention 2 Ganoderma lucidum with 4.12/ 24 125 Excipient 0.52/ 3 16 Total = 17 kg 516 mg \u00b17.5 per cent Intervention 3 Placebo 454 mg \u00b1 7.5 per cent Excipient of ascorbic acid, carob flour and caramel colour Approx 15 kg 454 mg \u00b17.5 per cent Total = 15 kg 454 mg \u00b17.5 per cent All participants took eight capsules per day ( four in the morning and four at night), orally and with food, for a period of 16 weeks duration .

All three interventions, Ganoderma lucidum, Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis and placebo were manufactured by GMP Pharmaceuticals, Sydney. The t hree interventions were prepared in identical capsules and dispensed in identical bottles. Labelling was conducted by the Centre for Complementary Medicine Research (CompleMED) as per TGA requirements. The label used for all bottles of medication is shown in Figure 3.1. Allife Party, Ltd. was responsible for delivering the product to CompleMED, where an external research officer labelled the containers with participant project numbers as per the randomisation strategy. At that time, the full treatment cours e (4 bottles) was labelled for each participant. 84 The medications were delivered to the CHI, Sydney, where the interventions were stored in a locked location according to the storage conditions specified by the sponsor.

Study Design 3.2.5.1 Clinical T rial Stages This study was conducted as a multip le-blinded, randomised, placebo -controlled, parallel design clinical trial. Figure 3.2 outlines the main stages of the trial. 86 Figure 3.2 : Schematic trial protocol Participant Recruitment Screening/Baseline measures Informed Consent Enrolment/Randomisation GROUP 1 Ganoderma lucidum GROUP 2 Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis GROUP 3 Placebo Health Outcome Measurements (Weeks 8 and 16) Follow -up Measurements (Week 24) Compliance/Adverse Event Check (Phone Week 1) Data Analysis and Write -up (Followed by release of randomisation strategy) Outcome health measurements (Weeks 8, 16) Compliance/Adverse Event Check (Week 4 and 12) 87 3.2.5.2 Strategies to M inimise Bias Randomisation Once suitability had been confirmed, each participant was formally enrolled into the study and given the next available participant project number. The project number had been previously allocated to one of the three trial arms according to a standard computerised randomisation strategy, with blocking only to create equal group numbers. The randomised treatme nt sequences were generated by Microsoft Excel 2003. The data of any participant w ho withdrew from the trial was handled according to intention -to-treat strategies of data analysis, according to the group to which they were originally randomised. Allocation concealment The randomised allocation sequence code was generated by a single research officer at the Centre for Complementary Medicine Research. The process was conducted completely external ly was and unknown to the research team members listed in the clinical trial protocol. The allocation sequence was stored by that research offi cer in two separate locked and protected locations. The allocation sequence was disclosed to only one other person, who was responsible for labelling the preprepared participant project numbered medication containers according to the sequence. The randomisation sequence was released to researchers only upon completion of data analysis. Blinding All medication bottles were identical, with exception of the participant proje ct number. The participants, therapists, asse ssors and data analysts had no knowledge of participant group allocations for the duration of the trial. There was no need for comparisons between intervention capsules either by the researchers or the participants. However, the interventions of Ganoderma lucidum, Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis and placebo were indistinguishable in colour, smell, taste, size and weight. All participants were involved with identical stages and 88 activities of the clinical trial. If a serious adverse event required t hat blinding had to be brok en, this only occurred for the affected individual and they were automatically withdrawn from the study due to the loss of allocation concealment. This was performed by the external randomisation assistant, such that the sequence remained unknown to the research team. 3.2.6 Clinical P rotocol 3.2.6.1 Participant R ecruitment Recruitment strategies included media release s through televis ion, radio and print sources organised by the media department of UWS. Recruitment was also enco uraged by approaching general practitioners through the Divisions of General Practice, mail -outs to members of Diabetes Australia and newspaper advertisements. Interested persons were invited to contact the principal investigator on the trial phone number. Initial screening took place over the phone and if the interested person was suitable, a screening appointment was made and an information package was mailed to him/her. The information package contained a cover letter, participant information sheet, part icipant quick reminder form, appointment time reminder card and map. Information packs for health professionals were also available. Due to privacy restrictions, participant information was not given to general practitioners or health professionals, unles s requested by the participant. 3.2.6.2 Informed C onsent The purpose of the screening appointment was to determine eligibility for trial enrolment. Although potential participants were not yet enrolled, informed consent was required for screening assessme nts. To avoid two consent processes, full informed consent was obtained for screening and enrolment at the same time. Informed consent involved detailed provision , at the appropriate level of comprehension for each person, information about the purpose, m ethods, demands, risks, inconveniences, discomforts, benefits and possible outcomes of the research. Each person exercised voluntary choice to participate, without coercion or 89 inducement. It was made clear that each person could withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason and that there would be no impact on relationships with the research team or their ongoing health management. Participants could receive their outcome me asure results at any time. I t was also made clear that his or her allocated intervention had to remain blinded until the trial analysis and results were complete. The potential participant and a witness signed two informed consent forms: one for the participant to keep, in addition to the information sheet, and one for the investiga tor. The informed consent form and participant information sheet are provided as Appendi ces 5 and 6. 3.2.6.3 Participant T reatment Participants met with the principal investigator or research assistant on a monthly basis. Participants were called the day before to remind them of the ir appointment. All pathology samples were for fasting status, and therefore all appointments were made during the morning. The importance of returning all unused medications w as emphas ised and the survey include d a recall question 'how many doses do you think you missed? ' All returned doses w ere counted and recorded . Participants were able to take all of their existing medications, including hypoglycaemic, hypotensive, and hypolipidaemic agents, as long as the med ication dosages and administration methods remained consistent and stable for the 24 week duration of the trial. Besides taking the intervention daily and participating in the appointments, ther e were no other requirements for the participants. Although a ll possible support was offered during the trial, ther e was no financial or other non -health benefit to participants, as per the requirements of the UWS Human Research Ethics Committee. Participant s were entitled to transport re imbursement for their expens es travelling to, and from, the CHI. Participants could withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. Further, this might be recommended by the research team in the event of adverse effects. The following protocol was followed in the event of withdrawal: 90 Withdrawal, and the reasons or associated information, were documented in the source data forms. The participant was requested to return all remaining trial medication. This was documented in the unused medications log. The data of the withdra wing participant continued to be used in the analyses based on intention -to-treat principles . The participant was not replaced in the clinical trial. There was no follow -up for participants who withdrew, with the exception of ongoing involvement by the res earch team for participants requiring adverse event management. After trial completion, all participants were sent information regarding which intervention he or she had been taking, and were informed of the overall clinical trial results. 3.2.7. Evaluat ion of Efficacy 3.2.7.1 Primary Q Cordyceps sinensis ) effective for reducing blood glucose levels in persons with the metabolic syndrome ?' the outcome measures were: Fasting blood glucose HbA 1c The f asting blood glucose test measures blood glucose levels at the point in time at which the sample was taken, while the HbA 1c test reflects blood glucose levels over the previous 3 -month period. 91 3.2.7.2 Secondary Questions a) For the question 'In persons with metabolic syndrome, is Ganoderma lucidum (and Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis ) effective improving the other four diagnostic criteria of metabolic syndrome? ' the outcome measures were: For reducing blood pressure : o Systolic blood pressure o Diastolic blood pressure o Mean arterial blood pressure For r educing triglycerides : o Triglycerides For reducing obesity: o Waist circumference o Hip circumference o BMI For i ncreasing high -density lipoprotein : o lipoprotein (and Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis) reduce the proportion of persons in this sample who meet the diagnostic criteria for the metabolic syndrome? ' diagnostic frequencies were recorded and analysed. c) For the question 'In persons with metabolic syndrome, Ganoderma lucidum (and Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis ) effective for improving health - related quality of life? ' the out come measure was the Short Form -36: Standard Version 2 , Australian language. 92 3.2.7.3 Exploratory Question For the lucidum with improving other cardiovascular risk factors? the outcome measures were: Reducing C -reactive protein: o High sensitivity C -reactive protein Reducing total cholesterol: o Total cholesterol Reducing low -density lipoprotein cholesterol : o Low-density lipoprotein Apolipoprotein A Reducing apolipoprotein B: o Apolipoprotein B The timing for the collection of each outcome measure throughout the clinical trial is outlined in Table 3. 5. As a more expensive, but exploratory outcome, a polipoproteins A and B were only measured at baseline (Week 0) and the end of the intervention period (Week 16). All other outcomes were additionally measured at the intervention period midpoint (Week 8) and at follow -up (Week 24). 93 Table 3. 5: Timing of outcome measures Outcome Measure Week 0 Week 4 Week 8 Week 12 Week 16 Week 24 Primary Fast.

Apo A Apo B 3.2.7.4 Data Collection P rotocols Pathology tests All blood samples were collected at the CHI by qualified staff according to the Institute 's occupational, health, safety and risk protocols. These protocols also met the requirements of the UWS Biosafety and Radiation Safety G uidelines. Samples were labelled and centrifuged at the CHI prior to daily collection by the pathology courier. Patholog y samples were analysed by, and according to the protocols of, the Pathology Department of the Sydney Adventist Hospital. Results were forwarded to the principal investigator. Blood pressure The following blood pressure measurement protocol was based on the 2004 recommendations of the Heart Foundation (Heart Foundation, 2004) . Each participant will be seated for 10 minutes in the consultation room pri or to testing . 94 Measurement will be taken with an aneroid (mercury no longer available) sphygmomanometer a nd stethoscope . Use only the clinical trial equipment for blood pressure measurement . The bladder will be 80 per cent length and 40 per cent width of the mid-upper arm circumference. The cuffs used in this trial have indicators on the equipment to determin e appropriateness of size. Three bladder sizes are available: normal adu lt, small adult and large adult . Either arm can be used but must be free of constricting clothing so that the cuff can be wrapped around t he upper arm without impediment . All measurements wil l be taken in a seated position . Ensure the cuff is at heart level by supporting the arm whatever the position of the patient. The centre of the bladder will be placed over the brachial a rtery and 2 cm above elbow bend . The cuff should be i nflated until sound disappears and to 30 mm Hg above the usual blood pressure, a nd then deflated at a rate of 2 -3 mmHg per second or less. Systolic pressure will be noted when the first sound returns (requires two consistent consecutive sounds), to the nearest 2 mm, and diastolic pressure at Phase V Korotkoff (disappearance of sound). Stage IV for diastolic measurement (muffled sound) will o nly be used if sound continues. Wait a minimum of 30 seconds before repeat ing the process in the same arm . Average the readings. If the first two readings differ by more than 10 mmHg systolic or 6 mmHg diastolic, or if you have other reason to question the results, repeat process every 5 minutes until consecutive readings do not differ by these amounts. Body size The fo llowing protocol was used to measure w aist circumference : This measurement will be ta ken without, or under, clothing . Palpate the lowest anterior rib point and the anterio r superior iliac spine . Mark the skin at the midpoint between these two points, on b oth right and left sides. Thes e marks represent the waistline . 95 Place the tape measure around the waist, ensuring the full circumference is horizontally level with the two waistline marks . Ask the participant to inhale and exhale. The measurement is taken on completion of the exhalation . Measure to the closest 0.5 cm. The following protocol was us ed to measure hip circumference: This measurement will be taken without, or un der, clothing . Locate the anterior superior iliac spine as the initial hip reference point . From there, move the tape measure to a horizontal level position that represents the widest (most protruding) measurement. For some persons that will be determined by abdominal fat, but for most this will be at the widest buttock location . The following prot ocol was used to measure height: Each consulting room has a secur ed wall height measuring device . Ask the participant to stand, such that the device is midway above their head . Ask the participant to touch heels, buttocks, shou lders and head against the wall. Straighten the head (tilting head forward) as far as possible whilst still keeping all points in contact with the wall . Lower the measuring device to place flatly on top of h ead and measure to within 0.5cm . This may differ to the partici pant's usual reported height due to the measuring technique used an d this may need to be explained . The following protocol was used to measure body weight: Use the calibrated clinical t rial weight scales only . Ask participant to remove shoes, bags, keys, phones and any other heavy items in pockets or on clothes . 96 Participants may leave clothes on . Turn scales on and wait until display is ready . Ask participant to stand on scales . Check feet a re entirely on measurement area . Wait until weight stabilises (di splay indicates final weight) and record to one decimal point . Scales will turn off themselves . See manual for further information . BMI may be calculated by dividing weight (measured to within 0.1 kg) by height (mea sured to within 0.5 cm) squared. Health -related quality of life A licence was purchased for unlimited use of the SF -36 Version 2 (Australian) for the duration of the clinical trial. This questionnaire was self -administered by participants, taking approximately 15 minutes. Results were generated by SF -36 scoring softwar e. The following protocol for the tool administration was based on recommendations in the SF -36 manual (Ware, Kosinski & Gandek, 2000) . Always give the SF -36 at the start of the data collection appointment. Give basic instructions to the participant. For example, 'The questionnaire is simple to fill out. Be sure to read the instructions on the top of the first page (point to them). Remember, this is not a test and there are no right or wrong answers. Choose the response that best represents the way you fee l. I will quickly review the questionnaire when you are done to make sure that all the items have been completed. You should answer these questions by yourself. Spouses, or other family members, or visitors, should not assist you in completing the question naire. Please fill out the questionnaire now. I will be nearby in case you want to ask me any questions. Return the questionnaire t o me when you have completed it. ' Provide a firm writing surface and a number two pencil. When the participant is finished, c heck questionnaire for completeness. 97 If not complete, ask whether they had any diffic ulty and record reasons for noncompletion. Explain why it is important that they answer all questions. You may read and repeat a question verbatim but cannot interpret or explain a question. You may also suggest they answer a question based on what they think the question means. For example, 'I know that it might be hard for you to think this way but which of these categories most closely expresses what you are thinking or feeling? ' Thank the participant and remind that they will do this again on the next visit. If the participant wants to know what the answers mean, explain that you are not trained in scoring for reasons to prevent bias. 3.2.8 Evaluation of Safety 3.2.8.1 Safety Q uestion During the clinical trial, the safety question asked 'In persons with metabolic syndrome, does treatment with Ganoderma ' Increased number and type of adverse events Increased out -of-range safety pathology results 3.2.8.2 Adverse E vents There are no known significant adverse events for Ganoderma lucidum and Cordyceps sinensis . As with most herbal medicines, some mild adverse events might be experienced by some partic ipants. These include dry mouth, sore throat, skin rash, nausea, dizziness, shortness of breath and headache. All participants had a screening consultation with the tria l physician prior to enrolment in the trial. A complete medical history was obtained, physical examination conducted and a screening pathology sample taken. The screening process aimed to find any previously unknown cause for exclusion, such that participants could be assumed to have a minimal risk of adverse events. 98 During info rmed consen t and by way of the information s heet, participants were introduced to the adverse events that might be encountered. During the trial, participants were asked about adverse events as part of the data collection and safety monitoring process. To avoid bias from leading open -ended questions, participants were asked 'How have you felt since I saw you last? Is there anything new that you wish to discuss? ' Participants could also contact the principal investigator at any time on the trial hotline to discuss any concerns or report adverse events. Table 3.6 shows that participants were asked about general health and adverse events at every clinical or phone appointment. Table 3.6 : Timing of safety measures Outcome measure Week 0 Week 1 Week 4 Week 8 Week 12 Week 16 Week 24 Adverse event questioning Safety pathology measures Adverse event definitions This trial adhered to adverse event definitions, principles and guidelines from the ICH Note for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95) (Therap eutic Goods Administration , 2000) and ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline \u2014Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting E2A (International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pha rmaceuticals for Human Use , 1994) and the CIOMS report Management of Safety Information from Clinical Trials (CIOMS Working Group VI, 2005) . This inc ludes the following definitions: Adverse Event : An adverse e vent is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse e vent can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, sy mptom or disease temporally 99 associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. Mild Adverse Event : The event causes minimal discomfort and does not significantly interfere with the patient 's normal activities. Moderate Adverse Event : The event is sufficiently uncomfortable to cause some impairment to the patient 's normal activities. Severe Adverse Event : The event is incapacitating and prevents the patient from participating in normal activi ties. Serious Adverse Event : A serious adverse e vent is any untoward medic al occurrence that at any dose: Results in death Is life -threatening (at the time) Requires i npatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation Results in persist ent or significant disability/ incapacity Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Severe refers to the severity of the event at the time, as opposed to the seriousness of the patient 's event outcome ; for example, a headache might be severe and disabling but not serious. A mild heart attack, though not disabling at the time , has more serious health consequences. Adverse event management When an adverse event was noted by a participant or member of the research team, the principal investigator consulted with the participant, the trial physician and/or other members of the research team. Possible outcomes included changes to enrolment status, medical advice and/or communication with the general practitioner or other health professionals, and coordination of eme rgency medical attention as 100 required and appropriate. If an adverse event was present when the clinical trial was terminated, its course would be followed until case management was organised, the event subsided or the investigator deemed it to be unrelated to the trial. The following were possible individu al participant management plans: Make no changes and review in a timely period Make no changes and contact general practitioner De-challenge: reduce dosage for 1 week and review (50 per cent or 100 per cent reduction) followed by re -challenge or withdrawal De-challenge and contact general practitioner, followed by re -challenge or withdrawal There are no clear Australian protocols or TGA requirements regarding determination of causality. The CIOMS VI Working Group recommends the use of a yes/n o binary system based on whether there is 'reasonable possibility ' or 'no reasonable possibility ' that an adverse event has been caused by a clinical trial intervention (CIOMS Working Group VI, 2005) . Adverse event reporting All adverse events were recorded in individual participant records and an adverse event log. In addition, where possible, a di agnosis, rather than signs and symptoms, was recorded. The adverse event log was available on request by any monitoring groups, including the UWS HREC. In the event of concern s regarding safety issues from monitoring, the results from another new study or any other reason to perceive a change to the benefit -risk ratio, these were to be reported to the sponsor and the HREC. For any serious or unexpected adverse reactions the ADRAC blue card (Report of Suspected Adverse Reaction to Drugs and Vaccines) was com pleted on behalf of the trial sponsor for their submission to the TGA (http://www.tga.gov.au/adr/bluecard.pdf ). The principal investigator notified the HREC of this process. The TGA wa s not notified if an event was: a) not serious, b ) expected , c) not caus ed by the drug. Any other special situations were also reported to the sponsor, such as onset of pregnancy during the trial. For serious adverse 101 events, the sponsor reported to the TGA with a blue card w ithin 15 calendar days (if life-threatening an initia l report was required within 7 d ays and followed up with a complete report in 15 days). 3.2.8.3 Pathology Measures of Safety Pathology measures to evaluate safety were full blood count s (FBC) and multiple biochemical analyse s (MBA). Table 3.7 lists the outcome measures included in the FBC and MBA that evaluate safety. Reference ranges vary for gender and age and are therefore not included here. Each pathology result was compared against the appropriate reference range for the participant. 102 Tabl e 3.7: Pathology measures of safety Multiple biochemical analysis (MBA) Full blood count (FBC) Sodium Haemoglobin Potassium Haematocrit Chloride Red cells Bicarbonate MCH (mean cell haemoglobin) Urea MCHC (mean cell haem. concentration) Creatinine MCV (mean cell volume) Urate Calcium White Cell Differential Count Adj. c alcium (adjusted calcium) Neutrophils Phosphate Lymphocytes morphology) ALT aminotransferase) 3.2.8.4 Stopping R ules Individual participants could withdraw from the trial at any time, for any reason. Discontinuation was re commended by the research team in the event of adverse effects from medication that might alter the benefit -risk relationship for that participan t. To monitor the overall trial risk -benefit status, the research team (consisting of the principal investigator, clinical p harmacologist and cardiologist/ trial physician) monitored evidence for harm and safety. A meeting could be called at any 103 time by any member of the research team in the event of risk concerns. The research team could stop the trial if it became possible that the risks might outweigh the benefit s for the participants as a group. With the exception of potential risk, there was no reason t o stop the trial prematurely. No interim analyses for efficacy were conducted and therefore the trial could not be stopped due to positive or negative interim findings. 3.2.9. Statistical Analysis 3.2.9.1 Power A nalysis The primary research question aske Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis ) is effective for reducing blood glucose levels in persons with the metabolic syndrome. There were two outcomes that measure blood glucose levels in this study: fasting blood glucos e and HbA 1c. Fasting blood glucose For a three -arm trial a prospective sample size calculation by Friedman 's formula (Friedman, Furberg & DeMets, 1998) estimated that a sample size of 39 participants would have 90 per cent power to detect a difference of 1.5 mmol/L (5 per cent significance level, SD 1 mmol/L), which represented a 20 per cent improvement, from a baseline measure of 7.5 mmol/L. This estimate allowed for a total noncompliance/ withdrawal rate of 20 per cent . The clinical effect is the magnitude and direction of the change attributed to the intervention in a clinical trial. The minimal important difference is the smallest worthwhile clinical effect required for that intervention to be used in a real clinical setting. The minimal important clinical difference was determined a priori as a 1.5 mmol/L decrease in fasting plasma glucose. This was chosen pragmatically by a group of medical practitioners, as a likely minimal amount required for clinical application as a primary treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. 104 HbA1c For a three -arm trial a prospective sample size calculation by Friedman 's formula estimated that a sample size of 168 participants would have 90 per cent power to detect a difference of 1 per cent HbA1c (5 per cent significance level, SD 1.4 per cent HbA1c), which represents a 12 per cent improvement from a baseline measure of 8 per cent HbA1 c. This e stimate allowed for a total non compliance/ withdrawal rate of 20 per cent . It was determined a prior i that the minimal important difference for Ganoderma lucidum to be used as treatment in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome was a 1 per cent decrease in HbA1c. This was also a pragmatic choice by medical practitioners as the minim um clinical improvement required to justify use as a primary treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus . As the sample sizes varied according to the outcome measure, the larger value was used to determine the sample size for this trial, resulting in 56 partic ipants per group, or a total of 168 participants. 3.2.9.2 Strategy for Analysis Data was analysed using SPSS (Statistical Program for the Social Sciences Version 10). There were no interim analyses. The data of all partic ipants who withdraw or were non compliant with the study were handled on an intention -to-treat basis, and therefore all participants were analysed according to the group to which they were randomised. Any deviations from randomisation, missing data and withdrawals were fully reported for t his purpose . For intention -to-treat analysi s, missing data was imputed with the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. For primary outcomes, a sensitivity analysis was used to compare these results with those obtaine d using complete case analyses. To evaluate the effectiveness of Ganoderma lucidum (and Cordyceps sinensis ) against placebo, differences in continuous primary variables between groups were evaluated using a repeated measures linear regression approach to analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) with planned comparisons. The covariate was baseline 105 scores , and efficacy was analysed at 8, 16 and 24 weeks. The primary variables for analysis were fasting blood glucose and HbA1 c. Secondary analyses were conducted for the other four criteria of metabol ic syndrome and health -related quality of life. A treatment effect size was calculated for each time point, and if statistically significant (at the 0.05 level of significance), the number needed to treat (NNT) was also calculated. Any other analyses were performed using appropriate statistical analyses , such as Mann -Whitney U tests to compare differences between groups for categorical variables. As the study was under powered for inferential testing of safety variables, these were evaluated with descriptiv e methods. 3.2.10 Publication Policy This clinical trial was a collaborative venture between three parties: the UWS Centre for Complementary Medicine Research (CompleMED), Allife Party Ltd. (Previously named Concord International Trading Party Ltd. ) and the CHI (CHI). A research agreement was signed by the three organisations to ensure research conduct and publications adhered to the ethical principles outlined in Section 3.2.2. Clinical trial results will be submitted for publication according to CONSORT guidelines, and irrespective of the effect size and direction of results. The protocol of this clinical trial was registered with the Australasian Clinical Trials Registry, toward this commitment. 3.3 Results 3.3.1 Introduction This section provides the results of the randomised clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in persons with metabolic syndrome. The first section , Participants (3.3.2) , outlines the progression of the participants through the 6 month s of the trial , including reasons for withdrawal, effectiveness of blinding, and compliance with taking the intervention. Section 3.3.3 presents the baseline characteristics of participants for 106 demographic features, self -reported cardiovascular health, cardiovascular outcomes and health -related quality of life. This precedes the analysis of efficacy (Section 3.3.4) of Ganoderma lucidum , which compares the intervention groups with the control group for the primary outcomes, se condary outcomes and exploratory outcomes . Results pertaining to medication safety are presented in Section 3.3.5. Intervention group data in tables are ordered Ganoderma lucidum , then placebo and then Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis , due to the blinded analysis of these groups numbered 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 3.3.2 Participants 3.3.2.1Participant Progression There were more than 1,000 initial participant screenings by phone and e-mail. Many of the individuals who enquired about the study lived significant distances from the trial centre or were seeking weight loss interventions only. From these initial enquiries , 106 persons were deemed suitable for in person screening for inclusion in the clinical t rial. Of these, 84 met the inclusion criteria to be enrolled and subsequently randomised into one of three groups: Ganoderma lucidum, Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis or placebo. The progression of participants in the three intervention groups over the 6 months of the trial is presented in Figure 3. The reasons for withdrawal are presented in Table 3. 8. 107 Figure 3.3 : Participant flow diagram *FPG is fasting plasma glucose; MS is metabolic insulin ) Week 8 (n=26) Withdrawal (n=1, required insulin) Week 8 (n =28) Withdrawal (n=1, thyroid surgery ) Week 16 (n=27) Withdrawal (n=1, breast cancer) Week 24 (n=25) Week 24 (n=1, required insulin) (n=1, high FPG) Week 16 (n= 24) Week 24 (n=24) Total completed N=75 22 participants were not randomised because of: current use of w arfarin (n=1) ; not having high FPG ( n=14); not having MS (n=3) ; not having both h igh FPG and MS (n=4)* Baseline (n =27) Week 16 (n=25) Withdrawal (n=1, infection) 108 Table 3.8 : Reasons for withdrawal Week of withdrawal Allocated group Reason for withdrawal Baseline Placebo General practitioner prescribed insulin to manage hyperglycaemia Week 1 Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis General practitioner prescribed insulin to manage hyperglycaemia Week 1 Ganoderma lucidum Participant was concerned about erratic blood glucose levels and other illness priorities and changed his/her mind Week 4 Placebo Participant required thyroidectomy after enlarged thyroid was detected during screen ing by trial physician Week 4 Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis Participant was concerned that high blood glucose levels might be caused by trial medication Week 12 Placebo Participant was diagnosed with breast cancer* Week 12 Ganoderma lucidum Participant developed urinary tract infection requiring antibiotics and did not want to take so many tablets Week 16 Placebo Participant was not interested in final follow -up appointment *Reported to TGA for serious adverse events. 3.3.2.2 Withdrawals Nine persons withdrew from the clinical trial, which is a total attrition rate of 11 per cent. Two participants dropped out of the Ganoderma lucidum group, three participants dropped out of the Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis group and four participants were lost from the placebo group. The rates of withdrawal were similar for the three groups. The most common reason for withdrawal was the necessity for hyperglycaemia to be treated with insulin therapy, which was an exclusion criterion for trial enrolment. The two most serious adverse events of stroke and breast cancer were reported to the TGA , as per the clinical trial protocol. No adverse event was attributed to the intervention as determined by the trial physicians and medi cal personnel external to the trial. 109 3.3.2.3 Blinding Participants were asked what medication they thought they were taking during the clinical trial. In Table 3.8 the number of correct answers is compared to the total number of incorrect or inconclusive answers reported at the halfway ( Week 8) and endpoint (Week 16) of the intervention period. There were 38 total correct answers compared to 115 incorrect answers, which is a ratio of 1:3. That is, at these key time points, f or every one participant who guessed their group correctly, three participants could not.

He did not attend postintervention follow -up at Week 24. 110 Compliance was also determined by number of missed doses of medication. During the trial each participant took a minimum of 112 doses (896 capsules). The number of missed doses, as self -reported by participants, was similar for the three groups (see Table 3. 10).

The age of the participants ranged from 34 to 86 years. Forty (48 per cent ) of the participants were born in countries other than Australia, but English was the main language spoken by the majority of participants (87 per cent ). Vocational ski lls training was the most common highest -achieved level of education (48 per cent ) and 27 persons (35 per cent) had undergraduate or postgraduate qualifications. Forty participants (48 per cent) held either full -time or part -time employment whilst 44 participants (52 per cent) were home carers, retired, unemployed or unable to work. The majority of those in the trial were not carers of under age children (82 per cent ) or the primary carer of an adult (92 per cent ). The baseline demographic characteristics re sults are presented in Table 3. 11. 111 Table 3.1 1: Demographic characteristics at baseline Demographic characteristics Ganoderma 60.8 (\u00b1 10.4) F (2, 81)=1.12, p=0.33 Sex, n (per cent) Male 13 (48) 17 (57) 14 (52) \u00b2 (2)=0.42, p=0.81 Female 14 (52) 13 (43) 13 (48) Country of birth , n (per cent) Australia 15 (56) 15 (50 ) 14 (52) \u00b2 (2)=0.18, p=0.91 Other than Australia 12 (44) 15 (50) 13 (48) Language , n (per cent) English 24 (89) 24 (80) 25 (93) Fisher 's exact, p=0.37 Other than English 3 (11) 6 (20) 2 (7) Education , n (per cent) Postgraduate 5 (19) 4 (13 ) 3 (11 ) Fisher 's exact, p=0.92 Undergraduate 7 (26) 5 (17 ) 5 (19 ) School 4 (15 ) 5 (17 ) 6 (22 ) Skills Training 11 (41 ) 16 (53 ) 13 (48 ) Employment , n (per cent) Full-time 8 (30 ) 9 (30 ) 9 (30 ) Fisher 's exact, p=0.96 Part-time 5 (19 ) 4 (13 ) 5 (19 ) Retired 10 (37 ) 9 (30 ) 10 (37 ) Unemployed 1 (4) 2 (7) 0 (0) Unable to work 2 (7) 2 (7) 2 (7) Home carer 1 (4) 4 (13 ) 1 (4) Carer of children under 18 years , n (per cent) Yes 4 (15 ) 7 (23 ) 4 (15 ) Fisher 's exact, p=0.64 No 23 (85 ) 23 (77 ) 23 (85 ) 112 Primary carer , n (per cent) Yes 4 (15 ) 2 (7) 1 (4) Fisher 's exact, p=0.38 No 23 (85 ) 28 (93 ) 26 (96 ) To examine differences in the demographic b ackground of the participants, C hi- squared goodness of fit and Fisher 's exact tests were used. P -values for these comparisons are presented in Table 3.10. The participants in the three groups were not significantly different from each other in terms of their age, sex, country of birth, language, level of educatio n, employmen t or carer status. 3.3.3.2 Cardiovascular Health Characteristics The results for baseline self -reported cardiovascular health characteristics are provided in Table 3. 12. Because the participants had to meet the diagnostic definitions of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus to be enrolled in the trial, the totals for these criteria are 100 per cent for each group. The average duration for having type 2 diabetes was 6.9 years. Twenty percent of participants were receiving diabetes treatment with oral hypoglycaemic medication. Thirty -four participants (40 per cent ) had smoked at some time in their life , and nine of those were also current smokers. Fifty -five persons (65 per cent ) enrolled in the trial believed they had hypertension though more than these (71 per cent ) were currently on antihypertensive medication to treat or prevent this condition. Having high cholesterol was self -reported by 60 percent of participants, and 45 percent said they we re currently taking cholesterol - lowering medicat ion. Eleven participants reported a history of heart attack and two participants had experienced a stroke. None of the participants had ever h ad lower limb arterial disease. 113 Table 3. 12: Self-reported cardiovascular health at baseline Self-reported cardiovascular health characteristics (per p-value of diabetes (years, SD) 6.8 (\u00b1 5.0) 6.4 (\u00b1 5.3) 7.5 (\u00b1 6.3) F (2, 81) =0.28, p=0.75 Take diabetes medication 22 (81 ) 21 (70 ) 18 (67 ) \u00b2 (2)=1.65, p=0.44 Never smoked 14 (52 ) 12 (40 ) 15 (56 ) Fisher 's exact, p=0.78 Have smoked 10 (37 ) 14 (47 ) 10 (37 ) Currently smoke 3 (11 ) 4 (13 ) 2 (7) Hypertension 19 (70 ) 17 (57 ) 19 (70 ) \u00b2 (2)=1.60, p=0.45 Take hypertension medication 20 (77 (63 ) 21 (78 ) \u00b2 (2)=1.59, p=0.45 High cholesterol 16 (59 ) \u00b2 (2)=3.35, p=0.19 Take cholesterol medication 17 (65 (47 ) 14 (52 ) \u00b2 (2)=1.56, p=0.46 Cardiovascular disease 6 (22) 4 (13 ) 4 (15 ) Fisher 's exact, p=0.76 Heart attack 5 (19 ) 4 (13 ) 2 (7) \u00b2 (2)=0.29, p=0.86 Stroke 0 (0) 1 (3) 1 (4) *1 case missing. ANOVA , Chi-squared goodness of fit tests and Fisher 's exact tests were used to determine whether there were any differences between participant groups according to self -reported cardiovascular health characteristics. There were no significant differences between the three groups for duration of diabetes, use of diabetes medication, history of smoking, hypertension, use of hypertension medication, high cholesterol, use of cholesterol medication and history of cardiovascular di sease or cardiovascular events. 114 3.3.3.3 Cardiovascular Risk Factor Measures At baseline, t he mean HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose for trial participants were 7.6 per cent (\u00b11.5) and 8.6 mmol/L ( \u00b12.8) respectively, as would be anticipated for participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus . The mean systolic blood pressure was also above the normal range at 138 mmHg ( \u00b117) but the mean diastolic blood pressure was within normal limits at 82 mmHg ( \u00b111) according to NCEP -ATP III (Hunt et al., 2004) criteria. This resulted in an overall mean arterial pressure for trial participants of 100 mmHg ( \u00b111). fasting serum triglyceride mean ol/L (\u00b12.31) was well above the NCEP upper normal limit of 1.7 mm ol/L but the HDL -C mean of 1.17 ( \u00b10.43) was on the border of acceptable for combined male and female results . The BMI , which is the least sex -specific of the anthropometric measures, had a mean of 34.2 kg/m2 (\u00b17.0), placing the average size of trial participants well into the obese category. 115 Table 3. 13: Cardiovascular risk factors at baseline Cardiovascular risk measures Ganoderma lucidum (n=30) mean (\u00b1 Primary outcomes HbA1c ( per cent ) 7.7 (1.7) 7.4 (1.4) 7.7 (1.5) F (2, 81)=0.36, p=0.70 FPG (mmol/L) 8.4 (2.8) 8.4 (2.7) 9.1 (3.0) F (2, 81)=0.58, p=0.56 Secondary outcomes Systolic BP (mmHg) 137 (13) 135 (16) 142 (20) F (2, 81)=1.17, p=0.32 Diastolic BP (mmHg) 79 (9) 82 (11) 84 (2, 81)=0.99, p=0.38 Mean arterial pressure 2.18* (1.35) F (2, 79)=0.68, p=0.51 HDL (mmol/L) 1.14 (0.22) 1.17 (0.22) 1.19 (0.70) F (2, 81)=0.09, p=0.91 Height (cm) 166.0 (10.97) 165.7 (29.7) 168.3 p=0.88 Waist circumference (cm) 109.0 (11.8) 113.3 (14.6) 112.0 (16.9) F (2, 81)=0.65, p=0.53 Hip circumference (cm) 113.2 (18.9) 118.1 (11.0) 119.9 (16.1) F (2, 81)=1.20, p=0.31 *1 case missing . BP is blood pressure; HDL is hi gh-density BMI is body mass index . One-way ANOVA was used to determine whether the groups differed on any of the cardiovascular risk factor measures at baseline . Table 3.12 presents the mean and SD for each risk factor within each intervention group. F -scores and p -values are provided to show between -group comparisons. There were no significant differences between the three groups for a ll measures of hyperglycaemia, hypertension, lipid 116 profile, and anthropometric measures of height, weight, BMI and hip and waist circumference. 3.3.3.4 SF-36 H ealth -related Quality of Life M easures The baseline self -reported SF -36 health -related quality of life results are displayed in Table 3.1 4. These include the mean and SD for each individual and summary domain. Participant scores were coded, summed and transformed to a scale from 0 (worst possible health -related quality of life) to 100 (best possible health -related quality of life). The average trial participant physical summary score was 44.4 ( \u00b18.6) and the mental summary score was 47.5 ( \u00b112.8) . These are lower than the Australian population norms of Hawthorne, Osborne, Taylor & Sansoni ( 2007) . 117 Table 3.1 SF-36 SF-36 Ganoderma F(2, 81), p -value Physical f unction 43.4 (10.1) 44.8 (11.6) 43.5 (11.0) F=0.15, p=0.86 Role p hysical 43.9 (10.6) 47.4 (9.3) F=0.80, p=0.45 Bodily ain 44.0 (11.7) 48.1 (11.8) 44.8 (10.3) F=1.03, p=0.36 General h ealth 42.9 (8.6) 43.4 (9.2) 44.2 (9.5) F=0.15, p=0.86 Vitality 45.3 (10.9) 49.0 (8.4) 47.6 (12.3) F=0.88, p=0.42 Social f unction 44.3 (12.2) 46.5 (12.4) 47.2 (10.3) F=0.44, p=0.65 Role e motional 42.1 p=0.72 44.8 (13.6) 48.6 (13.4) F=0.86, p=0.43 Scores have been normed to nearest 0.1. The SF-36 ranges from 0 (worst possible health -related quality of life) to 100 (best possible h ealth -related quality of life). To determine the similarity of health -related quality of life between groups at baseline, one -way ANOVA tests were used. F -score difference statistics and p -values are presented for the SF-36 domains in Table 3.1 3. There were no significant differences between the three groups for any SF -36 health -related quality of life domain. There were also no significant differences between the physical (F2, 81=0.34, p=0.72) and mental (F2, 81=0.86, p= 0.43) summary scores acr oss the three groups. 118 3.3.4 Combined Ganoderma lucidum Intervention Group The data of the lucidum group and the Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis group were pooled to create a combined Ganoderma lucidum intervention group for all analys es of intervention effectiveness. This w as done for two reasons. First, the anticipated sample size was not achieved during the 2 -year recruitment period, such that meaningful differences between Ganoderma lucidum , with and without supplementation of Cordyceps sinensis , were unlikely. Had a statistically or clinically meaningful difference between the combined Ganoderma lucidum group and placebo group been found (HbA1c mean difference = 0.33, 95 per cent CI -0.6-1.2, p=0.58; f asting p lasma glucose mean difference = 0.43, 95 per cent CI -1.2-2.0, p=0.42), further exploration of the effect of Cordyceps sinensis would have been conducted. Second , because the two active interventions had the same major constituent, it was deemed appropriate that the data coul d be combined for analysis of effectiveness for that major constituent. The Ganoderma lucidum intervention was suppl emented with 92 Ganoderma lucidum with was supplemented with 94 mg of Cordyceps sinensis extract. However , both these interventions had an identical main active constituent of 280 mg of Ganoderma lucidum mushroom extract. In addition, the Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis groups were lly similar at baseline on demographic characteristics , self- reported and clinically measured cardiovascular risk factors and he alth-related quality of life domains. All analyses for baseline group differences across three groups, as reported in Section 3 .3.3, were repeated as two -group comparisons between the placebo group and the new combined Ganoderma lucidum group. Just as for the previous analyses, there were no statistically or clinically significant differences between the placebo group and the comb ined Ganoderma lucidum group according to demographic characteristics , self-reported and clinically measured cardiovascular risk factors and health-related quality of life domains. These two -group comparisons of baseline differences are included in Appendix 1 0. 119 3.3.5 Efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum for Primary O utcomes The effectiveness of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of type 2 diabetes in persons with metabolic syndrome was evaluated with long term HbA1c and short term fasting plasma gluco se measures of hyperglycaemia. Missing data was imputed using the LOCF method. 3.3.5.1 HbA1c Figure 3.4 is a time plot showing the mean HbA1c for the placebo or combined Ganoderma lucidum groups at the start (baseline), middle (Week 8) and end (W eek 16) of the trial. Figure 3.4 : Change in HbA1c during medication period Error bars show t wo SDs (half 95 per cent confidence interval) . Ganoderma lucidum did not reduce HbA1c over the 16 -week intervention pe riod. The placebo mean reduced slightly, but the magnitude of this change is negligible. Figure 3.5 presents the sam e HbA1c time plot but includes W eek 24 data to additionally show the effect of 8 weeks wash -out from the medication.

Ganoderma lucidum did not reduce HbA1c over the 16 -week intervention period. The placebo mean slightly reduced but the magnitude of this change is negligible. Figure 3.5 presents the sam e HbA1c time plot but includes W eek 24 data to additionally show the effect of 8 weeks wash -out from the medication. HbA1 c mean values decreased in both groups during the follow -up period when participants no longer took medication, but the mag nitude of change is very small. Figure 3.5 : Change in HbA1c including follow -up period Error bars show two SDs (half 95 per cent CI). A linear regression appr oach to ANCOVA was used to determine the effect of Ganoderma lucidum (combined groups ) compared to placebo at the 16 -week point, using bas eline values as the covariate. The adjusted difference in the HbA1c means at the end of the medication period was 0.13 per cent with a 95 per cent CI of -0.35- 0.6 per cent , which was not a statistically si gnificant difference (F (1, 81)=0.28; p=0.6). 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 9.5 10.0 Baseline 8 weeks 16 weeks 24 weeks Placebo Combined Interventions HbA1c (%) 121 Table 3.1 5: Effect of Ganoderma lucidum on HbA1c at 16 weeks Placebo n=30 Mean (\u00b1 SD) Combined Intervention n=54 Mean (\u00b1 SD) Adjusted difference in means (95 per centCI) F(1, 81) p-value HbA1c -0.35- 0.60) F=0.28 p=0.60 16 weeks 7.29 (1.29) 7.66 (1.86) CI is confidence interval; SD is standard deviation . Figure 3.6 is a tree plot that graphs clinical effect against the minimal important clinical difference. It was determined a priori that the minimal important clinical difference for Ganoderma lucidum as a treatment for persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome was a 1 per cent decrease in HbA1c. T he clinical effect size was a 0.13 per cent increase in HbA1c (95 per cent CI of -0.35- 0.6). This did not overlap or approach the minimal important difference. Due to the insignificant clinical effect size, the NNT was not calculated.

Figure 3.7 : Change in fasting plasma glucose during medication period Error bars show two SDs (half 95 per cent CI). Treatment with Ganoderma lucidum did not reduce fas ting plasma glucose over the 16-week intervention p eriod. Both groups showed an increase in their means but the magni tude of this change over time was negligible. Figure 3.8 presents the same fasting plasma glucose time plot bu t with the additional of the 8 -week wash -out period.

For the fasting plasma glucose primary analysis, a linear regression approach to ANCOVA was used to determine the effect of Ganoderma lucidum (combined groups ) compared to placebo at the 16 -week point, using bas eline values as the covariate. The adjusted difference in fasting plasma glucose means at the end of the medication period was 0.03 mmol/L, with a 95 per cent CI of -0.9-0.9, which was not a statistically significant difference ( F (1, 81) =0.00; p= 0.95) .

There is therefore no overlap or approach towards the minimal important difference.

For complete case analysis, only those cases with data for both HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose at baseline and 16 weeks were used. This resulted in 6 cases l ost from the placebo group (n= 24/30) and 5 cases lost f rom the intervention group 125 (n=49/54). The partial intention -to-treat analysis was performed by imputing missin g data using the LOCF method .

There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between the intervention and control groups for HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose using both methods. Time plots for both primary outcome measures using the complete case analysis method are provided in Appendix 12 . 3.3.6 Efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum for Secondary Outcomes The second aim of the clinical trial was to examine the effect of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of the non diabetes components of the metabolic syndrome and health - related quality of life. These include hypertension, as measured by mean arterial pressure, dyslipidaemia , measured by triglyceride s and high -density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and obesity , measured by waist circumference and BMI . Health - related quality of life was measured with the SF -36 Version 2. 126 As for the primary outcomes, a linear regression approach to ANCOVA was used to determine the effect of Ganoderma lucidum on the secondary outcomes. The combined active and placebo intervention groups were compared at the 16 -week point using the LOCF imputation method and adjusted by the covariate baseline values. Power analysis was not performed for secondary outcome measures. Table 3.18 presents the baseline and 16 -week me ans, group comparison effect sizes and probability values for each of the secondary outcome measures . 127 Table 3.18: Effect of Ganoderma lucidum on secondary outcomes at 16 weeks Placebo (n=30) Mean ( \u00b1 SD) Combined intervention (n=54) Mean ( \u00b1 SD) Adjusted difference in means (95 per cent CI) Difference statistic F(1, 81) p-value Arterial pressure weeks 98.4 (10.7) 98.7 (11.4) Triglycerides (mmol/L) Baseline 2.2 (0.9) 2.5 (2.8) -0.1 (-0.3-0.2) 0.19 0.66 16 weeks 2.2 (1.0) 2.6 (2.4) HDL (mmol/L) Baseline 1.2 (0.2) 1.2 (0.5) 0.0 (-0.1-0.1) 0.02 0.90 16 weeks 1.2 (0.2) 1.2 (0.4) Waist circumference (cm) Baseline 113.3 (14.6) 109.6 (14.6) 0.65 ( 34.4 0.99 16 weeks 34.0 (7.3) 33.9 (6.6) SF-36 Baseline 45.4 (8.2) 43.8 (8.8) 0.9 (-2.2-4.0) 0.31 0.58 16 weeks 46.2 (8.5) 46.1 (8.9) 45.4 (8.2) 46.7 (13.5) 1.47 ( -2.1-5.0) 0.65 0.42 16 weeks 48.5 (12.7) 48.5 (11.1) 128 There were no statistically significant differences between the adjusted means of the combined Ganoderma lucidum group and the placebo group across all secondary outcomes ( the p-values rang ed from 0.42 to 0.99). The mean arterial blood pressure was reduced by 0.3 mmHg in the intervention group compared to the control group (95 per cent CI -4.6-3.9). The g roup means were very similar for measures of dyslip idaemia , with 0.1 mmol/L and 0 mmol/L difference s for triglycerides and high-density lipoprot ein cholesterol respectively. There was also no difference in obesity betw een those taking Ganoderma lucidum and those taking placebo medication. The between -group mean difference for waist circumference was 0.65 cm (95 per cent CI -1.5-2.8) and 0.0 kg/m2 (95 per cent CI -0.5-0.5) for BMI . On a 100 -point scale those who took Gano derma lucidum for 16 weeks experienced a reduction in mental h ealth -related quality of life of 1.47 points (95 per cent CI - 2.2-4) and in physical h ealth -related quality of life of 0.9 points (95 per cent CI -2.1- 5), compared to those who did not take the a ctive medication. 3.3.7 Efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum for Exploratory Outcomes Trends for between -group differences were explored with ANCOVA , using the LOCF method and baseline values as the covariate. Table 3.18 presents the baseline and 16 -week means, clinical effect sizes and probability values for C -reactive protein, total cholesterol, low -density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoproteins A and B. Power was not estimated for exploratory outcome statistical significance comparisons ; howev er, the between -group differences were not statistically significant at =0.05 for all outcome measures. There were also negligible clinical differences between Ganoderma lucidum and placebo groups for all but one of the exploratory outcome measures . This exception was C-reactive protein , which decreased in the intervention group by an average of 0.7 mg/L (95 per cent CI -2.8- 1.4) compared to the placebo group. 129 Table 3.19: Effect of Ganoderma lucidum on exploratory outcomes at 16 weeks Placebo (n=30) Mean ( \u00b1 SD) Combined intervention (n=54) Mean ( \u00b1 SD) Adjusted differen ce in means (95 per cent CI) Difference statistic F(1, 81) p-value C-reactive protein (mg/L) -0.7 (-2.8-1.4) F(1, 74)= 0.41 0.53 16 weeks 4.1 (6.3) 3.9 (3.5) Total cholesterol (mmol/L) Baseline 5.2 (1.2) 4.9 (1.3) 0.2 (-0.2-0.5) F(1, 81)= 0.73 0.39 16 weeks 5.1 (1.2) 5.0 (1.5) LDL (mmol/L) Baseline 2.9 (1.1) 2.7 (1.0) 0.2 (-0.1-0.5) F(1, 80)= 1.48 0.23 16 weeks 2.8 (1.0) 2.8 (1.2) Apolipoprotein A (g/L) Baseline 1.4 (0.3) 1.4 (0.3) 0.0 (-0.1-0.1) F(1, 72 )=0.01 0.90 16 weeks 1.4 (0.3) 1.4 (0.3) Apolipoprotein B (g/L) Baseline 0.9 (0.3) 0.9 (0.2) 0.0 (-0.1-0.1) F(1, 72)= 0.00 0.98 16 weeks 0.9 (0.3) 0.9 (0.3) LDL is low-density lipoprotein cholesterol . For the exploratory outcomes, there was missing data at baseline and therefore missing data after the LOCF imputation. The p lacebo group was missing two values for apolipoprotein A, apolipoprotein B, and C -reactive prot ein (n=28/30). The intervention group was missing one value for LDL (53/54), seven values for apolipoprotein A and apolipoprotein B (n=47/54), a nd five values for C -reactive protein (n=49/54) , hence the degrees of freedom differ for each outcome. 130 3.3.8 Frequency of Metabolic Syndrome Diagnosis In addition to calculating clinical effect sizes, the clinical usefulness of Ganoderma lucidum was evaluated by changes in the frequency of metabolic syndrome diagnoses. For inclusion in the clinical trial , at baseline all participants met the diagnostic criteria of metabolic syndrome, that is, a minimum of three out of five possible disease compon ents. Table 3.20 shows the changes to these proportions in the three groups over the course of the trial. Table 3.20: Proportion of participants with metabolic syndrome Ganoderma lucidum (n) Placebo (n) Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis (n) Baseline 27 30 27 Week 8 Met MS criteria 25 18 19 Did not meet MS criteria 1 10 5 Withdrawn 1 2 3 Week 16 Met MS criteria 23 20 19 Did not meet MS criteria 2 6 5 Withdrawn 2 4 3 Week 24 (follow -up) Met MS criteria 21 22 17 Did not meet MS criteria 4 4 7 Withdrawn 2 4 3 MS is metabolic syndrome After 4 months of taking trial medication, two participants in the Ganoderma lucidum group, five participants of the Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis group and six participants in the placebo group no longer met the diagnostic criteria 131 of metabolic syndrome. Therefore, there was no improvement in the diagnostic status of metabolic syndrome in the groups taking Ganoderma lucidum compared with the placeb o group. 3.3.9 Safety of Ganoderma lucidum The safety of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome was evaluated by comparing the number and type of adverse events and out -of-range safety pathology results experienced by participants in the Ganoderma lucidum intervention groups w ith those of the placebo group. Information on adverse events was collected at baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 and at the Week 24 follow -up. The values in Table 3.20 represent the number of times an adverse event was recorded. For example, if a participant repor ted having a cold at W eeks 4, 8, and 1 2 then this would be entered as three reported infection adverse events. Table 3.21 presents the total numbers of adverse events in two sections. The first section presents the frequency of reported side effects which are thought to be usual during commenc ement of Ganoderma lucidum treatment. These mild adverse events are headache, fatigue, diarrhoea, constipation and nausea. The second section pr ovides the frequency of all non anticipated side effects and is outlined according to physio logical system classi fications. 132 Table 3.21: 0 -16 Week 16 -24 Week 0 -16 Week 16 -24 Week 0 -16 Week 16 -24 Anticipated adverse events Headache 1 1 2 Fatigue 6 1 1 1 3 Diarrhoea 6 4 4 Constipation 3 3 Nausea 4 1 1 4 Subtotal 20 2 10 0 11 3 Nonanticipated adverse events Immune system and infection 9 1 14 5 11 1 Skin 1 4 1 1 Neurological 2 1 1 Musculoskeletal 6 4 Liver and biliary Alimentary and pancreatic 5 5 1 3 1 Endocrine 2 1 3 Respiratory 5 3 5 3 Cardiovascular 1 3 Kidney and genitourinary 1 Mental health 2 2 2 2 3 SUBTOTAL 32 6 38 8 24 7 TOTAL 52 8 48 8 35 10 133 In the Ganoderma lucidum group there were 20 reports of anticipated mild adverse events during the medication period; ten side effect events were recorded for the placebo group and 11 events for the Ganoderma lucidum group. None of these common side effects caused sig nificant concern or discomfort t o the participants. Regarding non anticipated adverse events, participants in the Ganoderma lucidum group reported 32 events compared to 24 events in the Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis group , and 33 events in the placebo group. There were no more than eight adverse events noted for any group in the follow -up period. The most common adverse event for all groups was an infection or immune system condition and these were most frequently reported by part icipants who were not taking an active medication. The majority of adverse events were mild. The only two serious adverse events, which were reported to the TGA , were not attributed to the trial intervention, as determined by the clinical trial medical tea m and external medical personnel. Safety biochemistry pathology tests were conducted during the trial for ongoing individual assessment and group data analysis. Table 3.22 shows the frequency of out-of range pat hology results at baseline and W eek 16 for the three intervention groups. The results are very consistent, both within the groups over time, and between the groups. All six frequency totals (three groups, measured twice) range from 42 to 46 abnormal pathology results. Highest frequencies were noted for urate, gamma -glutamyl transpeptidase and alanine aminotransferase. 134 Table Ganoderma lucidum Placebo Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis Baseline Week 16 Baseline Week 16 Baseline Week 16 Urea 5 4 4 2 2 2 Urate 9 5 6 5 6 5 Phosphate 1 2 3 3 0 2 Gamma -glutamyl transpeptidase 4 4 5 3 9 9 Alanine aminotransferase 6 6 8 8 5 5 Haemoglobin 0 0 1 1 0 0 Calcium 2 2 1 2 0 0 Lactate dehydrogenase 1 1 3 3 2 2 Aspartate aminotransferase 2 2 1 4 3 3 Calculated osmosis 2 3 2 2 2 2 Alkaline phosphatase 5 4 4 4 3 3 Bilirubin 3 4 0 1 4 3 Lymphocytes 0 0 0 0 0 1 Monocytes 0 0 0 0 0 1 Eosinophils 0 0 0 1 0 1 Protein 1 2 1 1 1 1 Platelets 0 1 1 1 2 2 Sodium 1 0 0 1 0 0 Haematocrit 0 0 1 1 1 1 Creatinine 2 2 1 1 0 0 Red cells 0 0 1 1 0 0 White cells 0 0 0 0 0 0 Neutrophils 0 0 0 0 0 0 Globulins 1 1 0 0 1 2 Thrombocytes 0 0 0 0 1 1 TOTAL 45 43 43 45 42 46 134 3.4 Discussion 3.4.1 Introduction This section discusses key issues about the randomised clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in persons with metabolic syndrome. This will include a summary of the results and consider the strengths and limitations of the research and its findi ngs. Discussion points informed by both studies of this thesis, including the implications of results, will be presented later in Chapter 5. 3.4.2 Summary of Results 3.4.2.1 Summary of Participant Characteristics Eighty -four participants were enrolled in this randomised clinical trial, including 40 women and 44 men, aged 34 -86 years. All participants lived within the Sydney metropolitan region. At baseline, all group means fel l within the diagnostic categories for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypertrigylceridaemia, and obesity. For high -density lipoprotein cholesterol, the group means bordered normal and abnormal ranges. Consistent with the inclusion criteria, all pa rticipants had metabolic syndrome. For health -related quality of life, the a verage participant physical summary score was 44.4 ( \u00b18.6) and the mental summary score was 47.5 ( \u00b112.8) on a 100 point scale. These are both lower (worse) than the respective Aust ralian population norms of 50.3 (\u00b19.7) and 52.9 ( \u00b110.2) (Hawthorne et al. , 2007) . This finding is consistent with other studies, presented in Section 2.3.6, that found reduced wellbeing and health - related quality of life in persons with the metabolic syndr ome. A comparison can also be made with norms for the 55 -64 years age category. This range includes the mean ages for the clinical trial groups. The physical summary score of 46.82 (\u00b111.55 ) and mental summary score of 50.12 (\u00b110.75 ) for this age group are also higher than those reported by participants in the trial. 135 3.4.2. 2 Summary of Efficacy Results Ganoderma lucidum did not reduce HbA1c or fasting plasma glucose during the 16 - week treatment period. Differences between groups were not statistically s ignificant. The treatment effect for HbA1c was 0.13 per cent (95 per cent CI of -0.35-0.6) in favour of the control group. The magnitude of this increase was too negligible to suggest harm from the intervention. In the follow -up period, HbA1c mean values decreased in both groups, but this change was very small. The treatment effect of Ganoderma lucidum on fasting plasma glucose was 0.03 mmol/L (95 per cent CI of - 0.9-0.96). Again, the direction of effect favoured the control group , but its magnitude was too negligible to propose potential harm. Mean fasting plasma glucose slightly increased for both groups after participants stopped taking medication, but the size of these within -group changes is insignificant. The magnitude of effects was too small to measure the NNT or number needed to harm (NNH) . For all secondary outcomes, t here were no statistically significant differences betw een the adjusted means of the combined Ganoderma lucidum group and the placebo group. The re were also no clinically significant improvements as a result of Ganoderma lucidum treatment over 16 weeks. Mean ar terial blood pressure decreased by a small amount , 0.3 mmHg (95 per cent CI -4.6-3.9), in the intervention group compared to the control group . The g roup means for triglycerides and high -density lipoprotein differed by 0.1 mmol/L and 0 mmol/L , respectively. Insignificant effect sizes were also found for o besity; the Ganoderma lucidum group mean waist circumference was 0.65 cm higher than that of the placebo group (95 per cent CI -1.5-2.8) and no difference (0.0 kg/m2) was found between groups for BMI (95 per cent CI -0.5-0.5). There was no reduction in the number of participants who met the diagnostic criteria of metabolic syndrome in those taking Ganoderma lucidum compared with the placebo group. T hose who took Ganoderma lucidum experienced a reduction in mental health -related quality of life of 1.47 points (95 per cent CI -2.2-4) and in physical health -related quality of life of 0.9 points (95 per cent CI -2.1 to 5) , compared to those who did not take the active medication. When considered in the context of a 100 -point scale these increases are not significant 136 enough to suggest a negative effect of Ganoderma lucidum on health -related quality of life. Trends for between -group differences were explored for C -reactive protein, total cholesterol, low -density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotei ns A and B. There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between the Ganoderma lucidum and placebo groups , with the exception of for C-reactive protein. This inflammatory marker decreased in the intervention group by 0.7 mg/L (95 per c ent CI -2.8-1.4) compared to the placebo group. Interestingly, group mean C -reactive protein levels were not high at baseline and remained within the normal range postintervention. As an exploratory outcome in this trial, further research would be required to determine if this finding is clinically meaningful. 3.4.2. 3 Summary of Safety Results Participants in the Ganoderma lucidum and Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis groups reported 52 and 35 events, respectively. This was comparable to the placebo group, for which 43 adverse events were reported. The majority of adverse events were mild. The only two serious events were not considered attributable to the trial intervention. Pathology biochemi stry panels were also evaluated for safety of Ganoderma lucidum and were found to be similar between intervention and control groups. 3.4.3 Strengths of the Study This study aimed for contempora ry best practice in clinical trial design, implementation, i nterpretation and reporting. Each stage was performed in accordance with international, national and institutional ethical and research guidelines. This included checking consistency with standards outlined by the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. 137 The clinical trial protocol was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (previously the Australasian Clinical Trial Registry). Over the last ten years, international governments, research groups, health organisations and research journals have implemented strategies to reduce publication bias toward studies reporting positive results. This is one reason for the introduction of clinical trial registries a round the world (Abaid, Grimes & Schulz , 2007) . By registering a clinical trial, the protocol is published and available online, thus improving transparency, accountability and responsibility for conducting quality research and ensuring access to results, irrespective of their direction and size of effect. There are many checklists and guidelines for clinical trial appraisal. Three commonly used tools are the Jadad Scale (Jadad et al., 1996) , PEDro Scale (Maher, Sherrington, Herbert, Moseley & Elkins, 2003) and Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (Higgins et al. , 2011 ). These tools specify the following as sources of bias in clinical trials: randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, therapists and assessors; level of attrition, intention -to-treat analyses, reporting of between -group effect estimates for prespecified outcomes, and conflict of interest. This clinical trial was designed and conducted to meet the criteria required for judgement of low risk on all domains. An appraisal of this t rial, using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, is presented in Chapter 4 as part of the systematic review process. Poor reporting of research is a barrier to judgement of validity and translation of results into clinical practice. The CONSORT Statement for r eporting clinical trial research was first published in 1996 with the most recent update provided in 2010 (Antes, 2010) . Although useful for appraisal, the role of the CONSORT Statement is to ensure accurate and complete reporting by researchers. Criteria listed in the statement have guided the presentation of research information within this thesis and will provide the framework for future publication of this work. Beyond clear and complete reporting, researchers can best support evidence -based clinical pr actice by providing clinically meaningful results. Rather than focussing on statistical significance, the results of this trial have been presented with CIs that can be compared against client minimal important differences. The NNT, a reciprocal of absolut e risk reduction, would have been determined, had larger effects been 138 detected. The smaller the treatment effect, the harder it is to interpret NNT in a clinically meaningful way (Altman, 1998) . Finally, standards for best clinical practice are also clien t-centred. Clinical research can support this by ensuring efficacy studies include evaluations of safety and tolerability, and a participant perspective of the experience. In this trial, safety of Ganoderma lucidum was evaluated by frequency and severity o f adverse events and atypical pathology results. The SF -36 Health -related Quality of Life Survey was used as a health outcome that represented a client -centred perspective. It has been found that the SF -36 is not very responsive to modest improvements in h yperglycaemia (Hill -Briggs, Gary, Baptiste -Roberts &Brancati, 2005) . However this broader health - related quality of life survey was chosen over diabetes -specific tools to capture the broader health implications of metabolic syndrome. 3.4.4 Limitations of the Study The primary limitation of this clinical trial was the sample size. Before commencement of the trial, power analysis estimated that 39 participants would have 90 per cent power to detect a difference of 1.5 mmol/L in fasting plasma glucose, with a SD of 1.5 mmol/L. However, to detect a difference of 1 per cent in HbA1c (with a SD of 1.4 per cent ), a total of 168 participants was required. Both these estimations allowed for 20 per cent of participants to be noncompliant or with draw from the study. The mean differences used for the power analysis were taken from the minimal important clinical differences. These were determined a prior i, by clinical reasoning that considered the expense, harm, number of capsules, and the efficacy of alternative antihyperglycaemic medications. The SDs were derived from variance data as reported by previous clinical trials with similar hyperglycaemic populations. The number of participants was restricted by slow recruitment. Metabolic syndrome is estimated to affect about one in four Australian adults. Therefore, we anticipated reasonable enrolment rates following initial screening. However many potential participants were found to have only two of the three necessary components of 139 metabolic syndrome . Although contact was made with over 1,000 potential participants, from these, only 84 persons were enrolled in the study. The trial period was extended by 18 months and the inclusion criteria were amended to allow enrolment of persons with nonalcoholic f atty liver syndrome. However, upon trial completion, the sample size was 50 per cent of that specified in the protocol. Although this trial provides valuable information regarding a metabolic syndrome population, the multiple -component definition of the di sorder appears to present recruitment challenges for researchers. There are additional considerations regarding whether the study is underpowered to determine efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum for reducing HbA1c. Firstly, a post hoc power analysis suggests a smaller sample size might be acceptable. The a priori analysis set power at the higher limit of 90 per cent and a generous allowance of 20 per cent noncompliance. However, 80 per cent is a common and accepted level of power in a clinical trial and a lower level of noncompliance was observed during the study. Compliance is difficult to determine. It is plausible that dropping out of the trial (as occurred for 11 per cent of sample) or t aking less than 90 per cent of the provided medication (as occurred for 1 per cent of sample) would interfere with result validity. An adjusted post hoc analysis using 80 per cent power and 12 per cent total noncompliance determined that 36 persons were re quired, per group, to detect a 1 per cent difference in HbA1c. Two further strategies were employed to improve statistical power. The two Ganoderma lucidum intervention groups were pooled for statistical analysis of efficacy , as outlined in Section 3.3.4. This allowed for a two -group, rather than three - group comparison for the primary, secondary and exploratory outcomes. Finally, groups were compared with ANCOVA using baseline data as the covariate. In contrast to traditional two -group comparisons, this te chnique provides a more accurate measure of effect and increases power (Vickers & Altman, 2001) . These strategies suggest the sample size might be adequate for hypothesis testing of both primary outcomes. However , conventional power analysis is clearly arb itrary and conclusions of statistical significance remain extremely influenced by sample size (Bacchetti, 2010) . Also statistical significance does not provide a magnitude of the 140 effect. For these reasons, clinical significance and interpretation of treatm ent effect sizes are increasingly regarded as the more important results from clinical trials. The primary analysis provides the more important, statistically rigorous and clinically meaningful results of this trial. Secondary and exploratory outcome meas ures might be underpowered to detect a significant difference between groups. Additionally, multiple analyses at multiple time points will introduce a type 1 error, such that one in 20 analyses, for significance set at p=0.05, might produce a significant r esult due to chance. Potential for this error was reduced by combining intervention groups and focussing on 16 -week analyses only. However, no analyses in this trial produced a statistically significant result. The d irection and magnitude of effects were e xamined for meaningful trends, as was noted for C -reactive protein. Similarly, the study was underpowered for inferential testing of safety variables and therefore these were evaluated with descriptive methods. 141 Chapter 4: Study Two Ganoderma lucidum for Pharmacologically Modifiable Cardiovascular Risk Factors: A Systematic Review 4.1 Introduction Chapter 4 presents the second research study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum for pharmacologically modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. As for the randomised clinical trial, the diagnostic criteria and outcome measures are relevant to a Western clinical setting. This systematic review was conducted after the randomised clinical trial presented in the preceding chapter, and include s data from that clinical trial. Discussion on issues informed by both studies of this thesis will be provided in Chapter 5. This chapter will be presented differently. Because the systematic review has been accepted for publication in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, I have chosen to retain the submission format for presentation in this thesis. The article is titled 'Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of cardiovascular risk factors '. Consistent with the preceding chapter, this publication follows the same sequence of methods, results and discussion. However, the editorial style of Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews differs from American Psychological Association 6th style that is used in the rest of the thesis. Lists of content experts and search strategies used in the systematic review are provided in Appendi ces 13 and 14. 4.2 Publication of Systematic Review Ganoderma lucidum for the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors Protocol Citation: Klupp NL, Hawke F, Cao H, Chang D, Bensoussan A, Kiat H, Grant SJ.

Ganoderma lucidum is becoming increasingly popular in Western countries as a complementary medicine for cardi ovascular health. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of Ganoderma lucidum for the management of pharmacologically modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1800 -2011, Issue 11), PubMed Entrez inclusive of MEDLINE (1950 to November 2011), EMBASE (1980 to November 2011), Science Direct (1823 to November 2011), Current 143 Controlled Trials (1990 to November 2011), Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (2005 to November 2011), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (2007 to November 2011), Chinese Medical Current Contents (2007 to November 2011) and other databases. We checked reference lists of included studies, contacted content experts and hand -searched The International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms. No language or publication restrictions were applied. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials of Ganoderma lucidum for the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors. Primary outcomes were blood glucose level, blood pressure and lipid profile. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and cross -checked data extraction and analysis. A third author arbitrated in the event of disagreement. Results Four trials , with a total of 375 participants , were eligible for inclusion. Of these, one study was published in Chinese and translated to English; one study was unpublished, for which study authors provided data; and two studies did not provide comparison group data suitable for statistical analyses. Both studies from which data were used for statistical analyses compared Ganoderma lucidum (3 g per day) to placebo in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus over 12 -16 weeks of intervention. Of the four included studies, the risk of bias was low for one study and unclear fo r the remaining three. Only two studies (one comparison) were suitable for inclusion in this meta -analysis. Ganoderma lucidum was not associated with statistically or clinically significant reduction s in HbA1c (WMD: -0.10 [95 per cent CI: -1.05-0.85]). Al l other analyses were from single studies. No improvement was found for fasting plasma glucose (WMD: 0.30 [95 per cent CI: -0.95-1.55]). Measures of postprandial blood glucose 144 level s found inconsistent results: in favour of placebo for '2 hour postprandial blood glucose ' (0.7 mmol/L, 95 per cent CI 0.29 -1.11) and in favour of Ganoderma lucidum for 'plasma glucose under the curve at the 4th hour' (-49.4 mg/dL/h (95 per cent CI -77.21 to -21.59]). As minimal import differences for the latter are unknown, the clinical significance of this effect is unclear. There were no statistically significant differences between groups for blood pressure, triglycerides and cholesterol. There was no increased risk in adverse events for persons taking Ganoderma lucidum (161 per cent v. 160 per cent ; RR 1.01, 95 per cent CI not estimable). However, Ganoderma lucidum was associated with an increased risk of mild events including headache, fatigue, and gastrointestinal effects (57 per cent v. 33 per cent ; RR 0.37, 95 per cent CI 0.15-0.94). Authors' conclusions Evidence from a small number of randomised and controlled trials does not support the use of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of cardiovascular risk factors in people with diabetes mellitus. Future research into the effica cy of Ganoderma lucidum should be placebo -controlled and adhere to clinical trial reporting standards. Plain language summary Ganoderma lucidum is a mushroom that is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. Recently it has also been used in Western countries to improve cardiovascular health. This review evaluated whether Ganoderma lucidum can improve risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and stroke. We identified four randomised trials but only two provided enough info rmation for analysis. Based on these two studies, this review found that Ganoderma lucidum was not effective for reducing blood glucose, blood pressure or cholesterol. These findings were based on people who had type 2 diabetes. Evidence about whether Gano derma lucidum might reduce blood glucose after a meal was mixed and came from a single study of unknown quality. Ganoderma lucidum was found to be a safe medication but can be associated with some mild side effects such as headache, 145 fatigue, nausea and con stipation. Future research in this field requires clinical trials that are better reported. Background Description of the condition The social, economic and personal burden of cardiovascular disease is well recognised. The WHO estimates at least 17 milli on deaths per year, worldwide, are due to cardiovascular disease (World Health Organization, 2011 ). This includes coronary heart disease, independently the world 's leading cause of death and stroke. Stroke also has the highest prevalence rates for disabili ty in many countries ( World Health Organization, 2011 ). With rates of diabetes and obesity rapidly increasing in both the developed and developing world, it is expected that morbidity and mortality rates for cardiovascular disease will continue to rise ( Capewell et al, 2010, Hossain et al., 2007 ). Cardiovascular disease is multifactorial in causation. Over 300 risk factors have been identified as likely contributors to vascular pathogenesis and, in combination, may have complex and cumulative metabolic eff ects. Tobacco, alcohol, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood glucose and obesity remain the primary modifiable risk factors ( Hossain et al., 2007 ; World Health Organization, 2011 ), and novel markers are being increasingly researched for their predictive ability and role in the development of cardiovascular disease. These include homocysteine, markers of inflammation, such as C -reactive protein, and markers of abnormal coagulation, including fibrinogen ( Pearson , 2003 ). Description of the intervention Ganoderma lucidum , also known as ling zhi or reishi, is a mushroom that has been consumed for its broad medicinal properties in Asia for 2 ,000 years, and has more recently been introduced to Western society. As with most herbal interventions, it is regarded as both medicine and food to bring the body 'into balance ', promote health, prolong life and prevent and cure many systemic diseases ( Willard , 1990 ). The 146 potential of Ganoderma lucidum to safely and effectively treat multiple primary risk factors for cardiovascular disease has increased interest in this medicinal mushroom. Results from clinical trials indicate that Ganoderma lucidum can lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose in humans (Gao et al., 2004a , b; Jin, 1996; et al., 2004a , b). In these trials, no abnormalities in haematological and biochemical (including hepatic and renal) safety biomarkers, and no moderate, serious or severe adverse events wer e reported for the participants. Data from animal and in vitro studies suggest that constituents, either individually or synergistically, produce beneficial effects of being antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycaemic, anti-atherogenic and immune , Ajith, Sheena, Gunapalan & Janardhanan, 2003 ; Yang et al., 2002 ; Zhang & Lin, 2004 ). How the intervention might work Unlike many synthetic medicines, knowledge of medicinal mushrooms ' modes of action, and evidence and guidelines for use are not well established. There is no agreed dosage for Ganoderma lucidum treatment ; however, most recommended amounts vary between 1.5 g and 9 g of dried extract per day ( Chang , 2000 ; Teow , 1996 ). The Ganoderma mushroom contains pharmacologically active variables and the effects and effectiveness of the whole product are likely to differ from any single component acting alone. The constituents of Ganoderma lucidum include polysaccharides (including beta -D-glucans, heteropolysaccharides sterols, lipids, antioxidants, vitamins B1, B2, B6, iron, calcium and zinc ( Huie & Di, 2004 ; McKenna , Jones, Hughes & Reishi, 2002 ). Why it is important to do this review Human trials which have evaluated Ganoderma lucidum vary greatly with regard to their level and quality of evidence, internal and external validity, and in particular, their analyses and reporting of results. This provide s a challenge to health professionals to determine the effectiveness for cardiovascular risk factor 147 management from an evidence -based perspective. A systematic review of this increasingly popular complementary medicine is required for both Eastern and Western medical practice. This review will evaluate the effectiveness of Ganoderma lucidum for the management of pharmacologically modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. Objectives The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of pharmacologically modifiable risk factors of cardiovascular disease in adults. This included determining the size, direction, and uncertainty of effect for each risk factor (blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides), and the consistency of effects between studies. The strength and consistency of evidence for adverse events was also evaluated. Methods Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies Randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials (as defined by Higgins et al., 2011 ), and randomised cross -over studies, for which only the first phase data was to be included. Comparison must have been against placebo or alternative pharmacologic al or nonpharmacological treatment. Types of participants Any person identified as having at least one cardiovascular risk factor as listed as a primary outcome measure in this review. The cardiovascular risk factor must have been evaluated in the contex t of prevention or treatment of a cardiovascular -related disease (for example, blood pressure changes evaluated in a cancer trial would have been excluded). 148 Types of interventions As with most complementary medicines, a range of strains, herb products and active ingredients may be utilised under the same product name. Therefore a degree of heterogeneity was expected. Ganoderma lucidum is frequently combined with a second ingredient aimed to increase potency. Trials evaluating a combined formulation were included if there was only one additional ingredient and Ganoderma lucidum represented at least 75 per cent of constituent weight. Co - intervention was allowed as long as all arms of t he study received the same co - intervention.

No language restrictions were applied. Published or unpublished studies, including those only available as abstracts, were eligible for inclusion . Searching other resources Reference lists of all included studies were checked for other potentially eligible studies . Persona l communication with authors in the relevant field, medicinal mushroom research centres and relevant pharmaceutical companies . Hand -searching of the International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms . 151 Data collection and analysis Selection of studies Two reviewers independently evaluated the English language titles and abstracts (where available) (NK and FH). One reviewer (HC) evaluated the Chinese language titles and abstracts. Full text versions were retrieved for all potentially relevant studies (NK). Two reviewers independently evaluated the full text versions for eligibility (NK and HC). Authorship and re sults were not blinded , as the effectiveness of applying this process has not been established by empirical evidence (Higgins et al., 2011 ). Any disagreement was resolved by discussion between reviewers. No arbitration of disagreement by a third reviewer ( SG) was needed. Data extraction and management Two reviewers (FH and HC) independently extracted data using a pilot tested data extraction form. One reviewer (NK) checked the data extraction forms for agreement. No arbitration of disagreement was needed. The following data was extracted: General information: title, authors, contact details, country, sponsor . Verification of meeting inclusion criteria . Publication details: published or unpublished, abstract only or not, publication type, language, standard referencing details and duplicate publications . Trial characteristics: design (parallel or cross -over), recruitment pr ocedures, method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding (participants, intervention administrators, outcome assessors ), evaluation of blinding by trialists, setting, quality appraisal. Participants: inclusion and exclusion criteria, total number and number in comparison groups, baseline characteristics. 152 Interventions: the composition or ingredients; preparation method, d ose, route , and duration of intervention; comparison intervention; co -intervention; and expertise of practitioner. Outcomes: outcomes specified above and adverse events. Follow -up: length of follow -up, reason and number of drop -outs and withdrawals, compli ance, and intention -to-treat analysis. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Risk of bias of included trials was rated independently by two reviewers (HC and FH) using the following criteria, as described in the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions ( Higgins & Green, 2011 ). Disagreements were arbitrated by a third reviewer (NK). Sequence generation Concealment of allocation Blinding Incomplete data Selective outcome reporting Other sources of bias, such as financial conflicts of interest and single author or single centre trials Each criterion was assigned a judgement of 'high risk ', 'low risk ' or 'unclear risk ' relating to the risk of bias for that entry. 'Unclear risk ' indicates an unclear or unknown risk of bias , or if an entry was not relevant to the study at hand. Results are presented in the 'risk of bias ' graph ( Figure 1). A 'risk of bias summary ' figure was generated using Review Manager 5 to present all of the judgements in a cross - tabulation of study by entry ( Figure 2). Measures of treatment effect Mean endpoint scores were used for inter -group comparisons. For pooled continuous data, weighted mean differences with 95 per cent CIs were calculated if the 153 measurement scales were the same. If different measurement scales were used, we planned to perform standardised mean difference analyses. Outcome measures were converted to metric values where possible e.g. , mg/dL was converted to mmol/L. The conservative random -effects model was used unless the degree of heteroge neity was readily explainable, or when the measure of heterogeneity I2 was less than 25 per cent, in which case the fixed -effect model was used ( Higgins et al., 2011 ). All quantitative analyses adhered to the intention -to-treat models where possible, where by participants were analysed according to the original group to which they were assigned. RR or odds ratios (OR) with 95 per cent CI were calculated for dichotomous data. Unit of analysis issues We planned to include cross -over trials, though none were eligible for inclusion. If cross -over trials are included in future updates, only the first phase of intervention will be included as there is insufficient data to determine a minimum wash -out perio d for Ganoderma lucidum . Dealing with missing data Where possible, data were extracted from intention -to-treat analyses. If data or study information were missing, the first or corresponding author was contacted for further information. Additional inform ation retrieved from authors is italicised in the extraction forms and clearly indicated in the review text. Assessment of heterogeneity Data was pooled in the meta -analysis if the trials were sufficiently clinically homogenous for participants, interven tions and outcomes. The Chi-squared test for heterogeneity was used to obtain the I2 statistic, which describes the proportion of inter-trial statistical inconsistency. I2 values were interpreted using the following guide: 154 0-40 per cent might not be impor tant 30-60 per cent may represent moderate heterogeneity 50-90 per cent may represent substantial heterogeneity 75-100 per cent considerable heterogeneity Where heterogeneity could not readily be explained, we used a random -effects model to incorporate heterogeneous trials in the meta -analysis. The statistical heterogeneity of data included in the meta -analysis was evaluated visually by inspecting overlap of CIs in forest plots. Data synthesis Statistical analyses were performed with the Cochrane statistical package Review Manager 5. Data were entered by one reviewer (FH) and checked by a second reviewer (NK). Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterog eneity If data were sufficient, we planned to perform subgroup analyses according to: 1. Dosage where comparable and possible 2. Duration of treatment 3. Severity of illness 4. Age Sensitivity analysis We planned to perform sensitivity analyses by excluding: (1) unpublished studies , and (2) studies with high risk of bias. If all trials were found to have a high risk of bias, we planned to perform the sensitivity analysis by excluding studies that did not have adequate allocation concealment or participant blinding . If one or more outliers were thought to contribute to heterogeneity and a reason for the outlying result was apparent, we planned to perform a sensitivity analysis by excluding outliers. 155 Results Description of studies Electronic searches retrieved a to tal of 4 ,405 citations (29 from CENTRAL; 71 from PubMed; 1 from Science Direct; 470 from EMBASE; 23 from MD Consult; 13 from Stat!Ref -Medical; 144 Biomed Central; Scopus; 284 from CINAHL; 1,051 from Current Contents; 462 from Health and Medic al Complete; 351 from Science Citations Index; 976 from BIOSIS; 10 from Current Controlled Trials; 9 from the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry; 6 from CentreWatch Clinical Trials Listing Service; 26 from clinicaltrials.gov; 0 from Chines e Biomedical Literature Database; 0 from Chinese Medical Current Contents; 22 from China Network Knowledge Infrastructure; 50 from VIP Database). English language translations of reports published in a Chinese language were obtained as required , to determine eligibility. Six studies were identified as being potentially relevant. No additional potentially re levant study was identified by either checking reference lists of included studies; personal communication with authors in the relevant field; medicinal mushroom research centres or relevant ph armaceutical companies; or hand -searching of the International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms. Included studies Four trials with a total of 375 participants were eligible for inclusion ( Gao et al., 2004 a, b, Klupp , Bensoussan, Kiat, Hawke & Chang, 2011 ; Wang et al., 2008 ). All four trials were identified by electronic searching. Klupp et al. (2011) was identified as a clinical trial protocol through the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. Res earchers for Klupp et al. (2011) provided unpublished data for use in this review. Wang et al. (2008) was published in a Chinese language and translated by one review author (HC). Details of these trials are presented in the 'Characteristics of included st udies '. Trial duration was 12 -16 weeks. All studies were placebo -controlled trials of G anoderma lucidum mushroom capsules of 3 g to 5.4 g per day. 156 Gao et al. (2004 b) evaluated Ganoderma lucidum (5.4 g per day) in 71 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus ov er 12 weeks. Gao et al. (2004a) evaluated Ganoderma lucidum (5.4 g per day) in 170 people with coronary heart disease over 12 weeks. Gao et al. ( 2004 b) and Gao et al. (2004a ) did not report data suitable for between - group comparison in Review Manager 5. These a uthors did not respond to requests for additional information. As such, these studies could not be included in meta - analyses. Klupp et al. (2011) evaluated Ganoderma lucidum (3 g per day) in 84 people with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mel litus over 16 weeks. Among participants receiving G anoderma lucidum , a subgroup of participants received Cordyceps sinensis , comprising 25 per cent or less of the total active ingredient. Klupp and colleagues provided additional information and data for us e in this systematic review. Wang et al. (2008) evaluated Ganoderma lucidum (3 g per day) in 50 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus over 12 weeks. It was deemed highly likely that data for fasting plasma glucose contained an error. Wang et al. (2008) re ported the endpoint mean of the placebo group is 187.9 (49) mg/dL. Our comparisons and calculations suggest this SD value is not 49 mg/dL; but rather, 4.9 mg/dL. We attempted to contact the corresponding author by post, however, our mail was returned to se nder. We could not locate a current postal or e-mail address for any listed author. Rather than impute an unconfirmed value, we chose to exclude this data from analysis. Excluded studies Two of the potentially relevant trials were excluded upon reading the full text versions (see excluded studies ). Jin et al. (1996 ) was not a randomised or controlled clinical trial and Wachtel -Galor et al. (2004 a) studied effects in healthy participants. 157 Risk of bias in included studies The r isk of bias of included studies is presented in Figure 1 and summarised in Figure 2 . Only one trial ( Klupp et al., 2011 ) was evaluated as having a low risk of bias on all items. The study by Wang et al. (2008 ) was designated as having an unclear risk of bi as on all items, except for item 'other bias ', which presented low risk. Gao et al. ( 2004 a) and Gao et al. (2004b) both had an unclear risk of bias on most items. The exceptions were for the items 'other bias ', which was deemed low risk, and 'selective reporting ', which was considered to have high risk of bias. Random sequence generation (selection bias) One trial reported random sequence generation using a computer ( Klupp et al., 2011 ). The process of random sequence generation for the other trials ( Gao et al., 2004 a, b; Wang et al., 2008 ) was unclear. Allocation concealment (selection bias) One trial reported concealing allocation order by using coded bottles labelled off -site by staff not associated with the research ( Klupp et al., 2011 ). It is not clear whether or not other trials concealed their allocation order s (Gao et al., 2004 a, b; Wang et al., 2008 ). Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) One trial ( Klupp et al., 2011 ) provided sufficient information to permit judgement regarding the risk of bias due to completeness of outcome data. In Klupp et al. (2011 ), missing outcome data were balanced in numbers across groups (with similar reasons for missing data across group), reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related to the true outcome, and missing data were imputed using appropriate methods. For all other studies ( Gao et al., 2004 a, b; Wang et al., 2008 ), insufficient information was reported to permit judgement of risk of bias. 158 Selective reporting (reporting bias) One trial (Klupp et al., 2011 ) prespecified primary outcomes and reported complete results according to that protocol. Gao et al. (2004 a) and Gao et al. (2004b) did not specify primary outcomes, selectively reported key expected outcomes and presented incomplete res ults for outcomes. No data from these studies could be used in meta - analyses. Of note, Gao et al. ( 2004 a) did not report data for fasting plasma glucose, which is an expected primary outcome for a clinical trials for diabetes mellitus. Both Gao et al. (2004a) and Gao et al. (2004b) were judged to have a high risk of reporting bias due to selective reporting. Wang et al. ( 2008 ) did not specify primary outcome measures , and it is unclear whether the reported outcomes were selected from a larger number of outc omes. Wang et al. ( 2008 ) was judged as having an unclear risk of bias. Other bias All four trials are at low risk of other biases. Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) One trial ( Klupp et al., 2011 ) reported sufficient information to permit a judgement of a low risk of bias. Three trials ( Gao et al., 2004 a, b; Wang et al., 2008 ) did not report sufficient information to permit a judgement of risk of bias. Although they reported using a placebo intervention, there were no details about personnel blinding. Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) One trial ( Klupp et al., 2011 ) reported sufficient information to permit a judgement of a low risk of bias. Three trials ( Gao et al., 2004 a, b; Wang et al., 2008 ) did not report sufficient information to permit a judgement of risk of bias. 159 Effects of interventions In total, 202 participants were allocated to a group receiving Ganoderma lucidum and 173 participants were allocated to a group rec eiving placebo . Details of all interventions are provided in the tables 'Characteristics of included studies '. Two of the four trials, Klupp et al. (2011 ) and Wang et al. ( 2008 ), presented summary statistics appropriate for use in analyses. Gao et al. ( 2004a) and Gao et al. (2004b) did not report d ata suitable for use in between -group co mparisons in Review Manager 5. These a uthors did not respond to requests for additional information. Comparisons are ordered according to the types of outcome measures in the methods section. Analyses containing data from only one study are summarised in Table 1 and Table 2 . All analyses are displayed as forest plots in Figure 3. Comparisons 1 to 3: Fasting plasma glucose Klupp et al., ( 2011 ) compared Ganoderma l ucidu m with placebo at 8, 16 and 24 weeks. The i ntervention period was 16 weeks, followed by an observational wash - out period of 8 weeks. Wang et al. ( 2008 ) compared Ganoderma l ucidum with placebo at 12 weeks; however , the reviewers deemed these data to contain an error and it was excluded from analysis. Differences in fasting plasma glucose between groups were not statistically significant after 8 weeks (WMD 0.80 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI -0.35-1.95)( Analysis 1.1 ); 12 to16 weeks (WMD 0.30 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI -0.95-1.55)( Analysis 1.2 ); or 24 weeks (WMD 1.00 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI - 0.18-2.18)( Analysis 1.3 ). Comparisons 4 to 6: HbA1 c Klupp et al. (2011 ) compared Ganoderma l ucidum with placebo at 8, 16 and 24 weeks. The i ntervention period was 16 weeks, followed by an observational wash - out period of 8 weeks. Wang et al. ( 2008 ) compared Ganoderma l ucidum with placebo at 12 weeks. 12 -week data from Wang et al. ( 2008 ) was pooled with 16 - week data from Klupp et al. ( 2011 ) for meta -analysis. The d ifferences in HbA1 c 160 between groups were not statistically significant at 8 weeks (WMD 0.30 per cent ; 95 per cent CI -0.33-0.93)( Analysis 1.4 ) or 12 to16 weeks (WMD -0.10 per cent ; 95 per cent CI -1.05-0.85)( Analysis 1.5 ), but was statistically significant in favour of the placebo group at 24 weeks (WMD 0.70 per cent ; 95 per cent CI 0.06 -1.34)( Analysis 1.6). As per protocol, sensitivity analysis was performed for the 12 to 16 -week meta - analysis by excluding unpublished data ( Klupp et al., 2011 ). On sensitivity analysis, the difference in fasting plasma glucose between the groups was not statistically significant (WMD -0.60 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI -1.34-0.14)( Analysis 1.5 ). Comparison 7: 2 hour post prandial blood glucose Wang et al. (2008 ) compared Ganoderma l ucidum with placebo at 12 weeks. The differenc e between groups in 2 hour post prandial blood glucose was statistically significant after 12 weeks in favour of placebo (WMD 0.7 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI 0.29-1.11)( Analysis 1.7 ). Comp arison 8: Plasma glucose under the curve at the 4th hour after the meal tolerance test Wang et al. ( 2008 ) compared Ganoderma l ucidum with placebo at 12 weeks. The difference between groups in plasma glucose under the curve at the 4th hour after the meal tolerance test was statistically significant after 12 weeks in favour of Ganoderma lucidum (WMD -49.40 mg/dl.h; 95 per cent CI -77.21 to - 21.59)( Analysis 1.8 ). There is a paucity of information regarding normal and atypical responses to 4 hour glucos e tolerance testing, making determination of clinical significance difficult. Comparison 9 to 11: Arterial pressure Klupp et al. ( 2011 ) compared Ganoderma l ucidum with placebo at 8, 16 and 24 weeks. The d ifferences in arterial pressure between groups wer e not statistically significant after 8 weeks (WMD 1.90 mmHg; 95 per cent CI -33.62 -37.42)( Analysis 161 1.9); 16 weeks (WMD 0.30 mmHg; 95 per cent CI -4.59-5.19)( Analysis 1.10 ); or 24 weeks (WMD -3.20 mmHg; 95 per cent CI -8.66-2.26)( Analysis 1.11 ). Comparison 12 to 14: Triglycerides Klupp et al. ( 2011 ) compared Ganoderma l ucidum with placebo at 8, 16 and 24 weeks. The i ntervention period was 16 weeks, followed by an observation al wash - out period of 8 weeks. The d ifferences in triglycerides between g roups were not statistically significant after 8 weeks (WMD -0.10 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI -0.47- 0.27)( Analysis 1.12 ); 16 weeks (WMD 0.3 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI -0.43 to 1.03)( Analysis 1.13 ); or 24 weeks (WMD -0.10 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI -0.68- 0.48)( Analysis 1.14). Comparison 15 to 17: Total cholesterol Klupp et al. ( 2011 ) compared Ganoderma l ucidum with placebo at 8, 16 and 24 weeks. The i ntervention period was 16 weeks, followed by an observation al wash - out period of 8 weeks. The d ifferences in total chole sterol between groups were not statistically significant after 8 weeks (WMD -0.20 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI -0.71- 0.31)( Analysis 1.15 ); 16 weeks (WMD -0.10 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI -0.69- 0.49)( Analysis 1.16 ); or 24 weeks (WMD -0.30 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI -0.84- 0.24)( Analysis 1.17 ). Comparison 18 to 20: High lipoprotein Ganoderma l ucidum with p lacebo at 8, 16 and 24 weeks. The d ifferences in high-density lipoprotein between groups were not statistically significant after 8 w eeks (WMD 0.10 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI -0.05- 0.25)( Analysis 1.18 ); 16 weeks (WMD 0.00 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI -0.13- 0.13)( Analysis 1.19 ); or 24 weeks (WMD 0.00 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI -0.15- 0.15)( Analysis 1.20 ). 162 Comparison 21 to 23: Low -density lipoprotein al. ( 2011 ) compared Ganoderma l ucidum with placebo at 8, 16 and 24 weeks. The d ifferences in low-density lipoprotein between groups were not statistically significant after 8 weeks (WMD 0.10 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI -0.39- 0.59)( Analysis 1.21 ); 16 weeks (WMD 0.00 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI -0.48- 0.48)( Analysis 1.22 ); or 24 weeks (WMD -0.30 mmol/L; 95 per cent CI -0.74- 0.14)( Analysis 1.23 ). Comparison 24 to 26: Waist circumference Klupp et al. ( 2011 ) compared Ganoderma l ucidum with placebo at 8, 16 and 24 weeks. The i ntervention period was 16 weeks, followed by an observational wash - out period of 8 weeks. Differences in waist circumference between groups were not statistically significant after 8 weeks (WMD -0.05 cm; 95 per cent CI -7.38- 6.38)( Analysis 1.24); 16 weeks (WMD -2.8 cm; 95 per cent CI -9.28-3.68)( Analysis 1.25); or 24 weeks (WMD -0.2 cm; 95 per cent CI -6.53-6.13)( Analysis 1.26 ). Comparison 27 to 29: Body mass index Klupp et al. ( 2011 ) compared Ganoderma l ucidum with placebo at 8, 16 and 24 weeks. The i ntervention period was 16 weeks, followed by an observation al wash - out period of 8 weeks. The d ifferences in BMI between groups were not statistically significant after 8 weeks (WMD 0.10; 95 per cent CI -3.14-3.34)( Analysis 1.27 ); 16 weeks (WM D -0.1; 95 per cent CI -3.25-3.05)( Analysis 1.28 ); or 24 weeks (WMD 1.30; 95 per cent CI -1.81-4.41)( Analysis 1.29 ). Comparison 30 to 32: C -reactive protein Klupp et al. ( 2011 ) compared Ganoderma l ucidum with placebo at 8, 16 and 24 weeks. The d ifference s in C -reactive protein between groups were not statistically significant after 8 weeks (WMD -1.50 mg/L; 95 per cent CI -3.09-0.09)( Analysis 163 1.30); 16 weeks (WMD -0.20 mg/L; 95 per cent CI -2.64-2.24)( Analysis 1.31 ); or 24 weeks (WMD 2.10 mg/L; 95 per cent CI -0.96-5.16)( Analysis 1.32 ). Comparison 33 to 35: Apolipoprotein A Klupp et al. (2011) compared Ganoderma l ucidum with placebo at 8, 16 and 24 weeks. The i ntervention period was 16 weeks, followed by an observation al wash - out period of 8 weeks. The d ifferences in apolipoprotein A between groups were statistically significant in favour of the placebo group after 8 weeks (WMD -0.60 g/L; 95 per cent CI -0.73 to -0.47)( Analysis 1.33 ) and 24 weeks (WMD -0.60 g/L; 95 per cent CI -0.73 to -0.47)( Analysis 1.3 4), but not after 16 weeks (WMD 0.00 g/L; 95 per cent CI -0.13-0.13)( Analysis 1.35 ). Comparison 36 to 38: Apolipoprotein B Klupp et al. (2011) compared Ganoderma l ucidum with placebo at 8, 16 and 24 weeks. Difference in a polipoprotein B between groups wa s statistically significant in favour of the placebo group after 8 weeks (WMD 0.20 g/L; 95 per cent CI 0.11 - 0.29)( Analysis 1.36 ), but not after 16 weeks (WMD -0.00 g/L; 95 per cent CI -0.13- 0.13)( Analysis 1.37 ) or 24 weeks (WMD 0.00 g/L; 95 per cent CI -0.12- 0.12)( Analysis 1.38 ). Comparison 39 to 41: Health -related quality of life (physical) Klupp et al. (2011) compared Ganoderma l ucidum with placebo at 8, 16 and 24 weeks. The i ntervention period was 16 weeks, followed by an observational wash - out period of 8 weeks . The d ifferences between groups in health -related quality of life (physical) were not statistically significant after 8 weeks (WMD -2.55; 95 per cent CI -5.78-0.68)( Analysis 1.39 ); 16 weeks (WMD -0.10; 95 per cent CI -3.38- 3.18)( Analysis 1.40 ); or 24 weeks (WMD 0.20; 95 per cent CI -3.77-4.17)( Analysis 1.41). 164 Comparison 42 to 44: Health -related quality of life (mental) Klupp et al.

Comparison 45 to 52: Adverse events Klupp et al. (2011) compared Ganoderma l ucidum (GL) with placebo control (C) at from 0 to 16 weeks (intervention period), and from 16 to 24 weeks (observational wash -out period). Differences in the total number of adverse events between groups were not statistically significant from 0 to 16 weeks (GL 161 per cent v. C 160 per cent; RR 1.02, 95 per cent CI not estimable)( Analysis 1.45 ) or 16 to 24 weeks (GL 33 per cent v. C 27 per cent ; RR 0.91, 95 per cent CI 0.6 8-1.21)( Analysis 1.46 ). Differences in the number of anticipated adverse events between groups were statistically significant from 0 to 16 weeks (GL 57 per cent v. C 33 per cent ; RR 0.64, 95 per cent CI 0.43 -0.95)( Analysis 1.47 ) and from16 to 24 weeks (GL 9 per cent v. C 0 per cent ; RR 0.91, 95 per cent CI 0.83 -0.01)( Analysis 1.48 ). Anticipated adverse events included mild headache, fatigue, and gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, diarrhoea or constipation. No participant in either group demonstrated a ny adverse effect to the liver. One participant demonstrated an adverse effect to the kidney, which occurred in the 16 -24 week non -intervention period. The d ifference between groups was not statistically significant (GL 2 per cent v. C 0 per cent ; RR 0.99, 95 per cent CI 0.93 -1.05). Discussion Summary of results This review includes four studies; three published and one unpublished. Two of the published studies ( Gao et al., 2004 a, b) did not provide control group data and therefore could not be used for statistical analysis. Published data by Wang et al. 165 (2008) and unpublished data provided by researchers for Klupp et al. (2011) were suitable for analysis. Both these studies investig ated the effects of 3 g Ganoderma lucidum, daily, in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Wang et al. (2008) evaluated 50 participants over 12 weeks and Klupp et al. (2011) evaluated 84 participants over 16 weeks. Only one primary outcome comparison w as suitable for meta -analysis: there was no statistically or clinically s ignificant improvement in HbA1c at the end of the intervention period for persons taking Ganoderma lucidum . This was supported by sensitivity analysis. Single study analysis from Klupp e t al. (2011) found improvement for those in the placebo group by 0.7 per cent HbA1 c (95 per cent CI 0.06-1.34) after an 8-week post intervention wash -out period. For fasting plasma glucose, no difference was found between the groups during, or after, the intervention period. Single study results Wang et al. ( 2008 ) for post prandial glucose were mixed. Analysis of '2 hour postprandial blood glucose ' found a statistically significant reduction of 0.7 mmol/L (95 per cent CI 0.29 -1.11) for those taking placebo . However, the same study found statistical significance favouring Ganoderma lucidum for another postprandial measure , 'plasma glucose under the curve at the 4th hour'. The difference between groups was -49.4 mg/dL/h (95 per cent CI -77.21 to -21.59], but there is a paucity of information regarding normal and atypical curve values for 4 hour glucose tolerance testing, making determination of clinical significance difficult. For the other primary outcome measures, there was single study evidence of no effect for blood pressure, triglycerides and cholesterol. Of the secondary outco mes, an improvement in a polipoprotein A of 0.6 g/L (95 per cent CI 0.47 -0.73) and 0.6 g/L ( 95 per cent CI -0.73) were found ( Klupp et al., 2011 ) for the placebo group at 8 weeks and 24 weeks, respectively. In the same study, there was also a statistically significant effect in favour of the placebo group for apolipoprotein B at 8 weeks 0.20 g/L (95 per cent CI 0.11 -0.29, but not at 16 or 24 weeks . None of these results are clinic ally significant enough to suggest harm from Ganoderma lucidum . There were no statistically significant differences between the groups for any other secondary outcome measure. These include d waist circumference, BMI , C-reactive protein or health -related qu ality of life. 166 There was no statistically significant greater risk of liver, kidney or total adverse events for those taking Ganoderma lucidum than those taking placebo ( Klupp et al., 2011) . However, there was a statistically significant increase in the r isk of mild anticipated adverse events during the intervention period (57 per cent v. 33 per cent ; RR 0.37, 95 per cent CI 0.15 -0.94) and the postintervention follow -up period (9 per cent v. 0 per cent ; RR 0.15, 95 per cent CI 0.01 -2.76). Anticipated adverse events included fatigue, headache and mild gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, diarrhoea or constipation. Completeness of findings This review searched a comprehensive range of databases, including Chinese language databases. No language res trictions were placed on the search and screening stages, and subsequently, a Chinese language publication was included in this review. Both the English and Chinese searches were updated before review finalisation. Of the four included studies, only two t rials, Wang et al. ( 2008 ) and Klupp et al. (2011) , reported data suitable for analysis. The publications of Gao et al. ( 2004 a, b) did no t report any control group data . As these authors did not, or could not, respond to requests for additional information, data from these two published clinical trials could not be included in this review. Although single study data was available for all primary outcomes, meta -analysis (from two studies) could only be performed for HbA1c. Although fasting plasma glucose was evaluated in two studies, there was a high probability of error in the data from Wang et al. (2008) and hence it was excluded from analysis. These authors could also not be contacted. Secondary outcome measures that were specified in the protocol but not e valuated by studies in this review include insulin, fibrinogen and homocysteine. Furthermore, where analyses were conducted from single studies, there is greater chance of outcomes being under powered. This is particularly important for more variable outcom es, such as blood pressure. 167 Both studies included in meta -analyses evaluated the efficacy of 3 g of Ganoderma lucidum taken for between 12 and 16 weeks. The 24 -week analyses by Klupp et al. (2011) evaluated effects on outcomes after 8 weeks without interv ention. The effect on outcomes might differ if taken in higher doses or for longer treatment periods. However, both trials used capsules of Ganoderma lucidum extract powder, which is considered the most potent delivery of the mushroom for medicinal purpose s. One of these studies ( Klupp et al., 2011) reported that participants were required to take 8 capsules per day to ingest 3 g of Ganoderma lucidum, which suggests compliance might be a barrier for studies evaluating higher dosages of a similar interventio n. Judgement of external validity This review includes a limited number of studies and only one outcome measure could be analysed with pooled data. Therefore most results in this review represent settings and participants of single clinical trials. Repor ting limitations for Wang et al. (2008 ) have implications for external validity , as no information was provided regarding recruitment, setting or country. The clinical trial by Klupp et al. (2011) recruited from the general community across Sydney, Austral ia. Both Wang et al. (2008 ) and Klupp et al. (2011) evaluated effects of Ganoderma lucidum in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The participants of the Klupp et al. (2011) study also had metabolic syndrome. These studies did not evaluate Ganoderma lucidum for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk factors, and did not include participants with impaired glucose tolerance ( prediabetes). The results of this review also cannot be generalised to those with more sev ere health presentations that were exclusion criteria of the studies. These include persons with renal or hepato -biliary impairment, hypoglycaemic events or requiring insulin or periods of hospitalisation. Klupp et al. (2011) also reported that pregnant wo men were excluded. Although Wang et al. ( 2008 ) did not specify the exclusion of pregnant women, the results of this review should not be assumed applicable to gestational diabetes. Ganoderma lucidum is most commonly used in traditional Chinese medi cine, b ut increasingly used in W estern society. This review aimed to evaluate efficacy and 168 safety of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of cardiovascular risk factors. In traditional Chinese medicine, the diagnostic approach to cardiovascular risk differs from that presented in this review, and the intervention is unlikely to be prescribed in isolation. As such, the results of this review are mo re relevant for application in Western medicine and less relevant for application within a traditional Chinese medicine para digm. Quality The lack of quality repor ting for three of the studies ( Gao et al., 2004 a, b; Wang et al. 2008 ) impacts on the results of this review. No data from Gao et al. ( 2004 a) and Gao et al. (2004b) could be included in analyses. The only published study from which data was extracted for use in this review ( Wang et al., 2008 ) had unclear risk of bias for nearly all items. For HbA1c, data from this trial could be pooled for analysis with data from Klupp et al. (2011) . Although the CIs from the two tri als overlapped, the direction of effect differed within each individual study. That Wang et al. ( 2008 ) found in favour of Ganoderma lucidum while Klupp et al. (2011) found in favour of placebo might be due to the unclear but potentially higher risk of bias of the Wang et al. (2008 ) study. Although Klupp et al. (2011) was judged to have low risk of bias on all items, the information from this trial is as yet unpublishe d and has not been subject to peer review. Overall, due to limitations and concerns about quality, a robust conclusion cannot be drawn for consistency, size and direction of outcome effects in this review. Potential biases The main potential bias for thi s review is that one reviewer (NK) provided unpublished data for use in this review. Other reviewers (FH, DC, AB and HK) were also involved in Klupp et al. (2011) . However, the clinical trial was registered with the Australia n and New Zealand Clinical Tria l Registry and all data provided by NK is consistent with the online protocol. The characteristics and potential for bias of Klupp et al. (2011) were independently evaluated by one other reviewer (HC) not involved in the study. 169 There are challenges ac cessing Chinese literature about Ganoderma lucidum . Much of the knowledge base is grey literature, which our search strategy might not have captured. Also, until recently, research in traditional Chinese medicine did not utilise placebo or control groups as a standard feature of clinical trials. Although excluding this research does not introduce bias, it is important to note that there is an evidence base in China unsuitable for inclusion in a systematic review such as this. Ganoderma lucidum might also have b een combined with multiple herbal interventi ons, as frequently utilised in E astern medicine. A further potential for bias was that only one reviewer was able to screen Chinese titles and abstracts for inclusion. Agreement and disagreement with other studi es This is the only systematic review evaluating Ganoderma lucidum for cardiovascular risk factors. We have aimed for all randomised and controlled clinical trials on this topic to be included. Commentary on this topic frequently reports positive finding s from the literature for effectiveness of Ganoderma lucidum . These reports are frequently based on animal, in vitro or human case studies. Any larger human research studies are often pretest/post -test designs without comparative controls. Such studies are unsuitable for determining efficacy and safety in humans. There is disagreement between studies included in this review. One study ( Gao et al., 2004 a) reported that taking Ganoderma lucidum reduced blood glucose and improved diabetes. Despite conducting a double -blind randomised study, the publication only described pretest/post -test results for the intervention group and therefore its data could not be included in statistical analysis. Its likely that these within -group changes would find greater effect sizes, favouring intervention, than the between -group comparisons as used in this review. Gao et al. ( 2004a ) also reported that Ganoderma lucidum improved blood pressure and cholesterol, but selective reporting and unclear between -group analyses similarly expose a high risk of biased 170 positive results. These were the key reasons that Gao et al. ( 2004 a) and Gao et al. (2004b) could not be included in meta -analysis. Wang et. al (2008) describe in their publication that there was greater reduction for 2 hour postprandial glucose in the Ganoderma lucidum group. This differs to our result of statistical significance in favour of placebo. These findings might differ depending on whether endpoint or change scores were used for analyses. As per Cochrane recommendat ions, our protocol specified that endpoint scores would be used for all analyses, whereas Wang et al. (2008) appear to have described change scores. Authors ' conclusions Implications for practice Evidence from existing randomised and controlled trials do es not support the use of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment o f cardiovascular risk factors. This e vidence is limited to two studies in which all participants had type 2 diabetes mellitus. There was evidence of no effect for the primary outcomes of this revie w; HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure, triglycerides and cholesterol profile. There were mixed findings regarding postprandial glucose from a single study. These results are for effects of Ganoderma lucidum at a dosage of 3 g daily for 12 -16 wee ks. There is evidence that Ganoderma lucidum is safe in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus. There was no increase in total adverse events for those taking Ganoderma lucidum , and no evidence of renal or hepatic effects. There was, however, evidence that mild adverse events were significantly higher in those taking Ganoderma lucidum . This supports traditional advice that commencement of Ganoderma lucidum might cause mild fatigue, headache, nausea, constipation and diarrhoea. The evidence base for treating cardiovascular risk factors with Ganoderma lucidum is weakened by methodological and reporting quality limitations. This review evaluated Ganoderma lucidum in a W estern medicine context and therefore results might be less generalisable to traditional Chine se medicine. 171 Implications for research Research into the efficacy and safety of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of cardiovascular risk factors is in its infancy. Much of the research conducted thus far is difficult to evaluate because of poor quality r eporting. Future studies should be designed to ensure a low risk of bias and to meet current reporting standards for clinical trials. Recommendations to improve the evidence base of Ganoderma lucidum for cardiovascul ar risk factor include: increasing the sample size for some outcome measures not adequately powered by existing studies (for ex ample, blood pressure); evaluating efficacy in persons with impaired glucose tolerance for the prevention of diabetes; evalu ating efficacy in persons with more severe pr esentations of diabetes and cardi ovascular disease; and evaluating effectiveness of Ganoderma lucidum within a traditional Chinese medicine context.

These are Capewell et al., 2010 and World Health Organization, 2011 . The methodological assessment as per protocol was updated according to current Cochrane guidelines. The primary outcome 'incidence rates of any of the above ' as listed in the protocol was changed to 'prevalence of any of the above '. The term 'change in ' that preceded outcome measures has been removed. This suggested change scores would be used but end -scores were used. In addition to the screening process as per the protocol, one additional reviewer (HC) evaluated Chinese language titles an abstracts. Due to changes in institutional access and database availability, the following databases were not searched as planned: 173 Blackwell Synergy Australian Medical Index Expanded Academic UK National Research Register Allied and Complem entary Medicine Database Centralis ed Information Service for Complementary Medicine Traditional Chinese Medical Literatur e Analysis and Retrieval Syst em Chinese Dissertation Database Chinese Academic Conference Papers China Medical Academic Conference System for Informati on on Grey Literature in Europe In addition to databases listed in the protocol, the following databases were searched for Chinese la nguage publications: China Network Knowledge Infrastruction VIP database In the protocol, it was stated that Ganoderma lucidum must be the only intervention. This was deemed too restrictive and was modified to allow for a lesser secondary constituent. Th e protocol was changed to 'Ganoderma lucidum is frequently combined with a second ingredient aimed to increase potency. Trials evaluating a combined formulation were included if there was only one additional ingredient and Ganoderma lucidum represented at least 75 per cent of constituent weight. ' Outcome measures were converted to metric values where possible e.g. , mg/dL was converted to mmol/L. 174 Characteristics of Studies Char acteristics of included studies Gao et al.

On the day of receiving the meal tolerance test, 187 patients had a fasting blood test and were then provided with breakfast containing 1/5 of the whole day 's energy intake, compris ing 55 per cent carbohydrate, 30 per cent fat and 15 per cent protein. Blood collections were performed 1 hr, 2 hrs, 3 hrs and 4 hrs after the breakfast to test blood glucose levels and calculate plasma glucose under the curve Notes The reported endpoint mean of the placebo group is 187.9 (49) mg/dL. Our comparisons and calculations suggest this SD value is not 49 mg/dL, but rather, 4.9 mg/dL 188 Wang et al.

For type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, this increase is regarded as epidemic, with significant long term health consequences for individuals and societies. It is not surprising that a potential natural treatment 'polypill', Ganoderma lucidum , should gain consumer, medical and research attention. Our randomised controlled trial and systematic review aim ed to determine the effect of Ganoderma lucidum on cardiovascular risk factors. However, for this randomised controlled trial, we were additionally interested in the effect on multiple cardiovascular risk factors and therefore participants were also requir ed to have metabolic syndrome. Not only has the risk cluster of metabolic syndrome received considerable clinical and research attention, but its individual components have each been researched for effects by Ganoderma lucidum in pre -clinical studies with promising findings. This doctoral research aimed to build on preliminary animal and in vitro research findings to determine the safety and efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of pharmacologically modifiable cardiovascular risk factors in humans. The randomised clinical trial (Study 1) specified hyperglycaemia as the primary outcome measure. Because there was no summary score for measuring metabolic syndrome, and no single factor deemed most important, hyperglycaemia was selected for having the mo st compelling preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of Ganoderma lucidum . Effects on the other four components of metabolic syndrome and health -related quality of life were selected for secondary observations. This differs from the systematic review (S tudy 2). The review was performed to search for further evidence that could expand upon, or be combined with, the data of the randomised clinical trial to improve power and generalisability. For the review, it was not required that persons had metabolic sy ndrome, although it was necessary 211 that Ganoderma lucidum treatment was prescribed for a cardiovascular -related disorder. The primary research outcomes for the systematic review included hyperglycaemia, but were expanded to include hypertension and dyslipid aemia. For clarity in this discussion, the effects of Ganoderma lucidum on hyperglycaemia will be examined as the primary research question and effects on blood pressure and lipids will be addressed in the next section. The two outcome measures used most frequently to measure hyperglycaemia are fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c. Neither of these outcomes improved following use of Ganoderma lucidum in the clinical trial, nor was any effect identified in the systematic review. In the randomised clinical trial the benefit was in favour of the control group : by 0.13 per cent for HbA1c and 0.03 mmol/L for fasting plasma glucose. The magnitude of this effect is negligible, does not suggest harm from the intervention and is best described as showing no effect betwe en the groups. In the systematic review, three other trials were identified that evaluated effects of Ganoderma lucidum on hyperglycaemia. However, two of these trials (Gao et al., 2004 a, b) did not report between -group effect sizes or provide control gro up data for calculation of this treatment effect. Within -group differences are significantly exposed to threats to validity and therefore none of the results from these studies could be used. The third study , by Wang et al. (2008) , did report complete resu lts; however , there was an error in their fasting plasma glucose data. The authors reported the endpoint mean and SD of the placebo group as 187.9 (49) mg/dL. Our calculations suggest this standard deviation value might not be 49 mg/dL, but rather, 4.9 mg/ dL. Despite multiple attempts, the authors of these three studies could not be contacted. This left only one outcome from the study by Wang et al. (2008) that could be combined with our results from the clinical trial. Wang et al. (2008) evaluated HbA1c i n 50 participants taking 3 g Ganoderma lucidum for 12 weeks. A meta - analysis pooled this data with that of our clinical trial of 84 participants, also taking 3 g Ganoderma lucidum per day, but over 16 weeks. The result was a weighted mean difference of -0.1 per cent (95 per cent CI -1.05-0.85) HbA1c in favour of the 212 intervention, which was not clinically or statistically significant. Examining the studies separately, Wang et al. (2008) had found a mean difference of 0.6 per cent HbA1c in favour of the intervention, whilst we found a 0.37 per cent HbA1c mean difference in favour of the control group. These results should be interpreted in the context of quality of evidence. Of the seven domains for risk of bias, the Wang et al. (2008) study was considere d to be at low risk of bias for only one domain; all others categories had an unclear risk of bias. In contrast, our randomised clinical trial was awarded a low risk of bias for all seven domains. As increasing risk of bias is known to increase effect size s in favour of interventions (Higgins et al. , 2011 ), this might explain much of the difference between the studies. In addition to these outcome measures, Wang et al. (2008) also measured the effect of Ganoderma lucidum on postprandial blood glucose leve ls. These single study analyses produced inconsistent results. Findings were in favour of the control group for the measure '2 hour postprandial blood glucose ' (0.7 mmol/L, 95 per cent CI 0.29-1.11) but in favour of Ganoderma lucidum for 'plasma glucose un der the curve at the 4th hour' (-49.4 mg/dL/h, 95 per cent CI -77.21 to -21.59). It was difficult to determine the clinical significance of the latter result. Measurement of plasma glucose under the curve is usually performed at the 2 or 3 hour time point. No references for normal range or clinically meaningful improvement could be found for 4 hour 'under the curve' measures. Considering the other postprandial result favoured the control group, the clinical interpretation for a 4 hour time measure is limite d, and the risk of bias is largely uncertain, this positive result does not represent strong evidence of effect. Overall, the small number of included trials has weakened the significance of the systematic review findings. It may have been noticed that e ffect sizes from the same data differed between the randomised clinical trial and the systematic review. This is because the clinical trial used ANCOVA linear regression to determine results, whilst the Cochrane Review Manager software (Revman) performs tw o-group comparisons with either end scores or change scores representing control and intervention group effects (Higgins & Green, 2009) . The optimum analysis technique depends, in part, upon the data and 213 the Cochrane Collaboration recommendation provides a n appropriate and consistent strategy. However, for continuous data with no anticipated floor and ceiling effects, more optimal estimation of treatment can be achieved using ANCOVA that adjusts for baseline differences (Twisk & Proper, 2004) . This method w as chosen for the clinical trial analysis. As a type of linear regression, it corrects for regression toward the mean and calculates an effect size that is usually a compromise between what would be determined using only end or change scores. Using these t wo types of analysis did not produce meaningful differences between any clinical trial and the systematic review results. These findings are not consistent with other research evaluating Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of cardiovascular risk factors. As demonstrated by the systematic review, the existing body of evidence comes from animal and in vitro studies and human studies at high or uncertain risk of bias. In particular, these poorer quality clinical trials have focussed on within -group (before and after) improvements that also measure the placebo effect, the Hawthorne effect, regression towards the mean, natural recovery and other threats to validity. Although these studies provided preliminary inform ation, efficacy can only be established by trials with a low risk of bias using treatment effects estimated from between -group comparisons. 5.1.2 Secondary R esearch Answer At the end of the intervention period of 16 weeks, Ganoderma lucidum was found to have no statistical ly or clinically meaningful effect on any secondary measures of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity or health -related quality of life. All treatment effects were of a negligible magnitude. There were also no possible comparisons betwee n our research and other studies. Wang et al. (2008) measured only hyperglycaemia. Although both trials by Gao et al. (2004 a, b) studied a range of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, these results were also not reported completely and treatment effect s could not be determined. Except for the slight variation due to the analysis techniques, the results of our randomised clinical trial and the systematic review are the same. 214 As discussed in Section 3.4.2., a finding from secondary outcome measures was t hat although the SF -36 scores were not affected by Ganoderma lucidum , participants with metabolic syndrome have poorer physical and mental health quality of life than other Australians. This supports findings by studies in other countries. The specified population of the clinical trial also provided an opportunity to measure the effect of Ganoderma lucidum on metabolic syndrome as a whole entity. There was no difference between Ganoderma lucidum and the control group with regard to improvement s in diagnosti c criteria. After four months of taking the trial medication, two participants from the Ganoderma lucidum group, five participants from the Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis group and six participants from the placebo group no longer met the diagnostic criteria for the metabolic syndrome. Of the secondary and exploratory outcomes, a meaningful change was only observed for C -reactive protein. This inflammatory marker decreased in the intervention group by an average of 0.7 mg/L (95 per cent CI -2.8-1.4) compared to the placebo group. C-reactive protein was not elevated at baseline and the decrease remained within the normal range. Due to the high risk of type 1 error s with multiple analyses in a clinical tri al, no effects can be conclusively attributed to Ganoderma lucidum for exploratory outcomes. Rather, trends are observed to guide future research. These results cautiously support other research studies being conducted about effects of Ganoderma lucidum on markers of inflammation and immunity . A difference between the clinical trial and systematic review was that the review also analysed data at Week 8 and Week 24. The exploratory outcomes apolipoprotein A and apolipoprotein B underwent change during the full duration of the clinical trial. The between -groups comparison for apolipoprotein A was statistically significant in favour of the placebo group at the half -way point (Week 8), and after 8 weeks wash - out from intervention (Week 24), but there was no difference between groups at the primary analysis timepoint of Week 16. The between -group difference for apolipoprotein B was significant also in favour of placebo after 8 weeks, but not at Weeks 16 or 24. This evi dence is not strong enough to suggest harmful effects from Ganoderma lucidum on these lipid -binding proteins. No effect was present at the primary analysis timepoint of 16 weeks and there is a high risk of type 1 error due to 215 multiple timepoint analyses fo r exploratory outcomes. This data might be useful as part of a future meta -analysis with a larger sample size . 216 5.1.3 Safety Research A nswe r Ganoderma lucidum has been used in China and Asia for over 2 ,000 years. Historical evidence describes the mushroom as safe for long term use, but acknowledges there can be mild side effects, such as headache, fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea or constipation . In modern marketing of the product, these anticipated effects might be described as part of the 'detoxificati on process'. The randomised clinical trial included analysis of total adverse events, but also separated analyses according to whether effects were historically associated with, or not associated with, taking Ganoderma lucidum . Our findings were consisten t with traditional advice for taking Ganoderma lucidum . Overall, participants taking Ganoderma lucidum had almost the same rate of adverse events as those taking placebo (RR=1.02) and there were no serious events attributed to the active intervention. Howe ver, we found evidence to support that the above - mentioned mild effects are 1.72 times more likely to be experienced by those taking Ganoderma lucidum , than those taking placebo (RR=1.72). When this analysis was performed by Review Manager 5.1 for the syst ematic review, the risk was conversely described as 0.6 for developing mild side effects if taking placebo. The ratio of total events was close to zero because non -anticipated events were more commonly reported by those taking placebo. These results repres ent risk whilst taking the intervention, and not during the wash -out period when the number of reported events was negligible. Ganoderma lucidum was also found to have no negative effects on kidney or liver function and there were no differences between the groups for the biochemistry panel and blood count analyses . The h ighest frequencies for out-of-range pathology results were noted for urate, gamma -glutamyl transpeptidase and alanine aminotransferase, as might be expected in persons with metabolic syndr ome. No other studies included in the systematic review reported adverse events and therefore no meta -analysis could be performed these or any other safety variables. However, these results are consistent with the current body of knowledge regarding the safety of Ganoderma lucidum . 217 5.1.4 Role of Cordyceps sinensis Cordyceps also has a renowned tradition in Chinese medicine , and like Ganoderma lucidum , has shown potential benefit for the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors. A number of Ganode rma lucidum products have Cordyceps sinensis as an additive. It has been suggested that when used together the two products have synergistic qualities that further increase their medicinal benefit s. To evaluate whether the addition of Cordyceps sinensis provides greater effects than that possible with Ganoderma lucidum alone, a third trial group took a combination herbal medicine . Cordyceps sinensis comprised 24 per cent of the capsule weight in addition to the Ganoderma lucidum component. For the Ganode rma lucidum -only intervention, this additional percentage was comprised predominantly of inert excipient, such that both interventions had comparable amounts of the primary constituent. The strategy for analysis changed when recruitment was slower than an ticipated. It was deemed unlikely that meaningful differences attributable to the Cordyceps sinensis additive could be detected with the reduced sample size. Comparison of primary outcome means between the Ganoderma lucidum and Ganoderma lucidum with Cordy ceps sinensis groups showed no clinically or statistically meaningful difference s. Both these active interventions contained 280 mg of Ganoderma lucidum mushroom extract as the major constituent. A decision was made by the research team to combine the data of the se two groups, thereby increasing the power to detect a true difference for the primary intervention , Ganoderma lucidum . The systematic review identified no studies that had a secondary constituent added to Ganoderma lucidum . Our clinical trial is the only study to measure the effect of Cordyceps sinensis when combined with Ganoderma lucidum . There was no evidence of a beneficial effect from a daily dose of 1.25 g Cordyceps sinensis when added to Ganoderma lucidum . As discussed , the comparison might have been underpowered to detect a difference. Furthermore, higher doses of Cordyceps sinensis as a single or combined intervention might produce more beneficial effects. 218 5.2 Reasons for Results There are two possible reasons for the research result : either the intervention is ineffective, or the result was due to chance. This research incorporated a randomised clinical trial and a systematic review, which are Levels II and I on the N ational Health and Medical Research Council Hierarchy of Evidence, re spectively (NHMRC, 2009) . Even the highest level studies can not completely eliminate bias. However, high quality, high level designs have the greatest capacity to restrict selection, allocation, assessment, ascertainment and attrition biases. The quality o f this research has been objectively categorised as having a low risk of bias. Although one of the systematic reviewers performing the risk of bias analysis was also a researcher in the clinical trial, the second blinded reviewer had no association with the trial . Both the randomised clinical trial and systematic review employed multiple strategies in design, conduct, analysis and reporting to reduce the likelihood of bias influencing the results. There m ay not have been an adequate sample size to detect a true difference between persons taking Ganoderma lucidum and those who did not. The challenges associated with determining power have been discussed previously in Section 3.4.4. However, the clinical trial results showed no trend in favour of the interven tion that might be magnified by a larger number of participants. The systematic review provided little additional data that could have increased power and generalisability. The majority of the evidence regarding the effectiveness of Ganoderma lucidum could not be used. With the exception of one outcome (HbA1c) by Wang et al. (2008), none of the other studies or outcomes could be used in the meta -analysis due to incomplete and inaccurate reporting of results. The HbA1c result from the Wang et al. (2008) study was more favourable to Ganoderma lucidum , but th is result must be interpreted cautiously due to the unclear risk of bias in that study. If we trust the research process and strategies for bias reduction, the most likely reason for the negative result is that the intervention was not effective. This might be because Ganoderma lucidum , with or without Cordyceps sinensis , does not have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors. Alternatively , the treatment might 219 not have been benef icial given at this dosage, in this formula tion, from this particular batch of herbal product. This raises a n important point regarding nonstandard herbal medicines. Standardising the intervention formula is difficult due to the complex chemical compositi on of Ganoderma lucidum. Also, u nlike standardised synthetic pharmaceuticals, it is difficult to establish bioequivalence between herbal medicines produced from different cultivation methods, manufacturing techniques and geographical locations. Even produc ts that have high quality processes for identification, processing and analytical testing can vary in quality and potency between batches. During th e clinical trial there were challenges in obtaining complete details (in English) from different companies and organisations about herbal product characteristics, quantitative descriptions and qualitative testing. With the exception of the extract name and number, all important information was eventually collated, such that the research team were confident in the quality of the herbal product. However, a dditional guidelines to the CONSORT statement have been published for reporting trials of herbal interventions (Gagnier et al., 2006) and these wil l assist researchers in communicating with source providers and manufacturers to obtain and report complete herbal medicine characteristics. This will not change the fact that diversity is an expectation of herbal medicine use. It is feasible that higher q uality herbs might often be selected for research evaluation. If poorer quality herbal medicines are used for research purposes, it is possible this reflects the standard of the consumer market that research such as ours aims to represent. In this trial, participants took medication for 16 weeks. Long -term use might lead to different health effects, however traditional advice and scientific evidence does not suggest there is increased benefit with increased duration of use. A higher dose of Ganoderma lucid um extract might be required to produce beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors. However, there is one main barrier to taking higher doses of the current product. To ingest the clinical trial daily dose of 3 g of Ganoderma lucidum , participants w ere required to take 10 standard size capsules per day. Most participants described that this number was the upper limit of what they would be 220 prepared to take in exchange for moderate health benefits. Most cardiovascular risk factors require long term, an d possibly lifelong, treatment of diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol disorders. Clinical research would need to establish significant benefit from Ganoderma lucidum to justify and ensure compliance for taking more capsules than was required in t his clinical trial. 5.3 Implications of the Results 5.3.1 Implications for Clinical P ractice This research found no evidence to support that Ganoderma lucidum should be considered by general practitioners, specialists and patients as a treatment option for type 2 diabetes mellitus, with or without metabolic syndrome. For those consumers who self -prescribe Ganoderma lucidum , this research suggests there is no harm to kidney or liver function and no increased risk of adverse events. There is, however, an increased likelihood of experiencing fatigue, headaches and mild gastrointestinal side effects upon commencement of the medication. These events may not be serious, but in the context of the efficacy results, are not favourable for the benefit - harm ratio wh en Ganoderma lucidum is taken for cardiovascular conditions. Ganoderma lucidum is taken for a multitude of health conditions. There might be improvement, or worsening effects on noncardiovascular physiology and disorders, but a broader judgement of benefit s to harm cannot be determined by this research. Cost-benefit is a nother important factor in clinical decision making. At the time of writing, one bottle (60 capsules) of Ganoderma lucidum retails for $60 in Australia. To consume the same dosage as used i n our clinical trial, it would cost the consumer $10 per day. This is acceptable to some consumers, especially for treatment of short term serious conditions, such as cancer. But for treatment of cardiovascular risk factors, long term management is require d and this price is significantly higher than most synthetic pharmaceutical options. As for quantity of capsules, because of its expense, a significant health benefit would be required for health professionals and their clients to choose Ganoderma lucidum for cardiovascular risk factor treatment . It should also be noted that cheaper products such as Ganoderma lucidum coffees and 221 teas have very low dosages of the mushroom and can not be considered comparable to the interventions of this research. This resea rch evaluated treatment for persons with diabetes and metabolic syndrome who lived in Sydney. A broad range of health presentations, ages and ethnic groups for both sexes were represented. In both our study, and that of Wang et al. (2008) , all participants had type 2 diabetes mellitus. The results can not be assumed to apply for different populations in terms of health profile s, geography and demography. Greater effects may have been found if baseline levels of pathology, such as hyperglycaemia, were poorer . Also, there is no information as to whether the results would be similar in pregnant women, or persons with insulin -dependent diabetes or serious organ complications, because these groups were excluded from the study. This was an explanatory, rather than a pragmatic trial, meaning effectiveness was measured under 'ideal' controlled conditions (Roland & Torgerson, 1998) . Explanatory trials aim for high internal validity, but require a trade -off against external validity. Beyond participants having type 2 di abetes, there was no information in the paper from Wang et al. (2008) about the ir participants, setting or country, and therefore generalisability cannot be established. Throughout this thesis, frequent mention has been made of the fact that the research was performed in a Western medicine setting. This is not comparable with a traditional Chinese medicine setting, which has different paradigms of health, disease, diagnosis and treatment. In a traditional setting , Ganoderma lucidum is likely to be prescrib ed as part of a complex herbal formula that is only part of a broader management strategy. Although Ganoderma lucidum is a Chinese medicine, the results of this study were not aimed to inform Chinese medicine practice and are limited in their ability to do so. 5.3.2 Implications for Future R esearch It is common and appropriate to suggest that future research should incorporate larger sample sizes to improve the chance of detecting a true effect by the intervention. Certainly, a larger trial would contribu te stronger evidence as to 222 whether Ganoderma lucidum can effectively treat cardiovascular risk factors. However, it can also be argued that this research provides some evidence of 'no effect', which differs from 'no evidence of effect' (Higgins & Green, 20 09). Without a demonstration of even slight trends toward benefit, the further spending of limited research money and time is difficult to justify. There are also ethical responsibilities to participants to ensure that they are volunteering to trial an int ervention that is likely to provide more benefit than harm. Based on the evidence from this research, which is of the highest level and quality currently available, this assurance could not be given. Researchers who contemplate performing further studies w ill need to weigh this evidence base against the community need for stronger confirmation regarding an intervention that has been trusted for thousands of years. The increasing interest and use in complementary and alternative medicines suggests Ganoderma lucidum research as a cardiovascular treatment is likely to continue. Bioequivalence presents special challenges towards making conclusive findings. As discussed previously, it is possible that different Ganoderma lucidum products might produce different results. Research continues to identify and manufacture higher quality and potentially more potent herbal medicine products. Should a different formulation and quality of Ganoderma lucidum become available, further researc h would be warranted. Similarly, higher dosages could be utilised in clinical trials, but relevance for researching quantities beyond what is consumable and affordable for clients remains a barrier. Should any future research find beneficial effects, cost - benefit analyses would become more relevant for consideration in research design. Ganoderma lucidum is a recommended herbal medicine for health benefits across a multitude of health presentations. The efficacy for treatment of other health disorders is beyond the scope of this thesis. However, we have observed there is now more research on the topic of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of immune, inflammatory and cancer -related conditions than for cardiovascular conditions. There may be more promising result s in that field. In our research, the only outcome that experienced a clinically meaningful benefit was a marker of inflammation, C -reactive protein. Although this was an explanatory measure and provides only weak evidence, this observation supports furthe r research for this, and other, measures of inflammation. 223 A separate area of research concerns the efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum when used as a traditional Chinese medicine. As a Western medic al researcher, it is beyond my expertise to suggest the diagnos es and health profiles that should be addressed. There has been a shift in clinical trial methodological concepts and models that is more supportive of complex intervention research. Methods vary between those closely aligned with accepted clinical trial r ecommendations, and those that challenge these assumptions with new strategies better suited to the particular needs of complementary and alternative medicine research. Our research used the former approach because it was an investigation of a single inter vention in a Western medicine setting. For Ganoderma lucidum research as a traditional Chinese medicine, modified strategies could be more appropriate. Irrespective of the study design, the results of the systematic review highlight that transparent method s and quality reporting are required for any results to be useful for others. 224 Chapter 6: Conclusion Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability in the world. Numerous risk factors have been identified as associated or causative of disease progression. Of these, the major modifiable risk factors include hyperglycaemia, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity. The term metabolic syndrome is used to describe a cluster of these factors. A metabolic syndrome diagnosis, though not as effective for screening as absolute risk measurement, acknowledges the complex synergistic effects of these inter -related risk factors upon each other, and toward cardiovascular disease. Ganoderma lucidum is a respected traditional Chinese medicine, used f or thousands of years for a range of health conditions. In recent years, interest in this medicinal mushroom has increased in Western countries. Its use is frequently self -prescribed as a primary treatment or supplement to synthetic pharmaceutical medicine s. Claims that Ganoderma lucidum could improve multiple cardiovascular risk factors have been supported by findings from preliminary animal and in vitro studies. However, determining the efficacy of an intervention requires human clinical studies with low potential for bias. This is the aim for high level , high quality randomised clinical trials and systematic reviews. This doctoral research utilised both study designs to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of hyperglycaemia, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and other cardiovascular risk factors. Two studies were conducted. The first, a randomised controlled clinical trial, evaluated the effects of Ganoderma lucidum on cardiovascular risk factors in the context of the metabolic sy ndrome. Blood glucose was specified as the primary outcome measure. Eighty -four persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome were enrolled, and 73 of these completed the study. There were similar numbers of men and women, and participants r epresented a wide range of ages and ethnic backgrounds. All participants lived in the region of Sydney, Australia. Evaluation of additional effects by a second fungus, Cordyceps sinensis , was initially included in the study design. Because the sample size was less than anticipated and 225 no effects attributable to Cordyceps sinensis were found, the data of the Ganoderma lucidum -only group was combined with that of the group taking Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis . The results of the randomised controlled trial represent a comparison between persons taking 3 g daily of Ganoderma lucidum for 16 weeks and those taking a placebo medication. The second study was a systematic review. This was conducted to identify, appraise and potentially meta -analy se results from other Ganoderma lucidum studies that researched cardiovascular risk factors. Studies were identified from searching 22 databases, including Chinese language databases, reference lists and communication with content experts. Studies were inc luded if they measured blood glucose, blood pressure or lipid profile s in a controlled clinical trial for cardiovascular -related conditions. Four studies were indentified as suitable for inclusion in the study. One of these was the unpublished data of our own randomised clinical trial, the protocol for which was published on the Australia n and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry . Our study was awarded a low risk of bias ; however , the risk for the other three trials was unclear. Of these three studies, two did not provide data suitable for meta - analysis and the third had reporting errors for some outcomes. Ultimately, data for only one outcome, HbA1c, could be pooled with our clinical trial results. For the clinical trial primary outcome measures, HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose, there were no clinically significant or statistically significant differences between those who took Ganoderma lucidu m and those who took the placebo medication. There were also no improvements in the nondiabetes metabolic syndrome components, diagnostic status of metabolic syndrome or health -related quality of life following 16 weeks of treatment with Ganoderma lucidum . With the exception of some fatigue, headache and mild gastro intestinal side effects, Ganoderma lucidum compared s imilarly to placebo group results for frequency and type of adverse events and abnormal biochemical safety profiles. At the dose of 3 g per day, Ganoderma lucidum was safe and well -tolerated in persons with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The addit ional HbA1c data resulted in a sample size of 134 persons. This analysis also found no clinical or statistical difference for those taking Ganoderma lucidum. 226 The results of this research are not consistent with previous findings. The randomised controlled trial and systematic review are high levels of evidence because they are designed and conducted to minimise risk of bias. As our systematic review highlighted, the other studies in this field have been animal, in vitro , or observational studies. The few c linical trials conducted have been of low quality such that benefit was measured from sources other than the true effect of the intervention. The main limitation of our results is that they are not from a large sample size. Although further research would increase power for detection of a true intervention effect, there were no beneficial trends noted for any primary or secondary outcome measures in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Future research might be more effectively directed towards the role of Ganoderma lucidum for other health conditions or within a traditional Chinese medicine context. 227 References Cited Abaid, L.

Kind Sheet METABOLIC SYNDROME C LINICAL TRIAL Participant Information Sheet Dear Participant, You have been approached to participate in a research project of the Centre for Complementary Medicine Research at the University of Western Sydney, titled A randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of hyperglycaemia i n persons with metabolic syndrome What is the project about? This project will test the clinical effectiveness of a mushroom called Ganoderma lucidum (also known as r eishi) for the treatment of high blood sugar, in people with metabolic syndrome. Participants will be randomly divided into three groups; Group 1 will receive capsules with only Ganoderma lucidum , Group 2 will receive capsules with Ganoderma lucidum combin ed with a second mushroom called Cordyceps , and Group 3 will receive a placebo (also called sham) capsule, which will have no treatment effect. This way we will be able to study whether Ganoderma is effective on its own, and also whether it works better in combination with the second mushroom, Cordyceps . Why is this project needed? Many people in Australia have high blood sugar, which might be classified as diabetes or prediabetes. Many also have other medical problems such as high blood pressure, obesity, or abnormal cholesterol and blood fats. Scientists and doctors now know that these conditions are linked in many ways and a person with three of these five problems is diagnosed with a condition called metabolic syndrome, also called 'Syndrome X '. Ganoderm a lucidum and Cordyceps sinensis have been used successfully in Asia for 2,000 years to treat high blood sugar, as well as the other problems of metabolic 264 syndrome. In the last 30 years W estern medicine has found bo th mushrooms to be safe and non toxic in h umans, and effective for the above medical conditions when tested in the laboratory, animals and small groups of humans. However this is the first large, high quality, blinded, randomised controlled trial to provide the evidence necessary to know if Ganode rma and Cordyceps really are effective for treating high blood sugar and metabolic synd rome. What will my participation involve? To participate, you must be over 18 years old, have high blood sugar and two of the following; high blood pressure, overweight , reduced amounts of high-density cholesterol (good cholesterol) and high triglycerides (fats). You cannot enter the study if you are pregnant, have a transplanted organ, have significant liver, kidney or heart disease, currently take insulin or have any m edical or social condition, which might interfere with your ability to complete the trial. These and other conditions, which might affect the results, or place you at any health risk, will be checked by the trial doctors before and whilst you are taking th e medication. If you agree to participate in the trial you must attend all appointments at the Cardiac Health Institute at Eastwood (near Ryde) and take all medications. You will be required to take four capsules, twice per day for 16 weeks. You will be te sted for their effects at the beginning, at W eeks 8 and 16 of this period and then at Week 24, as a follow -up measure. These tests are blood pressure, height, weight, a survey of how well you feel and taking a blood sample. This blood pathology testing is necessary to test blood cells, sugar, cholesterol, fats as well as to check that the mushrooms have no negative effects on your body. All blood tests will be fasting and therefore appointments will be in the morning. You will be required to not eat, smoke or drink alcohol 12 hours before your appointment. There is no financial cost involved in this trial, and $100 ($20 per visit) will be paid directly to you, to assist with any travel expenses. What are the potential benefits? Both Ganoderma lucidum and Cordyceps sinensis have a long and revered history in Chinese and Asian culture as medicinal agents, which can fight a range of diseases, support the immune system and improve general health. Many of these claims have been supported by research. This trial is based on the premise that these mushrooms 265 might reduce blood sugar, blood pressure, blood cholesterol and blood fats. By participating, you might experience health benefits, and you will be assisting to improve knowledge about the best treatments for high blood sugar and metabolic syndrome. If the treatment proves to be more favourable than the placebo, then it will be offered to the control group (placebo group) at the completion of the trial. What are the potential risks? Both Ganoderma lucidum and Cordyceps sinensis are considered safe for general consumption, much like a nutritional supplement. In Australia they are listed for general use not requiring prescription. They are considered to ha ve less toxic effects than the W estern medicine drugs used for these conditions. There is a small chance that you could experience mild herbal sensitivity symptoms of sore throat, skin rash, vomiting, nausea, asthma, headache, dry mouth, dizziness and shortness of breath. Some regard these responses as the body 's detoxifying process before improvement can occur. In the event of adverse events, changes or cessation of dosage may be required, possibly resulting in withdrawal from the trial. You will be able to call the Principal Investigator 24 hours a day with any concerns you may have. What are my rights if I participate? You have the right to completely understand all implications, risks and benefits and for all your questions to be answered. Your confidentiality and privacy will be assured and only the researcher s listed on this form will have access to your securely stored data. The results obtained in this study will be published in medical journals and conferences however this information will not include any information identifying individual participants. Ple ase understand that while your cooperation would be sincerely appreciated , you are under no obligation to participate in the study. Also, if you do agree to take part you may later leave the study at any time, for any reason with no prejudice to your ongoi ng clinic treatment or your relationship with the researcher. For any questions or concern s please contact the Principal Investigator in the first instance.

All appointments will take place at the Cardiac Health Institute at Eastwood. As metabolic syndrome is a non symptomatic condition, the interest and involvement of health professionals is central to recruitment. Hea lth professionals are invited to consider the suitability of clients and to introduce the project to those persons. To financially support this research involvement, $100 will be paid directly to the health professional for each successful en rolment in the clinical trial. Project Summary The mushrooms Ganoderma lucidum and Cordyceps sinensis are traditional Chinese medicines which have been used for over 2 ,000 years in Asia for treatment of a wide range of health conditions. Recent animal, in vitro and smal l human studies indicate both treatments may have clinical potential for management of cardiovascular risk factors. This randomised clinical trial of 168 persons will evaluate whether Ganoderma lucidum (as primary treatment) and Cordyceps sinensis (as addi tional 268 treatment) can effectively and safely treat the components of metabolic syndrome: high blood glucose, high blood pressure, hig h blood triglycerides, low high-density lipoproteins and obesity. Participants will take approximately 4 g per day of intervention, for 16 weeks, of one of the following : (Trial arm 1) Ganoderma lucidum (Trial arm 2) Ganoderma lucidum with Cordyceps sinensis (Trial arm 3) Placebo Researchers wil l meet with participants every 4 weeks and data will be collected at baseline, W eeks 8 and 16, and postintervention follow -up at W eek 24. Data collection includes blood pressure measurement, anthropometric tests, the Health - related Quality of Life Su rvey (SF -36) and relevant cardiovascular pathology tests. Inclusion/ exclusi on To participate in this study, persons must be: At least 18 years of age Able to provide informed consent in English Have high fasting serum glucose 6.1 mmol/L (primary outcome measure) Meet the NCEP -ATP III diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome. Therefore, in addition to the high fasting glucose participants must have at least two of the following: o Waist circumference >102 cm (men)/88 cm (women) o Fasting serum triglycerides 1.7 mmol/L or currently managed by medication o High -density lipoprotein cholesterol <1 mmol/L (men)/1.3 mmol/L (women) or currently managed by medication o Blood pressure 130/85 mmHg or currently managed by medication Exclusion criteria Participants will be excluded from the trial if they: Have a known allergy to mushrooms Have taken Ganoderma lucidum or Cordyceps sinensis in the past 12 months Are pregnant or breastfeeding Have any medical or social condition or circumstance which might prevent completion or compliance with the requirements of this trial Have any significant active medical or psychiatric condition, which the trial medical practitioner deems to make the person unsuitable for involvement in this trial e.g. , malignancy, heart disease Have significant renal impairment (serum creatinine > 160 mmol/L) 269 Have active hepato -biliary conditions including hepat itis (A, B or C) or significant hepatic impairment Have had major surgery in the past month or will have surgery during the trial Have had an organ transplant Have history of abnormal haemorr haging or have taken an anticoagulant in the last 3 months Are currently using insulin treatment or have done so in the past 3 months Have any other active medical condition which might significantly interfere with glucose levels, such as systemic infectio n (e.g. , tuberculosis, hepatitis, chronic sinusitis or any chronic sepsis) Have a recent history of hypoglycaemic events Other medication Participants will be able to take all existing medications, including hypoglycaemic, hypotensive, and hypolipidaemic agents, as long as the medication dosages and administration methods remain c onsistent and stable for the 24 week trial duration. Potential risks Ganoderma Lucidum and Cordyceps sinensis have b een established as safe and nontoxic interventions. They are listed in Australia for general human consumption at any dose without requiring prescription. There are no known significant adverse events but as with most herbal medicines, some mild adverse events might be experienced by so me participants. Examples of mild (or moderate) adverse events which might be encountered in this study are herbal sensitivity or intolerance symptoms of: Dry mouth Sore throat Skin rash Nausea Vomiting Headache Dizziness Asthma Shortness of breath There is also the possibility of impairment of liver or kidney function as detected by ab normal clinical findings of non physiological variance or other biochemistry abnormalities. As a reduction in blood glucose levels is an anticipated outcome upon which the study is designed, persons prone to hypoglycaemic episodes will be excluded from 270 the study. Persons on anticoagulant medication are also excluded. There are no known herb -food contra indications for Ganoderma lucidum and Cordyceps sinensis . All participants will have a screening consultation with the principal researcher and trial physician prior to enrolment in the trial. At this time, a complete medical history will be obtained, physical examination conducted and the screening pathology sample will be taken . The screening process will find any previously unknown cause for exclusion, such that participants can be assumed to have m inimal risk of adverse events. Adverse events will be checked monthly by way of consultation and multiple biochemical analyse s, and participants can call the Principal Investigator 24 hours a day with any concerns.

Thank you for you interest in this stud y 271 Appendix 7 Amendment to Criteria Centre for Complementary Medicine Research College and Science and Health Nerida Klupp Building 24, Campbelltown Campus Locked Bag 0438 824660 E-mail n.klupp@uws.edu.au 4th April 2007 To the Human Research Ethics Committee, RE: HREC 05/118 A randomised clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Ganoderma lucidum for treatment of hyperg lycaemia in persons with metabolic syndrome . I would like to request the Committee 's consideration for the research team 's recommendation for an amendment to the current clinical trial exclusion criteria. Reason for amendment Recruitment for this clinical trial began in November 2006 and since this time it has become clear that there was inadequate consideration given to the prevalence and significance of an exclusion criterion, which will notably impact on recruitment. As with all pharmaceutical clinical t rials, the healthy function of the liver is important to ensure adequate metabolism of the intervention drug and to avoid 272 potential adverse drug reactions. The current approved trial protocol states potential participants will be excluded if they: Have act ive hepato -biliary conditions including hepatitis (A, B or aminotransferase) >1.5x the upper limit of normal The population sample being invest igated are persons with metabolic syndrome , meaning they have a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors including obesity, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, poor cholesterol profile and high blood fats (triglycerides). The research team underestimated the degree to which this cohort would also have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) which increases levels of the ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) liver enzymes. The true prevalence of high levels of ALT and AST in t he general community, compared to those with metabolic syndrome is unknown. However in the US, where 25 per cent of adults have metabolic syndrome1, the prevalence of NAFLD and high ALT/ AST range from 8 -15 per cent of the total adult population.2 As NAFLD is considered the most strongly associated condition with metabolic syndrome2,3, and Australia has similar prevalence trends for metabolic syndrome, it is anticipated that rates of high ALT and AST would be considerably increased in this study 's cohort. ALT and AST are regularly measured because they do provide some indication of liver function and are easy, accessible and inexpensive. However , they are not actually str ong predictors of liver disease.4,5 More sensitive and specific tests such as imaging and biopsy would be inappropriate for screening purposes in either the clinical or research setting, unless specifically indicated. Levels of ALT and AST up to four times upper limit normal can be anticipated for persons with NAFLD, and recommendati ons for other drugs, such as thiazoladinediones, also used to treat metabolic syndrome, suggest safe usage up to 2.5 -3 times upper limit normal.6 Recommendation for amendment The research team has consulted widely with experts in this field prior to making this recommendation for amendment. We request that the following be removed from the current exclusion protocol: Have active hepato -biliary conditions including hepatitis (A, B C); impairment (bilirubin (aspartate aminotransferase) >1.5x the upper limit of normal To be replaced with Have active hepato -biliary conditions including hepatitis (A, B or C) or significant hepatic impairment. In the event of abnormal serum ALT (alanin e aminotransferase) or AST (aspartate aminotransferase), further consultation, with consent, must take place between the principal investigator with the trial physician, and when necessary other relevant clinicians (e.g., participant 's general practitioner , hepatologist) to determine suitability for partic ipation in this clinical trial. We believe this will aid recruitment by allowing persons with higher AST and ALT levels, as part of metabolic syndrome, to be enrolled in the clinical trial, whilst expandi ng and improving the process of detecting and excluding those persons with inadequate liver function through case discussion based on broader clinical criteria.

Generic Name (Brand only if appropriate) Indication(s) Dosage Duration/ Comments Initial 293 SF-36 (Version 2: Australia) Instructions for PI/ RA for administering SF-36 Health Survey These instructions are modified from the SF -36 Manual and Interpretation Guide: Ware et al. , Quality Metric Inc. 2005. More detail on the administration is available from this guide. Introducing the SF -36 Introduce the participants t o the questionnaire with words similar to: 'Part of the research is to better understand how you and other persons in this study feel, how well you are able to do your usual activities, and how you rate your own health. To do this we ask you to complete t his survey each month while in the trial. The questionnaire is simple to fill out. Be sure to read the instructions on the top of the first page (point to them). Remember this is not a test and there are no right or wrong answers. Choose the response that best represents the way you feel. I will quickly review the questionnaire when you are done to make sure that all the items have been completed. You should answer these questions by yourself. Family or friends should not assist you in completing the ques tionnaire. However I will be nearby in case you want to ask me any questions. Return the questionnaire to me when you have completed it.' Administering the SF -36 Provide a firm writing surface such as a clipboard or table top. Provide a Number 2 pencil f or computerised scoring. You may read and repeat a question verbatim for the respondent but you cannot interpret or explain the question. Instead tell them to answer the question based on what they think the question means. Never force a participant to ans wer a question. Closing When the respondent returns the SF -36 check the questionnaire for completeness. If it is not complete, ask the respondent whether he/she had any difficulty completing it and record the reasons for noncompletion. Thank the patient for completing the survey. 294 Your Health and Well being This questionnaire asks for your views about your health.
