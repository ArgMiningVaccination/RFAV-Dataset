However, current seasonal influenza vaccines are only protective against closely matched circulating strains. Even with extensive monitoring and annual reformulation our efforts remain one step behind the rapidly evolving virus, often resulting in mismatches and low vaccine effectiveness. Fortunately, many next-generation influenza vaccines are currently in development, utilizing an array of innovative techniques to shorten production time and increase the breadth of protection. This review summarizes the production methods of current vaccines, recent advances that have been made in influenza vaccine research, and highlights potential challenges that are yet to be overcome. Special emphasis is put on the potential role of glycoengineering in influenza vaccine development, and the advantages of removing the glycan shield on influenza surface antigens to increase vaccine immunogenicity. The potential for future development of these novel influenza vaccine candidates is discussed from an industry perspective.", "sitename": "BioMed Central", "date": "2020-02-14", "cleaned_text": "Category Sponsor/ company Strategy Phase Mechanism and potency assay Reference HA protein-based vaccine Novavax, VLP with Matrix-MTM adjuvant I/II Particle format for potency, strains mixed or sequential delivery; HAI and MN assay NIH, GSK, and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai HA stem or head-stem chimera I bnAbs (no HAI) and ADCC; intranasal influenza challenge Academia Sinica and OPKO Monoglycosylated HA as universal flu vaccine, exposing the conserved domain to elicit bnAbs preclinical Broad cross-reactive Ab; HAI and MN assay Epitope-peptides based vaccine BiondVax HA, and single-round whole immunity; intranasal mucosal immunity; intranasal influenza challenge DNA based vaccine Inovio RNA, DNA, or vector subunit delivery I Gene delivery for CTL and Ab NT); intranasal influenza challenge "}
