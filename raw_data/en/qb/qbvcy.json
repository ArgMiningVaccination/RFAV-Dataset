WELCOME Dear Friends, At Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJ) and Health System, we are continually preparing for the future of healthcare by developing more effective, efficient ways to deliver quality care. Research has shown us that if we want the best opportunity for improving the health and wellness of our communities, we can't do it alone. Partnering with other providers will enable us to expand beyond the walls of our hospitals and increase value to the populations we serve. We are pleased to share that on July 14, the Robert Wood Johnson Health System signed a definitive agreement to merge with Barnabas Health. Once complete, this historic transaction will create New Jersey's largest healthcare system to be known as RWJ Barnabas Health. The new system will span eight counties and offer the diverse communities in New Jersey expanded access to the best in academic medicine and community-based care. In other exciting news, the American Hospital Association presented RWJ with the 2015 Equity of Care Award, recognizing us as one of two top-performing hospitals in the country for demonstrating success at reducing healthcare disparities and promoting diversity and inclusion in leadership and staff at the organizational level. We are committed to living diversity as a value, modeling it internally among our employees and patients, and externally. We work together in partnership with our doctors, nurses and allied health professionals to give residents of this state access to expanded specialty healthcare services and innovative therapies found only at a handful of institutions in the nation. Receiving this award is a true testament to the impact the RWJ team is making through this initiative. We continue to provide equitable care and we cite examples in this issue of how we are bringing this kind of care into the diverse communities we serve. The Robert Wood Johnson Health System is leading the way to health. I now invite you to enjoy another exciting issue of Breakthroughs. Sincerely, Stephen K.

When Tamy Kostadinova would write something on a piece of paper, it would end up drenched with her sweat. Shown: Tamy Kostadinova, 20, suffered from excessive sweating of her hands. Her condition was so severe, she was unable to grip weights during her workouts to become a bodybuilder, so she turned to the experts at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital for a minimally-invasive procedure that changed her life. 1NEW BRUNSWICK NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET HAMILTON HAMILTON NEW BRUNSWICK SOMER SET NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSETMs. Kostadinova had trouble gripping ordinary items, like a telephone or a pencil, because they would slip out of her unusually wet hands. She started noticing the problem when she was in third grade. Even though her hands were the most wet, she noticed her entire body seemed to perspire much more than the average person. By high school, the excessive sweating was taking a toll on her self-confidence. \"It was really embarrassing,\" said the East Brunswick resident. \"Excessive sweating starts in early childhood or the early teen years, and if left untreated, never goes away. It affects everything patients like Ms. Kostadinova touch and do,\" said John Langenfeld, MD, Associate Professor of Surgery at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and a thoracic surgeon at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJ). The condition (also known as hyperhidrosis) typically involves the hands, but can also affect feet, underarms, and other body parts. About 7.8 million Americans have excessive sweating. Ms. Kostadinova turned to RWJ for help with her excessive sweating because a few years earlier, surgeons there were able to rebuild her ankle, deformed from overtraining as a tennis player. Before that, she had been to five other surgeons who were unable to relieve her excruciating pain and near-paralysis. Dr. Langenfeld is one of the only doctors in the region treating excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) through a minimally-invasive surgical approach. The procedure is called video-assisted endoscopic sympathectomy, which cuts the nerve that signals the body to sweat too much. \"Surgery is by far the best option, particularly for people with excessive sweating in the hands. It's an easy, quick procedure that provides instant relief,\" he said. For patients with sweaty hands, like Ms. Kostadinova, surgery cures the problem 98 percent of the time. Alternative treatments for excessive sweating are known to have drawbacks. For example, \"super\" deodorants, which are designed to keep hands, feet and underarms dry, do not work for many patients. Relief from Botox injections is temporary, and when used on the hands can also be very painful. Botox is also known to cause flu-like symptoms. Another procedure that uses electricity to temporarily turn off sweat glands (iontophoresis) is not only difficult to perform, but it needs to be repeated regularly with minimal success. Some patients also claim this procedure, which involves placing hands or feet into water and then passing a gentle current of electricity through the water, is painful. In May 2012, Dr. Langenfeld performed the 30-minute, same-day procedure on Ms. Kostadinova. After making two small incisions in her underarms, he placed an endoscope (a thin tube with a camera on its tip) into one and a tiny surgical instrument into the other. Dr. Langenfeld found and cut the nerve that leads to the glands that produce sweat, located deep inside the chest along the spine (part of the sympathetic nerve chain). \"I stopped sweating right away,\" said Ms. Kostadinova, now 20 and a junior studying criminal justice and criminal investigation at Kean University. \"My life has completely changed. Everything has gotten better.\" With her self-confidence back and her hands dry, Ms. Kostadinova is now well on her way to reaching her goal of becoming a police officer. After college she plans to enroll in both the police academy and the Army National Guard. Eventually, she hopes to become a homicide detective. \"It's been my dream since I was eight years old. Being a strong woman is really important to me,\" she said. T o build her strength, Ms. Kostadinova began working out with weights several years ago. Now she is preparing for bodybuilding competitions and training others. \"A lot of people suffer from excessive sweating for many years because they do not know that there is something out there that will help them,\" added Dr. Langenfeld. \"This surgery is a life changer for them.\" The minimally-invasive surgery means little to no scarring, a shorter hospital stay, and most important, a faster recovery, with most patients returning to their normal activities a few days after surgery.

Dr. Langenfeld is also a thoracic surgeon at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey. Shown: Rita Coco (left) and Bonnie Girvan recently took a trip to Pleasant Valley Lavender Farm in Morganville, one of many outings they've had since developing a friendship at one of the women's cancer support groups at the Steeplechase Cancer Center at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset. Although both women were treated years ago for breast cancer, they continue to heal by taking advantage of the comprehensive calendar of support programs offered at the Center. 3BREAST CANCER SUPPORT A Healing Community Being around other women by joining a support group at the Steeplechase Cancer Center at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJ Somerset) helped Rita Coco and Bonnie Girvan heal beyond the traditional scars left by medicine and surgery. NEW BRUNSWICK NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET HAMILTON HAMILTON NEW BRUNSWICK SOMER SET NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSET4The group helped to address the emotional wounds that lingered as a result of facing a life changing battle with breast cancer. Once strangers, the women are now close friends, thanks to a bond they've developed since becoming members of the Steeplechase Cancer Center at RWJ Somerset's support group community. The women, who met at Wellness Workout which is one of the many programs offered, found they were able to talk with and get support from other women with breast cancer. \"Being in a room with other women going through the same thing made me feel better,\" said Ms. Girvan, who had moved from Vermont to Bound Brook shortly before she was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 59. Ms. Girvan began attending the support group during her treatment at RWJ Somerset for aggressive HER2-positive breast cancer, which included removal of both breasts (double mastectomy) and breast reconstruction. Ms. Coco, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 55, did not think that she needed the help of a support group until she finished treatment at RWJ Somerset for her Stage 3A estrogen-positive breast cancer: removal of her right breast, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. \"When everything was over, I was kind of lost. I didn't have a purpose or a plan, and I didn't have anyone to talk to who'd gone through it,\" said the Middlesex resident. Feeling alone or falling apart after treatment is common, because patients have the space to feel again, said Nancy Cullinan, LCSW, CDE, CPT , Psychosocial Program Cancer Center at RWJ Somerset. \"Participating in support programs is not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength, to fortify patients for a challenging situation,\" she added. The support programs are part of the \"full package of everything cancer patients need\" to heal, said Kathleen T oomey, MD, Medical Director of The Steeplechase Cancer Center at RWJ Somerset. \"Every patient gets the collective knowledge of every expert at the cancer center through our multidisciplinary approach, and the very latest in care,\" she said. The Steeplechase Cancer Center, a standalone facility served by its own private parking lot, is conveniently located on the RWJ Somerset campus. It is home to renowned cancer care experts, state-of-the-art diagnostic and imaging equipment, the most advanced technologies and therapies and the area's largest support and wellness calendar with nearly 20 different classes offered each month. Another unique amenity patients can take advantage of at the center is the Sanofi Wellness Boutique to help patients look, feel and be their best through features like a certified fitter trained to help with breast prostheses, lymphedema garments and wigs. Although Ms. Coco and Ms. Girvan both completed their traditional treatment at the center years ago, they still participate in Wellness Workout, the support group, and classes such as yoga, T ai Chi, and healthy cooking, all part of an integrative therapy program. In the support group, they now help other women with breast cancer. \"I let other women going through what I went through know that it's going to be okay,\" said Ms. Girvan. Along with another group of women they met, Ms. Coco and Ms. Girvan regularly make plans to get together outside of the center. Whether it's a simple lunch, or more recently, a day trip to a lavender farm, the powerful bond these women developed through sharing and listening to each other's experiences is an important piece of the healing process. \"I'm still scared the cancer will come back, but I have such a good support system now with other girls that are going through this that it's not as terrifying as it was in the beginning,\" said Ms. Coco. Support programs are not limited to breast cancer patients, nor are they limited to patients treated at RWJ Somerset. The complementary programs and groups have something to offer everyone including patients, caregivers, community members and patients receiving treatment elsewhere.

Shown: Annabella Macias (left), now 2, with her mom Maryann Florio (right), is shown smiling at the sounds she is now able to hear coming from her headphones. Annabella was diagnosed with profound hearing loss as an infant and recently received two cochlear implants. 5COCHLEAR IMPLANTS FOR KIDS Breaking the Sound Barrier Annabella Macias entered this world on June 10, 2013. NEW BRUNSWICK NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET HAMILTON HAMILTON NEW BRUNSWICK SOMER SET NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSET6But her mother and grandmother believe that her true birthday was November 10, 2014, when Annabella's cochlear implant was activated allowing her to hear for the first time. \"It's like she is coming into this world for the first time,\" Annabella's grandmother Lauren Rolaf explained. Annabella Macias is one of the nearly three million children under the age of 18 born with some hearing loss. In Annabella's case, she was diagnosed as an infant with what doctors call \"profound\" or significant hearing loss. Now, thanks to The Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital (BMSCH) at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School's Pediatric Cochlear Implant Program, Annabella can hear sounds and is making daily strides with her speech development. The Pediatric Cochlear Implant Program combines the services and expertise of a nationally-recognized children's hospital and an academic medical center making it the only comprehensive pediatric cochlear implant program in New Jersey. A multidisciplinary team composed of audiologists, speech/language pathologists, a medical geneticist, clinical psychologist and pediatric otolaryngologists provides comprehensive evaluation, treatment and rehabilitation services to children with severe-to-profound hearing deficit under one roof. The program successfully completed its first cochlear implant in 2014. Annabella was among the first children to have the procedure which took place at BMSCH's Center for Advanced Pediatric Surgery, the state's only dedicated pediatric surgery center. \"Hearing loss can increase the risk of speech and language developmental delays,\" explained Kelvin Kwong, MD, Assistant Professor of Surgery at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and pediatric otolaryngologist (ears, nose and throat doctor) at BMSCH. \"If a child cannot develop adequate oral communication skills, it can have a significant negative impact on their ability to learn.\" According to Michael Chee, MD, also a Assistant Professor of Surgery at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Pediatric Otolaryngologist at BMSCH, growing up without the ability to hear in a hearing family can be a lonely experience for a child. \"Giving these children the ability to hear through cochlear implants allows them to share activities with their families and take part in age-appropriate learning activities,\" Dr. Chee noted. The realization that Annabella could not hear was a shock to her mom, Maryann Florio. After her birth, Annabella passed the initial hearing test given at the hospital. \"In her first three months, she wasn't responding to any sounds in the house,\" Ms. Florio said. \"Y ou could bang a pot next to her and there was no response.\" Ms. Florio took Annabella to the doctor for another hearing test, which showed no reading indicating significant hearing loss. Annabella then was evaluated by a pediatric ear, nose and throat specialist to rule out additional problems and by an early interventional developmental specialist to gauge her cognitive skills. \"Her cognitive abilities were totally normal,\" Ms. Florio said. Annabella was fitted with hearing aids for six months to confirm the results of the second hearing test. After researching pediatric cochlear implant technology, Ms. Florio decided it was the best option. Following three months of tests which included genetic testing, MRIs and CT scans, Dr. Chee and Dr. Kwong performed Annabella's first cochlear implant procedure on October 9, 2014 and her second implant on April 30, 2015. The procedures involved surgically implanting an electronic prosthetic device in the inner ear under the skin. The device stimulates the child's cochlear (inner ear) giving them the ability to process sounds through special hearing aids. The child often returns home the same day after implantation. Shown above: The Pediatric Cochlear Implant Program at The Bristol-Myers Squibb Children's Hospital at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, led by Michael Chee, MD (left) and Kelvin Kwong, MD (right), both Assistant Professors of Surgery at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, is giving kids with profound hearing loss the opportunity to lead a normal childhood through a program that includes not only surgery to implant the device, but follow-up care and rehabilitation. Because every sound is so new, audiologists gradually increase the device's volume. Ms. Florio said Annabella's first implant activation startled her a little, but she quickly became comfortable with it. Annabella continues to attend classes at a school for the hearing impaired and meets regularly with an early interventional development specialist. \"I almost cried when I said, 'Annabella' and she turned around to look at me,\" Ms. Florio said. \"I want her to grow up like the other children on the block. She is catching up quickly; this was just a short interruption for her.\" Visit www.bmsch.org/hearing or call 1-888-MD-RWJUH.American Parkinson's Disease Association Option 5K/Walk Sunday, October 4 Johnson Park Grove 4 River Road & Violet Drive Piscataway, NJ www.apdanj.org Susan G.

Shown: Parkinson's disease had knocked Irene Blackburn, 67 of Manville, off balance and she felt like she was always tipsy. She enrolled in a rehabilitation program offered through the Physical Therapy Department at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset. The program, called LSVT Big\u00ae, helps delay the deteriorating effects of Parkinson's and get patients back to doing the things they love, which in Mrs. Blackburn's case, is cross-stitch. 11PHYSICAL THERAPY Parkinson's Patients Go Big and Loud When Irene Blackburn began to lose strength in her muscles and started to feel off-balance, she just accepted it as the normal progression of Parkinson's disease. NEW BRUNSWICK NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET HAMILTON HAMILTON NEW BRUNSWICK SOMER SET NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSET12 \"My balance was so bad, I thought I would end up needing to use a wheelchair. I felt like I was tipsy because I would lean to the right side,\" said Mrs. Blackburn, 67, of Manville, who was diagnosed two years ago with Parkinson's disease. The neurodegenerative brain disorder causes the brain to stop producing dopamine, a neurotransmitter, which results in loss of control of body movements. Falling was a constant fear for Mrs. Blackburn. Her leg muscles were so weak she needed help to get up out of a chair. She gave up doing her favorite arts and crafts because her hands and fingers weren't strong enough to hold a paintbrush or sewing needle. Then she participated in a specialized rehabilitation program for individuals with Parkinson's disease called LSVT BIG \u00ae, which is offered by six certified therapists from the physical therapy outpatient service on both the New Brunswick and Somerset campuses of Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJ). After completing five weeks of physical therapy and occupational therapy, both a part of the LSVT BIG program, at RWJ Somerset, \"I feel like a whole new person,\" Mrs. Blackburn said. \"Our goal is to minimize the effects of Parkinson's and delay the deterioration,\" said Maria Halka, Mrs. Blackburn's occupational therapist. \"Patients tend to perform movements in a slow, hesitant way and we work with them to amplify their movements to help them to get back to doing the things they love to do.\" A typical treatment plan includes four sessions a week for four weeks - half of which are physical therapy sessions and half that are occupational therapy sessions. Patients also learn exercises to complete every day at home. \"We teach patients that in everything they do, from taking steps to writing their name, they need to think big,\" said Venus Rivera, a physical therapist who worked with Mrs. Blackburn. \"Because of the way Parkinson's disease affects their muscles and movement, patients need to use more effort and make bigger movements in order to do their normal daily activities.\" Some patients with Parkinson's disease may also require specialized speech therapy called LSVT Loud\u00ae, which is also offered by RWJ's outpatient physical therapy services and offered on both campuses also. Over the course of 16 sessions in a month, patients are taught exercises to stimulate the voice box muscles. \"LSVT Loud is the best evidence-based program for voice and speech for patients with Parkinson's disease,\" said Katie Holterman, coordinator of speech and language services at RWJ Somerset. \"Patients talk louder, develop clearer speech, slow down their rate of speech and improve their vocal quality so they are more easily understood when they are communicating with others.\" This spring, a new medical wellness program for Parkinson's patients was introduced at the RWJ Fitness and Wellness Center in New Brunswick. The eight-week program includes two 1-hour small group sessions a week led by an athletic trainer and physical therapist to focus on building strength and improving movement. A medical wellness program was also launched at RWJ Somerset this spring for patients who graduated from the LSVT to help them maintain their Shown above: Members of the physical therapy program at RWJ Somerset, Amira Elgoneimy, PTA (left), Maria Elena Halka, OTR (center) and Venus Rivera, PT (right) all worked with Mrs. Blackburn during her LSVT Big\u00ae sessions. The program is also offered through the physical therapy service on RWJ's New Brunswick campus. progress. Led by a physical therapist and occupational therapist, sessions are held twice a week. In addition, a weekly Parkinson's exercise group is also held at the RWJ Fitness and Wellness Center in New Brunswick. The class includes stretching and strengthening, a cardiovascular workout, posture enhancement and relaxation and breathing techniques. Following her therapy, Mrs. Blackburn built up her hand strength enough to begin rugweaving again. She uses a cane for walking but has regained her balance. With stronger leg muscles, she can easily get up and down from a chair by herself. \"I walk with a much stronger determination,\" she said. \"I carry myself much better without any fear of falling.\" Mrs. Blackburn continues to do exercises for about 30 minutes a day at home and swims three days a week at a Hillsborough fitness center. \"I really feel like I'm living again,\" she said. Visit www.rwjuh.edu/physical-therapy or call 1-888-MD-RWJUH.Shown: Alice Agrillo, 70, was suffering from pelvic organ prolapse, which prevented her from leading the active lifestyle she was accustomed to. Mrs. Agrillo sought the care of a urogynecologist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJ) where she learned she was a candidate for a robot-assisted procedure with a fast recovery that got her back in her tap dancing shoes. 13PELVIC SURGERY Dancing to a New Beat Age is only a number for 70-year-old Alice Agrillo. NEW BRUNSWICK NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET HAMILTON HAMILTON NEW BRUNSWICK SOMER SET NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSET14The Cream Ridge resident likes to walk two miles several times a week and can usually be found on a dance floor, whether it's with her tap dance group or with her husband, Leo. Her active lifestyle changed when her bladder began to drop and she started experiencing discomfort and pain in her vaginal area. \"I felt a lump bulging out of my body,\" Mrs. Agrillo said. \"It was uncomfortable to walk, I couldn't dance - even sex was painful.\" Mrs. Agrillo was suffering from pelvic organ prolapse, a condition in which structures such as the uterus, rectum, bladder, urethra or the vagina itself may begin to prolapse or fall out of their normal positions. Without medical treatment or surgery, these structures can fall further into the vagina or even through the vaginal opening if their supports weaken enough. The condition develops when the support network of muscles, ligaments and skin that hold pelvic organs, tissues and structures in place begin to weaken or break over time. Pelvic organ prolapse can impact sexual functions and bodily functions such as urination and defecation. It can also cause severe pelvic pressure and discomfort, similar to Mrs. Agrillo's symptoms. Mrs. Agrillo's gynecologist recommended that she follow a consistent exercise regimen to strengthen the vaginal area and potentially address the pain. \"I tried that for five years, but it didn't help,\" she explained. \"I love to dance. I belong to a tap dance group where I live. There is a lot of jumping involved with tap dancing, but it became very uncomfortable. I didn't want to give it up.\" As the pain and discomfort grew worse, Mrs. Agrillo asked her primary care physician for advice. He recommended that she see Manish Gopal, MD, a urogynecologist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJ), who specializes in the correction of complex gynecologic and bladder problems as well as hernia defects in the pelvic floor. Dr. Gopal thought Mrs. Agrillo was an excellent candidate to have sacral-colpopexy and vaginal reconstruction with the robot. She was active, healthy and had no other serious health issues. Recently, Dr. Gopal became the first surgeon in New Jersey to perform a minimally invasive robotic sacral-colpopexy using the da Vinci \u00aeXi Surgical System, the most advanced generation of the da Vinci \u00ae surgical robot. \"By using the da Vinci \u00ae Xi I can perform complicated procedures while leaving a small surgical footprint behind,\" Dr. Gopal said. \"The procedure is much less invasive using this technology.\" Because RWJ is the only hospital in the region using the da Vinci \u00ae Xi for procedures such as these, Mrs. Agrillo chose to have her procedure there. \"Y ears ago, I did per diem nursing there at RWJ,\" Mrs. Agrillo noted. \"I knew that the hospital always had the latest technology and I felt safer there.\" Dr. Gopal performs the surgery by making small, one centimeter incisions with the robot instead of one six-inch incision used in traditional methods. \"A six-inch incision is similar to the size of the incision used for a c-section,\" Dr. Gopal explained. Using the robot, Dr. Gopal attaches permanent material (a mesh) around the vagina to provide support. It is anchored to the vagina and a ligament over the sacrum. This prevents the existing bulge from growing larger and becoming worse. \"Many patients can return home the next day, be back to work in two weeks and experience less pain as they recover,\" Dr. Gopal said. \"The immediate return to quality of life is significant.\" Mrs. Agrillo had the procedure in February and returned home just three days later. She started walking within the first 24 hours and needed virtually no pain medicine. \"I felt immediate relief from the pain I was having,\" she explained. \"I had five little Shown above: Manish Gopal, MD, a urogynecologist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital New Brunswick, recently became the first surgeon in New Jersey to perform a minimally-invasive, robotic sacral-colpopexy for Mrs. Agrillo's pelvic prolapse using the da Vinci \u00aeXi Surgical System. incisions, which healed right away.

Mr. T orres, his wife, Ana, 47, and daughter, Andrea, 13, found the tools they needed by participating in Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset's (RWJ Somerset) Fun 'N Fit Program. Supported by a grant from the Sanofi Foundation for North America, the free 10-week program teaches families how to eat right and exercise to improve their health. T wenty one families participated in the first year of the program, which kicked off last fall. \"We have seen many great successes in just one course of the 10-week program. Each participant that completed the program improved at least one health indicator, such as body mass index, blood pressure and cholesterol levels,\" said Serena Collado, Director of the Community Health Department at RWJ Somerset. \"We hope that families adopt these choices long-term so that they continue to see and feel improvements in their health.\" At the end of the inaugural Fun 'N Fit session, the average weight of the adult participants dropped from 199.4 pounds to 178 pounds. The average adult body mass index dropped from 31.21 to 28.49 and the average adult waist size shrunk from 40.49 inches to 35.36 inches. All of the children who participated improved two health indicators, with one child improving five. For example, one boy reduced his waist circumference by four inches, lowered his cholesterol from 144 to 119 and improved his HDL from 46 to 51. The T orres family was encouraged by Angela Rodriguez, MSN, RN, APNC, of Somerset Pediatric Group in Bridgewater, to register for Fun 'N Fit. The program motivated them to change their diet, and included tips for healthy eating like recommending smaller portion sizes, or baking food instead of frying it and drinking more water. Instead of watching TV after dinner, they now take walks together or play basketball in their driveway. Mr. T orres says these changes helped him lose 15 pounds and lower his blood sugar level. \"Everything really comes down to a 'way of healthy living,'\" he said. \"Y ou know how it goes... you are healthier, you feel better, you are happier and you make those around you happier.\" Gary Benedict, exercise physiologist with the Medical Wellness Program at RWJ Somerset's Sports Physical Therapy and Performance Center in Bridgewater, leads the fitness component of the Fun 'N Fit program. He educates the families on the importance of exercise and helps give them ideas on ways to be more active as a family. Among the activities featured in the Fun 'N Fit program were Zumba classes, kickball, relay races, obstacle courses and a family hike. \"We encourage families to do things together - just get out and play and have fun,\" Mr. Benedict said. Children should get 60 minutes of physical activity each day and adults should exercise about 150 minutes each week, he said. \"Y ou don't need to be running a marathon,\" said Mr. Benedict. \"Just add a little bit of activity each day, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator or parking farther away from the door, and it will all start to add up to positive gains.\" Tia Hagins, a registered dietitian and a community nutritionist at RWJ Somerset, provided the ideas for families to help them alter their eating habits like providing sample foods that make a healthy lunch, or pointing out acceptable low-fat snacks and teaching the right food choices for eating on the go. Shown right: In addition to exercise and encouragement, nutrition is a large part of the Fun 'N Fit program. Tia Hagins, a registered dietitian and a community nutritionist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset, helps families with ideas that help them alter their eating habits. Participants were also given food journals to keep track of what they ate. \"Start with some simple changes, such as switching from whole to low-fat or skim milk, drinking water instead of soda and choosing whole grain bread over white bread,\" said Ms. Hagins. \"Slowly add more fruits and vegetables to your diet so that they make up half of your plate and watch your portion sizes.\" Mr. T orres says Fun 'N Fit taught him how to set reachable goals, such as getting rid of sugary foods gradually instead of all at once and committing to lose one pound a week instead of expecting to lose 10 pounds in one week. \"It is the little steps that actually help,\" said Mr. T orres. \"The most important thing is to not give up.\" Visit www.rwjuh.edu/events or call 1-888-MD-RWJUH.Fall Fun 'N Fit Session Register Now!

Following surgery, Ms. Fan has returned to China to be with her grandchild and Dr. Fan regularly communicates with her via Skype to make sure she's still feeling well. 17PARATHYROID SURGERY A World of Difference Xuemei \"Mei\" Fan traveled 8,000 miles from Guangdong, China to New Jersey in late January - her first trip to the United States - in search of relief for a deteriorating condition that left her with no energy and in constant pain. NEW BRUNSWICK NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET HAMILTON HAMILTON NEW BRUNSWICK SOMER SET NEW BRUNSWICK SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSET SOMERSETThree weeks later, Ms. Fan, 60, was discharged from Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJ) and returned home feeling great and with just enough time to celebrate the Chinese New Y ear. T wo years ago, Ms. Fan started to feel shoulder, knee and other joint pain, she said. \"Then there was heartburn and fatigue,\" she recalled. \"A routine check-up test found that I had hypercalcemia - too much calcium in my blood.\" T oo much calcium can weaken bones and commonly results from overactive parathy - roid glands located on or near the thyroid. An ultrasound and nuclear scan showed nod - ules on her thyroid. Fan underwent surgery in China; part of her thyroid was removed. However, following surgery her calcium levels remained high, and a parathyroid hormone test revealed above-normal results. Ms. Fan developed \"sleepy eyes\" and had increasing pain and difficulty walking. She started to feel depressed. The illness was taking a toll on her physically, impacting her ability to practice as an internal medicine physician and affecting precious playtime with her young granddaughter. In the meantime, Huizhou Fan, PhD, Associate Professor, Department of Pharmacology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, was growing more and more concerned about his sister's declining health. \"She told me she fell a couple of times, and I thought 'This is no good. Her bones are getting weaker,'\" he remembered. \"If she breaks a bone after a fall, it won't heal.\" Ms. Fan however, couldn't undergo a second surgery in China. Her brother suggested she visit RWJ for treatment. Mr. Fan reached out to Xiangbing Wang, MD, PhD, Professor of Medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. Dr. Wang's professional interests include thyroid and parathyroid disorders and he specializes in endocrinology. The two originally became friends back in college in China. Their subsequent graduate, post-graduate and career pursuits took them in different directions across the globe, but more than a decade ago, they reconnected as peers at the medical school. When Ms. Fan arrived at RWJ, Dr. Wang prescribed another nuclear scan and ultrasound and determined that she had ectopic hyperparathyroidism. \"Hers was a dangerous condition,\" he explained. \"Such high calcium levels can result in kidney stones, osteoporosis, severe dehydration and confusion and may interfere with the heartbeat.\" Dr. Wang shared the findings with Stanley Trooskin, MD, Professor and Chief, Division of General Surgery at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and RWJ's Chief of Surgical Services, and they recommended the removal of Ms. Fan's enlarged parathyroid and remaining thyroid to treat her thyroid cancer. \"This was a complex procedure. It was a re-operation, and we had to find the offending parathyroid, which in her case was near the clavicle, and remove the remaining thyroid, which was encased in scar tissue,\" Dr. Trooskin explained. \"At RWJ, we do 500 thyroid and parathyroid operations each year. With the latest technology, we precisely localized the offending, enlarged parathyroid gland and removed it utilizing a minimally invasive approach, which is especially important when there's a lot of scar tissue.\" Dr. Trooskin performed the surgery at RWJ and just one week following the surgery, Ms. Fan exclaimed \"I'm a different person from when I arrived.\" Her huge grin and sparkling eyes conveyed relief and pure joy. \"I already feel more energetic,\" she added. \"I can open my eyes! I can sleep better. I feel much better in general.\" She will take medication until her bone density normalizes, Dr. Wang said, so her improvement would be gradual. Ms. Fan said she was so profoundly appreciative of and impressed by the high quality of care she received and the teamwork at RWJ - citing Drs. Trooskin and Wang and the outpatient, radiology, operating room and Same Day Surgery staff in particular - Shown above: Xiangbing Wang, MD, PhD, (left) Professor of Medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, and Stanley Trooskin, MD, (right) Professor and Chief, Division of General Surgery at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and RWJ's Chief of Surgical Services, treated Xuemei Fan, (center) a patient who traveled 8,000 miles from China to seek care at RWJ. 18 that she planned to discuss her experience with her colleagues in China with the hope that they too can learn from her journey.
