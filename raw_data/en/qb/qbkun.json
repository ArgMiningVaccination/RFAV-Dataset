Always trim the wick to 1cm before lighting your new candle. Never burn your candles when covered or in a windy location. I'm lighting my candle for the first time, any tips? Always trim your wick/s to be no longer than 1 cm. Ensure your candle is evenly melted on top each time you light it before snuffing out the flame. This will ensure you use the entire candle with no tunnelling of the wax. I spilt the wax on a surface, how do I remove it? This is simple, a warm cloth and little elbow pressure does the trick! Luckily you bought a natural soy wax candle! Why does my candle have slight bumps on top? This is only natural with any hand-poured natural soy wax candle. We like to think of it as unique. "}
