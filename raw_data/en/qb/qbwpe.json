The Healing at Home blog series offers some options for using diet and acupressure to help you support your health between acupuncture appointments. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), our immune system is related to Wei qi or Defensive Qi which is the most superficial level of Qi, or energy, in the body. The Wei Qi is controlled by the energy of the Lungs. The ancient Chinese didn't understand the body as being made up of many different types of cells each with specialized jobs as we do today. Wei qi was the term used to describe what we now know as our very complex immune system which both protects us from disease, but also helps us to recover from illness. Rather than viruses and bacteria being responsible for colds and other illnesses, they described it as an invasion of \"evil qi.\" The back of the neck is an especially vulnerable area to invasion by evil qi. Making sure to cover the back of the neck during cold or windy weather with a scarf is one way to help protect ourselves. Despite the lack of scientific knowledge at the time about the exact mechanism and biology of immunity, TCM has a number of methods to help us to boost our immunity, or Wei qi. Stimulating the points below using acupressure can help keep the Wei qi strong. Rub each with gentle pressure in small clockwise circle at least once per day. Governing Vessel 14 (GV14): Located on the spine at the base of the neck, about where a necklace would rest, this point helps to strengthen Wei qi both to help us to stay healthy as well as to help us recover from a cold faster Kiiko Matsumoto's Immune area: Located on the Large intestine channel and extending a few inches toward the thumb, this area helps to stimulate the immune system. Stomach 36 (ST 36): Best used to prevent illness, ST 36 helps to build the qi. The ancient Chinese believed that treating this point every day could help you live forever. Warriors would regularly massage this point when on long marches to help them to energy to keep going. Kidney 3 (KD3): Located on the inside of the ankle, KD3 helps the Kidney and Lungs work together to keep our immune system strong. This point is especially useful when there is a low-grade sore throat. Lung 7 (LU7): Located close to the wrist, LU7 is the primary point for releasing the exterior (to expel a pathogen) and aids the proper functioning of the Lung energy. It is also a useful point for headaches. Food fight: eating for a strong immune system In TCM, many of the foods which help us to fight off a cold are described as \"releasing the exterior.\" Think of that similar to a bouncer in a nightclub showing a rowdy patron the door. These foods encourage the invading pathogen to exit the body. So load up when you are feeling under the weather, especially in the form of broths, soups or teas. Garlic Onions Mint Ginger "}
