It is an ancient name, derived from the Celtic tribes who named their wise, healing women \"Weleda\" or \"Veleda\". These historically authentic priestesses were highly respected and were asked for their counsel, their advice and honoured for their experience and wisdom. Our logo shows the staff of Asclepius, the symbol of the art of healing, surrounded by two figures. They symbolise the idea of giving and taking, of helping and receiving help, of reciprocity. Today, our name and logo stand for our commitment to health, wellbeing and to our social responsibility.WOMEN OF HEALING 4 5With great courage and commitment, the founders of Weleda dared to break new ground 100 years ago. They knew of the deep connection between people and nature. Since 1921, we have been developing certified natural cosmetics and Anthroposophic medicine based on this understanding and Weleda has been a pioneer of sustainability right from the start. As much as we take, we try to give back. From our biodynamic medicinal plant gardens, to our sustainable and respectful supply chains, and the responsible use of resources - we are striving to make the world a better place. Sustainability and our respect for people and nature are part of our roots and our future. A hundred years ago we became the world's first natural cosmetics company, pioneering organic farming methods and cultivation, setting standards for ethical business practises. Today, we are the world's No.1 producer of certified natural skincare and healthcare products, inspiring an industry and supplying into fifty countries and across five continents. And we are according to Cosmetify*, one of the three most searched sustainable beauty brands globally. *www.beauty-magazine.co.uk: Cosmetify: No 1 The Body Shop; No 2 Yves Rocher; No 3 WeledaOUR STORY \"IN THE BEGINNING, THERE WAS A VISION AND A SMALL LABORATORY.\"FOR PEOPLE AND NATURE We humans are connected to one another and are part of nature. That is why we have a responsibility to each other and to the environment. We call Weleda a place for human development. HUMAN AND NATURE ARE ONE Our founder Rudolf Steiner knew that people and nature are deeply connected. We humans are part of nature. Through our connection with nature, we live and develop, we nurture and heal. We need nature. And nature needs us - today more than ever. TOGETHER FOR OUR FUTURE Since 1921, economic success hasn't been the only priority for Weleda. We respect nature and cultivate partnerships with our customers, suppliers and employees. And because we find deep meaning in our work, we love what we do. And it shows: we receive prestigious awards for our contributions to sustainability. People and nature are facing grave challenges in the 21st century. In response, we are striving to make our business more future-proof and sustainable, through our biodynamic medicinal plant gardens, our sustainable and equitable supply chains and our increasingly efficient use of resources. We are working to restore and maintain the balance between people and nature. This approach is in our DNA and carries us into the future. We take responsibility. For people and nature. Since 1921. \"WE DARE TO CARE. INSPIRED BY ANTHROPO SOPHY WE DARE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.\" 6 7Models, actresses and make-up artists around the globe have sworn by Weleda Skin Food since 1926. Then, as now, its award-winning formula is rich in active plant ingredients including pansy, rosemary, chamomile and calendula.Skin Food: Cult classic for over 90 years WELEDA SINCE 1921. OUR STORY. Courageous women and men took new paths in medicine and skin care 100 years ago. They founded Weleda, based on their understanding of people and nature as part of a holistic whole. OUR ROOTS Weleda was founded at a time of great change. People wanted a better future; revolutionary ideas were in the air. Whether in politics, the sciences or business, pioneers everywhere were looking for new and better ways. It was at this time of new beginnings that Weleda's history began in a hospital, a pharmaceutical laboratory and a medicinal plant garden. The philosopher and polymath Rudolf Steiner, together with the physician Ita Wegman and the chemist Oskar Schmiedel, developed the first pharmaceutical formulations according to an understanding that underpins Weleda's product philosophy to this day: that life processes in the human body and in nature live in close relationship with each other.HOLISTIC RIGHT FROM THE START Rudolf Steiner used the term \"anthroposophy\", meaning \"the wisdom of man\" to describe his ideas for medicine, agriculture and education. Steiner and Wegman understood the human being as holistic, one made up of the body, mind, soul and spirit. Based on the natural sciences, these two \"pioneers of healing\" developed the first anthroposophic medicines and skin care products in Dornach, Switzerland. In 1920 Rudolf Steiner gave a series of lectures to doctors and medical students, known as the \"first medical course\", marking the birth of integrative Anthroposophic medicine. The history of Weleda began the following year with the commercial production of medicine and skin care products in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, Germany. In the same year, Ita Wegman founded what is now the Arlesheim Clinic - the world's first anthroposophic medical clinic. Many more followed. WELEDA W ORLDWIDE In many countries, doctors, pharmacists and patients joined forces and founded their own Weledas. After Switzerland and Germany, in the 1920s subsidiaries opened in the Netherlands, the UK, Austria, France, Czechoslovakia and even America. Products from the early years, such as Skin Food and Arnica Massage Oil, are still among the classics worldwide today. Steiner and Wegman believed their medicines needed to be shared, and should be widely available for anyone and everyone as they were (and are) gifts from nature. 8 9Weleda sources essential lavender oil from Moldova. We are working in close partnership with local villagers to convert to biodynamic cultivation by the end of 2021. This helps to ensure that the plants produce essential oil of the highest quality and purity. Fragrant lavender \"HIGHEST QUALITY COMES FROM NATURE. CAREFUL PROCESSING KEEPS IT INTACT, RIGHT UP TO THE PRODUCT.\" The quality begins with the plants grown in our biodynamic gardens. Our gardeners work with nature's own rhythms and intimately know every type of plant in the garden, from planting the first seed from our seed bank, nurturing the biodiversity of our soils, through to harvesting the crop by hand. Before we select a plant for a new formulation, we research it carefully. We observe it with all the senses to understand where and how it grows. This is how it reveals its unique characteristics and correlation to humans. Our natural cosmetics are certified by NATRUE - no other seal worldwide is more demanding in terms of quality. We produce Anthroposophic medicines from plants, metals and minerals. Our raw materials, sourced according to high quality criteria, are just as important as the methods by which we process them. We choose each process with care, because we know that growing quality plants is only half the story - it's the processing that makes the difference in preserving the plant's natural effectiveness.OUR PROMISE OF QUALITY We use the best raw materials, procuring them from people around the world with whom we nurture close and trusting partnerships. This ensures that we can trace every plant oil, dried flower and essential oil all the way back to their source. As a member of the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT), we are committed to the ethical sourcing of raw materials worldwide. QUALITY FOR US MEANS 100% certified natural cosmetics Over 80% botanicals are certified organic Tested to be free from microplastics, genetically modified ingredients, and petroleum-derived ingredients Ethical sourcing with respect for people, plants and animals Increasing our use of renewable energies 100% natural fragrances, crafted by our in-house perfumersWe develop certified natural cosmetics and produce Anthroposophic medicines - with knowledge, skill and experience since 1921.OUR QUALITY 10 11\"IT COMES DOWN TO A MAT TER OF FAIRNESS. SO THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL HAVE ENOUGH TO LIVE ON.\" STEFAN SIEMER Head of Corporate Sustainability at Weleda SUSTAINABILITY: A CORNERSTONE OF OUR WORK For us, being a sustainable business means maintaining the health of people and nature for future generations. Only to take what can regenerate. We understand that we are a part of nature and must work in harmony with it. Only in this way can we face global challenges such as climate change and the loss of biodiversity. We are working to improve our climate balance and developing more sustainable packaging. By 2022 we aim to become independently certified a \"B Corporation\" - an internationally recognised certification demonstrating we meet high social and environmental standards by delivering financial, ethical value creation. UEBT: ECOLOGICAL AND FAIR Since 1921 we have been committed to acting responsibly - socially, economically and ecologically. This includes adhering to the strict criteria laid out by the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT). This non-profit organisation provides a globally recognised standard for the ethical sourcing of natural ingredients. It guarantees that biodiversity is conserved and used sustainably in the cultivation, harvesting and processing of raw materials. It also ensures that all our partners along the supply chain are treated equitably and paid fairly.HEALTHY SOILS: THE POWER OF THE EARTH Through the biodynamic cultivation of nearly 248 square kilometres worldwide (the equivalent of 35,000 football pitches) we are taking active measures to improve soil health and to conserve biodiversity. Using natural methods, we aim to keep the soil healthy, making it resilient and as biodiverse as possible. After the oceans, it is not the forests, but the soils of the earth that serve as our planet's largest carbon stores. A living part of the earth's crust, soil filters rainwater to create new, clean drinking water. Without the power of the soil, there would be no food. We all live from healthy soil - humans, plants and animals. Our gardens around the world are homes to rich and diverse habitat. The Weleda Garden in Wetzgau, Germany is home to 50 bird species and several hundred species of wild bees, and where there are about 1,000 species growing there as wild and ornamental plants.Unfolding health and beauty in harmony with nature and the human being.

These two unsung heroes are real problem solvers for anyone in search of specialist products for problem skin. Once tried, never forgotten! Aknedoron Cleansing Lotion may be applied morning and night, using a cotton pad. Gently massage into the skin, lifting grime and cleansing without removing your natural sebum layer. After cleansing thoroughly, apply Aknedoron Purifying Lotion. Acting as a SOS treatment, it clears the pores and calms irritation.AKNEDORON PURIFYING SKINCARE All it takes is Thyme Student Kimberley Sanderson and supervisor, Dr Margarita Gomez Escalada, a Senior Lecturer in Microbiology and Genetics at Leeds Metropolitan, recently revealed that a solution using the common herb thyme - an active ingredient in our Aknedoron Purifying and Aknedoron Cleansing Lotions - was more effective in killing acne bacteria than traditional chemical-based creams. Acne is caused by a bacterium called Propionibacterium acnes, which infects the skin pore and then forms a pimple. Currently, the most common treatments for acne are antibiotics or a topical cream or wash containing the chemical benzoyl peroxide. These treatments are often associated with side-effects, for example benzoyl peroxide often causes a burning sensation on the skin and irritation.Specialist A potent mixture of expertly selected plant extracts and minerals, this incredible lotion restores harmony after oily outbreaks. Sage, thyme and lavender provide balance, while calendula and chamomile soothe. Witch hazel's mild astringent properties help clear the pores, and sulphur calms irritation while stimulating restorative blood flow. This lotion can be used on problem areas all over the body - simply apply with cotton wool. 102006 50ml Ve \u00a311.50Aknedoron Cleansing Lotion A daily cleanser to gently purify without stripping away the skin's natural defences.

Weleda's recyclable glass bottles are made from 85% recycled glass (the highest % possible). Weleda's roll-on deodorant bottles are made using 70% PCR (post consumer waste). Weleda's recyclable cartons are printed using mineral-oil-free colour inks on 100% FSC certified card. All Weleda's outer packing boxes are made from 100% recycled board. Four tonnes of material were saved in 2017 by optimising the weight of the screw caps for our recyclable aluminium tubes, and we've also recently reduced the amount of aluminium used in packaging and have introduced ABL (Aluminium Barrier Laminate) tubes for some new-launch products, a material which uses less aluminium. New packaging is currently in design using 100% recycled plastic. As detailed in Weleda's annual Sustainability Report, we're working towards a sustainability goal for 2022 that 65% of the weight of all primary packaging produced must come from bioplastics or recycled plastic sources. Achieving more through TerraCycle\u00ae We've teamed up with recycling experts TerraCycle\u00ae to ensure that all Weleda packaging can be recycled within the UK, even if some county council kerbside collection schemes don't accept certain mixed plastics. Whilst Weleda's glass bottles, aluminium tubes and plastic bottles are widely recyclable via local council kerbside collection schemes, some regions may not offer kerbside collection for the mixed plastics used in Weleda's 'soft touch' plastic tubes, even if they are technically recyclable, because sorting machinery and recycling facilities vary from county to county. Our soft touch tubes are made from a partially recycled mixed plastic, which is mainly 50% recycled HDPE (high density polyethylene). Through our partnership with TerraCycle\u00ae, customers can now return their empties to their local Weleda Wellbeing Advisor or collection point. TerraCycle\u00ae also awards points for the waste collected, which can then be redeemed for a charitable donation to charities and non-profit organisations. Downstream, the recycled plastics are then made into new products such as garden furniture.NOT ACCEPTED WASTE Any other brand of beauty care packaging All cardboard, glass, aluminium and rigid plastic packaging as these can be recycled via your local council facilities All Weleda packaging that is not a soft touch plastic tube TerraCycle\u00ae, the TerraCycle Logo\u00ae are property of TerraCycle, Inc. used under license. \u00a92019ACCEPTED WASTE All Weleda soft touch plastic tubes See the picture below for what you can recycle through this programme. Every time you empty a Weleda soft touch plastic tube, save the packaging and send it in to TerraCycle\u00ae to be recycled.Working towards more sustainable packaging solutions All Weleda soft touch plastic tubes, including: Skin Food Original and Skin Food Light Body Washes / Shower Gels / Body Scrubs Sunscreen and After Sun Lotions Lip Balms Conditioner Mini & Travel Size Soft Touch Plastic Tubes The Global Penguin Society At Weleda, we have identified common goals with The Global Penguin Society and we are committed to ensuring our products contain no chemical nasties that could pollute our oceans and have a detrimental effect on marine life. Our revolutionary partnership with TerraCycle\u00ae ensures that no Weleda plastic packaging needs to go to landfill. Points collected from this partnership will raise funds for our chosen non-profit organisation, the Global Penguin Society (GPS), founded by Marine Biologist Dr Pablo Borboroglu. Over half of the world's 18 species of penguin are listed as vulnerable or endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Threatened by poor fisheries management, pollution and climate change in the oceans, penguins also face pressure on land from coastal development and irresponsible tourism. Every 10kg of Weleda packaging recycled through TerraCycle\u00ae will raise nearly \u00a310 for the Global Penguin Society, to support its international conservation activity.Body Oils Skin renewal +50% after 14 daysWhat women experienced using our Pomegranate Body Oil: *Measurement of depth of wrinkles with PRIMOS, test with 21 subjects in 2009, age: 42-69 years.HG HG 44 45 BODY OILS Pomegranate Regenerating Body Oil Luxurious and indulgent, this firming body oil is packed with essential fatty acids, vitamins and proteins to smooth and protect the skin, letting its natural beauty shine through.

Weleda's organic pomegranate comes from the fertile valleys in the coastal region of Icel in southern Turkey. This thriving fair trade farming partnership ensures Weleda has a top quality supply of organic pomegranate, and guarantees the farmers a reliable income. Harvesting begins just after dawn, the crop is hand picked, carefully and laboriously, to ensure the best quality fruit. The juice is extracted for the food industry, and the seeds are then dried before they are cold pressed to extract the valuable oil for skincare. To produce just 1kg of the precious oil requires 500kg of pomegranates. Weleda's pomegranate farming partners are a small scale cooperative of over 100 growers, so protecting the landscape from intensive farming and potentially damaging large scale farming methods.Pomegranate Body CareREGENERATING & STIMULATING Punica Hand Cream renewalWhat women experienced using our Pomegranate Body Oil: *Measurement of depth of wrinkles with PRIMOS, test with 21 subjects in 2009, age: 42-69 years.+50% after 14 days HG Pomegranate Regenerating Body Care \"I love the Weleda Pomegranate Body Oil, the smell and the result on my skin is amazing plus the ingredients are as natural as possible, which is very important to me.\" Storm Keating, ModelPomegranate Body Oil Luxurious and indulgent, this firming body oil is packed with essential fatty acids, vitamins and proteins to smooth and protect the skin, letting its natural beauty shine through.

Weleda uses 500 tons of organic birch leaves a year, collected by our fair trade partners in the Czech Republic.

See our website for more information or call us and we'll send you a leaflet. Birch Cellulite Oil From a holistic standpoint, an increase in cellulite can indicate a build-up in toxins within the body - most of which are stored within the body's adipose (fatty) tissue. Regular massage and the use of specific cleansing and stimulating oils, can significantly improve the appearance of these areas - and support the body in its own process of internal cleansing. Weleda's Birch Cellulite Oil is a completely natural massage oil for areas of visible cellulite anywhere on the body such as thighs and buttocks. Extracts from organically grown birch, rosemary and butcher's broom stimulate the skin's metabolism, and are blended with active carrier oils, including vitamin rich wheat germ and nourishing jojoba. Invigorating essential oils of grapefruit and cypress provide the fragrance, and also work to uplift the mind, and energise the body. And it really works. A dermatological study confirmed that after using Birch Cellulite Oil twice daily over 28 days, testers' skin was on average noticeably 22% firmer, visibly 21% smoother and cellulite significantly reduced. 106112 100ml Ve \u00a327.25Birch Body Scrub Containing the gentlest of exfoliators - tiny beeswax pearls, with round, soft edges, Birch Body Scrub loosens dead skin cells without disturbing the healthy layers below.

Today no cosmetic sold in the EU can claim to be 'cruelty- free' on the packaging. We do test our products on real people, through extensive in-use monitored studies. We first test each ingredient for toxicology prior to use, and then test our formulations on human volunteers for skin tolerability. Animal testing is fundamentally against the underlying values and ethics of the NATRUE certification standard. The NATRUE criteria also extends the animal testing ban on finished cosmetic products to countries outside the EU. You will find the NATRUE seal on every one of our natural and organic cosmetics.CRUEL TY FREEAnimal testing We get asked all the time about animal testing and whether our natural and organic cosmetics are cruelty free. The answer is yes they most certainly are! Weleda has never tested any of its individual cosmetics ingredients nor finished beauty products on animals. We don't carry any cruelty free symbols on our packs because we have the NATRUE seal on every single one of our cosmetics. NATRUE is against animal testing; their criteria stipulates: \"Products must comply first and foremost with the basic requirements of Cosmetics Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, particularly with regard to their composition, safety, efficacy and labelling requirements. Furthermore, animal testing is fundamentally against NATRUE's underlying values and ethics. It is for this reason that the NATRUE criteria extends the animal testing ban on finished cosmetic products as regulated by Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 to countries outside the EU.\" Today thankfully it is against the law in Europe for any beauty cosmetics to be tested on animals so it goes without saying that, as a European beauty brand, our range is cruelty-free. But maybe it doesn't go without saying, as we hear some of you asking, what about mainland China where current regulation requires even imported European cosmetics to be tested on animals before they can be sold in China? The term 'cosmetics' in China is considered to be skincare, makeup, perfume, hair care, sun care, nail care, deodorants and whitening products. Strangely enough toothpastes and bars of soap are exempt, and as such they are not required to be tested on animals. So Weleda toothpaste and soaps may be found in China. But rest assured they are still cruelty-free. Cosmetics bought in China via an overseas e-commerce website also avoid the animal testing requirement, so increasingly Chinese customers are buying from online stores in Hong Kong and further afield in order to get hold of European green beauty brands. We do not sell our other products in mainland China because of the current cosmetics regulation, and there is no plan to do so until China changes its requirement regarding animal testing. Hopefully consumer pressure in China will bring about change before too long. 69 6870 71 Whether you're careering down a ski slope, powering up a hill on your bike or stretching to the max with some hot yoga, arnica delivers deep muscle warmth and relief from aches both before and after your workout.

White Mallow Nappy Change Cream White Mallow Face Cream White Mallow Range Baby Derma Naturally soothing for hyper-sensitive baby skin As far back as ancient times, white mallow was highly regarded as a medicinal plant. Unlike many other plants, it feels warm and soft to the touch. It radiates softness and sensitivity, which is why it is well suited to skin that is sensitive or affected by baby eczema, an allergic skin condition characterised by dry, red and itchy skin. The anti-irritant properties of white mallow help calm and protect hypersensitive skin, relieving itching and promoting healthy skin development. The polysaccharides in its roots are particularly effective and, combined with water, form an organic gel which provides moisture, alleviates irritation and envelopes the skin in a soothing cocoon. Organic coconut oil, sourced sustainably from the Philippines, is a source of vitamin E which is essential for healthy skin growth and repair, keeping skin smooth and protecting against cracking. Recent research has shown its effectiveness in treating atopic dermatitis in paediatric patients.WHITE MALLOW DERMA Accredited by the Eczema Association With extracts of organic white mallow, pansy, organic coconut oil, borage seed oil, organic cocoa butter and sesame oil, Weleda's white mallow fragrance-free products soothe and provide intensive care for skin prone to irritation.

One of the highest levels in the world.\" Annual & Sustainability Report 2017\"The harvest is a special time every year . Especially when you have followed the calendula growth from the very beginning. Each year we have new seasonal workers with very different personalities. The garden becomes the sum of every person who has worked here.\" Claire Hattersley Cultural Development ManagerWe ensure the eco-system is balanced, planting in line with the biodynamic calendar; odd at first until you realise that the moon, sun and planets all affect the way a plant grows. Farming in this way isn't easy but it is well worth the extra effort we go to as our plants make potent tinctures from which we make your medicines. Weleda has the largest medicinal plant gardens in Europe, home to over 1,000 different species of plant growing on 23 hectares, around 50 different types of bird and more than 30 species of wild bee. Over 120 plants are used, freshly picked, in tinctures for Weleda products. We hand pick our gardeners too: Our gardeners are special folk. Their job is to nurture, ensuring the plant itself and its environment is healthy. We use our own seed bank as we believe this makes for plants most suited to our environment here in Derbyshire. We use traditional farming methods as it makes sense to rotate our growing beds annually and we combine wisdom from our many seasons of gardening, creating active composts to feed the soil from our own plant materials; we make our own biodynamic garden preparations from our natural materials which we spray in the Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. Our aim is to grow the healthiest of plants, always.To ensure the best quality ingredients we grow our own plants in herb gardens in Derbyshire. There we grow to biodynamic\u00ae standards, which is a form of farming we call \"super-organic\" - it isn't just about how the plants are grown it's also about where and when we grow them.

Developed by Dr Samuel Hahnemann in the 18th century, homeopathy also follows a holistic approach to good health stimulating the body's natural ability to cure itself. Its guiding principle is to choose a remedy that would produce similar symptoms to those you wish to treat, i.e. 'like cures like'. Each remedy is created by a series of dilution and shaking processes to produce a minimum 'potentised' dose. Why choose Weleda?

Our Weleda gardeners meet and greet Duncan early doors and take delivery of his precious cargo. Every member of staff at Weleda knows when it's 'Arnica Day' and are ready to chip in as and when they are required. It is critical the arnica plants are processed as soon as possible in order to capture the plant's vitality. Arnica soon passes from the outside world of the garden to a cleaner world of tincture production and manufacturing , outdoor clothing is exchanged for whites and GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) rules. Our gardeners keenly check each plant, before shredding ensues and the moisture content is measured. Organic grain alcohol and purified water quantities are calculated and then gradually mixed with the shredded arnica. The gardeners then ensure that the fresh macerate is allowed to infuse for two weeks with occasional stirring. The vessel is emptied, contents pressed and 50% arnica tincture is created and is now ready to use. The large guisti is primed, ready to receive potassium olivate, birch leaf extract, lavender and rosemary essential oils and fresh arnica tincture, all vital ingredients in our award-winning Arnica Muscle Soak. The same active ingredients with their synergistic effect, are combined together to create medicinal Arnica Massage Balm and warming Arnica Massage Oil, firm favourites of rugby teams, mountaineers, ballet dancers and enthusiastic gardeners. Arnica is a welcome sight post marathon running or any physical activity that renders the muscle a little weary. Ideally, for the full arnica effect, opt for an oral preparation together with external application so arnica can work from the inside out and the outside in. 98 99Arnica is an alpine plant and for this reason it does not thrive in our lowland Derbyshire soil at 'The Field'. Instead, Weleda obtains Scottish-grown and biodynamically cultivated arnica from the grower, Duncan Ross. Each year Duncan makes a ten-hour drive with a freshly-harvested crop. The day before the crop arrives, Duncan and four other gardeners are busy, carefully lifting each arnica plant, roots and all (planta tota), washing the roots and removing any discoloured and broken leaves. The plants are then placed upright in boxes, with their roots in fresh water, ready for the journey to Weleda Head Office. In the cool twilight hours, he sets off transporting around 100 kilos of whole fresh plants. Our gardeners scrub-down and gown-up to meet the stringent rules we work to in our pharmaceutical laboratories. Join a reforestation revolution and Plant a Weleda Forest with TreeSisters Our pledge to plant 1 million trees In 2021, as we celebrate our 100th Anniversary what better way to celebrate this remarkable milestone than to plant a Weleda forest in collaboration with the UK charity TreeSisters, with the aim of planting one million trees to combat climate change. The Weleda vision is to plant a magnificent forest of trees. Not a single location but a forest of a million trees planted around the world where trees are needed most urgently - to reclaim endangered rainforest, prevent flooding or soil erosion, protect natural habitats, support local communities in some of the poorest countries in the world, and empower women in the workplace. The charity funds tropical reforestation projects globally with a focus on initiatives either run by women or supporting women around the world.You Are Invited!TreeSisters Women Seeding Change. A registered charity with global impact! TreeSisters is a movement of people around the world who are taking collective responsibility for planetary restoration at the grass roots level. TreeSisters' mission is to accelerate reforestation in the tropics by making it as normal to give back to Nature as it currently is to take. They do this by working with world class planting projects that use ethical planting methods to plant native tree species. To date they have funded the planting of over 6.5 million trees and they aim to plant millions more. All of their planting projects involve and employ local communities to ensure the long-term success of the trees planted and support the rebuilding of the human connection to Nature. TreeSisters channels and nurtures feminine Nature-based leadership around the world, to restore balance and promote planetary and personal wellbeing. TreeSisters plants in the tropics for a number of reasons: Tropical trees sequester carbon 3x as fast as temperate trees. They do this as tropical trees grow fast! This means they draw down and store 95% of all global tree-based CO2. Carbon is also sequestered through the roots, which transfer CO2 into the soil.

It is wonderful to know that everything I have to offer as a wellbeing advisor flows from who I am as a person and all I have experienced.
