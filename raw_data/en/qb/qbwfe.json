Nanotechnol. 2013, DOI: [10.1038/nnano.2013.254](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nnano.2013.254)). Some bacterial toxins operate by embedding themselves in cell membranes, creating pores that leak cellular contents. Heating the toxins denatures them, thereby reducing their toxicity, but it also potentially reduces a vaccine's effectiveness in stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies. Zhang's team leveraged one bacterial toxin's affinity for cell membranes to make a vaccine containing the unaltered toxin. The researchers coated plastic nanoparticles with red blood cell membranes embedded with -hemolysin, a red-blood-cell-puncturing protein secreted by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Mice receiving the coated nanoparticles made more antibodies than mice receiving heat-treated -hemolysin alone. Also, more mice receiving the nanoparticles survived direct injection of -hemolysin. The nanoparticle membranes showed no sign of releasing the pore-forming toxins, which would be a problem in vaccines that use an unaltered toxin. The researchers say they could adapt the nanoparticles for toxins made by other bacteria. "}
