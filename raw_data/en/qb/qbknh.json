The move came after the chairmen of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' committees on doctrine and abortion issues issued a statement late Tuesday r [eiterating moral concerns about the J&J vaccine](https://www.usccb.org/news/2021/us-bishop-chairmen-doctrine-and-pro-life-address-use-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine). It said the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines are preferable \"if one has the ability to choose a vaccine.\" \"The statement issued by the USCCB (United States Conference of Catholic Bishops) was shared by Archbishop (Dennis) Schnurr to all of the priests of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati,\" the archdiocese said Friday in an emailed statement to The Enquirer. \"In addition, we did post [ the statement on the Catholic Telegraph website ](https://www.thecatholictelegraph.com/vaccines-ethically-preferable-to-johnson-johnsons/73318)for local Catholics to remain informed.\" A spokeswoman said the Diocese of Covington had no comment on the conference's statement. While not disputing the church officials' contention that an abortion-derived cell line is used in the production, Johnson & Johnson issued a statement Tuesday stressing that there is no fetal tissue in its vaccine. Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine is made using a harmless cold virus, called an adenovirus. The company used the same technology to produce a successful Ebola vaccine. The adenovirus is grown using what's called an immortalized cell line, and the virus then is pulled out and purified. Several types of cell lines created decades ago using fetal tissue exist and are widely used in medical manufacturing but the cells in them today are clones of the early cells, not the original tissue. The New Orleans archdiocese says the decision to receive a vaccine is one of individual conscience. In its statement late last week, the archdiocese stopped short of advising Catholics not to take the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. It added that Catholics should choose coronavirus vaccines made by Moderna or Pfizer if they are available. The Archdiocese of St. Louis on Tuesday encouraged Catholics to seek out the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines and avoid the Johnson & Johnson version if possible. Like the New Orleans archdiocese statement, the St. Louis statement called the Johnson & Johnson vaccine \"morally compromised.\" However, the St. Louis statement stressed that Catholics can get that vaccine \"in good conscience if no other alternative is available.\" The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said in a January statement that \"abortion-derived\" cell lines were used to test the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines but not in their development or production. In their Tuesday statement, Bishop Kevin C. Rhoades of Fort Wayne-South Bend and Archbishop Joseph F. Naumann of Kansas City in Kansas say this in conclusion: \"While we should continue to insist that pharmaceutical companies stop using abortion-derived cell lines, given the world-wide suffering that this pandemic is causing, we affirm again that being vaccinated can be an act of charity that serves the common good.\" The statements renewed religious discussions about the vaccine and the use of abortion-derived cells. In December, the Vatican said that \"it is morally acceptable to receive COVID-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses\" in the research and production process when \"ethically irreproachable\" vaccines aren't available to the public. Pope Francis has frequently spoken about the need to ensure that vaccines are widely available, especially to the poor and marginalized. And, last month, a decree signed by the governor of the Vatican city-state said that Vatican employees who opt out of vaccination without a proven medical reason could be subject to sanctions, including being fired. In January, the U.S bishops' conference issued this guidance: \"Given that the COVID-19 virus can involve serious health risks, it can be morally acceptable to receive a vaccine that uses abortion-derived cell lines if no other available vaccines comparable in safety and efficacy with no connection "}
