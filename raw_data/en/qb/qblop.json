The searches were performed by William Mcleod, Senior Research Librarian at the National Academies. DESCRIPTION OF THE DATABASES USED IN THE LITERATURE SEARCH All searches were run against MEDLINE (1950-present), EMBASE (1980-present), BIOSIS (1969-2005), and Web of Science consisting of Science Citation Index (1900-present) and Social Science Citation Index (1956-present). There were no restrictions placed on year of publication, language, or publication type. All result sets were deduplicated to eliminate occurrence of the same reference two or more times among the databases employed, and all results were exported to an EndNote Library. MEDLINE and EMBASE (in OVID SP) OVID command-line syntax is provided below. Terms immediately followed by a forward slash (/) are Medical Subject Headings (MeSH headings from MEDLINE) or EMTREE terms (from the EMBASE controlled vocabulary). The asterisk after some terms (*) is the OVID unlimited truncation symbol (for example, rat*, will retrieve rat, rats, ratify, rational, etc.). The postqualification .ti,ab. means that a term was searched only in the titles and abstracts. Exp means that a term was \"exploded\" in the MeSH or EMTREE vocabulary to also capture all narrower terms associated with the broader concept. BIOSIS (in OVID SP) and Web of Science (Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index) All BIOSIS search terms were submitted to the database using keyword or keyword-phrase searches and were not qualified or limited to a specific field. In OVID SP BIOSIS, when a search term is not qualified, it is automatically searched in the following fields: abstract; biosystematic code; words; subject headings; and meeting information. All Web of Science searches were submitted to the databases as topic searches that automatically search titles, abstracts, and author-supplied keywords. MEASLES, MUMPS, AND RUBELLA VACCINE EMBASE (in OVID SP) Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine searches in MEDLINE and EMBASE started with four \"base sets\" with which all specific adverse events identified for consideration were combined: - Measles or (vaccination/ and rubella/)) Each set above was combined with each of the sets below. Each pair resulting from this combination was deduplicated, when the online database provided this utility, and then exported to an EndNote library: - syndrome/ or syndrome/ or schizophrenia, child development disorders, pervasive/ or childhood disintegrative disorder/ or pervasive development disorder specified/ - ataxia/ - Brachial plexus neuritis/ - Chronic syndrome, chronic/ - Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy/ or polyradiculoneuropathy, chronic inflammatory demyelinating/ or exp multiple sclerosis - Exp complex regional pain syndromes/ or exp complex regional pain syndrome/ - Vaccine Searches in BIOSIS (in OVID SP) and Web of Science (Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index) Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine searches in BIOSIS and Web of Science started with four \"base sets\" with which all specific adverse events identified for consideration were combined: - ((vaccin* or immuniz*) and rubella)) Each set above was combined with each of the sets below.
