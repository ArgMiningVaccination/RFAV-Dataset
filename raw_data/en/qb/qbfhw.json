DHS serves individuals and families with low incomes, people with mental illnesses and/or substance abuse issues, developmental disabilities, la te-onset disabilities, the blind, visually impaired, deaf, hard of hearing, or deaf -blind, and aging individuals. In addition, the Department serves parents needing child care services, child support and/or healthcare for their children, as well as famili es facing catastrophic medical expenses for their children. DHS has the following Divisions: Division of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing; Division of Developmental Disabilities; Division of Disability Services; Division of Family Development, Division of Med ical Assistance and Health Services; Division of Aging Services; and the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS ). These divisions provide many support systems for the families of children served by the Department of Children and Families (DCF ). The DHS also operates the Commission for the Blind and Visually Impaired . On July 11, 2006, legislation was signed creating the New Jersey Department of Children and Families (DCF) , the state's first Cabinet -level department focused solely on child and family well - being. All services provided by the DHS Office of Children Services were transferred to the DCF. The new Department included the Divisions of: Youth and Family Services (DYFS), now known as the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCP&P ), Child Behavioral Health Services (CBHS), now known as the Children's System of Care (CSOC), Families and Community Partnerships (FCP), formerly the Division of Parole and Communit y Programs ( DPCP ). It also includes the Office of Education . Through the DCF -funded University Partnership with Rutgers University headed by Rutgers University School of Social Work, DCF's Office of Training and Professional Development collaborates with R utgers in the New Jersey Child Welfare Training Partnership. On June 29, 2012, Governor Chris Christie signed a bill that further reorganized DCF into a single point of entry for all families with children, youth and young adults living with either devel opmental disabilities or substance abuse disorders , or both . This realignment of substance abuse treatment and developmental services is intended to remove barriers to accessibility, provide more complete care through all service offerings, and improve eff iciency for those families served by DCF throughout the state. The transfer of these services to DCF's CSOC from DHS began January 1, 2013. The bill also established and renamed four divisions within DCF. As mentioned earlier, t he former DYFS is now kno wn as the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCP&P). This Division is the state's child welfare agency and is responsible for child protection services for New Jersey youth. The former DCBHS is now the CSOC and continues to coordinate Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 2 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 39 of 456the state m ental health plan for children, youth and young adults; provide support and assistance to child welfare youth who need to access intensive or multiple mental health services; allocate state and federal resources for mental health programs; promulgate stand ards for services; and is now responsible for the provision of services for children, youth and young adults with developmental disabilities as well as substance abuse disorders. The former D ivision of Parole and Community Programs, DPCP, is now the Divisi on of Family and Community Partnerships. The Division on Women has been transferred to DCF from the Department of Community Affairs. Additionally, the Office of Education and the New Jersey Child Welfare Training Academy remain under the auspices of DCF. In 2011, DHS merged its Division of Mental Health Services and the Division of Addiction Services into the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS ). The merger provided an opportunity to integrate adult mental health, substance abuse and co -occurring disorders treatment at all levels of service in an efficient and coordinated manner from the statewide and regional level to the local levels, thus enh ancing access to services, coordination of services, alignment of policies and contracts, and workforce development efforts. As a result of these changes, New Jersey manages the public behavioral health system separately for adult and children services. Specifically, the adult behavioral health system is managed by the Department of Human Services (DHS) , Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) while the children's behavioral health system is managed by the Department of Children and Fami lies (DCF) , Children's System of Care (CSOC). Prior to 2006, the DHS managed both t he adult and children's mental health and substance use disorder system . Later, in 2013, t he adult and children's substance abuse health systems were separated . The substanc e abuse programs that serve children under 18 years were transferred in July 2013 and children in the South Jersey Initiative were transferred in December 2013. DMHAS continues to manage t he Children's Crisis Intervention Services (CCIS) and blended menta l health programs (serving both children and adults). In 2017 , the State provided funding to open substance use disorder residential beds to treat 18 and 19 year olds as the system at the time did not allow treatment for this age as children. The expansion through DCF allow ed their licensed residential facilities to treat 18 and 19 year olds and expand residential capacity by an additional 200 beds . On June 29, 2017, Governor Christie filed an executive reorganization plan with the State Legislature transferring the institutions and programs under DMHAS and its staff that support the provision of mental health and addiction services from the Department of Human Services to the Department of Health (DOH) . The plan stated that \"transferring the provision of mental health and addiction services to DOH is necessary to improve health care, remove bureaucratic obstacles to the integration of physical and behavioral health care and effectively address substance abuse disorder as the public health crisis it is. \" The reorgani zation plan was effective August 28, 2017. On June 21, 2018, Governor Philip Murphy issued a reorganization plan to return the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services to the Department of Human Services. The purpose of the plan is to ensure that the State is delivering behavioral health s ervices in the most efficient, effective manner possible to patients by connecting behavioral health services with Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 3 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 40 of 456critical wrap -around services administered by DHS that support the treatment, recovery, and long-term well -being of individuals struggling wi th substance use and mental health issues . DHS also houses the State Medicaid Agency which plays a significant role as the primary payor for mental health and substance use treatment in the State, as it is the insurance provider for approximately 1.7 milli on NJ residents. The reorgani zation plan was effective September 29, 2018. DOH continues to operate the State psychiatric hospitals and licensing of mental health and addiction services programs and facilities . Overview of the Delivery of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Services DMHAS is the Single State Authority (SSA) for substance abuse in New Jersey. Between the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant and other federal and state resources . The SSA provides services across the continuum of care, which includes prevention, early intervention, treatment and recovery support. In FFY 2018 and 2019, the SSA funds: a) 19 community -based prevention coalitions for the provision of prevention programs with a focus on environmental strate gies, b) over 30 community -based prevention providers that offer a variety of evidence -based curricula for children, adolescents, older adults, and families, c) two state institutions of higher education that provide early intervention services (Rutgers U niversity and The College of New Jersey ), e) four intensive supported housing programs including the recent contract awards of three regional pilot recovery -based housing residences and case management and supportive services for consumers with an opioid u se disorder ( OUD ) who are homeless or at risk of homelessness , f) 24 -hour Addictions Hotline services , g) two non -profit corporations for the operation of recovery support centers, Recovery Center at Eva's Village and Living Proof Recovery Center, h) thre e smaller Community Peer Recovery Centers, i ) 21 Opioid Overdose Recovery Programs, j) 21 Support Teams for Addiction Recovery (9 recently awarded) , k) 19 Older Adult Education Programs (9 recently awarded) , l) three Family Support Centers, m) a Telephone Recovery Support program, n) an addictions workforce training and development initiative, o) 21 county governments for the provision of services throughout the continuum of care, p) funding through a Request for Letter of Intent (RLI) for all county jails to incorporate or enhance Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) as well as case management services for inmates with an Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) at the jail , q) 16 trainings to support approximately 1,000 physicians, APNs and Physician Assistants to attain a buprenorphine waiver , and r) the recent request for proposals ( RFP) award of 11 hospitals for the Opioid Reduction Options ( ORO ) in the Emergency Department (ED) that aims to reduce the use of opioids in EDs and the subsequent prescribing of opioids at E D discharge . Within its treatment continuum levels of care range from detoxification, outpatient, intensive outpatient, residential (short -term, long -term, halfway house), partial hospitalization and opioid maintenance. As of June 2018 , there were 242 licensed providers, 344 licensed Outpatient sites and 73 licensed Residential sites which provide substance use disorder services. DMHAS utilizes the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) principles in client placem ent. The SSA is also responsible for: 1) the Statewide Intoxicated Driving Program (N.J.S.A. 39:4 -50), which processes the conviction records of drivers convicted of driving under the influence and schedules these drivers for detention, evaluation, education, a nd treatment referral by the county - based intoxicated driver resource centers and makes funding available to address the treatment Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 4 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 41 of 456needs of indigent individuals convicted of a Driving Under the Influence (DUI) who meet diagnostic criteria for treatment thr ough the Driving Under the Influence Initiative ( DUII ), 2) the development of treatment services for people involved in the criminal justice system, 3) the Co - Occurring Network to serve individuals with co -occurring mental illness and substance abuse disor ders, 4) the special substance abuse treatment needs of people who are deaf, hard of hearing or disabled; women who are pregnant or have dependent children; minorities; and middle -aged or senior citizens, and 5) promoting and training on evidence based pr ograms such as Medication Assisted Treatment, co -occurring services, motivational interviewing and \"The ASAM Criteria Treatment Criteria for Addictive , Substance -Related and Co -Occurring Conditions, American Society for Addiction Medicine Third Edition, 20 13.\" In Calendar Year (CY) 2018 , there were 89,629 substance abuse treatment admissions and 87,483 discharges reported to the SSA through its New Jersey Substance Abuse Monitoring System (NJSAMS). Of these admissions, 55,783 were unduplicated . , there were 22,393 fee- for-service ( FFS) admissions. For primary drug at admission, 50% reported heroin and other opiates and 28% reported alcohol. Data from NJSAMS for Calendar Year 2018 indicate that only 15% of methadone is planned and 7 % of buprenorp hine in treatment for clients admitted to treatment, yet heroin and other opiates are the primary drugs of admission for 50% of clients entering New Jersey's addiction treatment system. Most admissions were to outpatient care ( 27%), followed by intensive outpatient care (26%). Regarding age, 1% were under 18 years old, 5% were 18-21 years old, 26% were 22 -29 years old, 58% were 30 to 54 years old and 10% were over 55 years old. For race/ethnicity, 60% were white, 23% were black an d 16% were of Hispanic origin. Clients who did not have insurance at admission decreased ( 25%). Those who had Medicaid was 64%. The SSA's primary population served are the indigent in need of substance use disorder treatment. Priority is given to special target groups: persons who i nject drugs (PWID) , pregnant women and women with dependent children, and individuals with/or at risk of HIV or TB. Other special target groups include individuals with: co -occurring mental illness; homeless; deaf, hard of disabled; criminal justice; older adults; gay, lesbian bisexual, transgendered and questioning (GLBTQ ); military, and intoxicated drivers. Description of the Organization of the Public Behavioral Health System at the State and Local Levels for the Delivery of SUD Services State Government The SSA strives to promote the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, support the recovery of individuals affected by the chronic disease of addiction, and promote the use of evidence -based practices. The SSA is responsible for regulating, monitoring, pl anning and funding substance abuse prevention, early intervention, treatment and recovery support services in New Jersey. In addition, the SSA assists with training the addiction workforce. The SSA provides leadership and collaborates with providers, con sumers, families, and other stakeholders to develop and sustain a system of client -centered care that is accessible, culturally competent, accountable to the public and grounded in best practices that yield measurable results. The SSA monitors substance ab use Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 5 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 42 of 456treatment provider agencies for quality assurance and compliance with required assessment and treatment protocols and for other contractual requirements. County Government In New Jersey, county governments also play an important part in the overall f unctioning of the public behavioral health system. Since 1983, a portion of the proceeds of the state's alcoholic beverages tax has been dedicated to the production and implementation of county comprehensive plans in all 21 counties. The plans correlate county resources to the needs of individuals with alcohol and drug use disorders. Originally, the scope of these plans was limited to the needs of individuals with an alcohol use disorder. In 1989, both the scope of the county plans and corresponding fin ancial resources for which the counties were made responsible expanded to include the needs of individuals with drug use disorder. Additionally, in the same year, a governor's advisory council was established to coordinate the actions of all departments an d divisions of state government with regard to substance abuse and to oversee locally -driven prevention efforts by municipal alliances. Presently, the SSA oversees county alcohol and drug comprehensive planning in collaboration with counties that has grad ually elevated quality assurance standards of county planning for the entire continuum of care, from prevention to early intervention, treatment and recovery support services. The SSA does this by issuing: a) guidelines for plan content, format and plann ing process, b) compendia of secondary source data, c) reports of survey findings, and d) technical assistance tailored to the needs of county behavioral health planners. The SSA works collaboratively with the 21 County Alcohol ism and Drug Abuse Directors . A representative of their association is a member of the Behavioral Health Planning Council. The SSA's current county planning activities focus on the current 2016 -2019 four-year period from 20 16 to 20 19 and the upcoming 2020 -2023 planning cycle . As Ne w Jersey continue s to implement its Medicaid Waiver (1115) establishing a managed behavioral health care organization, counties will provide the state with a critically -important monitoring and feedback function \"on the ground,\" as well as develop investme nt proposals for early intervention and recovery support services that remain the least well developed segments of the continuum of care. Additionally, the county plans will direct greater attention than ever before to the problems of citizens dually affl icted with both substance use and mental health disorders. Thus, the county Mental Health Administrators were invited to participate in the community -based planning certificate program DMHAS sponsored in 2013 and the comprehensive planning process with th e hope that, over time, both the substance abuse and mental health planning processes and products will integrate under a single county comprehensive, behavioral health plan. Roles of Other State Agencies with Respect to the Delivery of SUD Services/ In terdivisional and Interdepartmental Collaboration Department of Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (DMAHS) . NJ FamilyCare's Comprehensive Demonstration (\"The Waiver\") was approved on October 31, 2017 and includes an Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)/Substance Use Disorder (SUD) continuum providing authority for the New Jersey Department of Human Services' Division of Me dical Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 6 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 43 of 456Assistance and Health Services, to serve individuals with a substance use disorder or opioid use disorder in a full continuum of care. The continuum matches beneficiaries with the most appropriate services to meet their need, and provides an efficien t use of resources grounded in evidence -based practice. This includes services provided in residential treatment settings that qualify as an Institute for Mental Disease (IMD) consistent with key benchmarks from nationally recognized, SUD -specific program standards. Beneficiaries will have access to high quality, evidence based, OUD and SUD treatment services ranging from acute withdrawal management, ongoing chronic care in cost effective settings, and care for comorbid physical and mental health conditions . Specifically, New Jersey was granted waiver authority to: Claim expenditures for services provided in an IMD for a statewide average length of stay of 30 days. Add a new level of care to the continuum for long term residential treatment, ASAM 3.5; Develop peer recovery support specialist and case management programs that will engage, support and link individuals with an SUD in the appropriate levels of care; and Move to a managed delivery system that integrates physical and behavioral health care. As part of the waiver requirements New Jersey is expected to repo rt data as part of the SUD Monitoring Protocol and track progress toward waiver goals. The SSA, in collaboration with NJ FamilyCare, has established and is expanding mental health and SUD service providers who are able to enroll consumers needing treat ment services in 24 -72 hours through presumptive eligibility (PE). PE allows a certified provider to enter information directly in the FamilyCare enrollment application that is then checked , and a temporary Medicaid number assigned. The application goes through verification, and if successful, a permanent Medicaid number is assigned. At the time of this writing, 1,086 agency staff have been trained and certified with 197 provider sites cert ified to take a PE application.

Department of Children and Families. Interdi visional and interdepartmental collaboration between DMHAS and the Department of Children and Families ' (DCF) CSOC is frequent. Executive Staff from each Division have collaborated to make system recommendations for youth with mental illness and/or substa nce use challenges and families currently served in the CSOC whose youth are emerging adults. Recommendations were made in the form of policies, procedures and protocols that will ensure a seamless transition of youth and their families to all adult menta l health services. In addition, several staff from CSOC attend monthly Behavioral Health Planning Council meetings to better coordinate services. DMHAS provides funding via a Memorandum of Understanding between the SSA and DCF to supplement DCF contrac ts for women with children under supervision of the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCP&P ). This specialty funding is for the Substance Abuse Initiative for Substance Abusing Women (SISAW) Initiative. SISAW includes residential (18 beds) and intensive outpatient treatment slots (43) for women and children who reside in three catchment areas; Asbury Park, Jersey City and Newark and are also eligible for Work First. DCF provides funding for one of seven Maternal Wrap Around Programs ( M-WRAP ) statewide. The overall goal with the M -WRAP is to alleviate barriers to services for pregnant opioid dependent women through comprehe nsive care coordination implemented wi thin the five major timeframes when intervention in the life of the substance exposed infants (SEI) can reduce potential harm of prenatal substance exposure : pre -pregnancy, prenatal, birth, neonatal and early childhood . Care coordination also addresses screening, early intervention, assessment, treatment and recovery supports. DCF als o provides funding for one of 21 OORP programs. The Opioid Overdose Recovery Program (OORP) responds to individuals reversed from opioid overdoses and treated at hospital emergency departments as a result of the reversal. OORP utilizes Recovery Specialist s and Patient Navigators to engage individuals reversed from an opioid overdose to provide non -clinical assistance, recovery supports and appropriate referrals for assessment and substance use disorder treatment. DMHAS is also developing a Memorandum of Agreement with DCF to provide services for the recent Partnership for Success grant that DMHAS was awarded. New Jersey Judiciary, Administrative Office of the Courts. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC ) will be maintained to fund a full continuum of treatment services for Drug Court applicants who are deemed legally and clinically eligible for Drug Court. State funding appropriated to the AOC for this purpose is transferred to the SSA to implement and manag e the statewide network of treatment services in coordination with the AOC and participating Superior Court vicinages. Enhanced services will be maintained as funding permits, including: medication, psychiatric/psychological evaluations, medication monito ring, physical exams, transportation, counselor appearances, partial care, co -occurring integrated Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 8 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 45 of 456services, methadone, and methadone intensive outpatient services.

A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) will be maintained between the New Jersey State Parole Board (NJSPB ) and the SSA to purchase, within a fee -for-service (FFS) network, community -based substance use disorder treatment for NJSPB parolees under the Mutual Agreement Program (MAP). Since October 1, 2017 , Medicai d has been introduced to begin paying for ambulatory treatment for eligible parolees. In July of 2018, short term residential was added and in October of 2018, long term residential. Department of Corrections. DMHAS is working with the Department of Cor rections in providing Intensive Recovery Treatment Supports (IRTS) post -release to a cohort of eligible offenders (n=200) that receiv e MAT prior to release from prison, and to another cohort of non -MAT eligible offenders (n=400) both pre - and post -release into the community. IRTS links eligible offenders to recovery services necessary to support wellness and successful community re -integration. It helps offenders address issues such as: health/wellness, treatment adherence, employment, housing, and opportun ities and skills to enhance the individual's ability to participate in meaningful life activities. There are three IRTS teams providing services for up to six months prior to release and up to 12 months post release. Department of Education. The SSA will continue to coordinate with the Department of Education (DOE ) to develop school health goals and priorities. The primary focus of this interdepartmental group will be to reduce risky behaviors and promote adoption of health enhancing behavior s. Additionally, the SSA will continue to collaborate with the DOE in identifying and creating survey instruments that can be jointly used to collect data required by both entities, and to coordinate schedules for administering student surveys so as to mi nimize duplication of data collection efforts. State Police. In 2014, the Regional Operations Intelligence Center operated by the New Jersey State Police developed the Drug Monitoring Initiative (DMI), to address the epidemic of the pervasive use of he roin, opiates, and the violent crimes and burglaries that are directly correlated to this nationwide crisis. The DMI is a cutting -edge program with a robust multi -state drug intelligence capability that collects and analyzes law enforcement and healthcare data in order to help law enforcement and public healthcare experts develop strategies to combat drug activity in their jurisdictions. Some highlights of the initiative are: The incorporation of public health into the drug monitoring intelligence cycle The ability to coordinate the collection, analysis, and mapping of drug incidents statewide The expedited analysis of seized drugs to better direct investigators and health resources Training law enforcement, fire service, and emergency medical service pers onnel statewide DMHAS and the DMI continue to be active and committed partners in substance abuse prevention throughout New Jersey.

Department of Health. Starting in late 2018, the Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences Vice Chancellor for Research and Research Training convened a working group for faculty and key outside experts with research, clinical or public health and government program expertise in opioid use and addiction. Staff from DMHAS participate as leaders in the areas of prevention, early intervention, treatment, and recovery support. The goal of the group is to st imulate inter - disciplinary collaboration and partnership with state agencies that will position both Rutgers and New Jersey as leaders in this critical area. The meeting agendas include introductory talks on the opioid addiction epidemic, networking sessi ons and breakout groups based on partnering interests and funding opportunities. Dr. Brent Ruben, executive Director of the Center for Organizational Leadership in the Rutgers School of Communication and Information is the facilitator of this event. In 2018, two counties in New Jersey -developed Overdose Fatality Review Teams to conduct confidential reviews of resident drug and alcohol overdose deaths to identify opportunities to improve member agency and system -level operations in a way that will prevent future similar deaths. Representatives from DMHAS participate on the teams. DMHAS is collaborating with DOH on its Opioid Reduction Options (ORO) project. While DMHAS has issued awards to 11 hospitals and will manage the program, the DOH has developed a learning collaborative in which awardees will be required to participate. DMHAS also participates in bi -weekly calls with the Commissioner of Health and key staff to discuss the state's efforts in addressing the opioid crisis.

To promote interoperability between behavioral heal th and physical health providers caring for SUD/OUD individuals, the State of New Jersey is making available a total of $5.3 million in funding for a milestone -based SUD provider incentive program. The program is being administered by the Department of Hea lth. Description of Regional, County and Local Entities that Provide SUD Services In New Jersey, the administration and organization of the substance use disorder (SUD) system is centralized, rather than county or locally based. A broad array of SUD services are offered in the community and the SSA awards funding to 178 SUD treatment agencies that provide a continuum of treatment. It provides funding to 32 SUD prevention agencies. It also provides awards to the 21 County Governments. County Gove rnment. The SSA collaborates with the 21 counties of New Jersey in a joint state and county comprehensive behavioral health planning process intended to: 1) coordinate system development and service delivery at state and local levels, and 2) unify communit y-based planning for prevention and treatment. Chapter 51 of the Laws of 1989, C.26:2BB -12 et seq, amended Chapter 531 of the Laws of 1983 that had established the \"Alcohol, Education, Rehabilitation and Enforcement Fund\" (AEREF) and the county comprehensi ve planning requirement for Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 10 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 47 of 456participation in the AEREF program . The amended statute established 1) the Governor's Advisory Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, GCADA, and 2) the county Local Advisory Committee on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, LACADA , known u nder the 1983 Act simply as the citizen advisory committee . The AEREF is a non -lapsing, revolving trust fund into which $11 million are deposited annually from a tax on the sale of alcoholic beverages. Approximately $9 million from the AEREF plus an addit ional $6.9 million in supplemental funds from the state treasury are distributed per statutory formula to the counties each year, for a total of $1 6.1 million for CY 2019 . Participation requires each county to develop a community -based, comprehensive plan to provide \"community services to meet the needs of intoxicated person and alcoholics,\" and \"relate existing services to the needs of alcoholic and drug addicts\" across the full continuum of care, including prevention, early intervention, treatment an d recovery support . DMHAS quality assurance standards require county plans be based on a scientific planning process that uses quantitative data, outcomes -related service -provider profiles, and community participation to both assess county needs and optimi ze county service investments . Additionally, counties must match 25% of their respective annual AEREF allocation with a contribution of county revenues and dedicate approximately 11% of their allotment to the implementation of federally -validated preventio n education programs . An additional $20,000 is awarded to each county to support its planning operations. The Office of Planning, Research, Evaluation and Prevention is responsible for overseeing the AEREF county comprehensive planning program . Governor' s Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abus e. The SSA works collaboratively with the Governor's Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (GCADA ) on various addiction prevention related projects, including participation on the Prevention Unification Planning Process . The Unification Planning process is designed to provide guidance in the identification of prevention priorities and goals. Through the Municipal Alliance Program, the GCADA unites New Jersey's communities in a coordinated and comprehensive grass roots prevention effort. Municipal Alliances are local planning and coordinating bodies established in all 21 counties to assess nee ds, set priorities, develop plans and implement programs that form the foundation of New Jersey's substance abuse prevention activities. New Jersey's Municipal Alliances provide over 3,800 prevention programs statewide. GCADA's Municipal Alliance Program provides 395 grants to 529 municipalities throughout New Jersey, with the majority of grants averaging between $10,000 - $20,000. The primary CSAP strategy utilized by the alliances is education, followed by alternatives, which provide social, athletic an d recreational activities as an alternative to situations in which alcohol and drug use might occur. The majority of programming is delivered in communities and schools served by the alliances. DMHAS, in collaboration with GCADA and the New Jersey Preve ntion Network is currently engaged in the planning process - recently renamed \"Prevention Collaborative\". In the current Prevention Collaborative , the SSA, in collaboration with GCADA: 1) help s counties identify and implement a greater number of evidence -based prevention programs, 2) support s counties in the use of environmental approaches to prevention planning at the county and municipal levels, and 3) encourage s counties to develop and operationalize community -based and culturally appropriate recovery support systems of care. The plan will also provide direction in the development of future prevention funding opportunities made available by the SSA. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 11 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 48 of 456 Local Advis ory Committee on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse . The SSA works collaboratively with the county Local Advisory Committee on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse ( LACADAs ) that \"assist the governing body in development of the annual county comprehensive plan \" required for participation in the Alcohol, Education, Rehabilitation and Enforcement\" fund of 1983 and 1989. The LACADAs are also required to establish a County Alliance Steering Subcommittee (CASS), which is the county -level planning body for each county's Municipal Alliance s (MA s) that stems from the Governor's Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (GCADA). The MAs are coalitions of municipal level residents and other stakeholders who volunteer to conduct data analysis and prevention service inventories as the basis for adopting a set of local prevention priorities and recommending these to the LACADAs. Through the CASS, the MA plans are coordinated with the LACADA's CCP through a process known as \"Unification Planning.\" Overview of the State's SUD Prevention, Early Identification, Treatment, and Recovery Support Systems Primary Prevention (Criterion 2 ) The SSA develops and supports community -based prevention education and early intervention services using a three -tiered approach to the promotion of healthy life choices: 1. Universal: where media messages and written information are provided statewide to all citizens; 2. Selective: where programs of information and skill development are provided to groups of individuals at some risk; and 3. Indicated: where programs of in formation, skill development and behavioral change are promoted to identify individuals most at risk. Employing the five -step Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) developed by SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) as well as DMHAS' Addicti on Prevention Strategic Planning, the SSA plans prevention and early intervention services in the state, awards funding to providers through RFPs and funds 19 county -based prevention coalitions as well as more than 60 community -based programs that offer a variety of evidence -based curricula for children, adolescents, older adults, and families to reduce substance abuse related problems in the communities they serve. The SSA monitors contracts, provides on -going technical assistance to contracted provider a gencies, and oversees outcome evaluations for each program. All DMHAS - funded coalitions and programs focus their efforts on addressing the prevention priorities identified in the Prevention Strategic Plan: Reduce underage drinking Reduce the use of illegal substances - with a special focus on the use of opioids among young adults 18 -25 years of age Reduce prescription medication misuse across the lifespan Reduce the use of new and emerging drugs of abuse Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 12 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 49 of 456DMHAS funds over 60 curriculum -based prevention programs in community settings throughout the State. DMHAS -funded providers develop an annual work plan for each program they are delivering and submit a quarterly report on the number of individuals and families served with basic socio -demograp hic information using the Prevention Outcomes Management System (POMS), which is the DMHAS' online prevention data reporting system. Examples of curriculum - based programs include: Strengthening Families , LifeSkills, I Can Problem Solve, and Lions Quest. While traditional prevention has tended to focus on individual strategies, aimed at convincing individuals to choose not to use alcohol or other drugs, environmental strategies are prevention strategies that focus on changing conditions in the environment. These strategies are an essential part of any comprehensive prevention plan, becau se there are a number of conditions in the legal, physical, social, and economic environment that may make it easier for youth to use substances. Examples of such environmen tal conditions include inconsistent enforcement of the laws, easy access to alcohol or other drugs, aggressive alcohol advertising and media messages that link drug use with being \"cool,\" and a social environment that encourages alcohol or other drug use a s a rite of passage. Since 2012, when DMHAS established its system of regional prevention coalitions, increasing emphasis has been placed on the use of environmental strategies in order to effect significant, measurable change at the community level. Additionally, as a result of Partnerships for Success (PFS) funding from CSAP that was awarded in 2013 and 2018 , regional coalitions utilize resources to address tobacco prevention. Coalitions also use PFS funds for services to older adults and returning vet erans, when warranted. Services to Families of Military Veterans. Working with the New Jersey National Guard Family Program and its eight Family Assistance Centers based at armories around the state, the SSA funds the New Jersey Prevention Network to prov ide programs to serve returning military personnel and their families through two evidence -based programs, Coping with Work and Family Stress and the Strengthening Families Program. Both programs are designed to enhance protective factors to support milit ary members and their families in making responsible parenting and individual choices in regards to drug and alcohol use. Services to Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered and Questioning Youth. According to a study by University of Pittsburgh researchers published in the April 2008 issue of Addiction , the likelihood of substance use by gay, lesbian bisexual, transgendered and questioning (GLBTQ) youth are on average 190 percent higher than for heterosexual youth . The SSA funds the North Jersey Community Research Initiative to continue and expand their existing programs for high - risk GLBTQ youth of color by adapting a prevention model developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, early intervention s ervices, social marketing, and structured recreational activities. A CSAP -sponsored evaluation of the program determined that the program was effective in reducing rates of substance use among participants and that participants were highly satisfied with the services that were provided. Strategic Prevention Enhancement. In 2011, New Jersey received a State Prevention Enhancement (SPE) grant from CSAP. New Jersey's State Prevention Enhancement (SPE) Project served six high-need counties: Bergen, Camden, Hudson, Essex, Middlesex, and Monmouth. The SPE grant Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 13 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 50 of 456provided intensive training and technical assistance on the effective use of the Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) to agencies and local government in these high -need communities to enable them to i dentify or collect data regarding substance abuse and its consequences in their communities and develop a local approach to addressing the consequences. Partnership for Success. In October 2013, DMHAS received a five -year Strategic Prevention Framework - Partnerships for Success (SPF -PFS) cooperative agreement from CSAP. The goals of New Jersey's SPF -PFS initiative were threefold: 1) to strengthen and enhance the work of DMHAS -funded prevention coalitions; 2) to further develop the prevention data infrastructure and information systems capacity at the state level; and 3) in collaboration with state partners and community stakeholders, to continue work in developing a unified sta tewide prevention planning and service delivery system. Specifically, New Jersey's SPF -PFS sought to 1) reduce underage drinking among persons aged 12 to 20; and 2) reduce prescription drug misuse and abuse among persons aged 12 to 25. As additional comp onents of its PFS programming, New Jersey also focuses on unhealthy drinking patterns and prescription drug abuse among adults age sixty and older; and serves military families with prevention education, addressing military community risk levels, striving to mitigate the risk factors, and enhancing the protective factors to support military members and their families in making responsible parenting and individual choices in regards to drug and alcohol use. DMHAS was awarded a second PFS grant in 2018. In this project, DHMAS prevention coalitions will provide training on the basics of substance abuse prevention, and use of the SPF, to the Children's Inter -Agency Coordinating Councils (CIACC) in each county. The CIACC provides a forum where the system of s ervices for children with special social and emotional needs can be developed, reviewed, revised and/or redirected through a collaborative decision -making process with the New Jersey Department of Children and Families to promote optimal services provided in the least restrictive, but most appropriate setting possible. DMHAS will utilize current SPF-PFS funds for various prevention infrastructure developments and enhancements, some of which are: Updating New Jersey's Epidemiological Profile The first N ew Jersey Epidemiological Profile of Substance Abuse was published in May 2008. It included a comprehensive array of substance abuse -related components and indicators and is organized around indicators for mortality, morbidity, crime, consumption and othe r factors. The updated Profile will include more indicators related to mental health in order to also support mental health prevention efforts and also will address one of the most prominent data gaps - substance use and mental health data for older adults . Updating the Prevention Outcomes Management System (POMS) Support is being requested to modify the existing DMHAS prevention information data collection system known as POMS. An outcomes -module will be designed , and the existing curriculum -based module will be re -designed to make it more user friendly. Update of the Statewide Prevention Inventory Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 14 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 51 of 456An inventory of all existing substance abuse prevention interventions in NJ was produced under NJ's SPE grant. The go al of this task was to provide information on existing prevention efforts and their focus so that service gaps could be identified , and duplication avoided in ongoing strategic planning efforts. Prevent Drug Overdose . In September 2016, DMHAS was award ed a Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Overdose -Related Deaths (PDO) grant for $1 million over five years. Called the Opioid Overdose Prevention Network (OOPN) initiative, DMHAS receive s real-time, statewide information about drug overdoses from the state's police fusion center that uses cutting edge data collection and transmission technology. This capability allow s DMHAS to almost immediately alert front -line practitioners and to make data -driven decisions about where to deploy prevention interventions, wh ich includes community education and distribution of naloxone. Our project implement ed an Early Warning and Rapid Response System (EWRRS) that allow s an extensive network of practitioners and community workers in a variety of healthcare settings (e.g., FQHCs, EDs, hospitals) who will be informed when their communities are affected. The alerts will also mobilize opioid overdose prevention practitioners who can provide emergency response training and distribute naloxone to at -risk individuals and their families, as well as disseminate information about addiction treatment services to the local communities that are affected. Strategic Prevention Framework for Prescription Drugs . In September 2016, NJ was awarded a Strategic Prevention Framework for Prescription Drugs (SPF Rx) grant for $371,616 per year for five years. The SPF Rx provides an opportunity for states that have completed a Strategic Preventi on Framework State Incentive Grant (SPF SIG) to target the priority issue of prescription drug misuse. Called NJAssessRX, the grant expands interagency sharing of the state's prescription drug monitoring program, data and gives DMHAS the capability to use data analytics to identify prescribers, prescriber groups and patients at high risk for inappropriate prescribing and nonmedical use of opioid drugs. Informed by the data, DMHAS and its prevention partners strategically target communities and populations n eeding services, education or other interventions. The target population is youth (ages 12 -17) and adults (18 years of age and older) who are being prescribed opioid pain medications, controlled drugs, or HGH , and are at risk for their nonmedical use. A major component of New Jersey's SPF Rx project focus es on young athletes. A TOP toolkit entitled \" Tackling Opioids through Prevention for Athletes\" was developed. Literature suggests that when young athletes are prescribed opioid pain relievers for sport s-related injuries, there is a risk of addiction and medication misuse. The 19 county coalitions that were established by DMHAS provide education regarding this issue to coaches, parents, prescribers, and young athletes. DMHAS conduct s epidemiological an alysis on NJPMP data and employ s geographic information systems (GIS) to identify communities and issues that require targeted interventions and public health initiatives. One of the goals of this project is to build capacity to strategically utilize the PMP to inform our prevention strategies. DMHAS purchase d the SAS\u00ae Analytics software for Prescription Drug Monitoring data. This product allow s us to identify suspicious or problematic patterns and help s us develop targeted prevention strategies. We can use the SAS\u00ae Analytics tool Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 15 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 52 of 456for anomaly detection and predictive modeling. This help s us achieve our goal to identify drug misuse trends and develop appropriate prevention strategies. Reports will identify those populations, practice settings and geographi c areas, with the highest rates of nonmedical use of opioids and opioid prescriptions. The reports developed from DMHAS data analysis will be shared with other state agencies and with DMHAS' Prevention Coalitions to inform planning in local communities, which might, for example, target locales for naloxone distribution to prevent drug overdoses. These reports will also be the basis for a public awareness campaign and for training of providers and the health care community on addictions and the risks of o pioid prescribing. State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis. In May 2017, SAMHSA awarded New Jersey $12,995,621 annually for two years for its State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis project . As one component of this project , DMHAS award ed funding for prevention services programs to older adults in five counties . Awardees design ed and implement ed a comprehensive educational program specifically focused on providing older adults with practical information regarding non- pharmacological appro aches to dealing with acute and chronic pain. The goal of the project is to reduce the overuse, misuse and abuse of prescription opioid medications within this population. State Opioid Response. In September 2018. SAM HSA awarde d New Jersey $21,566,035 annually for two years . In March 2019, NJ received an additional $11,257,470 in SOR supplemental grant funds. In 2019, with State Opioid Response (SOR) grant funds, DMHAS is expanding educational programs for older adults in all 21 NJ counties. These community based educational programs will focus on providing older adults with practical information regarding non-pharmacological approaches to dealing with acute and chronic pain. Suicide Prevention. DMHAS Suicide Prevention Committee with input from a statewide NJ Adult Suicide Prevention Advisory Council has developed and implement ed an Adult Suicide Prevention Plan in accordance with and guided by the 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention: Goals and Objectives for Action, published by t he U.S. Department of Health and Human Service Office of the Surgeon General and National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention. In addition, the Suicide Prevention Committee used the New Jersey Youth Suicide Prevention Plan and other States' suicide prev ention plans as references. The NJ Adult Suicide Prevention Plan contains strategies and actions in addition to crisis responses for specific concerns of adult New Jersey citizens; addressing current NJ needs and activities and linking up -to-date science f or prevention with practical application in the field. The plan and the action steps go beyond organizations and agencies and stress the importance of everyone's contribution to keeping all individuals in the state safe, in addition to conveying hope and recovery. Although NJ's rate of suicide has been the lowest or second lowest in the nation, DMHAS believes that every suicide is unacceptable and can potentially be prevented, especially for people under care. The plan recognizes several at -risk population s, such as individuals with mental health and substance abuse, a suicidal and/or trauma history, who are part of the LGBTQ community, or have severe medical conditions/chronic pain, etc., as well as high risk periods, such as transitions of care, especiall y discharges from EDs and inpatient psychiatric units, and includes programs, policies, and approaches to address these at - risk populations and problems.

DMHAS funds the NJ Suicide Prevention Hopeline that responds to more than 2 ,000 callers in distress per month with referral options when indicated. Stigma Reduction. The many New Jersey residents with a substance use disorder , as well as those who are in recovery from this disease, routinely encounter stigma and discrimination. Existing policies, laws, practices and misplaced perceptions undermine acceptance of addict ion as a treatable disease and health condition and restrict access to appropriate health care, employment, housing, and public benefits. NCADD - New Jersey provides extensive education and public information to help reduce the incidence of stigma related to alcoholism or drug addiction. One mission of the Governor's Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (GCADA) is to reduce stigma related to substance use disorder as a top priority. Through outreach and education, the Council send s a message that addiction stigma must no longer be tolerated. In 2014, GCADA unveiled the Addiction Doesn't Discriminate campaign, which is dedicated to increasing public awareness of substance abuse issues. The awareness campaign represents a partnership between GCADA and the Ne w Jersey Office of the Attorney General, including its Division of Consumer Affairs, Division of Criminal Justice, Office of the Insurance Fraud Prosecutor, and Division of State Police; the New Jersey DHS and its DMHAS; the U.S. Attorney's Office, Distric t of New Jersey; the New Jersey Department of Education; and the Partnership for a Drug -Free New Jersey. The campaign is still in operation. Drug Free Communities Support Program. New Jersey is home to 2 9 Drug Free Communities Support Program ( DFCSP ) grantees. Additionally, extensive prevention programming and education is provided by other state agencies such as: the Department of Education's Office of Safe and Drug -Free Schools, D epartment of Children and Families , the Juvenile Justice Commission, D epartment of Health , the Division of Highway Safety, and law enforcement agencies. Policy Academy. In 2014, New Jersey was 1 of 10 states selected by SAMHSA to participate in the Prescription Drug Abuse Policy Academy. The goal of the Academy was to devel op and strengthen state strategic plans to address prescription drug abuse. Representatives from DMHAS, along with partners from: the NJ Attorney General's Office, Department of Health, Department of Children and Families, the prevention/treatment provide r community, as well as a family member who lost her son to an overdose participated in the academy. New Jersey's approach to the problem of Prescription Drug Abuse emphasizes that drug overdose deaths are preventable. We chose to focus our efforts on three components that have proven to be essential aspects of an effective approach to combating the issue: A. Public Awareness involve s: 1. Utilizing existing or developing new social marketing and public information campaigns that target the General Public and provides information to address existing obstacles such as stigma and beliefs such as prescription drug abuse only happens in \"bad\" families, or that, if a physician prescribes a medication, there are no risks involved and misperceptions and, 2. Utilizing existing or developing new social marketing Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 17 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 54 of 456and public information campaigns that target Youth and Young Adults (12 -25 year olds) and provides information to address obstacles and misperceptions. B. Collaboration and Coalition Action: according t o Community Anti -Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA), coalitions are by their very nature in the business of strategic social interaction. The central mission of any coalition is to develop a collective understanding across the region of the social issue at hand as well as to envision new ways of living that will yield better outcomes. The work being done by the DMHAS -funded regional coalitions, Municipal Alliances, and Drug -Free Community coalitions around this issue is invaluable and should be coordinated and further enhanced. C. Surveillance and Ongoing Evaluation of Our Efforts involve 1. Monitoring events and trends related to prescription drug abuse to identify geographic \"hot -spots\" and/or particular populations at risk and, 2. Evaluating policies and pr ograms that have been implemented to address prescription drug abuse. The Policy Academy provided an opportunity to refine and enhance the strategies listed above. Additionally, DMHAS developed the Opioid Overdose Recovery Program (OORP) as a result of its participation in the Policy Academy and the information presented there . The intent of the Opioid Overdose Recovery Program (OORP) is to respond to individuals who have been reversed from opioid overdoses (by police, emergency responders, or friends/fa mily) and are subsequently treated at hospital emergency departments as a result of the reversal. Opioid Overdose Prevention Program . As a result of the Opioid Antidote and Overdose Prevention Act passed in May 2013, DMHAS issued contracts to licensed, contracted opioid treatment programs to provide community education and training, to include the distribution of naloxone kits to individuals who attend and complete training. Contracts were awarded to four opioid treatment programs located in, or adjace nt to, five counties which had the highest rates of opiate overdose death reported for the period of January 1, 2013 - June 30, 2014. Efforts to educate and dispense naloxone are focused on individuals who are high risk for opioid overdose and include individuals admitted to opioid treatment programs and other substance abuse treatment programs, as well as those individuals engaged with local syringe access programs. Another priority is educating, training and distributing naloxone to family members, frie nds and loved ones who are in contact with individuals at risk for an opiate overdose. Since those contract s expired , an RFP was issued in July 2015 to continue this initiative on a statewide basis, known as the Opioid Overdose Prevention Program (OOPP). The RFP established three programs commencing in the fall of 2015 in the following regions . North: Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Morris, Passaic, Sussex and Warren Counties Central: Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Somerset, and Union Counties South: Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, Ocean and Salem Countie s The program provides education to individuals at risk for an opioid overdose, their families, friends and loved ones to recognize an opiate overdose and includes the distribution of naloxone kits and information on how to access treatment, including Medication Assisted Treatment, which is the best practice for someone living with an opioid use disorder. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 18 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 55 of 456 Request for Letters of Interest (RLI) were issued in June 2017 by DMHAS for contracted OOPPs operating regionally across the State of New Jersey to partner with DMHAS in its State Targeted Opioid Response Initiative (STORI) funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis (STR) grant. DMHAS made three awards in the amount of $75,000 each . DMHAS is educat ing and distribut ing naloxone kits to a larger spectrum of specialized groups including, but not limited to, school nurses and other personn el at statewide school districts, medical and clinical staff at jails and prisons, and medical and clinical staff working for residential substance use disorder treatment programs. Opioid Overdose Prevention Network . In September 2016, DMHAS was awarded a grant from SAMHSA for $1 million annually for five years to implement the Opioid Overdose Prevention Network (OOPN) initiative. DMHAS has partnered with Rutgers University, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, for the development and implementation of a comprehensive prescription drug/opioid overdose prevention program for this project which includes Naloxone training and distribution. The project plans to reach 3,000 individuals through training and distribute a minimum of 2,500 naloxone kits annually. The initiative will reach individuals in communities identified through Prevention Pathways, as well as reach out to those programs serving individuals who have specialized needs, including: agencies and organizations working with justice -involved populati ons and offender re -entry syringe access programs; community health centers; individuals who underwent an overdose reversal and women's substance use disorder providers. Opioid Overdose Recovery Program. The Opioid Overdose Recovery Program ) responds to individuals reversed from opioid overdoses and treated at hospital emergency departments as a result of the reversal. OORP utilizes Recovery Specialists and Patient Navigators to engage individuals reversed from an opioid overdose to provide non -clinical assistance, recovery supports and appropriate referrals for assessment and substance use disorder treatment. The Recovery Specialists and Patient Navigators maintain follow-up with these individuals for a minimum of 8 weeks after the initial contact. OORP includes linking individuals to appropriate and culturally - specific services and provides support and resources throughout the process. OORP providers are required to have protocols and procedure s in place for priority populations that include pregnant women and parents who have custody of their children and are at risk of child welfare involvement. For pregnant women, OORP provider policies must indicate how they will collaborate with the hospit al social worker and/or hospital staff to ensure coordination and access of MAT services. This program was initially implemented in five counties as of January 2015 and is now currently operational in all 21 counties in New Jersey , utilizing state, SABG, S TR and SOR funds. A key goal of OORP is to prevent relapse and future overdose. DMHAS was able to provide Governor's Initiative funding to 17 OORPs. The funds enable them to serve individuals who did not experience an overdose, but who present in the eme rgency department with issues attributable to opioid use disorder. These individuals are also able to receive OORP services as described above. Opioid Reduction Options in Emergency Departments. Funded through SAMHSA 's State Opioid Response to Grants and Governor Murphy's initiative to address the opioid epidemic in New Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 19 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Expires: issued an RFP to increase awareness and focus on non -opioid pain management strategies, reduce the use of opioids in Emergency Departments (EDs) and the subsequent prescribin g of opioids at ED discharge. Funding is available for FFY 2019 and may be available for FFY 2020 ; total funding is $1,790,000 . According to a 2015 study of opioid prescribing in a cross section of U.S. ED's, 17% of discharged patients received an opioid prescription ; DMHAS seeks a reduction in opioid prescriptions written in New Jersey's EDs at discharge to 12% or lower. Though there are numerous pain management programs, most deal with chronic pain, not acute pain, the type of pain that ED physicians treat. In its effort to help stem the over -prescribing of opioids, DMHAS developed an Opioid Reduction Options ( ORO ) Plan t hat is geared to assisting health facilities in minimizing the use of opioids as the first line of treatment in New Jersey E Ds where clinically indicated. The ORO program promotes the CERTA concept: channels, enzymes, receptors, targeted, analgesia. The CE RTA concept optimizes the following medication classes in place of opioids: Cox -1, 2, 3 inhibitors, N-methyl -D-aspartate (\"NMDA\") receptor antagonists, sodium channel blockers, nitrous oxide, inflammatory cytokine inhibitors and gamma - Aminobutyric acid (\" GABA\") Three will be established which have different levels of expectation: Gold, Silver, an d Bronze. Hospitals can apply for one of the tiers and will be required to participate in a Learning Community tailored to the tier. On July 3, 2019, DMHAS granted ORO awards to 11 hospitals, 10 Gold and 1 Silver. Early Identification/Intervention The SSA has initiated several programs to develop and provide early intervention services. Early Intervention Services . ASAM level .5 services are offered in the SSA's continuum of care. In CY there were 430 individuals admitted for Early Intervention servic es. This service is most commonly delivered to clients referred from DMHAS' Driving Under the Influence (DUI) program. NJ Connect for Recovery Call Line . The NJ Connect for Recovery Call Line was established by the Mental Health Association of New Jersey to support two distinct groups across the state: those concerned with their own opiate use; and, those who are experiencing distress related to the opiate use of a friend or family member. This service is a safe, confidential, nonjudgmental forum that New Jerseyans may call to connect, grow and transform through a unique combination of supportive counseling from Certified Alcohol and Drug Counselors and Peer Specialists. The NJ Connect for Recovery Call Line has expanded weekday hours to increase access to guidance for people coping with opiate addiction and their family members. The current hours of operation are: Weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., Weekends from 1:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. and Holidays from 3:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. This service also includes insurance consultations for individuals with third party insurance who are trying to determine what benefits their insurance includes for treatment for substance use d isorders. In addition to the telephone line, the service also provides Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 20 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 57 of 456training for various groups that include family members using the CRAFT model, so that families can be empowered to support each other cope with their loved ones' Substance Use issues. Interim Services. Interim Services have been a requirement of provider contracts , but a new initiative allows DMHAS to pay f or these services through a fee -for-service (FFS) mechanism. The Interim Services initiative provides funding to agencies to s upport individuals awaiting admission to treatment following an SUD assessment . Interim Services are an engagement level of service intended to link individuals to services they may not be able to access due to lack of provider capacity. This service is de signed to be provided by agencies contracted for any licensed ASAM level of care. Interim services will be made available to any individual eligible for treatment within the public system who cannot be admitted for the assessed level of care within 72 hours. Prior to this initiative agencies enrolled in the Block Grant initiatives were required to provide this service. Once launched in October 2019 , funding for Interim Serv ices will be open to all contracted FFS providers. ReachNJ Hotline . In February of 2017 , the Governor announced ReachNJ , the Addiction Helpline . The Reach NJ was continued through 2018 and was updated in 2019. In February 2019 the ReachNJ contract was transferred to Rutgers UBHC and updated to a Hotline in which callers reach a live pe rson within 30 seconds, 24 hours a day , seven days a week . ReachNJ now provides the same level of service to callers as the Interim Managing Entity ( IME). These services include: screening, coordinated referrals, and care coordination. Reach NJ is availa ble to all NJ residents including those with private insurance, those in need of financial assistance, children and young adults. Through this process , ReachNJ facilitates referrals to the agency most appropriate to meet the caller's needs. College Campuses. This initiative awarded funds in November 2014 for five years to Rutgers University and The College of New Jersey to provide recovery support and/or environmental prevention strategies to systematically identify and help students who have a subst ance use disorder (SUD) diagnosis as well as those who intermittently abuse AODs. Each college or university is required to provide: individual and group substance abuse recovery -oriented programs and services, assessment, academic and personal counseling services, and offer recovery -based housing for students. Environmental Management strategies seek to reduce the supply of and demand for AODs by making them less available and their use less acceptable within the campus environment. Capital agreements are in process with The College of New Jersey, Montclair State University, and Ramapo College of New Jersey to develop and designate recovery housing for students and/or enhance existing recovery communities on campus. Proposed capital improvements inclu de: the re-purposing of a student recreation facility into a health and wellness center, creating a recovery lounge, renovating a single family dwelling into recovery housing, and upgrading an existing residential building with new kitchen and lounge areas for students in recovery. Internet Gambling. In 2014, the New Jersey Legislature enacted legislation directing that $250,000 be collected from each casino located in Atlantic City or their internet gaming affiliate(s) that were issued a permit to condu ct internet gaming. The purpose of the legislation is to increase/enhance the scope of disordered gambling treatment services in New Jersey. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 21 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 58 of 456 Utilizing monies appropriated through this legislation, in early 2018, DMHAS awarded funding (by means of a competitive RFP process) to the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey to expand outpatient and short -term residential treatment services for Gambling Disorder. The Council's responsibilities include overseeing the provision of treatment, monitoring all aspects of service delivery, credentialing service providers, processing service authorizations and claims, and reporting to DMHAS. With the funds described above, DMHAS developed a Memorandum of Agreement with the Rutgers University Center for Gambl ing Studies (CGS). The CGS conducted a needs assessment of agencies who serve as our state -approved field sites for students pursuing their LCADC license. Supervisors were contacted in person and/or by phone and email and asked a series of questions to gau ge their: 1) knowledge of gambling problems and gambling treatment and screening needs; 2) willingness to participate in a pilot project to develop a gambling SBIRT; and 3) interest in attending a 30 -hour gambling training either in person or online. CGS also reviewed all the existing literature on SBIRT protocols for substance use as well as a gambling SBIRT that was designed in Maryland. Based on their review, CGS designed a small pilot study to test the GAM -SBIRT, including validated screening instrumen ts and feedback from participants. Sports Betting. With the introduction of legalized sports betting in 2018, DMHAS now receives $50,000 as a portion of the licensing fee each gaming establishment is required to pay. These funds are also directed to the further development or enhancement of prevention programs or treatment services for gambling disorder. Compulsive Gambling. This contract provides statewide assessment, treatment, prevention, and helpline services through the Council on Compulsive Gambl ing of New Jersey. The Council offers counseling by certified treatment providers; a helpline (1 -800-GAMBLER) that provides information on problem gambling and connects callers to treatment programs and Gamblers Anonymous/Gam -Anon meetings; ongoing public awareness activities; and educational materials for compulsive gamblers, families, and others affected by gambling problems. The Council also conducts outreach to at -risk populations such as older adults, adolescents, criminal offenders, and alcohol/drug dependent persons. Advanced professional training workshops and program development assistance are offered throughout the year. The Council's annual statewide conference focuses on promising approaches to assessment, prevention and treatment of compulsive gambling. Conduct Disorder. DMHAS is currently collaborating with the University Behavioral Health Care (UBHC) at Rutgers University as UBHC implements a substance abuse prevention study/i ntervention for children age 8 -11 who display behaviors consisten t with or meet diagnostic criteria for one of the diagnoses included in the definition of Conduct Disorders. Conduct Disorder is a childhood psychological disorder in which a child demonstrates a persistent pattern of behavior, which violates the basic ri ghts of others or disregards major societal norms or rules. Conduct disorders in youth are a significant predictor of the development of substance use disorders in adolescence and adulthood. DMHAS recognizes the need to identify, create and Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 22 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 59 of 456deliver innov ative, quality outpatient services to those children at increased risk for the development of substance use disorders with the hope that these interventions will forestall or prevent their development. The project include s an intensive clinical component in combination with the 14 -week Strengthening Families Program. The study will continue through the fall of 2020. Treatment Interim Managing Entity . DMHAS partnered with DMAHS and Rutgers University Behavioral Healthcare ( UBHC ) to implement an Interim Managing Entity (IME) to allow a single point of entry into substance use disorder treatment throughout the state. Launched in July 1, 2015 , the IME has coordinated the addiction services for individuals, insuring that it is deliv ered at the appropriate level for the applicable time required. Clients can either c all the IME directly to be screened and receive a warm handoff to a provider, or they can go to/call a provider directly to be screened and continue services. If callers to the IME are amenable, the IME completes a full screen, both clinical and fiscal, and uses this information to make a referral to an SUD treatment agency with the funding and capacity to meet the caller's needs. The IME holds Affiliation Agreements with all of SUD treatment providers who receive state funding, federal funding and/or Medicaid. These agreements allow for coordination between the provider and the IME to increase caller engagement in care. This has allowed NJ to manage its resources across the continuum of care. The IME care coordination center's phone number is publicized as the addiction services hotline. This year, the state has renamed the IME in a new media campaign and so this will be publicized as ReachNJ. The IME also provides pr ovider training, care coordination to callers and utilization management (UM) activities . UM activities assure that individuals are provided with the correct level of care for their needs. Between the SAPT Block Grant and other state resources, the SSA supports the following levels of care for substance abuse treatment, which comport with SSA regulations and The ASAM Criteria standards. Residential. New Jersey's system of care for residential treatment services is comprised of five levels: 1) Level 3.7 WM Medically Monitored Inpatient Withdrawal Management 2) Short-term residential treatment which approximates Medically Monitored Intensive Inpatient Services Level 3.7, 3) Long-term residential treatment which approximates Clinically Managed High -Intensity Residential Services Level 3.5, and 4) Halfway house services which approximates Clinically Managed Low Intensity Reside ntial Services Level 3.1. Medication Assisted Treatment, including Methadone, Buprenorphine and Naltrexone are available at most residential facilities either through an affiliation with an Opioid Treatment Program or provided by the residential provider directly. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 23 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 60 of 456 Specified providers offer specialized programs for women, women with dependent children, children and adolescents, which are consistent with the level of care classification but include services appropriate to these populations. Enhanced co -occurring services are a lso available. Services provided at each level of care will meet or exceed current New Jersey licensure standards. Outpatient. New Jersey's level of care for outpatient treatment services is comprised of six levels: 1) Early intervention Level .5, 2) Outpatient Level 1 .0, 3) Intensive outpatient (IOP) Level 2.1, 4) Partial care Level 2.5, 5) Level 2 -WM Ambulatory Withdrawal Management with Extended On -Site Monitoring , and 6) Medication Assisted treatment delivered in an Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) . Services are offered on site as well as at some mobile medication sites. Services provided at each level of care will meet or exceed current New Jersey licensure standards. The following is a brief description of the various substance abuse treatm ent initiatives funded through SAPT and state funds. SAPT Women's Set -Aside (PWWDC Criterion 3 ). The SSA provides funding through the women's set aside federal block g rant to a statewide network of licensed substance abuse treatment providers in all modal ities of care: outpatient, methadone outpatient, short -term and long -term residential for substance abuse treatment to pregnant women and parenting women. The women's programs are designed to meet the specific needs of women such as gender specific substan ce abuse treatment and other therapeutic interventions for their children. Gender responsive treatment is trauma informed and trauma specific, strengths -based and relational. Gender specific treatment includes gender specific therapies with family focuse d services, such as individual and group sessions, child care, transportation, services for children, parenting, linkages and recovery supports. As per contract language, p roviders are required to develop Plans of Safe Care. If a woman is pregnant, the Plan shall be developed prior to the birth event whenever possible and in collaboration with treatment providers, health care providers, early childhood service providers and other members of the multidisciplinary team as appropriate. Plans of Safe Care wi ll address the needs of the mother, infant and family to ensure coordination of, access to, and engagement in services. Integrated Opioid Treatment Services and Substance Exposed Infants (IOT -SEI). In December 2017 the Department of Health (DOH) awarded funding through a Request for Applications (RFA) for the expansion of integrated opioid treatment services and substance exposed infants (IOT -SEI). DMHAS manages the IOT -SEI Initiative which provid es an array of services for opioid dependent pregnant women, their infants and family ranging from substance use disorder treatment, prenatal and postpartum medical/obstetric services, care coordination, recovery -based living arrangements, wraparound servi ces such as intensive case management and recovery supports . The overall goal is intended to improve outcomes for pregnant women with opioid use disorder, their infant and Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 24 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 61 of 456families. This initiative promotes maternal health, improve birth outcomes and red uce the risks and adverse consequences of prenatal substance exposure. Five agencies across the State are participating in this initiative. Drug Court. Drug Court is a cooperative initiative between the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) and the S SA which commenced in 2002. This agreement allows the AOC to transfer treatment funding to the SSA who then secures and makes available, based upon clinical need, a complete continuum of care for Drug Court offenders sentenced in New Jersey Superior Court. Drug Court participation has been voluntary. Fifteen vicinages serving all 21 counties Drug Courts function within the existing Superior Court structure to provide treatment along the full continuum of care and diversion opportunities for non -violent off enders who otherwise may be incarcerated in state prisons for drug related offenses. Since 2012 , Drug Court has expanded the criteria for participation; legal eligibility now include s second degree burglary and robbery and also mandatory sentencing to Drug Court . As with the State Parole Board, Drug Court agreed to begin using Medicaid to pay for treatment services beginning in January of 2017 for ambulatory services and residential services starting July of 2018. As the result of legislation allowing for t he use of medication assisted treatment (MAT), Drug Court has had a six -fold increase in the number of participants using some form of MAT. This trend is expected to continue. The success of NJ's statewide Drug Court program has diverted a sizable number of non -violent, low security offenders whose crime resulted from their addiction have been diverted from the prison system. Recently, the Department of Corrections (DOC) has shifted its in -prison focus to medium security offenders in need of SUD treatment. This changed significantly in April of 2017 when Mid -State Correctional facility, a shuttered 656 -bed medium -security prison, became the state's first fully -dedicated, licensed drug treatment center for male and Edna Mahan for female inmates. In collabora tion with the DHS and DMHAS, both facilities were licensed to provide the ASAM levels of care for short -term and long -term residential services as well as intensive outpatient and outpatient levels of care. Access to treatment begins at the inmate's entry into the prison system versus nearer to release as it was in the past . Inmates will be able to receive multiple episodes of treatment throughout their stay in prison so cases of relapse can be addressed for a more sustainable recovery. Current ly DOC operat es 656 beds at Mid -State and 65 beds at Edna Mahan. An MOU with Rutgers UBHC signed in November of 2016 enables inmates from all DOC facilities being released to either parole or the community to request the full array of ASAM SUD treatment services throu gh the Interim Managing Entity. Mutual Agreement Program. The SSA oversees the Mutual Agreement Program (MAP), a Parolee Substance Use Treatment Project implemented through Memoranda of Agreements between the SSA and the New Jersey State Parole Board (NJSPB). This funding is a combination of direct appropriations from DMHAS and funds transferred from NJSPB. These funds support a similar FFS network which offers the full continuum of care including long term and short term residential care, halfway house, partial care, detoxification, outpatient and intensive outpatient treatment, co - occurring services, psychotropic medication reimbursement, and MAT . With the advent of Medicaid reimbursement for treatment services and medication, the use of MAT for parolees has expanded. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 25 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 62 of 456South Jersey Initiative. This state funded fee -for-service initiative targets young adults (ages 18 - 24) from eight counties (Ocean, Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, Cape May, Salem and Cumberl and). It provides a continuum of care that includes methadone maintenance, detoxification, residential, halfway house, and outpatient treatment services. Driving Under the Influence Initiative. New Jersey set aside $7.5 million in state funds beginning in November 2005 to support the substance use disorder treatment needs for financially indigent residents of New Jersey who have been convicted of intoxicated driving and related offenses including driving under the influence (DUI). Convicted DUI Offender s who are financially indigent (less than 350% of the FPL) can receive all appropriate levels of care for the length of substance use disorder treatment documented by medical necessity. The intent is to ensure NJ residents in need of substance use disorde r treatment receive the necessary interventions, and to reduce the incidence of recidivism and ultimately creating safer roads and waterways. There are over 200 licensed sites in the Driving Under the Influence Initiative (DUII) network providing all levels of substance use disorder treatment services. The New Jersey Statewide Initiative. The New Jersey Statewide Initiative ( NJSI ) began on July 1, 2016 when providers with slot -based contracts transiti oned to f ee-for-service (FFS). Initially NJSI include d only ambulatory services - intensive outpatient (IOP ASAM level 2.1) and outpatient (OP level 1) levels of care, and only two of the eight providers that converted to FFS were funded by Block Grant dollars for outpatient substance abuse treatment service s (ASAM level 1). In February 2016, residential substance abuse treatment services were also added, including Halfway House (HWH level 3.1), Long -term residential treatment (LTR level 3.5), and Short -term residential (STR level 3.7). LTR and STR services a re Block Grant funded. Services also include Assessment and Enhancements such as a psychiatric evaluation and medication monitoring, urine drug screens, as well as an enhancement for Buprenorphine and Vivitrol, and recovery supports. The Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Initiative. As of July 1, 2016 , the contracted methadone outpatient, intensive outpatient and residential services reimbursed by SAPT Block Grant funds transitioned to Fee -for-Service. On April 11, 2017 IWM was added . Network . Approval to provide Vivitrol (injectable naltrexone) and related enhancement services in both residential and ambulatory settings through DMHAS Fee -for- Service (FFS) Network is predicated on agency submission and DMHAS' approval of an application to the Vivitrol Network as well as approval of policies and procedures required by the Department of Health, Certificate of Need and Licensing (CN&L) . Those agencies contracted to provide Vivitrol must agree that the prescription and administ ration of the medication will be conducted by the appropriate medical personnel (Medical Director, Nurse Practitioner, Physician Assistant, or Registered Nurse) and that all counseling services will be provided in accordance with DOH and DCA regulation. Agencies will ensure, and comply with, consumer choice and consent for this course of treatment. Staff shall provide the appropriate education regarding this medication and also discuss the options available for individuals with either an alcohol or opioid use disorder .

The information packet shall include the benefits and the risks of the medication. State Targeted Opioid Response Initiative. New Jersey was awarded a State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis (Opioid STR) grant on May 1, 2017. The State Targeted O pioid Response Initiative ( STORI ) was a new initiative added to the DMHAS FFS Network and opened July 3 , 2017 . FFS Network initiate d an open enrollment process for new and existing providers to participate in the STORI. STORI include s the following subs tance use disorder treatment for individuals with OUD: assessment, Intensive Outpatient and Outpatient, Opioid Intensive Outpatient and Outpatient (which includes methadone) , buprenorphine and Vivitrol enhancements, withdrawal management (ambulatory and residential) and short term residential. The STORI was implemented in phases. Phase 1 was opened to all Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs), Residential Withdrawal Managemen t, and Short Term Residential providers. Case management services are included. Phase 2 was opened on August 7, 2017 to all providers who re-enrolled in the Vivitrol Network. New providers were asked to join the Vivitrol network; for those who join ed, they were eligible to join the STORI treatment initiative. As of April 30, 2019 , 2,652 clients receiv ed either STR, WM, OP or IOP services. New Jersey was granted a no -cost extension for this grant so services for this initiative will continue until March 2020. SOR Grant . SAMHSA, Center for Substance Abuse Treatment released the State Opioid Response (SOR) grant funding opportunity for states and territories in June 2018. New Jersey was awarded funding in October 2018. The goals of the SOR are to address the opioid crisis by: (1) increasing access to MAT, (2) using the three FDA -approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorders, (3) reducing unmet treatment needs, and (4) reducing opioid overdose related deaths through the provision o f prevention, treatment, and recovery activities for OUD . DMHAS plans to expand its strategy to develop infrastructure support with SOR funds to provide buprenorphine in both ambulatory substance use disorder (SUD) treatment programs , as well as other pro grams, such as licensed mental health programs by funding an additional eight agencies , as well as a low -threshold buprenorphine induction program at two Harm Reduction Centers (HRCs). DMHAS also plans to fund Interim Services for individuals on waiting lists for outpatient and residential programs to provide immediate access to MAT to prevent relapse. DMHAS will partner with both Rutgers University and Rowan University to ensure funding is available to support individuals at clinics who are indigent, so they can be inducted and/or maintained on MAT. Services for these individuals are planned to include other ancillary services such as care coordination and peer services. In addition, DMHAS will assist all State county correctional facilities establis h MAT programs or enhance existing MAT services for inmates with an OUD as well as provide care management Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 27 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 64 of 456services. Funding is being made available to promote clinical stability and effective recovery processes for inmates prior to release from incarcerat ion. Recovery Support Recovery support is defined as the coordination of personal, family, and community resources to achieve the best possible quality of life for every client entering the substance abuse early intervention and treatment system. The chr onic nature of addiction requires sustained recovery support to promote sustained periods of wellness and to continuously reduce the need for additional acute care. Correspondingly, a modern addiction treatment system must support sustained recovery. In New Jersey, substance abuse treatment does not end upon discharge; a continuum of care plan, including personal, family and community resources, must be established. It can range from low level contact such as quarterly telephone conversations to high lev el contact such as coaching, depending on support needed. In an effort to increase recovery supports, the existing Mental Health Planning Council was renamed the Behavioral Health Planning Council in 2014 and is moving to expand membership to include in dividuals, families and providers involved in substance abuse services. In essence, this increase in membership will evolve the current Planning Council into a more behavioral health focused Planning Council. The intention of the SSA is to expand addicti on recovery support services throughout the state to mirror the extensive mental health support system, which includes both self -help support centers and supportive housing. The SSA currently funds two Addiction Recovery Centers, and 63 units of supportiv e housing and case management and supportive housing services for 10 women and their children. DMHAS awarded three providers start -up funding for three small -scale Recovery Centers to provide peer -to-peer recovery support services to prevent recurrent of substance use and promote sustained recovery. Recently, DMHAS awarded contract s to provide housing subsidies, case management and supportive services to up to 200 individuals with an OUD who are homeless or at risk of homelessness in five counties: Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Mercer and Monmouth. Contracts were also awarded to pilot three recovery -based housing residences (a minimum of five individuals in each residence), one in each region (North, Central and South) , for consumers with an OUD who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and are in or recently discharged from treatment. Citizen's Advisory Council . The Citizen's Advisory Council (CAC) is composed of consumer and citizen members representing the voices of New Jersey residents at risk for, struggling with, or otherwise affected by the chronic disease of addiction. The CAC supports education, prevention, intervention, treatment, and recovery from alcohol, drug, and other addictive disorders and the elimination of associ ated stigma. The Council provides input and guidance to DMHAS in furthering its mission, linking the Division with consumers and advocating for the needs and interests of individuals, families, and communities. The CAC believes: In the rights of a ll citizens to access and receive quality prevention, treatment, recovery and support services without stigma; Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 28 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 65 of 456 In quality, holistic, comprehensive, affordable, client centered treatment services within a continuum of care that recognizes the need for life-long management; In encouraging informed consumer choice, and that our collective voices are integral to DMHAS in fulfilling its mission. Self-Help Groups. Support for involvement of recovering persons in self -help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous is also routinely provided as part of recovery planning, beginning in treatment and continuing upon discharge. Bringing Recovery Suppo rts to Scale - Technical Assistance Center Strategy. In recent years, New Jersey has greatly expanded, particularly for substance abuse treatment consumers, opportunities to provide peer -delivered services. Accordingly, the number of peers providing these services has also increased. Most of the positions held by peers, however, are part -time or casual in nature. There is a widely -acknowledged understanding, supported by scientific evidence, that peer - delivered services complement and enhance behavioral health care by creating the emotional, social and practical assistance necessary that enables the client/patient to manage their illness and stay healthy. Despite the evidence of effectiveness, however, the settings in which peers are currently employed i n New Jersey are limited. And, beyond training and certification activities, there is often no \"formal\" path by which a peer can enter and serve in this field of work. Peer-delivered services can have a transforming effect on larger systems of care and on our society by enhancing long -term recovery outcomes and elevating public and professional perceptions of hope for recovery. In addition, employment as a peer specialist brings financial benefits not only for the individual, but collectively to societ y as far too many people with behavioral health disorders are discouraged from working when employment can be a form of financial stability, source of identity, and a positive contributor to recovery. In May 2017, was New Jersey was one of 10 states selec ted to participate in the Bringing Recovery Supports to Scale - Technical Assistance Center Strategy (BRSS TACS) policy academy. With guidance from BRSS TACS seeks to develop a plan by which it can expand the role of peers in behavioral health service del ivery, and to develop career guidelines for peers who want to use their experiential knowledge to support the recovery goals of individuals experiencing mental illness or those who suffer from a substance use disorder. Peer Recovery Support Specialists . Peer-based recovery support is defined as a process of giving and receiving nonprofessional, nonclinical assistance to achieve long -term recovery from alcohol and/or drug -related problems. In New Jersey, these supports are provided by c ertified peer recovery specialists with lived experience who have been suc cessful in the recovery process in order to support others experiencing similar situations. Lived experience is defined as having knowledge of substance use disorders or mental illness gained through di rect, personal experience with success in their own recovery process. DMHAS views peers as an integral and equal partner in our peer initiatives as the recovery support services they provide expand the capacity of formal and informal treatment and recover y pathways. Peers are an essential component of p rograms that include medication assisted recovery, residential, therapeutic community and outpatient programs, hospital emergency Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 29 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 66 of 456department deployment, family and recovery centers. Through shared understan ding, respect, and mutual empowerment, certified peer recovery specialists strengthen a person 's motivation to change, help to initiate the recovery process, and engage individuals in the recovery proce ss to reduce the likelihood of a return to substance u se. Peer support can exist within the context of individual level and/or family levels. New Jersey's recovery support services are designed to span all stages of recovery - from initiation/stabilization through recovery maintenance & the enhancement of quality of life in long -term recovery. mobilize \"Recovery Capital\": Internal and External resources that can be drawn upon to initiate and sustain recovery (White, 2009). External Recovery Capital includes, but is not limited to, financial assets, health i nsurance, safe and recovery -conducive shelter, clothing, food, and access to transportation. Internal Recovery Capital includes, but is not limited to, values, knowledge, educational/vocational skills and credentials, self -awareness, self -esteem, self -efficacy, hopefulness/optimism, perception of one's past/present/future, sense of wholeness and healing. Family and/or Social Recovery Capital includes, but is not limited to, intimate relationships, family and kinship relationships (defined here non -tradition ally, i.e., family of choice), and social relationships that are supportive of recovery efforts. Recovery specialists encourage families (biological, nuclear or self -chosen) to become willing to participate in their loved one's treatment and recovery. The presence of others in recovery within the family and social network can help access sober outlets for sobriety -based fellowship/leisure, and relational connections to conventional institutions (school, workplace, church, and other mainstream community organizations). The Division supports the role of peers through several new and existing initiatives. These programs assist individuals with opioid use disorders or those who are at risk of an opioid overdose through supportive services, case management, educ ation, resources, and advocacy for families and individuals. For example, the Opioid Overdose Recovery Program (OORP), which is now in all 21 counties, provides support services to individuals reversed from opioid overdoes treated at hospital emergency de partments. Peers working in OORP programs meet with individuals at bedside where they share their stories of hope and recovery. These peers are instrumental in engaging individuals in the emergency department and beyond and letting them know that they are not alone , and that recovery is available to them in whatever pathway they choose. Peers working in the Support Team for Addiction Recovery (STAR) assist participants in connecting to housing, employment, health services, etc. DMHAS supports the advancement and professionalism of peers by increasing and enhancing its peer workforce. All peers working in DMHAS initiatives attend a 3 -day E thics training, where they learn about themselves, others, cultural diversity, codes of condu ct, motivation interviewing, outreach, self-care, wellness, and engagement techniques. In addition, peers attend t he 5-day Connecticut Community for Ad diction Recovery (CCAR) which lead s to peer certification. DMHAS supports two pathways to peer certific ation. The International Reciprocity and Credentialing Consortium (IC&RC) NJ affiliate, the Addiction Professionals Certification Board, grants the Certified Peer Recovery Specialist (CPRS) and NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals grants the National Certified Peer Recovery Support Specialist (NCPRS). Over 150 peers have receiving training through the Division's Addiction and Training Workforce Development initiative and one-quarter have obtained certification as recovery support specialists .

An indivi dual 15 -minute rate has been developed for peers working in SUD treatment agencies and a bundled rate for the OORP program. The rates are in place as of July 1, 2019. New Jersey's Medicaid office distribut ed a newsletter outlining the reimbursement process for the OORP program as well as providing technical assistance to agencies as they adhere to requirements of this initiative. This is a significant step in helping to provide sustainability for our peer-delivered programs. Opioid Overdose Recovery Program. A Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued in June 2015 to develop an Opioid Overdose Recovery Program (OORP) to respond to individ uals reversed from opioid overdoses and treated at hospital emergency departments as a result of the reversal. This new two -year initiative funded by DMHAS, the Governor's Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (GCADA) and the Department of Children and Fami lies (DCF) fund ed programs in Atlantic, Camden, Essex, Monmouth and Ocean Counties. The Opioid Overdose Recovery Program utilize s recovery specialists and patient navigators to engage individuals reversed from an opioid overdose to provide non -clinical assistance, recovery supports and appropriate referrals for assessment and substance use disorder treatment. The recovery specialis ts and patient navigators also maintain follow -up with these individuals. It is expected that, at minimum, recovery specialists will be accessible and on -call from Thursday evenings through Monday mornings in the specific locations where funding is made a vailable. This new initiative commence d in the fall of 2015. Additional OORP RFPs were released in 2016 to implement the OORP in six more counties. New Jersey's STR award has funded OORP RFPs in 2017 to implement the OORP in the 10 remaining counties in the state . As of March 31, 2019, 11,922 individuals have been served by the OORP. While overdose and relapse prevention are key goals, the program is also intended to help individuals move into recovery. Support Team for Addiction Recovery . Support Teams for Addiction Recovery (STAR) provide case management and recovery support services for individuals with opioid use disorders (OUD). The STAR initiative is comprised of one team, each consisting of a program supervisor, two case managers and two recovery specialists. The team is to maintain a caseload of 40 individuals. STAR case managers work with individuals to assist with issues that often occur concurrently with an OUD, such as homelessness, incarceration, legal issues, employm ent, education, transportation, need for social services, health care, child welfare involvement, child care, health insurance, documentation, etc. The STAR recovery specialists provide non -clinical assistance and recovery supports services. The overall go al of STAR is to help maintain individuals with an OUD in the Recovery Zone for as long as possible, help to reduce the risk of recurring episodes of opioid related problems, and prevent future overdose. As noted earlier, 10 STAR programs were funded by STR funds, and another 11 by SOR funds. Maternal Wraparound Program. The Maternal Wraparound Program ( M-WRAP ) is a program that provides intensive case management and recovery support services for opioid dependent pregnant and postpartum women. Opioid de pendent pregnant women are eligible for services through M-WRAP during pregnancy and up to one year after birth event. Intensive case management focuses on developing a single, coordinated care plan for pregnant/postpartum women, their infants and familie s. Intensive Case Managers work as liaisons to all relevant entities Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 31 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 68 of 456involved with each woman. Recovery Support Specialists p rovide non -clinical assistance and recovery supports while maintaining follow -up with the women and their infants. DMHAS , DCF, and funding through the Governor's Initiative supports seven M -WRAP regions statewide. Target counties were selected based on a high incidence of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) from 2014 data provided by the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services and the number of unduplicated pregnant women seeking substance use disorder treatment in those counties during 2015 according to data from the New Jersey Substance Abuse Monitoring System. The overall goal with the M -WRAP is to alleviate barriers to services for pregnant opioid dependent women through comprehe nsive care coordination implemented wi thin the five major timeframes when intervention in the life of the substance exposed infants (SEI) can reduce potential harm of prenatal substan ce exposure : pre -pregnancy, prenatal, birth, neonatal and early childhood . Care coordination also addresses screening, early intervention, assessment, treatment and recovery supports. To ensure that the needs of the mother, infant and family receive c oordination, access to and engagement in services, providers are required to develop Plans of Safe Care. The plan shall be developed prior to the birth event whenever possible and in collaboration with treatment providers, health care providers, early chi ldhood service providers and other members of the multidisciplinary team as appropriate. The M -WRAP model is intended to promote maternal health, improve birth outcomes for women, their infants and families, and reduce the risks and adverse consequences o f prenatal substance exposure. Collegiate Recovery. Two public colleges and universities (Rutgers University at New Brunswick and The College of New Jersey) receive funds to support students in recovery. Recovery support and housing agreements are in pla ce with Rutgers University, New Brunswick and Newark campuses and The College of New Jersey. Recovery supports include screening and intervention services for at risk students; recovery housing; self-help, mentoring, prevention; community education; and alcohol -free/alternative programming and community service opportunities. A capital agreement is in process with The College of New Jersey to enhance its existing recovery community on campus. Famil y Support Centers. Three regional Family Support Centers were developed to provide peer to peer family support services for at least 50 families in each region whose loved ones suffer from an opioid use disorder (OUD) . Each regional center is staffed with Family Support Coordinator s with lived experience s trained in the Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training (CRAFT) model. CRAFT teaches families self -protection along with non -confrontational skills to help empower their loved one to seek treatment; as well as helping each family member develop and work on their own Individualized Wellness Recovery Plan. The overall goal of the FSC Coordinator is to provide compassionate support to empower parents to have a better quality of life, improve their psychological health, reduce levels of stress, feel less isolated, and gain skills needed to c ope with their loved ones' OUD. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 32 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 69 of 456The F amily Support Centers also offer s families support, education, resources and advocacy in an environment that is safe and non -stigmatizing. Families who receive FSC services also receive Naloxone Training and Kits to assist their loved ones at risk of opioid overdose. Telephone Recovery Support . The Telephone Recovery Support (T RS) program is intended for individuals discharged from substance use disorder treatment with an opioid use disorder, as well as those who are trying to maintain recovery from an opioid use disorder. Weekly phone calls are made by trained staff and volunteers who provide support, encouragement and information concerning recovery resources. TRS is a peer -to-peer check -in type service where the staff and volunteers will help provide local recovery supports, includin g information about local resources such as self -help meetings, food pantries, recovery houses and detox, if needed. Also included in TRS is the incorporation of text messaging and other types of social media in order to appeal to the younger population wh o rely on cell phones and social media to communicate. Staff help provide information about local recovery supports, including information about local resources such as self -help meetings, food pantries, and recovery -based living, if needed. To date, 618 individuals have been served by TRS. Prison Intensive Recovery Treatment Support . The Prison Intensive Recovery Treatment Support (PIRTS) program is a collaboration with the NJ Department of Corrections (DOC) providing peer services that expand s pre- and post - release recovery support services to individuals within DOC with an opioid use disorder and facilitate s continuity of care and treatment that includes comprehensive medical, substance use treatment and social services. Eligible Offenders being released from DOC custody who are receiving FDA approved medication assisted treatment for an OUD and who will continue to receive medication assisted treatment after their release from prison, and those Eligible Offenders, with an OUD, being released from custody who choose not to receive medication assisted treatment while incarcerated are participants in the PIRTS program. The overall goal of PIRTS is to help individuals with an OUD who are being released from prison access the Recovery Zone. Within the \"recovery zone\" the client acquires valuable relapse prevention skills from various means, according to what works best, to sustain recovery. Experiences are translated into valuable lessons and integrated into recovery plans that most closely reflect the client's needs, preferences and values. The outcome of sustained recovery is saving lives, families, communities and dollar s. The term \"recovery zone\" refers to a state of sustained recovery characterized by long periods of abstinence, gainful employment, stable housing, and supportive and rewarding social and spiritual connectedness. Interventions that support clients' entran ce into and maintenance within the recovery zone improve the quality of life for individuals with opioid use disorders. This program was developed through an MOA with University Behavioral Health Care and in close collaboration with the Department of Corre ctions (DOC). A key feature of this program is that the provider will begin working with offenders 6 months prior to release. Recovery Centers. New Jersey has five recovery centers for individuals in recovery from substance use disorders. Recovery centers are place s that those in recovery can find help, fellowship, and a safe haven. Peer workers provide mentoring, coaching, care coordination, social and recreation activities, life skills, vocational training, support groups, wellness classes, workshops and assistance in housing, childcare, language and employment . Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 33 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 70 of 456 The SSA opened New Jersey's first Recovery Center at Eva's Village in Paterson in September 2009 and its programs have grown exponentially in the last six years. This peer -driven and peer - operate d center, which is open 365 days per year, provides the following services in the large metropolitan area and surrounding communities: referral to treatment, peer support services, housing assistance, employment assistance, and language assistance, and sel f-help advocacy, childcare assistance, and recreational activities, wellness classes of interest to the community and advocacy activities in support of recovery. Client choice to participate in program activities is paramount. Additionally, the Recovery Center's participants and staff continue to take leadership roles in community oriented recovery activities such as hosting a Recovery Month walk and picnic celebration in the large catchment area of Passaic County as well as organizing transportation for many (four bus loads) of their program participants to attend the largest Recovery celebration in the tri -state area in Philadelphia. The SSA issued a n RFP and subsequently awarded a contract to the Center for Family Services in Camden County in April 201 2 to provide New Jersey's second Recovery Center. It opened in December 2012 at a suburban location in Camden County. Staff working seven days a week provide outreach to individuals in recovery as well as to provider treatment programs throughout the stat e. Like Eva's village before them, Living Proof Recovery Center has a peer advisory board and a full monthly calendar with weekly self -help meetings, anger management, resume -building and financial workshops. There are also sober social activities such as line dancing, wrap sessions and recovery movies on the weekends. Both recovery centers also provide Telephone Recovery Support (TRS) which has been is an evidence -based and data driven method of successful recovery support (White, 209). Both centers hav e a strong core of volunteers who are helping with day to day operations and recruitment. At present, staff and volunteers at both centers have used CRSP and updated CDA certification for staff and volunteers. DMHAS has expanded Recovery C enters through the SOR funding. Funding has been issued in 2019 through a Request for Proposals (RFP) to develop Community Peer Recovery Centers (CPRC) where individuals can access peer support, information about substance use disorder treatment, recovery support servic es, and information about other community resources in a supportive substance free environment. DMHAS has awarded three providers in the amount of $100,000 each which is for start -up small -scale Recovery Centers to provide peer -to-peer recovery support se rvices to prevent recurrent of substance use and promote sustained recovery. Providers are required to provide peer -to-peer recovery support services that are responsive to community needs. All activities and services are led and drive by \"peers\", individ uals who have experienced addiction and recovery, either directly or indirectly as a family member or friend. The overall goal of the CPRC is to provide a safe place for recovering individuals to gather in support of one another and experience recovery -oriented living in a community setting. The CPRC will be a place where those in recovery can have the opportunity to give back to their community thereby fostering senses of empowerment and independence. DMHAS will be issuing another RFP in early Summer, 20 19 using SOR funds for expansion of seven additional CPRCs. Coalition for Addiction Recovery Support . The Coalition for Addiction Recovery Support (CARS ) Advisory committee is a diverse group of experienced recovery support practitioners and providers fr om New Jersey comprised of 75% peers at minimum . It offers the opportunity for Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 34 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 71 of 456individual members to be part of a statewide voice for recovery. For organizations , it offers the opportunity to contribute to the development and expansion of recovery support services in New Jersey and an opportunity to coordinate the training and cultivation of the per workforce. The organization is currently funded through SAMHA's Building Communities of Recovery (BCOR) grant. Grassroots Recovery Organizations and Centers. The Recovery Movement that began in the late 1990's with Faces and Voices of Recovery and most recently celebrated in the 2012 movie The Anonymous People is well established in New Jersey. In terms of social media, there are numerous NJ Recovery Support pages on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter - ranging from parent to parent support groups sprung from the loss of their own children, to groups advocating for more treatment and recovery options for those suffering from a substance use disorder . At the commu nity level, New Jersey has seen tremendous efforts in advocacy and recovery support. The New Jersey chapter of the National Association on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (NCADD - NJ) has developed a program of \"Recovery Advocates\" program with graduates be ing divided into regional teams across the state. These Advocacy Leaders are trained on how to provide testimony to the New Jersey Assembly as well to develop regional events to educate the community about recovery and reduce stigma regarding addiction . There are eight grassroo ts recovery organizations in NJ: Addictions Victorious (Gloucester County) , A Change for Nick (Passaic County), CARES - Center for Addiction Recovery, Education and Success (Morris County ), CARES (Warren County ), City of Angel s (Merc er County ), CFC Loud and Clear (Monmouth County) , Help Not Handcuffs (Monmouth County ), Hope Sheds Light Foundation ( Ocean County) and Recovery Advocates of America (Mercer County) . Some of these organizations run their own peer-developed, peer designed and peer run Recovery Centers independent of DMHAS funding : City of Angels , CARES - The Center for Addiction Recovery, Education and Success in Morris and Warren Counties , CFC Loud and Clear , Recovery Advocates of America and A Change for Nick . All of these centers train their peer recovery staff and volunteers using the CCAR model. The centers are primarily volunteer run and often receive donations from families who lost loved ones to addiction . These organizations are community - based and de veloped efforts to help individuals access treatment, provide support throughout their treatment experience and provide aftercare/relapse prevention supports and services after discharge. These are peer -designed, non -12 step affiliated groups, although 12 step meetings are often held on site. Other Recovery Organizations. There are other recovery organizations that provide education, support and advocacy for those with SUD and their families and loved ones. Three grassroots coalitions provide family support: The Silent Epidemic (Gloucester County ), Parent to Parent (Burlington County ) and Stop the Heroin (Atlantic County ). Seven organizations provide advocacy and training : National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence NJ (Mercer County), Mental Health Association of NJ (Union County), Ammon Foundation (Union County), Mainstream Recovery (Monmouth County, New Jersey Prevention Network (Monmouth County), King's Crusade (Burlington County) and New Jersey Recovery Advocates (Bergen County) . Five organizations provide recovery residences: Hansen Foundation (Atlantic County), Surfside Structured Sober Living (Atlantic County), Antonia Maria Foundation (Middlesex County), God Winks (Bergen County), and Milestone House (Bergen County).

In the fall of 2014, New Jersey opened its first Recovery High School - the Raymond Lesniak ESH Recovery High School , which is located on the campus of Kean University in Union Coun ty. It is open to students throughout NJ. A Recovery High School is exclusively for young people that struggle with substance use disorders. Every member of the staff, faculty and administration in each school is required to attend numerous trainings re garding addiction and recovery. The school provides social, academic and counseling. The initial class enrolled approximately 20 students. The number of students enrolled is increas ing annually. In 2018, two additional recovery high schools opened in N ew Jersey - one in Monmouth County, and the other in Cape May County. Group Homes for Persons in Recovery (Criterion 7 ). Funding is provided to Oxford Houses to provide administrative and programmatic oversight of the statewide network of peer -led group recovery homes in New Jersey. The Oxford House model offers recovery -oriented living as a choice in a person's continuum o f care. Recovery is an individualized process for individuals with substance use disorders . As of April 2019, New Jersey has approximately 139 Oxford Houses (102 male houses, 30 women houses, and 7 women with children houses); total beds are 1 ,113 with 827 male and 286 female beds. The Revolving Loan Fund is administered by Oxford House annually to establish new homes, with additional funding from the Administrative Office of the Courts and DMHAS treatment contracts. This funding supports Oxford House outreach staff to establish homes exclusive for the Drug Court population and women with children homes. Federal funding for the State Opioid Response (SOR) allowed for expansion of the Oxford House contract for three full -time Outreach workers to establi sh 10 new homes per year. In response to the opioid overdose epidemic, and its effects related to Oxford House, DMHAS requires Oxford House outreach staff to conduct annual trainings (overdose specific) for the 14 Oxford House Chapters throughout the state . Trainings are provided at the Oxford House annual state workshop. Each home is required to maintain Naloxone kits on site. Oxford House shall make every effort to accept individuals prescribed Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) as well as other legitim ately prescribed medications. Women and children Oxford Houses shall be responsible for providing lockboxes to each woman for medication storage, and residents in Oxford Houses are responsible for their individual medication lockboxes. Supportive Housin g. The SSA has two existing supportive housing programs modeled on Housing First and incorporated into its MATI. These two contracts combined provide for a total of 63 housing units, 31 units in Camden and 32 units in Atlantic City. Services are provided to individuals with substance abuse disorders who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, and are intravenous drug users. Women with children are given top priority. It includes rental subsidies and support services. The SS A developed a Women's Intensive Supportive Housing (WISH) Program. This program develops permanent supportive housing for pregnant and/or parenting women with a co -existing substance abuse disorder and mental illness who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and being discha rged from a licensed long -term residential substance abuse treatment and/or halfway house facility. An RFP was developed and released in January 2015. This RFP calls for the development of a WISH team to provide case management and supportive housing ser vices for 10 women and their children. The SSA is seeking to partner with a provider that will serve identified WISH Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 36 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 73 of 456Program clients in supportive housing and has demonstrated success in managing permanent supportive housing programs. An award was made in May 2015. DMHAS outpatient treatment system will be able to accommodate the substance abuse treatment needs of the project participants. In addition to WISH, DMHAS has provided additional subsidies to DCP&P to develop housing for parents with children in the child welfare system. DMHAS recently awarded contracts to provide individualized case management and supportive services to up to 200 OUD consumers, on average, up to 8 hours per month, billable in 15 units, based on individual needs. These services will assist individuals in seeking and connecting with behavioral health and or physical healthcare needs . DMHAS will provide 200 rental subsidies, up to the fair market rate (FMR) as defined by the Department of Community Affairs ( DCA) for lease based housing. One -time funding will be available to consumers for security deposits, utility start - up costs and furnishings. Contracts were awarded four agencies to serve individuals in five counties: Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Mercer a nd Monmouth. Contracts were recently awarded for pilot three recovery -based housing residences (a minimum of five individuals in each residence), one in each region (North, Central and South) , for individuals with an OUD who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and are in or recently discharged from treatment. Individualized case management and recovery -based housing servi ces will be provided for 15 individuals (a minimum of five individuals in each region) who have been identified as needing a safe, healthy, peer -lead, recovery -oriented environment. The h ousing provided must be licensed as a Class F, Cooperative Sober Living Residence (NJAC \u00a7 5:27). Accordingly, individuals will be responsible for providi ng their own food and taking care of their own laundry. Treatment and counseling may not be provided in the residence; however, non -clinical recovery support services may be provided at the site and the agency may require, at its discretion, drug or alcoh ol testing of residents. (NJAC \u00a7 5:27 -2.1). Services to Special /Target Populations Pregnant Women and Women with Dependent Children (Criterion 3) . In 2014 as a SAMHSA Prescription Drug Abuse Policy Academy State, New Jersey was eligible to apply for a u nique technical assistance opportunity through the SAMHSA supported National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare (NCSACW) to address the multi -faceted problems of Substance Exposed Infants (SEI) and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). New Jersey DHS/DMHAS as the lead State agency partnered with DCF and Department of Health (DOH) and submitted a successful application for In -Depth Technical Assistance (IDTA) (no funding attached). The IDTA goal was to develop uniform policies/guidelines that addr ess the entire spectrum of NAS and SEI from pre -pregnancy, prevention, early intervention, assessment and treatment, postpartum and early childhood. The IDTA would also provide assistance to New Jersey to strengthen collaboration and linkages across multip le systems such as addictions treatment, child welfare, and medical communities to improve services for pregnant women with opioid and other substance use disorders and outcomes for their babies. The New Jersey IDTA Core Team included over sixty (60) indi viduals representing multiple State Departments and Divisions, community stakeholders, treatment providers, and the medical community. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 37 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page three goals: (1) Increase perinatal SEI screening at multiple intervention points (Health system, S UD/MH system); (2) Leverage existing programs and policy mechanisms to collaboratively increase the rate at which women screening positive on the 4P's Plus get connected for a comprehensive assessment by establishing formal warm -handoffs and other safety net measures; (3) Leverage existing programs and policy mechanisms to collaboratively increase the rate at which women delivering SEIs and their babies and any other eligible children, receive early support services for which they are eligible. Three workg roups convened : (1) Data Workgroup looked at statewide data systems (Medicaid ICD codes and DOH) that capture prenatal screening, linkage to treatment services, follow -up for parenting women, prevalence of NAS and associated costs. During the initiative, t he team analyzed 2013 and 2014 Medicaid data to establish prevalence and costs of treatment NAS. (2) Prenatal Screening, Early Identification of Infants & Referral to Service Workgroup focused on how to increase connections to appropriate treatment and s upportive services such as Central Intake and Perinatal Cooperatives, by mapping out current screening and referral practices across the state using Pregnancy Risk Assessment (PRA) data; New Jersey implemented the 4Ps+ across the State and embedded the too l within the PRA. The workgroup found high utilization (over 80%) of 4Ps+ within doctors serving pregnant women on Medicaid. The mapping allowed the team to target low utilization areas to increase the prevalence of prenatal screening. (3) Labor, Delivery and Engagement (Infants) Workgroup developed a comprehensive survey with input from the medical community and perinatal cooperatives. The Hospital Birth Survey was disseminated statewide March 2017 to the labor and delivery hospitals. The survey sought to understand how pregnant women with SUD and substance -exposed infants are identified, treated, and triaged with partners at discharge, and if treatment for NAS was explored. The Hospital Birth Survey results is intended to guide Departments in establishing statewide guidelines for best practice; aid in the development of cross system models to ensure families get access to services; establish education needs on issues of SEI/NAS and identify high risk areas. Throughout the IDTA process the Core team report ed to the State Opioid Workgroup. The Opioid Workgroup was comprised of representatives from multiple State departments and their divisions. The Opioid Workgroup engaged the support and commitment of Department -level commissioners in dire cting the resources and expertise of their particular department to address the issue of opioids and its attendant problems. In order to sustain the work completed in IDTA, the Opioid Workgrou p recommended the establishment of a systemic approach to infan t substance exposure, prevention and intervention. The Opioid Workgroup developed an interagency workgroup to promote improved outcomes for SEIs and their families . Although, th is workgroup is no longer convened , a monthly Opioid Workgroup meeting is convened u nder the leadership of Governor Murphy's Policy Office, that includes high level leadership representing different state departments including the Department of Human Services ( DMHAS and the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services), De partment of Corrections, Department of Law and Public Safety, Department of Labor and Workforce Development, Department of Health and Department of Children and Families. The IDTA commenced in 2017, however, DMHAS as the IDTA lead state agency requested modified technical assistance from the NCSACW to support New Jersey to interpret the key Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 38 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 75 of 456findings from the Birthing Hospital Survey , and apply these findings to the Project ECHO program design. Robert Wood Johnson and the Nicholson Foundation, in partnership with the three Departments (Health, Human Services, and Children and Families) and other stakeholders began planning to launch Project ECHO (Extension for Community Outcomes) for SEIs. The New Jersey Project ECHO is aimed at Statewide adopt ion of best practice clinical care and community - based interventions to support SEIs and their parents to support recovery, family formation, and child development through a multidisciplinary case -based learning platform. Project ECHO for SEI and parents focuses on prevention, birth, and the infant's first year of life. DCF is the lead State agency on Plans of Safe Care for SEI, mothers and their families and has developed protocols for integrating Plans of Safe Care into child protection services and c hild welfare and child welfare assessments. Child Welfare/Parents with Dependent Children Programs (PWWDC Criterion 3). July 1, 2015, the treatment contracts for parents with substance use disorders via a Memorandum of Understanding between the SSA and DCF Division of Child Protection & Permanency (DCP&P) transitioned over to DCF. DCF and DMHAS collaborate on multiple initiatives targeted to pregnant and parenting women with substance use disorders. This partnership focuses on a coordinated multisystem approach to enhance and integrate service delivery that will ultimately improve the outcomes for the women, their infants and families. This cross -system collaboration ensures that services are coordinated , and information is shared appropriately to facil itate better communication, maximize resources and address barriers. Currently, 12 of New Jersey's 21 counties have monthly DCP&P Child Welfare Substance Use Disorder Consortia meetings which are held at the local DCP&P offices. Child welfare staff, DMHAS, Division of Family Development, Substance Use Disorder Provider Agencies, Work First New Jersey, Substance Abuse Initiative (WFNJ SAI) providers, and Boards of Social Services meet each month and plan on how to better serve families, leading to more effective policies and practices to meet the needs of infants, children and families. The Consortia al so addresses ASFA timelines and reunification for children in out of home placement. Through collaboration, multiple agencies working with the same family can improve communication to reduce the gaps in service delivery and improve coordination of services . The Consortia allow for cross systems collaboration with local treatment programs and other community partners who can provide the expertise needed to better serve families in the child welfare system. Persons Who Inject Drugs Services (Criterion 4). The SSA will continue to require all substance use disorder treatment agencies providing treatment to persons who inject drugs ( PWID) to provide outreach activities to encourage PWID clients to seek and undergo treatment. The SSA will continue to incorpo rate a provision within the requirements section of each contract with the agencies providing treatment to PWID to ensure that these entities: 1) admit all individuals who request and are determined to be in need of treatment for intravenous drug use withi n 14 days of their request; or 2) make interim services available to the individuals within 48 hours of the request, and should the individual actively remain on the waiting list, admit the clients within 120 days. Each program will be notified that the fo llowing information about each client, who cannot be Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 39 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 76 of 456admitted to treatment within 14 days, shall be documented on the provider's standard waiting list: 1) date of placement on the waiting list; 2) unique client identifying number; 3) categorical priority s tatus for admission; 4) record of provision of interim services by type and date; 5) record of weekly contact between client and entity; and 6) date and reason for removal from the waiting list. Tuberculosis Services (Criterion 5). In New Jersey, all substance use disorder treatment facilities receiving contracts are required to conduct TB testing as part of the patients' admissions process. A provision of the guidelines require that patients with TB, who were not admitted for treatment because the funde d capacity at that facility had been exceeded, would be referred to another treatment provider for services. HIV Services (Criterion 6) . The Division currently funds Early Intervention Services (EIS) and HIV Specialist positions at 14 licensed Opioid Tr eatment Programs (OTPs) providers statewide at 15 site locations, one of which is in a rural location . Services are available in areas of the state that have the highest rate of HIV infection, as well as the greatest need for these services. Since DMHAS recognizes that individuals with substance use disorders, specifically injectable drug users, are at a higher risk for contracting HIV/AIDS than the general population, DMHAS obligates a portion of its HIV Block Grant funds to implement a Memorandum of Agr eement (MOA) with Rutgers, Robert Wood Johnson (RWJ) Medical School, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, that provides administrative services including lab directorship, consultation, lab oversight, authorization, HIV test kits and technical support to ensure rapid HIV testing for clients in several licensed substance abuse treatment facilities statewide. Through the existing MOA, DMHAS also funds for mobile testing services conducted by staff employed by RWJ Medical School. Specific emphasi s for mobile services is for residential and ambulatory substance use disorder treatment programs located in areas of the State with the highest incidence of intravenous drug use and HIV infection. The SSA currently expends 5% of its SAPT Block Grant award to support the HIV Early Intervention Services (EIS) at 14 funded providers at 15 site locations. Of these, South Jersey Drug Treatment Center provides access to HIV EIS services to substance use disorder treatment clients residing in a rural area, defin ed as a census area of less than 2,500 residents, consistent with SAPT Block Grant requirements. Funding for early intervention services allows clients to receive some or all of these services, either provided on -site at the substance use disorder treatment program or at a nearby medical facility in the community or provided at a combination of both settings. As of FFY 2017, the State of New Jersey was no longer classified as a designated HIV Block Grant State. As a result, the DMHAS will no lo nger be permitted to utilize funds from its SAPT Block Grant to support the continuance of HIV EIS after FFY 2019 . DMHAS will continue to work closely with its providers to develop affiliation agreements with agencies in communities that provide HIV testi ng and treatment services to ensure integrated care. Drug Court. Drug Court is a cooperative initiative between the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) and the SSA which commenced in 2002. This agreement allows the AOC to transfer treatment funding to the SSA who then secures and makes available, based upon clinical need, a complete continuum of care for Drug Court offenders sentenced in New Jersey Superior Court. Fifteen vicinages serving all 21 counties Drug Courts function within the existing Su perior Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 40 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 77 of 456Court structure to provide treatment along the full continuum of care and diversion opportunities for non -violent offenders who otherwise may be incarcerated in state prisons for drug related offenses. Drug Court participation ha d been voluntary. In July 2012 legislation was signed into law that stipulated a two-phase Drug Court expansion: broaden the legal eligibility to include second degree burglary and robbery and require mandatory sentencing to Drug Court . These were both accomplished by the court by July 2017 . In 2016, The Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) Drug Court received a Federal Grant allowing them to provide temporary recovery -oriented housing to Adult Drug Court participants in New Jersey's 21 counties. In collaboration with the DMHAS (SSA), an RFP was issued which stipulated that the funds from this grant would allow providers to secure and offer temporary recover -based housing to Dru g Court participants over a three -year period. Providers would demonstrate a safe and recovery housing environment that will allow for up to 50 beds to be utilized annually serving 150 Drug Court participants in the community during the three years awarde d, while maintaining a recovery -oriented lifestyle. The parameters must stay within the maximum scope of four months per Drug Court participant. However, additional months can be utilized if there is a need to continue temporary housing until permanent h ousing is secured. Individual eligible for this initiative would be participants who are completing or have completed various Levels of Care (LOC) including residential, Outpatient (OP), Intensive Outpatient (IOP), Partial Care (PC) and Halfway House (H WH) and are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless in need of appropriate housing. This grant was awarded because of the barrier that exist for many Drug Court participants who are ready to enter the community. However, they have difficulty securing re covery housing and as a result are forced to stay in county jails, in longer lengths of stay or remain in treatment because housing was not available as an option for them when they were scheduled to be discharged. This barrier has prevented many particip ants from moving to the next level in their recovery. Providers awarded this RFP had to utilize Evidence Base Practices (EBP), along with supporting documentation that was reviewed and approved by SAMHSA that acknowledge this is a safe and recovery -based environment. Providers also showed that they follow or will follow the National Association of Recovery Residences (NARR) standards for recovery houses and the NARR code of ethics that governs their recovery -based environments. Mutual Agreement Program . The SSA oversees the Mutual Agreement Program (MAP), a Parolee Substance Use Treatment Project implemented through Memoranda of Agreements between the SSA and the New Jersey State Parole Board (NJSPB ). This funding is a combination of direct appropriati ons from DMHAS and funds transferred from NJSPB. For the NJSPB, these funds support a similar FFS network which offers the full continuum of care including long term and short term residential care, halfway house, partial care, detoxification, outpatient a nd intensive outpatient treatment, co -occurring services, psychotropic medication reimbursement, and medication assisted treatment. Co-Occurring Services. Beginning in SFY 2010, the SSA established a Co -Occurring Services Network (COSN), comprised of 53 substance abuse licensed treatment providers was established to provide treatment to clients with co -occurring disorders on a Fee for Service (FSS) basis. Agencies eligible to join the FFS Initiatives Co -Occurring Network must first meet New Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 41 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 78 of 456Jersey of Health Certificate of Need Licensing Office (CN&L) requirements as a co - occurring provider before applying to the FFS Co -Occurring Network. Currently, there are 127 agencies in the COSN. These agencies represent 240 individually licensed sites w ith COSN approval. Approval to provide co -occurring services is predicated on agency's submission, and DMHAS' approval of agency's co -occurring policies and procedures as part of the agency's Co - Occurring Services Network Applications. Those agencies con tracted for the South Jersey Initiative (SJI), Driving Under the Influence Initiative (DUII), New Jersey Statewide Initiative (NJSI), Medication Assisted Treatment Initiative (MATI), Substance Abuse Prevention & Treatment Initiatives (SAPTI), State Hospit al Access to Rehabilitation and Education (SHARE), and State Targeted Opioid Response Initiative (STORI) FFS Initiatives must also participate in the co -occurring network and have demonstrated readiness to provide integrated care for dually diagnosed clie nts. The contractee shall be co - occurring capable and provide at a minimum , assessments and treatment , or must be able to screen, refer and provide linkages to a co -occurring capable agency. The contractee shall ensure that clients screened as \"at risk\" fo r co-occurring disorders (COD) shall receive a complete mental health assessment. If the screening contractee is not qualified to provide COD services, it is the contractee's responsibility to facilitate a referral for this service and coordinate ongoing c are. Services to Families of Military Veterans. Working with the New Jersey National Guard Family Program and its eight Family Assistance Centers based at armories around the state, the SSA funds the New Jersey Prevention Network to provide programs to serve returning military personnel and their families through two evidence -based programs, Coping with Work and Family Stress and the Strengthening Families Program. Both programs are designed to enhance protective factors to support military members and their families in making responsible parenting and individual choices in regards to drug and alcohol use. New Jersey is focused on returning Veterans as a priority population by delivering both Block Grant and PFS-funded initiative s. This is another popul ation for which there is limited information. DMHAS has reached out to New Jersey Department of Military and Veteran's Affairs as well as the New Jersey National Guard to solicit their active participation on the SEOW and Advisory Council in light of this priority. Driving Under the Influence Offenders . New Jersey set aside $7.5 million in state funds beginning in November 2005 to support the substance use disorder treatment needs for financially indigent residents of New Jersey who have been convicted o f intoxicated driving and related offenses including driving under the influence (DUI). Convicted DUI Offenders who are financially indigent (less than 350% of the FPL) can receive and all appropriate levels of care for the length of substance use disorde r treatment documented by medical necessity. The intent is to ensure NJ residents in need of substance use disorder treatment receive the necessary interventions, and to reduce the incidence of recidivism and ultimately creating safer roads and waterways. There are over 200 licensed sites in the Driving Under the Influence Initiative (DUII) network providing all levels of substance use disorder treatment services. Older Adults. The SSA recognized that information concerning older adults and substance use is lacking, and this was also identified as a data gap by the SEOW. In order to help close that gap, Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 42 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 79 of 456the statewide results have yielded some interesting findings that will help drive planning efforts for this population over two years. Based upon res ults from the New Jersey Older Adult Survey on Drug Use and Health, DMHAS was led to focus on unhealthy drinking patterns and prescription drug abuse among adults age sixty and older. Data from the Older Adult Survey showed, that in terms of illicit drug use, respondents were more likely to use tranquilizers, sedatives, and opiates than older adults who responded to the New Jersey Household Survey. Data also showed a definite pattern of misuse of prescription drugs and alcohol, particularly among male res pondents. New Jersey's 19 DMHAS -funded coalitions are addressing issues regarding the misuse of alcohol or prescription drugs among older adults through the use of appropriate environmental programs and strategies. Nearly one in every four people residing in New Jersey (23.7% of New Jersey's population) is aged 55 or older. Also, compared to national statistics, New Jersey is expected to witness more significant decreases in two population groups: those under the age of 25 and those between the ages of 35 -44 years. In addition, the New Jersey population will age more rapidly than the country as a whole. That is, since 2006, New Jersey has experienced a higher percentage point change in the 75 and older age group. Based upon analyses of New Jersey' s Older Adult Survey, findings are consistent with those from national surveys as described below . The number of substance dependent and abusing adults over age 50 is predicted to rise: from 1.7 million 2002 to 4.4 million by 2020 (Office of National Drug Control Policy) A government survey of nearly 11,000 Americans aged 50 and up revealed: 23% of men and 9% of women ages 50 -64 admitted to binge drinking in the past month 14% of men and 3% of women ages 65 and older reported binge drinking According t o the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2013 , rates of lifetime drug use will increase in the next two decades among the baby boom generation, probably because of less stigma among the cohort reg arding \"illicit\" drug use; and because the current cohort of older adults tend to misuse alcohol and prescription medications if they misuse substances at all. As the baby boom generation ages, the cohort's size alone is predicted to double the number of p ersons needing treatment for substance use disorders. Therefore , DMHAS has identified older adults as a priority population for substance abuse prevention services and provides funding for both the environmental programs and approaches mentioned above as well as evidence -based curricular programs. In 2017, DMHAS utilized STR funds to develop the Alternative Approaches to Pain Management program for older adults. The programs provide information about managing acute and chronic pain with means other than opioid analgesics: NSAIDs, massage, yoga, nerve blocks, etc. The program is currently in operation in 10 counties and will soon be expanded to all 21. Deaf and Hard of Hearing . The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Program for the Deaf, Hard of Hearing and Disable d and a Program Advisory Committee w ere established pursuant to PL 1995, c.318 (NJSA 26:2B -36 to 39) and continue to meet on a quarterly basis to ensure quality substance abuse treatment services are provided to individuals who identify as being Deaf, hard of hearing or disabled in the community. Annualized funding of $350,000 is provided for prevention, education, treatment, intervention, communication accessibility, and advocacy services for the population of Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 43 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 80 of 456individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, and/or disabled. Communication accessibility is coordinated to provide sign language interpreters or Computer Assisted Real -Time Translation (CART) for individuals who are identified as deaf or hard of hearing seeking substance abuse treatment at any level of care. Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered, and Questioning . The SSA provides prevention services to Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered, and Questioning (GLBTQ) youth. The SSA awarded funding to the North Jersey Community R esearch Initiative to expand their existing programs for high-risk GLBTQ youth of color by using a \"Street Smart\" prevention model developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as early intervention services, social marketing, and st ructured recreational activities. The SSA provides prevention services to GLBTQ youth. The odds of substance use for GLBTQ youth are on average 190 percent higher than for heterosexual youth, according to a study by University of Pittsburgh researchers p ublished in the April 2008 issue of Addiction. For some sub - populations of GLBTQ youth, researchers found the odds were substantially higher, including 340 percent for bisexual youth and 400 percent for lesbians. The SSA awarded funding to the North Jersey Community Research Initiative to expand their existing programs for high -risk GLBTQ youth of color by adapting the \"Street Smart\" prevention model developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as early intervention services, socia l marketing, and structured recreational activities. Consumers < 350% Federal Poverty Level . The SSA has established a guideline of 350% Federal Poverty Level ( FPL) for the receipt of state funded substance abuse treatment. Clients are means tested with a web -based tool, known as the DAS Income Eligibility (DASIE) prior to admission into substance abuse treatment to determine whether they qualify for public funding. Other SABG Criteria (8, 9, 10) Referrals to Treatment (Criterion 8) . DMHAS utilizes the criteria set by the American S ociety of Addiction Medicine (ASAM ) for patient placement. The tool that is utilized for assessment and placement is the Level of Care I ndex Version 3, which is incorporated in DMHAS administrative data system, NJSAMS. In addition, the DSM - 5 is utilized for diagnosis. The Immediate Needs Profile (INP) is used as a screening tool. DMHAS Licensed Substance Use Disorder Treatment Providers receiving funding from the Federal Substance Abuse Block Grant Women's Set -Aside are required to conform to current New Jersey Licensure Standards for Intensive Outpatient, Out Patient Psycho/Social, Opioid Treatment, Short Term, Long Term Residential and Halfway House Programs. Contractees must ensure that pregnant women are receiving substance use disorder treatment prenatally through post -partum. Providers are required to complete the following assessments: 1) Addiction Severity Index (ASI); 2) America n Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Criteria 2013; 3) Level of Care Indicator (LOCI); 4) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM5); and the New Jersey Substance Abuse Monitoring System (NJSAMS). Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 44 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 81 of 456Contractees are required to work coll aboratively with the community, other stakeholders and state systems to identify potential clients. Providers must ensure that pre -admission service coordination shall be provided to reduce barriers to treatment, enhance motivation, stabilize life situati ons and facilitate engagement in treatment. Contractees must ensure that priority admission and interim services to their programs will be given to IV using, pregnant women and parenting women and publicize the fact. If a contractee is at full funded capacity and unable to admit the pregnant woman, they must refer such women to another facility or make interim services available within 48 hours. At a minimum, interim services includes the following: counseling and education about HIV and Tuberculosis (TB), about the risks of needle -sharing, the risks of transmission to sexual partne rs and infants, and about steps that can be taken to ensure that HIV and TB transmission does not occur, as well as referral for HIV or TB treatment services, if necessary, linkage to Recovery Centers and/or other recovery supports in the community, and referral and/or and refer ral and/or linkage to community naloxone education programs. For pregnant women, interim serv ices also include counseling on the effects of alcohol an d drug use on the fetus, as well as referral for prenatal care. Medication -Assisted Treatment (MAT) is the standard of care for pregnant women with opioid use disorder (Treatment Improvement Protocol 43, Chapter 13). Contractees are required to ensure that pregnant women are immediately provided with or referred to comprehensive medication assisted treatment and continue this modality of treatment throughout pregnancy. If a woman wishes to continue with this modality of treatment following her delivery , it is expected that the treatment agency coordinate continuance when clinically appropriate. All women will be given timely access to prenatal care either by the program or by referral to appropriate healthcare providers. Contractees must ensure that pro gram staff is qualified based on professional licensing regulations and be knowledgeable in the area of gender -specific women's substance use disorder modalities and treatment interventions. Programs are required to develop treatment plans that are family centered, provide for family input when clinically indicated, and address specific services and community support for the family. Additionally, program staff must ensure each woman receives continuity of care and is linked with recovery supports after dis charge. Programs are required to provide an array of clinical and supportive services such as transportation, child care, ensure that children will be referred for primary pediatric care (including immunizations) and/or psychological care as needed. Pro grams are required to provide comprehensive medical services for women including prenatal care and/or referrals and linkages to the local Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) . Other services include life skills training designed to nurture a range of skills needed for performance of everyday tasks, to attain self - sufficiency and to sustain independent living in the community. Programs are required to assist women with housing supports and assistance by linking them to transitional, permanent and/or supportive housing and to enhance the skills necessary to maintain safe and recovery -based housing. Programs are expected to collaborate and communicate with systems that provide services to pregnant and parenting women as well as referral agencies such as child welfare, maternal health, other social service providers, etc. Programs are required to implement Plans of Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 45 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 82 of 456Safe Care to address the needs of the mother, infant and family to ensure coordination of, access to, and engagement in services. Independent Peer Review of Treatment Services (Criterion 9) . DMHAS identified three treatment service providers to be reviewed for the FFY 2019 Independent Peer Review (IPR) cycle. The treatment providers selected for review constitute five percent of tho se receiving FFY 2019 SAPT Block Grant funds and are representative of the population of such entities. A letter was sent informing the agencies that they had been selected for review. The letter also clearly defined the purpose of the IPR. The stated pur pose of the IPR is to ensure continuity and quality of care delivered to individuals with substance use disorders, to improve the system of care and ensure that the IPR focus is on education and remediation rather than monitoring and enforcement. The letter indicated that participants could anticipate independent suggestions for service delivery improvement from the IPR Reviewer, and that the review would not be used by any agency for certification, licensing, compliance monitoring, funding related decisio ns, or for litigation purposes. Each IPR that was conducted and completed during FFY 2019 was based, in part, on the review of a limited number of discharged patients' records, a survey questionnaire, review of treatment process, and interviews with c linicians. In addition to the records review, the staff's treatment knowledge, skills level, and attitude were analyzed by a questionnaire survey. Agency counselors were asked to present cases for review, of clients who have recently completed the progra m. The focus of the case review was on implementation of the treatment process. During the FFY 2019 agency selection process, the focus was on standard outpatient treatment. All three reports must be completed by September 30, 2019 . Next year DMHAS' plan is to repeat the process of hiring up to three credentialed substance abuse professionals to conduct three IPRs in the North, South and Central regions of the State by September 30, 2020 ; one difference, the focus of the review will be on a different mo dality than long term and short term residential programs which is the chosen modality for the FFY 2019 IPR . Professional Development (Criterion 10) . As part its on -going responsibility to address areas of concern that affect service access, quality, and outcomes, the SSA provided several educational opportunities to enhance the competency of its addiction and behavioral healthcare workforce. Through i ts Addiction Training and Workforce Development (ATWD) initiative, the SSA has provided scholarships for initial and renewal/recertification alcohol and drug counseling courses for behavioral healthcare professionals, alcohol and drug counselors, peers, and prevention specialists in the State of New Jersey . All training initiatives also assist prospective alcohol and drug counselors with navigating the credentialing process, exam preparation, internship recruitment, and placement. To prepare clinical staff to achieve certification or licensure, and to comply with the New Jersey Board of Marriage and Family Therapy Examiners' Alcohol and Drug Counselor Committee continuing education requirements, the ATWD contract was renewed with the New Jersey Prevention N etwork. The principal goal of this initiative was to provide accessible training opportunities statewide for those entering or presently working in the addiction field. The anticipated outcome was to increase the number of credentialed and licensed employ ees who Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 46 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 83 of 456provide treatment , prevention, and peer services. The contractee offered alcohol and drug counseling coursework leading to certification and licensure at nine geographically located training sites across New Jersey. Training opportunities were ava ilable to individuals and counseling staff in outpatient, residential, and opioid substance abuse, prevention, peer staffed and behavioral healthcare treatment programs. Since its inception in 2006 -2007, the ATWD has had over 750 students become credential ed as certified alcohol and drug counselors (CADC) or Licensed Clinical Alcohol and Drug Counselors (LCADC). In addition, the ATWD contractee provided scholarships for individuals to attend Certified Prevention Specialist (CPS) courses. Participants fr om prevention agencies, county alliances, and other community agencies were eligible to attend classes. The goal of the scholarship program was to increase prevention knowledge and best practices to the field as well as to increase the number of preventio n specific professionals in New Jersey. ATWD also provided training in Motivational Interviewing, clinical supervision, trauma informed care, and cultural competency. The ATWD contractee held on -going three -day required Ethics training for 85 peer specia lists working in DMHAS Initiatives including OORP, STAR, STORI, Family Center and Recovery Center staff . The training focused on peer roles, boundaries, and ethics when working with individuals reversed with Narcan presenting in the emergency room with opi oid use disorders. In addition, 82 individuals attended the CCAR - Connecticut Community Addiction Recovery training leading to peer credentialing. To date, over 30 recovery specialists have been awarded certification , and many more are awaiting verificat ion of their applications . DMHAS held a Peer Recovery Support Summit in collaboration with the New Jersey Prevention Network, in Atlantic City, NJ, on May 19. Over 400 peer specialists attended. The Summit, \"Overcoming the Opioid Crisis: Recovery, Hope a nd Healing,\" focused on actionable and practical tools that peer recovery specialists can use in their day -to-day functions and responsibilities. Speaker s included Cynthia Moreno Tuohy, Executive Director, NAAADAC, Dr. Michael Ganon, D.O., Medication Assi stant Treatment Specialist, and David Sheff, author of Beautiful Boy. The SSA continued to build capacity among current credentialed clinical and peer professionals through its Memorandum of Agreement with The Rutgers University, Center for Alcohol Stud ies (CAS) , Education and Training Division. CAS offered highly specialized, one -day professional development seminars throughout the year as well as offering an intensive weeklong summer training program. Both the seminars and weeklong program offered tra ining education hours that can be applied towards recertification or renewal for alcohol and drug counselors and behavioral healthcare professionals working within the addiction and co -occurring treatment fields. Over 500 individuals participated in these training opportunities. How These Systems Address the Needs of Diverse Racial, Ethnic, Sexual, and Gender Minorities The population in New Jersey is diverse in its ethnic and cultural makeup, and several counties have significant minority ethnic populations. Staff providing services must be culturally competent, and education must ensure consumer access. Substance use disorder agencies are required to adhere to licensing standards that require culturally competent services. The state has Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 47 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 84 of 456not announced specific goals in regard to the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act (PPACA ), but it has been actively working to pro mote structures to support the medical home component, and these are required to be culturally competent and meet the needs of a diverse population. New Jersey's ongoing efforts to fully develop a community -based, client -centered, recovery - oriented, cont inuum of care that includes prevention, early intervention, treatment and recovery support services are based upon its ongoing needs and capacity assessment activities. These efforts incorporate standards established by state law and federal policies prom ulgated by SAMHSA. For example, the aforementioned NJ P.L. 1989, Chapter 51 stipulates that the needs of youth, drivers - under -the-influence, women, persons with disabilit ies, workers, and offenders committing crimes related to substance abuse are given sp ecial attention in all county plans . The SSA gathers data from many state administrative databases and reports to provide counties with the data necessary to describe the needs of these particular groups. All DMHAS -funded prevention service providers (coalitions as well as organizations that provide individual and family curricula) are contractually -required to adhere to the standards listed below. Adherence to these standards is monitored as a component of the annual contract site visit conducted by DMHAS. 1. Promote and support the attitudes, behaviors, knowledge, and skills that are necessary to work respectfully and effectively with clients and each other in a culturally competent work environment. 2. Have a comprehensive management strategy to address culturally and linguistically appropriate prevention services, including strategic goals, policies, procedures, and designated staff responsible for implementation. 3. Develop and implement a strategy to recruit, retain, and promote qualified, diverse and culturally competent prevention staff that are qualified to address the needs of the communities being served. 4. Require and arrange for ongoing training for prevention staff in culturally and linguistically competent service delivery. 5. Provide all clients wit h limited English proficiency (LEP) access to bilingual prevention staff or interpretation services. 6. Provide a Registries of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) Certified Interpreter for Deaf or hard of hearing participants when requested as required by the A DA. (American with Disabilities Act). 7. Provide oral and written notices, including translated signage at key points of contact, to clients in their primary language informing them of their right to receive no -cost interpreter services. 8. Translate and make a vailable signage and commonly -used written client educational material and other materials for members of the predominant language groups in service areas. 9. Use a variety of methods to collect and utilize accurate demographic, cultural, epidemiological and clinical outcome data for racial and ethnic groups in the service area, and become informed about the ethnic/cultural needs, resources, and assets of the surrounding community.

The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) within the New Jersey Department of Human Services (DHS) has a long standing commitment to culturally and response care and addressing the unique mental health needs of multicultural populations. The DMHAS defines cultural competence as: \" ... the ability to honor and respect the beliefs, languages, interpersonal styles and behaviors of individuals and families receiving services, as well as staff members who are providing such services. Cultural competence is a dynamic, ongoing developmental process that requires a long term commitment and is achieved over time\" (HHS 2003a, p. 12). The DMHAS Multicultural Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) formed in 1981. Its mission is to address issues of the quality of mental health and addiction services provided; the quantity of services provided; staffing levels, qualifications and training. Additionally, the MSAC devises strategies that are appropriate to the lifestyles, special needs and strengths of New Jersey's diverse minority and cultural groups su ch as administrative strategies, service delivery system strategies, education strategies and appropriate direct care strategies. MSAC members include representatives from the community and academic arenas as well as d ivision participants. In Fiscal Year 2012, the DMHAS committed funding and resources to enhance and improve culturally responsive and culturally competent service delivery to consumers via the development of two Regional Mental Health Cultural Competence Training Centers. These Centers provid e knowledge, training, technical assistance and serve as a resource regarding multicultural issues in mental health and addiction. More specifically, their major initiatives include: Developing and reviewing needs assessments relating to the cultural comp etency of the DMHAS system of care . Providing technical assistance to the DMHAS mental health and addictions agencies in the implementation of an agency cultural competence plan based on the information from both SAMHSA and CSAT TIP 59 . Providing accredited trainings that match the cultural and linguistic competencies, skills and needs of staff. In Fiscal Year 2018, the DMHAS committed funding and resources to develop a Multicultural Diversity and Statewide C onsultant. This individual provide d consultation, technical assistance, training and services as a statewide resource for DMHAS contracted mental health and addiction providers on issues relating to culture, language , and diversity in the DMHAS system of care. Promoting /Integrating Health and Behavioral Health Smoking Cessation. DMHAS has focused on a broad plan to reduce smoking rates in individuals with mental illness and or substance use disorders (SUDs). DMHAS contracts with the Robert Wood Johnson School of Medicine, for technical assistance from Dr. Williams, who is a natio nally recognized leader in treating tobacco dependence in individuals with mental illness and addiction. Dr. Williams and her colleagues have been working for decades in NJ to enhance tobacco treatment efforts in the behavioral health treatment setting th rough various policy, education and treatment efforts. DMHAS is also funding CHOICES, which is a consumer -driven program with the goal of increasing a wareness of the impact of tobacco use and to create a strong peer support network Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 49 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 86 of 456that encourages mental health consumers to make a positive healthy lifestyle change by addressing smoking and tobacco use. In 2017, DMHAS coordinated a State Strategy Session/Leadership Academy for Wellness and Tobacco -free Recovery , which allowed collaborative planning with th e Department of Health (DOH), the Department of Children and Families (DCF), and other state and county agencies. Some of the initiatives that increased understanding and awareness about the impact of smoking on those with mental illness and /or SUDs; in a ddition, a variety of steps were taken to address smoking, which included an increase in Medicaid coverage for smoking cessation . Several committees that were formed made recommendations on workforce training and development , evidence -based and promising practices, and integration of prevention coalit ion efforts with primary health, all of which are still under consideration. DMHAS is preparing a statewide survey for licensed agencies to determine the educational needs of their staffs and the current leve l of smoking cessation treatment that they provide . DMHAS is currently planning a second State Strategy Session/Leadership Academy for Wellness and Tobacco -free Recovery in late July 2019. This will bring together state officials, practitioners, educator s, prevention specialists, and peer recovery advocates , who will assist the state with developing an overall strategic plan to address smoking in this population. This is being done in conjunction with the Smoking Cessation Leadership Center at the Univers ity of California San Francisco, and the National Behavioral Health Network for Tobacco and Cancer Control. The plan this time is to measure service needs more precisely and to establish how the needs of the population have change since the last summit. The goal is to select a few areas to work on improving and measuring changes in the data at baseline and subsequent years. Further, DMHAS is more closely collaborating with DOH , which has a number of new projects funded by a 1% set aside from tobacco tax. This will fund 11 new quit centers, 5 prevention grants, a collect campus NJ QUITS initiative, and mini grants for colleges to create some free policies. In addition, smoking cessation services have been incorporated into various DMHAS initiatives to address the opioid epidemic. These initiatives are supported by state and federal funding (known as State Opioid Response or SOR) and are directed at providing medication assisted treatment (MAT) for substance use disorders; use of smoking cessation medicatio ns is defined as a form of MAT. In the New Jersey Substance Abuse Monitoring System (NJSAMS), which is a treatment database, smoking cessation medications will be listed as treatments. Some DMHAS initiatives that have promoted MAT in primary care and other medical settings are also including smoking cessation interventions. One of these initiatives is the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC), and this routinely provides smoking cessation as one of its required evidence - based practices. DMHAS has further plans to promote smoking cessation efforts in integrated primary care and behavioral health settings, and this is one of the goals of its July meeting to develop a stra tegic plan. Another goal is the promotion of practice guidelines that recommend asking about and assessing tobacco use at every health care visit, whether for medical of behavioral health services. Another initiative being considered is the expansion of t obacco -free campuses and smoke free policies in all behavior health care settings, especially in outpatient and residential addiction Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 50 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 87 of 456services. The latter is especially important because recent evidence suggesting that individuals who quit tobacco have imp roved outcomes in regard to their use of opioids and other illegal drugs. DMHAS Medical Director's Integration Office. The SMHA Medical Director's Office has an Integration unit with the goal of promoting integration between behavioral health agencies an d primary health care providers. This office is working closely with the state Medicaid Office (Division of Medical Assist ance and Health Services, or DM AHS) and DCF. The main goal of the initiative is to increase consumers with mental health and/or subs tance use disorders (SUDs) access to primary care and improve collaboration between behavioral health agencies and primary health care providers. Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic s. DMHA S was selecte d to be one of the eight Certifie d Communit y Behaviora l is collaboratio n betwee n the Departmen t of Huma n Services ' Divisio n of Medica l Assistanc e and Healt h Service s (DMAHS) and DMHA S and the Departmen t of Childre n and Familie s (DCF) .

Ther e are seven behaviora l healt h provider s license d to provide treatment to adults and children who have a mental illness (including serious emotional disturbance) and/or substance use disorder participatin g as CCBHCs in New Jersey . The Federal Demonstration was extended to September 13, 2019 and the state partners are currently evaluating plans for sustaining some or all of the program in the state. A recent announcement is the House voted to pass the \"Empowering Beneficiaries, Ensuring Access, and Strengthening Accountabil ity Act of 2019 (H.R. 3253),\" which would extend funding for certain Medicaid programs. Under the provision, funding for the eight -state Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) demonstration program would be extended for another two and a half years until December 21, 2021. There was overwhelming bipartisan support of H.R. 3253, passing with a vote of 371 -46. The bill must now go to the Senate for a vote before the CCBHC demonstration program expires on June 30, 2019. Since launching in 2017, CCBHCs have dramatically increased access to comprehensive, community -based mental health and addiction treatment. Members of the House on both sides of the aisle have applauded CCBHCs for being a key solution to combat the opioid epidemic by reducing pati ent wait times, expanding access to medication -assisted treatment, hiring more staff specializing in addiction treatment and much more. Office Based Addictions Treatment . The Office Based Addictions Treatment ( OBAT ) initiative, rolled out in 2019, which i s based on the \"hub and spoke\" approach. In this model, specialty SUD clinics, such as the opioid treatment programs (OTPs) serve as the 'hubs' and treated patients with more complex needs; meanwhile, the 'spokes' were small office based practices and prim ary care settings in most patients with more routine treatment needs were treated. Office -based practitioners (e.g., family physicians, psychiatrists, medical specialists, advanced practice nurses Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 51 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 88 buprenorphine and naltrexone, and th ey would have to either make referral arrangements or directly provide counselling for the patients. To assist OBAT practitioners, Medicaid has funded a new position called the navigator, whose role is to arrange social services and supports for patients and to help monitor their progress. The OBAT system of OUD services, also referred to as the MATRx, allows a two -way referral of patients with other Medicaid funded providers. Office -based providers can refer patients needing a higher level of medical an d /or addiction services to specialty providers (e.g., substance use treatment agencies, certified community behavioral health clinics, federally qualified Health Care centers, etc.) or to one of two Centers of Excellence (COEs). DMAHS contracted with Rutg ers University and Cooper/Rowan Universities to serve as COEs for the OBAT initiative. In addition to providing MAT services, these Centers are available for treatment and consultation referrals of individuals with complex needs. Because many practitione rs without extensive experience with buprenorphine need support to maintain a MAT practice, the Centers are also providing MAT training (with the goal of training 1,000 prescribers in calendar year 2019 to receive the DATA 200 waiver whereby enabling them to prescribe MAT) and will be available to provide mentors to these practitioners. Single MH/SUD License. DMHAS is working with the Department of Health licensing office to comment on regulations that act as barriers to integrating services, with the go al of streamlining the regulations and increasing integration of services. The plan is to develop a single, unified regulation that will remove current barriers and allow integrated services to operate seamlessly. System Improvements SUD Promoting Interoperability Program . Health Information Technology (HIT) and Electronic Health Record s (EHR) are critical elements in New Jersey 's strategy to address the substance use disorder (SUD) and opioid use disorder (OUD) crisis. Due to limitations in feder al statute, SUD /OUD providers have generally not been able to participate in the federal Promoting Interoperability Program or meaningful use incentive programs. To promote interoperability between behavioral health and physical health providers caring fo r SUD/OUD individuals, the State of New Jersey is making available a total of $5.3 million in funding for a milestone -based SUD provider incentive program. Implementing EHR technology allows behavioral health providers to efficiently capture and store dat a in structured format that, with the proper privacy and security processes in place, can be easily retrieved, shared and transmitted to assist in patient care, monitoring and recovery. Amongst a host of benefits, the behavioral health provider adopting an EHR will have the ability to: (1) gather , analyze and report clinical and operational data ; (2) prepare for and demonstrate interoperability to a Health Information Exchange (HIE) and associated use cases; (3) generate electronic prescription and connect to a Prescription Drug Monitoring Database (PDMP) and (4) collect and transmit information to the NJ Substance Abuse Monitoring System (NJSAMS). In order to make meaningful progress in connecting residents of N ew Jersey being treated for SUD/OUD , clinica l information needs to be portable between SUD clinics, hospitals, and other providers. This will allow all types of providers caring for patients to be armed with the latest Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 52 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 89 of 456clinical information on a patient, enhancing care quality and appropriateness at all sites and avoiding inappropriate or duplication of care. All of this requires meaningful investment in the IT infrastructure of SUD clinics, which Governor Murphy intends to provide with these funds. This will not only serve the purpose of moderniz ing systems; it is intended, specifically, to connect siloed systems of care to each other, to enhance care coordination and quality. In addition, these investments present an opportunity to allow for EHRs in SUD clinics to better align with workflow barr iers and needs at the point of care. This program is administered by the New Jersey Department of Health (DOH) in collaboration with the New Jersey Department of Human Services ( DHS ), Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (DMAHS) and the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS), collectively referred to \"the State\". Funding will be made available to participating SUD provider entities on a first -come, first -serve basis through New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJ IT) and its New Jersey Innovation Institute (NJII), formerly NJ -HITEC, the designated state entity that manages the New Jersey Health Information Network (NJHIN). The SUD provider must meet the following criteria to be eligible to participate in the progr am: 1.1.1 A non -profit or for -profit entity or governmental entity. 1.1.2 A Medicaid provider and have adjudicated claims from Medicaid. 1.1.3 Licensed by the Department of Health's Office of Licensing (OOL) to provide SUD treatment prior to the start of services . 1.1.4 Receivi ng funding from DMHAS to provide SUD treatment services either through cost-based contract or fee -for-service . 1.1.5 Have at least 50 SUD admissions during CY 2018 which is documented in NJSAMS . The program anticipates that there will be two categories or tiers of SUD providers that will be able to participate. 1.1.6 Tier 1 providers are SUD providers who currently do not have an EHR and will be implementing a new EHR. 1.1.7 Tier 2 providers are SUD providers who currently have an EHR but will be upgrading to an Office of the National Coordinator for HIT (ONC) Certified EHR Technology (CEHRT) . Incentive payments are disbursed by NJII to participating providers after the achievement of milestones as defined below. The State reserves the right to revise the milestone defini tions based on current or future system capabilities and/or overall program milestone achievement progress. Designated personnel from the State will review all supporting document and approve incentive payments. The State will have an option to implement an attestation application to allow participating SUD providers to register and submit attestation information. All milestones are expected to be achieved over a two -year funding period. 1.1.8 Milestone 1 - Participation Agreement / EHR Vendor Contract Agreement 1.1.9 Milestone 2 - EHR Go -live / Upgrade Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 53 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 90 of 4561.1.10 NJHIN/HIE Connectivity 1.1.11 Milestone 4 - PMP Connectivity 1.1.12 Milestone 5 - NJSAMS Connectivity (optional, if supported by EHR vendor) If all five milestones are achieved, the total amount of incentive payment a Tier 1 participating SUD provider may potentially receive is $42,500, while a Tier 2 participating SUD provider may potentially receive is $30,000. As of June 21, 2019, 22 SUD providers have signed a participation agreement. The goal is to have 120 providers participate. The New Jersey Association of Mental Health and Addiction Agencies (NJAMHAA) is providing technical assistance and developing learning collaboratives. Pay for Performance. Incentivizing provider performance or paying for performance (P4P) is an approach being explored to achieve better health and or behavioral health outcomes for clients. However, the literature suggests that few organizations use P4P to improv e clinical outcomes directly. As a result of the NJ Governor's Initiatives announced on September 18, 2017, DMHAS will incorporate this model into the Prison Intensive Recovery Treatment Support (PIRTS). The system is the Performance Incentive Payment Syst em (PIPS). It is a new innovative model to incentivize provider performance with the goal of improved outcomes. These incentives are designed to pay for the attainment of meaningful outcomes that will help the client achieve success as they move into reco very from substance use disorder. Performance -based incentives will be paid as follows: Retention . If client remains in treatment for 90 days, payment will be $200. Relapse Prevention . If client remains in the community for 5 months after completion of an episode of care, payment will be $300. Recidivism. If client remains in the community for 6 months after release from prison, payment will be $300. Overdose Prevention . If client do es not experience an overdose for 6 months after admission to the PIRTS Program, payment will be $500. Stable Housing . If a client is placed by PIRTS and remains in housing for 6 months payment will be $300. Employment. If a client is placed by PIRTS in employment and remains for 6 months, payment will be $300. Eligible Offenders being released from DOC custody who are receiving FDA approved medication assisted treatment for an OUD and who will continue to receive medication assisted treatment after their release from prison, and those Eligible Offenders, with an OUD, being released from custody who choose not to receive medication assisted treatment while incarcerated will be participants in the PIRTS program. The overall goal of PIRTS is to help in dividuals with an OUD who are being released from prison access the Recovery Zone. Within the \"recovery zone\" the client acquires valuable relapse prevention skills from various means, according to what works best, to sustain recovery. Experiences are tran slated into valuable lessons and integrated into recovery plans that most closely reflect the client's needs, preferences and values. The outcome of sustained recovery is saving lives, families, communities and dollars.

A novel feature of this program is that the provider will begin working with offenders six months prior to release. Financing Strategies . The SSA has explor ed financing strategies involving payment for an episode of care. Since the SSA has a fee -for-service billing system for many of its treatment initiatives, it has the data available to conduct this analysis. Costs by episode for the different initiatives b y the level of care initially entered are analyzed to support fiscal planning. The analysis has indicated the episode costs vary widely across initiatives even though they start at the same level of care. These data have helped inform the SSA in developi ng benefit management strategies for high cost services such as residential with the goal of ensuring that individuals get the right service at the right time in the right amount (as per SAMHSA's recommendation). Maximizing the appropriate use of services in the most cost-effective manner, allows the SSA to provide more services to clients in need and helps reduce the treatment gap between met and unmet demand. Quality Reporting . The purpose of the Certified Comm unity Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) is to provide ready access and an expansive scope of services to clients who present with behavioral health concerns and most often present with needs in multiple life domains. The CCBHCs offer services within an int egrative, holistic framework, thereby closing a treatment gap that frequently results in inadequate service provision for individuals with co -existing social, physical and behavioral health care needs. New Jersey selected seven CCBHCs in six counties, inc luding six CCBHCs in five metropolitan counties plus one provider in a rural pocket of Atlantic County. The CCBHCs include: Care Plus in Bergen County; Northwest Essex in Essex County; Catholic Charities and Oaks Integrated Care in Mercer County; Rutgers UBHC in Middlesex County; CPC Behavioral in Monmouth County; and AtlantiCare in Atlantic County. New Jersey's CCBHCs are expected to: decrease the time from patient's initial outreach to f irst appointment, increase access to a wide scope of mental health services, meet treatment gaps for individuals with substance use disorders, expand the use of mental health and substance use peer supports, and increase use of evidence -based practices suc h as Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT). New Jersey's CCBHCs offer 24 -hour crisis care, treatment for co -occurring substance use disorder and mental illness, ambulatory and medical withdrawal management, evidence -based outpatient counseling, case managem ent, and family support services. SAMHSA identified 22 standardized variables based on the above domains of service that will be used to measure the aggregated impact of the CCBHCs, including six measures that may qualify for a quality bonus payment. If a CCBHC reports all six quality bonus payment measures, it will receive a QBP for meeting or exceeding national standards established by the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS). Nine of the measures are clinic level which means they are reported by the individual CCBHC clinics. Listed below, they include time to evaluation along with eight preventive care and screening measures for adults and children.

Overview of the State's Behavioral Health Prevention, Early Identification, Treatment, and Recovery Support Systems Department of Human Services New Jersey manages the public behavioral health system separately for adult and children services. The adult behavioral health system falls within the Department of Human Services (DHS) Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) while the children's system is within the Department of Children and Families (DCF) Children's System of Care (CSOC). Although both the DMHAS and the CSOC operate in two different departments, both Divisions work collaboratively to serve adults with serious mental illnes s (SMI) and children with serious emotional disturbance (SED). The DHS serves more than 2.1 million of New Jersey's most vulnerable citizens, or about one of every five New Jersey residents DHS serves individuals and families with low income, people with mental illnesses and/or substance use disorders; developmental disabilities ; late-onset disabilities ; the blind and/or visually impaired ; deaf or hard of hearing ; and older adults . In addition, the Department serves parents needing child care services, child support and/or healthcare for their children, as well as families facing catastrophic medical expenses for their children. DHS has the following Divisions: Commission for the Blind and Visually Impaired; Division of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing; Divis ion of Developmental Disabilities; Division of Disability Services; Division of Family Development, Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services; Division of Aging Services; and DMHAS. DHS also provides many support systems for the families of childr en served by DCF. In 2011, DHS merged its Division of Mental Health Services and the Division of Addiction Services into DMHAS. The merger provided an opportunity to integrate adult mental health, substance abuse and co -occurring disorders treatment at all levels of service in an efficient and coordinated manner from the statewide and regional level to the local levels, thus enhancing access and coordination of services, alignment of policies and contracts, and workforce development efforts. Between 2017- 2018, DMHAS went through two major reorganization processes. On June 29, 2017, Governor Christie filed an executive reorganization plan with the State Legislature transferring the institutions and programs currently under DMHAS and its staff that support the provision of mental health and addiction services from the Department of Human Services to the Department of Health (DOH). The plan stated that \"transferring the provision of mental health and addiction services to DOH is necessary to improve health c are, remove bureaucratic obstacles to the integration of physical and behavioral health care and effectively address substance abuse disorder as the public health crisis it is.\" On August 28, 2017, DMHAS be came part of DOH. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 57 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 94 of 4562 On June 21, 2018, Governor Mu rphy announced plans to return the DMHAS back to the Department of Human Services, reversing a decision made by Governor Christie in 2017. By restoring DMHAS at the Department of Human Services where Medicaid and social services are housed, Governor Murphy 's plan would ensure that mental health programs and s ubstance use disorder s ervices are delivered to New Jersey residents in the most effective and efficient manner possible. The four state psychiatric hospitals would remain in DOH. DOH would create an integrated licensing system for mental health, substance abuse and primary care and continue to improve the quali ty of care in the state psychiatric hospitals. Governor Murphy's plan took effect on August 20, 2018. Mental Health Services DMHAS is the sta te mental health authority (SMHA) that oversees the state's public system of adult mental health services. The SMHA works closely with three regionally -based, adult psychiatric hospitals, and one adult forensic hospital . The SMHA contracts with 1 17 not-for- profit community provider agencies . In addition, the SMHA provides 85% of the cost for individuals with a designated county of residence who are uninsured and a 100% of the cost for individuals who do not have a county of residence and are uninsured for the four county - operated psychiatric facilities ( New Bridge Medical Center, Essex County Hospital Center, Meadowview Hospital, and Cornestone Behav ioral Health Hospital of Union County ) . The state psychiatric hospitals, county hospitals, and community provider agencies all function as part of the continuum of mental health services in New Jersey . New Jersey's 21 counties are organized into three mental health service regi ons; North, Central, and South. Each county has a Mental Health Board that is staffed by a Mental Health Administrator. The Boards advise the SMHA and the New Jersey Behavioral Health Planning Council (BHPC) of issues and programs that are of significance to their locale and residents. In each county, a System's Review Committee (SRC) is c onvened monthly in accordance with state regulation ( NJAC10:31- 5.3(a)) . The SRC is comprised of representatives from the acute care community and include staff from: state and county hospitals, short -term care facilities (inpatient units serving individual s on commitment status), voluntary psychiatric inpatient units, the county Mental Health Board, community provider representation (including the county's Program for Assertive Community Treatment and county's Integrated Case Management program) , family and consumer organizations , and the SMHA. The SRC is charged with the collection and review of service data as well as monitoring the provision of acute care services statewide. In addition, each county has at least one Designated Screening Center with mobile outreach and 24- hour access. The county -based Designated Screening Centers generally determine who meets the commitment standard and requires inpatient treatment. The community mental health system of services provides for four levels of care in each co unty: (1) prevention and early intervention; (2) acute care programs and crisis stabilization; ( 3) intermediate care and rehabilitation; and ( 4) extended/ongoing support programs. The SMHA contracts for statewide, regional and county/local behavioral healt h services. Statewide Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 58 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 95 of 4563 contracted services include services for specialty populations such as: Statewide Clinical Consultation and Training (SCCAT ) program which provides consultation and training to our hospital and community provider s regarding individual s dually diagnosed with a mental illness and developmental disability; Statewide Clinical Outreach Program for the Elderly (S -COPE) which provides consultation and training to nursing facilities and DMHAS residential providers who serve older adults (55 ye ars of age and older) who are at risk of psychiatric hospitalization; and ACCESS which provides consultation, residential, outpatient and case management services to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing and diagnosed with a mental illness. Additiona l statewide contract services include contracts to provide training and technical assistance to specialized segments of the provider workforce and statewide depositories of behavioral health resource information and self -help information. The SMHA contract s for regional services including: Behavioral Health Cultural Competence Training Centers to provide training and information to providers regarding cultural competence, co- occurring services for individuals with a mental illness and substance use disorder and housing with enhanced supports for individuals with co -occuring medical needs , development disorders, substance use disorders, or criminal justice involvement. According to its 2018 URS Data Table 3, & 14a, the SMHA served 341,774 unduplicated adult (age 18 + years ) consumers SFY 2018. Of the total number of unduplicated adult consumers served in SFY 2018, 322,240 (94.3% ) were served in community settings \u2014including county hospitals and Short Term Care Facilities ( STCFs ); 2,952 (0.86%) were served in St ate Psychiatric Hospitals, and 16,582 (4.85%) were served in other psychiatric inpatient settings. Of the total number of unduplicated adults ( 341,774) served in all settings by the SMHA in SFY 2018, 132,561 ( 38.8%) were reported to have SMI. Persons who are SMI are the primary target population for SMHA funded services. However, the SMHA also provides specialized services to other high risk target populations including persons with special access needs, older adults, ethnic and linguistic minorities, and individuals with co- occurring mental health and substance use disorders, hearing impairment, co -occurring developmental disabilit y, and criminal justice involvement. Many of the activities of the SMHA focus on inter -organizational coordination and collabor ation to improve access for special needs populations. This is achieved through interface with the various Divisions within the DHS including the Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) , Division of Aging Services, Division of Deaf and Hard of Hearing , Division of Family Development (Welfare), and Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (Medicaid). In addition, there is coordination with the DCF 's Division of Child Protection and Permanency ( DCP&P ), Department of Health, Department of Commun ity Affairs (housing/homeless) and the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Financing Agency (NJMHFA). There is also coordination with the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation Services (DVRS) within the Department of Labor and Workforce Development , and with t he Department of Corrections. The Five Criteria in State Mental Health Plan Section 1912(b) of the Public Health Act (42 USC \u00a7 300x -2) establishes five criteria that must be addressed in state mental health plans. States must describe these in the planni ng steps. The criteria are defined below: Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 59 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 96 of 4564 Criterion 1: Comprehensive Community -Based Mental Health Service Systems: Provides for the establishment and implementation of an organized community -based system of care for individuals with mental illness, including those with co -occurring M/SUD. States must have available services and resources within a comprehensive system of care, provided with federal, state, and other public and private resources, in order to enable such individuals to function outside of in patient or residential institutions to the maximum extent of their capabilities. SMHA funds four levels of service along the mental health continuum of care with Community Mental Health Block Grant, and other federal or state funds. They are: Prevention a nd Early Intervention Services, Acute Care Services, Intermediate and Rehabilitative Services, and Recovery Support including Consumer Operated Services . In addition, the SMHA operates four State Psychiatric Hospitals and funds four County Psychiatric Hospitals. The SMHA also engages in Olmstead Initiatives . 1. Prevention and Early Intervention Services . First Episode Psychosis The SMHA has utilized the C MHBG 10% set -aside funds for providing service s to individuals with first episo de psychosis (FEP) in FY 2017. A Request For Proposal was issued in June 2016 for three agencies to provide Coordinated Speciality Care (CSC) services for individuals with FEP. Three agencies: Oaks Integrated Care, Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care (UBHC) , and Careplus Inc NJ , were selected t o receive the funding and the first CSC team became operational on November 1, 2016. The remaining two teams became operational within the following two months. NJ teams implemented the National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) Reco very after an Initial Schiz ophrenia Episode (RAISE) model, which is detailed in the Coordinated Specialty Care for First Episode Psychosis Manuals I: Outreach and Recruitment, and II: Implementation. The New Jersey's CSC programs emphasize a team approach with the following components: outreach, low -dosage medications, cognitive and behavioral skills training, I ndividual ized Placement and Support, supported employment and supported education, case management, and family psycho -education. Each CSC team is comprised of six team members of mostly masters' level trained clinicians. They include a team leader, a recovery coach, a supported employment and education specialist, a pharmacotherapist, an outreach and referral specialist; and a peer support specialis t. All clinicians are trained to treat clients using Evidence Based Practice methods. Evidence Based Practice methods used to treat clients are recommended by the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) Manuals and include: Individual Plac ement and Support Person -Centered Therapy Motivational Interviewing Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) Cognitive remediation Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 60 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 97 of 4565 Peer wellness coaching Trauma- informed care Individual Resiliency Training (IRT) Psychoeduaction Supported Education & Employme nt New Jersey's CSC services are provided for youth and adults ages 15 to 35 years who have experienced psychotic symptoms for less than 2 years with or without treatment. New Jersey CSC programs cover 21 counties using extensive outreach efforts. As of M ay 21, 2019, the three CSC programs ha d over 520 referrals and have treated 266 clients in their programs. New Jersey plans to continue utilizing the 10% set -aside funding in the FY 2020- 21 to support these three CSC teams in providing evidence -based ser vices for individual with FEP. With increased demand for FEP services ,the CSC program s expanded from serving 35 clients to 70 clients per agency and increased clinical staff from 5.2 FTE to 6.8 FTE levels in FY 2019. Beside funding the three CSC teams, the SMHA ha s utilized the 10% set -aside fund to support the hiring of an evaluation specialist, who assists in the development of evaluation tools and data collection instruments . In addition, the evaluation specialist is responsbible for contacting the agencies t o ensure that these agencies su bmit the required data elements on a regular basis. The agencies have been required to submit Quarterly Contract Monitoring Report ( QCMR ) data and fiscal spending data to the SMHA at the end of each quarter. The data evaluation specialist is also developing a client level CSC database. This database will include client demographic information ; admission and discharge data ; and clinical and functioning measures of all clients who participated in the CSC programs. The goal of the data collection is to monitor the progress of all clients, to evaluate the CSC programs, and also to address all federal data evaluation and reporting requirements . The New Jersey CSC programs have implemented and collected data from t he Mental Il lness Research, Education and Clinical Centers Global Assessment Functioning scale (MIRECC GAF) and the Colombia Suicide S everity Index to get an understanding of clients' diagnostic symptoms during tre atment in the CSC program . MIRECC GAF is the primary a ssessment tool used to determine symptom progress in the CSC client base. Scores are collected on a quarterly basis and compared against previous quarter scores from agency to agency. The Colombia Suicide S everity Index is used at intake, after each hospit alization, and on a discretionary basis to asses s client suicid ility. These measures have also been used by other RAISE programs outside New Jersey and proven to be sound measures for symptom severity among the FEP population. Since inception in 2017, CSC program s have effectively improved the quality of care for the FEP population in New Jersey. Among the 266 clients served during the past two years , psychiatric hospitalization re -admission rates were reduced from 41.7% to 18% . The psychotropic medication adherence rate was 81.3% compared to a rate of approximately 50% in other ESMI populations that did not receiv e evidence -based psychotherapies . Since its inception CSC has provided a stable system for FEP individuals to interact in the community thr ough g aining employment, continuing education and has improvement global functioning for those who remain in care for a consistent period . In FY2018, 81.9% of clients who were in a CSC program for 3 months or longer have shown improved functionality .

The 18- month initiative provi des technical assistance, which is administered in the form of monthly calls with CLASP and other participating states; site visits with CLASP; and a conference with other states on promising practices toward serving populations with maternal depression. New Jersey's efforts under this initiative come from a collaborative which is co -lead by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DHS -DMHAS) and the Department of Health (DOH), and includes the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (DHS - Medicaid) , the Department of Children and Families (DCF), and three maternal health consortia consisting of the Partnership for Maternal Child Health, Central Jersey Family Health Consortia, and South Jersey Perinatal Cooperative. The collaborative, known as the MOMD Core Team, has, as its focus , three individual goals for improving its ability to serve mothers with maternal depression. Each of these goals is the focus of its own subcommittee of core team members, which meets monthly to discuss progre ss, share insights, and discuss any questions or concerns arising from their efforts. The core team subsequently reports on these meetings to CLASP on monthly calls and receives feedback and consultation where necessar y. The three goals comprising New Jers ey's MOMD initiative consist of : 1) Enhanced Data Capacity related to examination of maternal depression in New Jersey ; 2) Increased Access to Services related to maternal depression ; and 3) Reduced Racial, Ethnic, and Socioeconomic Disparities in utilizat ion of maternal depression services . National Academy for State Health Policy Maternal and Child Health Policy Innovations Program Policy Academy As a result of a collaborative application between DHS -Medicaid and DMHAS, New Jersey was selected for parti cipation in a policy academy through the Maternal and Child Health Policy Innovation Program (MCH PIP), funded by the federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration (MCHB, HRSA). Through this program, the National Ac ademy for State Health Policy (NASHP) will work with states and other state stakeholders, to support and advance innovative state -level policy initiatives that improve access to quality health care for the maternal child health population. As part of MCH P IP, NASHP is conducting a two- year policy academy for up to eight state teams comprised of representatives from state Medicaid agencies, public health agencies, mental health/substance use agencies, and other state stakeholders (e.g., child welfare agencies, provider groups, Medicaid managed care plans, etc.). Participating state teams will identify, promote, and advance innovative state -level policy initiatives in order improve access to care for Medicaid -eligible pregnant and parenting women with or at risk of substance use disorder (SUD) and/or mental health conditions through health care delivery system transformation. The Policy Academy will emphasize policy strategies that promote integration of care and systems; align with state initiatives to trans form how care is provided and paid for (e.g., Medicaid managed care, accountable care organizations (ACOs), Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 62 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 99 of 4567 value -based payment, etc.); and ultimately, improve health outcomes for pregnant and parenting women. NJ PROMISE Program for Serving Youth and Young Adults at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR -P) In Fiscal Year 2019, the Childr en's System of Care (CSOC) was a recipient of a SAMHSA grant for establishing community programs for outreach and intervention with youth and young adults at clinical hig h risk for psychosis (CHR -P). DMHAS and CSOC co -lead the project . The project title is NJ PROMISE - Prevention, Resilence, Optimism, Mastery, Insight, Support, and Education. In order to most effectively administer the grant activities , DMHAS and CSOC established a M emorandom of Agreement (MOA) that carves out the details of the responsibilities. The NJ PROMISE program serve s youths and young adults not more than 25 years of age who experienc e the prodromal symptoms of psychosis. This program provide s evide nce-based interventions to prevent and/or delay the onset of psychosis. NJ PROMISE services are provided through effective outreach, client therapy, and linkages to community supports. DMHAS staff also play the role of the lead evaluator who is responsible for data collection and program evaluation. DMHAS NJ PROMISE program responsibilities include : provider services in accordance with the MOA; program staffing; in -kind contributions; quarterly reports from the providers; client level and aggregate data collection ; and program evaluation. Oaks Integrated Care, Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care (UBHC), and Careplus Inc NJ serve as CHR -P service providers . Each team at minimum consist s of a prescriber, an outreach coordinator, and a therapist. Each s ervice provider will serve up to 25 clients in Fiscal Year 2019 and 50 clients in each successive fiscal year s. This program will focus on community outreach in a prevention- based approach to care in accordance with the \"stepped -care\" therapy model where clients start with having one evidence- based practice therapy . The EBP service modalities will gradually increase if a client 's psychotic symptoms increase. DMHAS data requirements include : QCMR, the adult and children's National Outcome Indicators (NOMs), and client level data. NOM s will be collected at intake and every six months until client discharge to evaluate client well -being during treatment . All other data elements will be collected on a quarterly basis. All data will be submitted by the Childrens' System of Care (CSOC) to SAMHSA through SPARS system for program evaluation. Behavioral Health Prevention Efforts of the New Jersey Governor's Council on Mental Health Stigma In November of 2004, then Acting Governor Richard J. Codey signed the Executi ve Order that created the Governor's Task Force on Mental Health. One of the recommendations of the Task Force, as per Executive Order #58, was the establishment of a Governor's Council on Mental Health Stigma. The mission of the Governor's Council on Ment al Health Stigma is to combat mental health stigma as a top priority in New Jersey's effort to create a better mental health system. Through outreach and education, the Council delivers a message that mental health stigma must no longer be tolerated. The D MHAS is represented on the Council via a liaison who is the DMHAS Family Coordinator. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 63 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 100 of 4568 Each year the Council presents Ambassador Awards to those who champion the mission to raise mental health awareness and combat stigma, educate the public about mental il lness and engage communities in the process of embracing mental health. The Ambassador Awards promote respect, understanding and change . Due to the restructuring of the Governor's Council which is still in progress, the Ambassador Awards, did not occur in 2019. However, in the coming months, the Council will reconvene with renewed energy and enthusiasm and plan for their initiatives in Fiscal Year 2020. The Council posts training videos related to stigma awareness and messages of hope and recovery on its w ebsite . The council conducts outreach to schools, the media and other organizations. The Council recognizes the importance of cultural competency in all of its efforts and inclusion of all groups in prevention efforts. Community partnerships focus on colla boration with all groups to insure to ensure that input, information and guidance in regard to messaging, content and approach are accurate and culturally competent. Suicide Prevention Compared with the rest of the United States, New Jersey has low rate s of deaths by suicide, consistently varying between lowest and second lowest in the nation (CDC, WISQARS) . However, suicide rates in NJ are following national trends and have steadily risen over the years. The age adjusted rate for 2017 was 8.36 per 100,0 00 (compared to 14.0 nationally). There were 809 deaths by suicide in New Jersey in 2017, making suicide the 2nd leading cause of death among those aged 10- 14, 3rd leading cause of death for ages 15- 24 and the 4th leading cause of death for ages 2 5-34, 35- 44 and 45- 54. The highest increase was seen in age group 45 to 54 years. For every NJ resident who dies by suicide, there are approximately 5.5 inpatient hospitalizations and emergency room treatments for suicide attempts with the cost of care totaling over $194 million in 201 7, not to mention the great emotional toll on suicide attempt survivors, their families, friends and co- workers. In 2017 there were 2,392 individuals in need of inpatient hospitalization as a result of suicide attempts and 2 ,382 visit ing the Emergency Department. The SMHA continues to fund the NJ Suicide Prevention Hopeline, operated by Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care, which is set up to accept calls 24/7 from individuals who are seeking information or assistance for themse lves, friends or relatives that may be at risk of suicide. Calls are received from anyone of any age and are answered by a peer, a trained volunteer, or a clinical staff member. If a caller is assessed as being at serious risk of suicide, the caller can be \"warm -transferred\" to the appropriate local Psychiatric Emergency Service or other entity (i.e. DCF sponsored 2nd Floor Youth Crisis Line) that can provide emergency or other necessary services for that individual. In calendar year 201 7 the Hopeline recei ved a total of 26,619 incoming calls. This is an average of 2,218 calls per month. In the year 2018, the Hopeline received a total of 47,254 inbound calls, with a monthly average number of 3938. Due to this enormous increase in call volume, DMHAS added funding for an additional 0.5 FTE position. The NJ Hopeline is an approved National Suicide Prevention Lifeline Crisis Center and provides back up to the Lifeline Crisis Center call system in NJ. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 64 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 101 of 4569 To publicize this valuable, local helpline the SMHA created an d distributed posters for display at many gatherings and conferences to providers, agencies and other public places. Given the diverse population of NJ, the SMHA is in the process of making Hopeline brochures and posters available in Spanish. In addition to the Suicide Prevention Hope line, NJ has several other helplines available for individuals in need: - Veterans and their families can call a crisis helpline at : 1-866-838-7654 1-866-VETS -NJ 4 U - Anonymous and confidential resource for youth 2nd Floor Youth Helpline : 1-888-222-2228 - Peer Recovery Warm Line: 1 -877-292-5588 - NJ Mental Health Cares : 1-866-202-HELP (4357) - Crisis Text Line : Text - line program: 1- 877-914-Mom2 or 1- 877-914-6662 (Peer support for Mothers of Special Needs Children and Adults) In conjunction with the Department of Health that oversees the State Psychiatric hospitals, SMHA developed an administrative bulletin on Screening, Assessment, Management, and Treatment of Suicidal and N on-Suicidal Self -Directed Violence . This policy mandates the use of evidence -based screening and assessment tools , as well as the development of a Safety Plan for patients identified as moderate and/or high risk, complemented by active suicide -specific treatment initiatives . SMHA in coordination with Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care, provided training on evidence -based suicide screening and assessment tools to Screening Centers as one component of the involuntary commitment process. In fiscal year 2018 and 2019 the DHS/DOH Suicide Prevention Committee as well as the NJ Adult Suicide Prevention Advisory Council continued their work of information sharing, collaboration and advising to the governing authority based on identified practice gaps as per survey results. The focus shifted to i ncreasing Community Collaboration and Integration and will be pursued on a regular basis. The membership of the Committee consists mostly of DHS and DOH employees, whereas the Council has a broader membership that incl udes State Agencies, Professional Organizations, Universities, Support and Advocacy Groups, Consumer Organizations/Agencies and Persons with Lived Experiences. DMHAS also has representation on national suicide prevention initiatives, such as the Community of Practice and the State Coordination Affinity Group. Community Behavioral Health Programs contracted by the Department of Human Services and/or licensed by the Department of Health are required to report Unusual Incidents regarding individuals they serve . State Psychiatric Hospitals are also required to report Unusual Incident Reporting Management System ( UIRMS ) data regarding individuals they serve. According to the UIRMS data that DMHAS received, there were 324 suicide attempts and 48 deaths by suicide reported in Fiscal Year 2018. DMHAS requires providers to intensely analyze each of these Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 65 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 102 of 45610 events to assess opportunities for improvement in their systems and processes. All reports of the providers are reviewed by the DMHAS Mortality Review Committee for p atterns and trends among agencies. Many of DMHAS consumers, who have died by suicide , did not have an evidence -based suicide risk screening or assessment completed, consumers were often not appropriately linked to treatment , and oftentimes clear risk facto rs were overlooked. Members of the Mortality Review Committee review the reports they receive from agencies, make recommendations for improvement, and follow -up on actions taken, if indicated. DMHAS also continues to receive and a nalyze data from the NJ Vi olent Death Reporting System (VDRS) -New Jersey's detailed and timely surveillance system of all violent fatalities \u2014as well as existing NJ data from other systems that capture non -fatal suicide attempts of individuals who received treatment through emergenc y room visits and inpatient hospitalizations. For 2017 and 2018, the SMHA had requested and received Proclamations from the Governor's Office declaring Suicide Prevention Month and/or a Suicide Prevention Week in September for Suicide Prevention efforts. In order to emphasize coordination and collaboration among the Youth and Adult Suicide Prevention Systems in New Jersey we organized joint Suicide Prevention Conferences . More than 650 people registered for the 2018 Conference, with close to 500 attending. Attendees included people with lived experience, consumers, medical professionals, social workers and community social service providers, educators, community health providers, hospital -based providers, community agencies, administrators, state representatives, and executive leadership. Of those who attended, over 90% of the 230 post -conference survey respondents rated the conference as good to excellent in each of the survey categories. There has been a steady increase of attendance of these annual conf erences over the last four years . DMHAS submitted a proposal for implementing a state -wide Zero Suicide Model in NJ, following other early adopter states like Wisconsin, Colorado, Texas, Ohio and New York. Funding for this project is included in the 2020 budget and DMHAS already hired a person within the Medical Director's Office who will be tasked with spear -heading the implementation of the state -wide Zero Suicide approach in NJ over the next two years. Such an important initiative for NJ is based in th e belief that suicide deaths for individuals under care within health care systems are preventable. The Zero Suicide Institute under the Education Development Center (EDC) is recognized as the leading proponent and training entity of this model with the main component being the 2- day Academy. Each Academy trains and consults of up to 80 participants comprised of 16 teams of 4 people. Using the Zero Suicide Framework, participants of the health care system learn how to incorporate best and promising practice s into their organizations and processes to improve care and safety for individuals at risk under their care. 2. Acute Care Services . The SMHA funds and regulates a variety of acute mental health care programs for individuals with acute mental health needs and for those experiencing psychiatric crises. They include Designated Screening Centers (DSC), Affiliated Emergency Services (AES), Early Intervention Support Services (EISS), Involuntary Outpatient Commitment (IOC), Intensive Outpatient Treatment and Support Services (IOTSS), and Projects for Assistance in Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 66 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 103 of 45611 Transition from Homelessness (outreach to persons who are homeless) and Short Term Care Facility (STCF) beds. Short Term Care Facilities (STCFs). In order to meet the needs of individuals who require involuntary in- patient psychiatric services, the SMHA currently designates 4 20 Short Term Care Facility ( STCF ) beds. The SMHA has allocated $2 4.6 million in subsidies for STCF beds , half of the cost is paid by the state and the remaining 50% is paid by Medicaid. There are currently 420 STCF beds which are currently online in New Jersey in 24 general community hospitals . These beds serve all 21 New Jersey counties. Most of these agencies are community hospital based and the STCF beds permit the state's r esidents to access a hospital based level of psychiatric care at the local community level. For SFY years 2017 and 2018, the state's System Review Committee database indicates that occupancy rate for STCF beds was 87.3 % and 88.2 % respectively. Diversionary Beds. The DMHAS contracts with inpatient providers to purchase bed -days in inpatient facilities, known as \"Diversion\" contracts. The purpose of the Diversion contracts is to afford individuals age 18 and older who would otherwise be admitted to a state or county psychiatric hospital the opportunity to receive treatment in an inpatient setting, which may enable the individual to stabilize and be discharged to the community. The primary goal of the purchase of bed -days is to reduce admissions to state hos pitals. Individuals who do not stabilize and require continued inpatient treatment may be transferred to a state or county hospital at the conclusion of their approved length of stay in the contracted Diversion bed. The hospitals that contract for Diversio n beds maintain additional bed capacity that is not governed by their DMHAS Diversion contract, and serve a similar population in this additional capacity. DMHAS currently contracts for access to 196 beds at three private psychiatric facilities -- Carrie r, Hampton, and Northbrook that offer an alternative to state psychiatric hospitalization. Most contracts specify a cost per bed -day of $625 . However , a set of the contracted bed -days are reimbursed at a rate of $610. In SFY 2018, the total admissions were 2,154. The total number of bed-days were 48,267. The y provided 1,885 diversions from the state hospitals. The actual spending in SFY 2018 was $25,110,210. Designated Screening Centers (DSC). In FY1 8, the SMHA continued funding 23 Designated Screening Service (Screening and Screening Outreach) programs across the 21 Counties at a total cost to DMHAS of $ 52.1 million. The Screening and Screening Outreach Program is designed to provide psychiatric emergency services including screening, assessment, crisis intervention, referral, linkage, and crisis stabilization services, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, in every geographic area in the state. According to the SMHA's Quarterly Contract Monitoring Report (QCMR) database of information self -reported by the screening programs, there were 91,542 episodes of care to these screening centers during SFY 2018. Beginning in SFY16, the State received approval for a Medicaid State Plan Amendment that allowed for Psychiatric Emergency Rehabilitation Services. Accordi ngly, hospital providers bill the Medicaid program at established rates and generate Medicaid revenue to partially offset operating costs. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 67 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 104 Services ( AES) . The SMHA also provides annualized funding to 12 Affiliated Emergency Service (A ES) programs, which provide for behavioral health staffing at high volume emergency departments. A mental health provider is responsible for the provision of emergency services to individuals in crisis presenting in hospital emergency departments . Emergenc y service includes mental health and social services provision or procurement and advocacy. Emergency services offer immediate crisis intervention services and service procurement to relieve the client's distress and to help maintain or recover his or her level of functioning. Emphasis is on stabilization, so that the client can actively participate in needs assessment and service planning. Emergency service is affiliated by written agreement with the geographic area Designated Screening Center. (N.J.A.C.10:31) . During SFY 2018, the state's 12 Affiliated Emergency Service Programs delivered 28,954 episodes of crisis care (3 Hudson, 1 Middlesex, 3 Monmouth, 2 Morris, 1 Passaic and 2 Union Counties) and received $3.92 milliion in funding . Early Intervention S upport Service s (EISS). In 2008, the SMHA began investing $3.0 million annually in Early Intervention Support Service s (EISS) programs in Morris and Atlantic Counties. These urgent care mental health clinics are intended to provide rapid access to short - term, non- hospital based crisis intervention and stabilization services for persons with a mental illness. These early intervention programs are community -based programs aimed at offering individuals mental health service options that can divert undue use of emergency room and in- patient programs. A comprehensive range of pharmacologic, therapeutic, recovery and supportive services are offered in order to divert undue use of emergency room and in- patient programs. Currently, EISS programs are funded for $11.6 million and serve Atlantic, Camden, Essex, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Bergen, Cumberland, Hudson, Mercer Counties and Ocean Counties. During SFY 2018, t hese programs delivered 13,505 episodes of care , with episodes ranging from one contact with immediate referral to four -six weeks of short term crisis stabilization. Involuntary Outpatient Commitment (IOC) . DMHAS now funds eighteen Involuntary Outpatient Commitment (IOC) programs that serve all twenty one New Jersey Counties. Annualized funding is $6.5 million to support these programs, which have an aggregate statewide service capacity to serve 607 persons. During SFY 2018, a total of 1,203 persons (duplicated count) were served in IOC, with an average active ongoing caseload of 479. IOC programs offer: court ordered out -patient based mental health treatment; a ssistance with linking with community based mental health services; m onitoring of adherence to the court ordered plan; i nterface with the judiciary including transportation to court hearings and contact with the presiding judge, as needed. Challenges to program development and operations have included; provider recruitment and retention of psychiatrists; operationalization of some aspects of the law, such as managing \"unwilling to receive treatment voluntarily\" in an outpatient setting and \"material non- compliance\" with the outpatient treatment plan; matching the law's limits with the right group of persons. Intensive Outpatient Treatment Support Service (IOTSS). Since 2008, the SMHA has funded 25 IOTSS programs , located in the following counties (1 Atlantic, 3 Bergen, 1 Burlington, 3 Camden, 1 Cape May, 2 Cumberland, 1 Essex, 1 Gloucester,1 Hudson, 1 Hunterdon, 1 Mercer, 2 Middlesex, 1 M orris, 1 Ocean, 1 Passaic, 1 Salem, 1 Somerset, 1 Union and 1 Warren) in order Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 68 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 105 of 45613 to create quick access to intensive outpatient services for individuals seeking access to treatment through the acute mental health system. These new programs are designed to create dedicated access for consumers referred from emergency ro oms and other acute settings. In SFY2018, 3,962 consumers were served by IOTSS. Homeless Adults/PATH. The SMHA is the recipient of the federally funded PATH program, which is matched with state funding. The PATH program is authorized by the Public Health Service Act Title 42 of the U.S. Code \"The Public Health and Welfare\", Chapter 6a \"Public Health Service,\" Subchapter III -A, Part C - Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH), the target population is homeless adults or those at risk of homelessness who have a serious mental illness, including those with co- occurring substance use disorders who are not currently engaged in and are resistant to mental health and other community support services. The primary objective of PATH is to provi de outreach to, identification and engagement of the target population into an array of community services through active case management and referral. All New Jersey PATH programs provide outreach, screening and assessment, case management and referral services for community mental health and substance abuse treatment services, financial benefits, primary health services, job training/vocational and educational services and relevant housing services including; emergency housing, transitional housing and permanent housing services. A limited number of PATH programs also provide some of the following services directly; security deposits and payment of back rent, mental health assessment and treatment, representative payee services and staff training. Recove ry, community integration and housing stability are the long -term goals of the program, achieved through client -centered treatment planning. The SMHA contracts with 25 non- profit agencies to operate PATH programs within the state's 21 counties. A small number of PATH programs use PATH funding to directly provide psychiatric assessment and outpatient mental health services. Many PATH providers are Community Mental Health Centers and link their consumers to mental health services in their agency such as, outpatient or partial care programs. All PATH programs link individuals to behavioral health and co -occurring services , entitlements and housing (emergency, transitional and permanent) within their communities. In SFY18 there were 2,417 consumers served by PATH. All PATH providers are required to complete Intended Use Plans in which they identify the services to be provided, evidenced -based practices to be deployed, strategies for making housing available, the gender, race and ethnicity of the individuals t hey are serving in their community; the gender, racial and ethnicity of their staff; and to specify how thei r staff will provide culturally sensitive services and what cultural competency training and support their staff is provided. 3. Intermediate and Rehabilitative Services. The SMHA contracts for Intermediate and Rehabilitative services including: Community Support Services ; Residential Services; Supported Employment (SE); Supported Education (SEd); Programs for Assertive Community Treatment (PACT ); Intensive Family Support Services (IFSS), Illness Management and Recovery (IMR); Justice Involved Services ( JIS); Integrated Case Management Services (ICMS); Outpatient Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 69 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 106 of 45614 Services (OP); Partial Care; Statewide Clinical Outreach Program for the Elderly (S -COPE ); and Legal Services . Programs in Assertive Community Treatment (PACT). Programs in Assertive Community Treatment (PACT) is an evidence -based model of service delivery in which a multi -disciplinary, mobile, treatment team provides a comprehensive array o f mental health and rehabilitative services to a targeted group of individuals with SMI. The program is designed to meet the needs of consumers, who are at high risk for hospitalization, are high service users and who have not been able to benefit from traditional mental health programs. In order to meet the unique needs of this targeted population, PACT teams offer highly individualized services, employ a low staff to consumer ratio, conduct the majority of their contacts in natural community settings (e.g . consumer's residence) and are available to help individuals address psychiatric crises 24 hours a day. Service intensity is flexible and regularly adjusted to consumer needs. Per the evidence- based model, c onsumers are eligible for PACT for an indeterminate period as clinically needed. As a long -term program, in which the course of treatment has no pre -determined end point, most New Jersey PACT teams are staffed with eight to ten full -time equivalent direct care staff and can serve between 60 -75 consumer s at any point in time. There are 31 PACT teams in New Jersey, serving all of the 21 counties. The SMHA contracts with 12 different non- profit agencies that operate these teams. Since state fiscal year 2010, the SMHA has expanded twenty of the 31 teams with additional staffing. DMHAS anticipates continued targeting of dedicated funding to expand the state's PACT program . As an Evidence -Based Practice (EBP), ACT is endorsed by SAMHSA. PACT will continue to be integral to enhancing the network of community mental health services. During state fiscal year 2017, six New Jersey PACT teams (Berg en, Camden, Middlesex team I, Middlesex team III, Monmouth team I, and Passaic team II) were expanded to serve 25 additional people with access to housing vouchers . The expansion facilitate d the discharge of individuals who are in state psychiatric hospitals. According to QCMR data reported by providers, there were 2,733 consumers served by PAC T in SFY 2018. Community Support Services (CSS) . CSS is mental health rehabilitation service and supports necessary to assist the consumer in achieving mental health rehabilitative and recovery goals as identified in an individualized rehabilitation plan (IRP); including achieving and maintaining valued life roles in the social, emp loyment, educational and housing domains; and assisting the consumer in restoring or developing his/her level of functioning to that which allows the consumer to achieve community integration and to remain in a n independent livi ng setting of his/her choosi ng. The SMHA contra cts with 39 CSS providers ( including specialty support models such as Medically Enhanced [MESH] , Enhanced Supportive Housing [ESH], Forensic [FSH], and Developmental/Mentally Ill [DD/MI] in all 21 counties. These services are consumer -driven and housing is leased -based . In addition, the State funds Residential Intensive Support Teams (RIST) which operate under a team -based Supportive Housing model with a high staff -consumer ratio and SMHA funded rental subsidies serving consumers discharg ed directly from the state hospital system, as well as those at risk of hospitalization. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 70 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 107 of 45615 Individuals eligible for services may have challenging behaviors related to frequent untreated mental illness or lengthy hospitalizations and homelessness . This may include a history of non- engagement with services, refusal to leave a hospital setting, active substance use disorder , and lack of financial benefits and other support systems. Some may have co -existing developmental disabilities or medical conditions that remain untreated due to lack of physical health services while homeless, or on- going conditions that need treatment and support. CSS opportunities and program design paired with subsidies demonstrate the principles of supportive housing including lease -based or similar occupancy agreements. Preservation of housing is primary and recognized as essential to overall wellness and recovery. The housing setting will provide private bedrooms, comfortable living space, and adequate kitchen and bathroom facilities . CSS promotes community inclusion, housing stability, wellness, recovery, and resiliency. Illness management, socialization, work readiness and employment, peer support, and other skills that foster increased self -direction and personal responsibility f or one's life are also addressed. Consumers are expected to be full partners in identifying and directing the types of support activities that would be most helpful to maximize successful community living. This includes use of community mental health treatment, medical care, self -help, employment and rehabilitation services, and other community resources, as needed and appropriate. According to QCMR data reported by providers, there were 4,762 consumers served by CSS in SFY2018. Residential Services.

Statewide Clinical Outreach Program for the Elderly (S -COPE). In 2011 DMHAS saw a need to develop specialized services to assist screening centers and nursing homes to respond to an increasing numbe r of older adults with behavioral problems. In 2012, the SMHA awarded a contract for the development of a program to provide specialized clinical consultation, assessment, treatment and intervention to older adults who were at risk for presentation to ER f or psychiatric hospitalization. Trinitas Regional Medical Center in Elizabeth, New Jersey was the recipient and has been administering this Statewide Clinical Outreach Program for the Elderly (S-COP E), which is fully funded by DMHAS and has been in operati on since April 2012. S-COPE provides crisis intervention and stabilization, consultation, and training for the management of mental health and behavioral issues in older adults (55+) residing in nursing homes and State -funded residential care facilities. S-COPE functions as a multidisciplinary team consisting of a geriatric psychiatrist (consultant), a gero -psychologist, geriatric advanced practice nurse, and master level clinicians. Outcomes are carefully monitored and reported to DMHAS on a monthly basis . The S -COP E program is available 24 hours /7 day a week to offer face -to-face clinical consultative services. S -COPE staffs also provide training and technical assistance to screeners, administrators, clinical staff, direct care staff and support staff, p rimarily in nursing facilities to improve staff's ability to assess, provide treatment, manage behavioral disturbances and stabilize crises for this population. The multidisciplinary clinical team advocates for acute care treatment of those older adults wh o need psychiatric hospitalization and advocates within the facility for management of behavioral disturbance for individuals who would not benefit from inpatient psychiatric stays. In 2018 there were 921 referrals to S -COPE and 189 were diverted from scr eening centers. There were 1 ,532 face t o face visits conducted and 2,770 phone consultations. S -COPE continues to provide support in maintaining clients in facilities by closely working with nursing sta ff. In addition, with S-COPE involvement, at least 12 individuals have been diverted from state hospitals. S -COPE equips staff by sharing best practices and offering trainings. All trainings, assessments, and treatments offered are consistent with promising practices and/or evidence - based practices. In 2018, there were 177 trainings completed, affecting over 2,300 people. T here wer e 75 trainings completed in northern region, 47 trainings in lower central region, and 55 trainings completed in the southern region. Trainings are open to all professionals including but not limited to Social Workers, Nurses, Psychiatrist, CNAs, and other professionals. The regional trainings and conference offers Continuing Education credits (CEs) for nurses and social workers. Training topics varies based on needs of the faciliti es and regional areas. Some of the topics delivered in 2018 included: Understanding the 3D's: Dementia, Delirium, and Depression, Understanding 3A's: Anger, Agitation and Aggression: Strategies for Care Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 73 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 110 of 45618 of Dementia Care , Behavioral and Psy chological Symptoms of Dementia, Promoting Healthy Cognitive A ging, Transitioning to LTC from Psychiatric Hospitals, and Sexuality in Long Term Care. Trainings are delivered by S -COPE Interdisciplinary team members consisting of Master level clinicians, Advanced Practice Nurse, Psychiatrist, Psychologist, and/or Licensed Clinical Social Worker s. Trainings are conducted on -site at facilities, via ECHO on ZOOM platform, and at regional locations (northern region, lower central, and southern). The on -site tr ainings are facility focused and topics are often suggested by the facility or following S -COPE case assessment. The regional trainings topics are based on identified theme of the area and availability of the space and their request. In 2018, t here were 14 7 on- site trainings offered, 10 Regional Trainings, 19 ECHO sessions, and 1 annual conference. S-COPE uses a combination of ways to deliver its trainings such case based scenarios, role - plays, videos, and sharing direct information. All trainings are developed by the S -COPE team and trainings topics can be suggested by anyone. In 2018, S -COPE exceeded the training contracted goals and it continues to find innovative ways to deliver evidence based trainings. Intensive Family Support Services (IFSS) . IFSS has been a priority for the SMHA since the inception of the original eight funded programs in 1990. At the present time, an IFSS program is funded in each of New Jersey's 21 counties. These programs enhance family functioning by providing the family with a greater knowledge about mental illness, treatment options, the mental health system, and skills useful in managing and reducing symptomatic behaviors of the member with a serious mental illness. Families also learn patterns of communication and levels of environmental stimulation which have been demonstrated to reduce the number of psychiatric crises and hospitalizations. Family psychoeducation is offered as part of an overall clinical treatment plan for individuals with mental illness to achieve the bes t possible outcome through the active involvement of family members in treatment and management and to alleviate the suffering of family members by supporting them in their efforts to aid the recovery of their loved ones. Family psychoeducation programs ma y be either multi- family or single -family focused. Core characteristics of family psychoeducation programs include provision of emotional support, education, resources during periods of crisis and problem solving skills. More specifically , family psychoedu cation enhances family functioning by providing the family with a greater knowledge of mental illness, treatment options, the mental health system and skills useful in managing and reducing symptomatic behaviors of the family member with a serious mental illness. Family psychoeducation is offered in each of New Jersey's twenty -one counties via the county IFSS Program. According to QCMR data reported by providers, there were 2,557 consumers served by IFSS in SFY 2018. Services offered include psycho- educati on presentations, family support groups, single family consultation, respite activities and referral/linkage. Services are delivered in the family home, at the agency or at other sites in the community convenient to individual family members. Engaging mino rity families has always provided a significant challenge for the IFSS programs. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 74 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 111 of 45619 IFSS programs invest significant effort and energy in attempting to attract minority families. Visits occur on a regular basis to a wide variety of mental health programs. IFSS staff also establish es contact with local churches and clergy as well as appearing at public meetings and events such as health fairs in their respective counties. Additionally, IFSS programs maintain a positive relationship with the New Jersey Chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). NAMI affiliate offices are located in each county. NAMI is contracted with the SMHA to provide support, education, advocacy and referral services to four separate ethnic groups through the following progr ams: Family to Family en Espanol, South Asian Mental Health Awareness in New Jersey (SAMHA NJ), Chinese American Mental Health Outreach Program (CAMHOP), and the African American Community Takes New Outreach Worldwide (AACT -NOW!). Illness Management and Recovery (IMR) . State Psychiatric H ospitals . IMR continues to be consistently offered by Rutgers consultants at all three regional state hospitals as one evidence -based treatment modality that teaches consumers about mental illness and coping strategies wi th the goal of decreasing symptoms, reducing relapses and future hospitalizations. Priority is given to individualized goals towards recovery. The SMHA, in partnership with the Rutgers School for Health Professions (SHP), has an active State Hospital Psych iatric Rehabilitation Initiative (SHPRI) within the Department of Psychiatric Rehabilitation and Counseling Professions. SHPRI's mission is to improve the quality of care provided at NJ's State Psychiatric Hospitals through consultation, education, program development, and evaluation, using psychiatric rehabilitation goals, values and principles as well as current research. As of 01/01/2018 several IMR groups have been offered to consumers in the three regional state psychiatric hospitals: 7 at Trenton Psyc hiatric Hospital; 12 at Ancora Psychiatric Hospital; and 3 at Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital (access to IMR is limited in the state's forensic hospital). These groups have been provided on the hospital units and in the hospitals' centralized treatment malls on average to between 14 and 95 patients. The SMHA decided to require the use of the Using the Illness Management and Recovery Treatment Integrity Scale (IT IS) as a treatment adherence standard for clinical supervision of Illness Management and Recovery program within the state hospitals. As of June 2019, the IT IS scale has only been tested by scoring an audio tape of a random sample of sessions and comparing them to validated outcome indicators. The hospitals are currently using the scored sessions as a form of audit that is fed back to clinicians providing IMR. The clinician then uses this feedback in the process of clinical supervision by identifying areas for improvement within IMR sessions. Community . DMHAS has incorporated IMR into the founda tion of principles and practices central to a recovery -oriented, person- centered system of community mental health services. IMR is incorporated into the partial care systems and it is supported by regulations. Currently, IMR is also incorporated into the community support services programs (CSS), formerly referred to as supportive housing programs. As part of the agencies' contr actual agreement with DMHAS, IMR providers track consumers receiving IMR and the type of IMR deliver ed (group or individual) that they receive. DMHAS , through a contract with Rutgers UBHC -Technical Assistance Center (TAC), provide s statewide face- to face and telephone consultations on this evidence -based practice. DMHAS , also through Rutgers UBHC -TAC provide s three 2 -day IMR Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 75 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 112 of 45620 introduc tory trainings across the state within a given fiscal year and monthly IMR Roundtables (alternating northern, central, and southern locations) to provide consultation for IMR -trained and contracted community providers. In 2015, the DMHAS launched the IMR R egional Train - the-Trainer Training and Consultation Model. Participating agency programs co -create and co - facilitate tailored trainings and consultation meetings in collaboration with UBHC IMR staff. The model's goal is to help a group of agency -based mast er IMR practitioners develop a collaborative and supportive infrastructure of IMR expertise within their NJ region and at their individual program settings. If these practitioners meet all program model requirements within a 2-year period, they become IMR In-House Master Trainers for their agency. Fidelity measures are optional and done through self -assessment with individual agencies as part of their quality assurance protocol. The Rutgers UBHC IMR -trained network constitutes IMR -trained CSS Programs and - trained Partial Care/Partial Hospital (PC/PH) programs. In FY 2018, out of a total of 61 IMR - trained CSS Programs in NJ, 26 reported their implementation data. These 26 programs served a total of 487 clients. Data reflecting the number of CSS staff tra ined in IMR by Rutgers UBHC from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018 is 47 CSS staff representing 25 CSS programs . PC/PH IMR implementation d ata were received from 56 of 105 IMR -trained PC/PH Programs in NJ in FY 2018. The data showed that 6,051 clients were se rviced with IMR. Data reflecting the number of PC/PH staff trained by Rutgers UBHC from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018 is 43 PC/PH staff representing 30 PC/PH programs. In FY 2018, the Rutgers UBHC IMR Regional Train- the-Trainer (T -t-T) pilot Program did not expand to an additional region. Due to staff turnover among the current IMR Regional Train -the- Trainer (T -t-T) Program teams, the Rutgers IMR Program team provided IMR Onboarding training for select agency staff recruited by their agency. Thirteen new I MR practitioners representing eight IMR Regional T -t-T agencies (5 in northern region; 3 in southern region) participated in 2 full -day T -t-T trainings and at least four scheduled regional meetings/workshops throughout the fiscal year. Seven of eight agencies representing the Northern Regional T -t-T cohort continued to provide in- house IMR training at their individual agencies. They also met as a self -facilitating cohort at least 6 times throughout the year. Four of five agencies representing the Southern R egional T -t-T cohort continued to provide in- house IMR training at their individual agencies. They did not meet as a self -facilitating cohort, but continued to participate in monthly scheduled meetings/workshops with the Rutgers UBHC team. Justice Invol ved Services (JIS). The SMHA has been funding JIS since 2000. The services work to divert from incarceration individuals whose legal involvement may have resulted from untreated mental illness or co -occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders. It is a short -term case management program designed to help consumers to successfully link to mental health or co -occurring and other services in order to stabilize and enter valued community roles reducing their incidence and length of incarceration. The pr ogram provides access to community -based mental health and substance abuse treatment services as well as critical social services. Through case management, clients receive treatment and psychiatric rehabilitation services, housing, employment, medications and health services. The SMHA is involved in very Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 76 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 113 of 45621 active collaborations with the Judiciary, Office of the Attorney General, local law enforcement, State Parole Board and Department of Corrections, and funds 15 JIS services and several other criminal justic e initiatives. JIS is provided to a diverse mix of consumers, male and female as well as individuals of Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Asian and Asian Indian backgrounds and from many different countries. Pre-booking Diversion. Pre-booking diversi on typically involves a police based intervention to avoid arrest for non -criminal, non- violent offenses. The SMHA's acute care screening services are a form of pre -booking diversion in that police are able to bring consumers to screening for mental health crisis or pre -crisis services. Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) are local initiatives designed to improve the way law enforcement and the community respond to people experiencing mental health crises; they are trained to identify and de- escalate situations involving consumers. CIT is built on strong partnerships between law enforcement, mental health provider agencies and individuals and families affected by mental illness. Crisis Intervention Team. DMHAS funds a CIT Center of Excellence through the Mental Health Association of Southwest New Jersey. The Center facilitated the development of new county CIT efforts. Presently sixteen of twenty -one counties as well as the NJSP provide training to law enforcement, dispatcher and mental health staff in CIT. These counties offer the training to other counties and municipalities as well as their own. As of May 2019, 276 of 565 municipalities have at least one certified CIT officer. As of February 2019, 4,643 law enforcement and mental health provider staff have been trained . Post-booking Diversion. Post booking diversion involves an intervention by a mental health staff person so that consumers are released from detention earlier than they otherwise would be; released on their own recognizance or released from jail with mental health intervention and treatment conditions or helping to avoid detention altogether. Superior Court . One form of post booking diversion that has been formally accomplished in NJ is through Prosecutor Diversion Programs. Prosecutor Offices identify a defendant who has a serious mental illness which is confirmed by the Mental Health JIS program associated with the program. The JIS program arranges for mental health and other services. These become a condition of a plea bargain or dismissal of the indictment if the defendant successfully complete treatment and any conditions set by the Prosecutor. The Union County Prosecutor's Office created and piloted this program, with DMHAS funds; however, the funds do not include treatment dollars. In 2014, the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) expanded the program by awarding 2- year grants to Essex and Ocean counties for a prosecutor led mental health diversion program on indictable offenses . The grants had limited treatment dollars. In FY 2016, the O AG awarded three additional Prosecutor Diversion programs: Warren, Hunterdon and Gloucester. The funding was only for two years, with the Prosecutor's Offices continuing as they were able after the funding expired. The SMHA continues to assist with service s through local community mental health providers. There were no new grants awarded since 2016. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 77 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 114 of 45622 Atlantic County was awarded funds from the Office of the Attorney for a special Veterans Prosecutor diversion program. In conjunction with division funds, thi s program targeted Veterans whose charges are related to their behavioral health issues. The program coordinates with the VA Healthcare Systems and the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMAVA) to obtain needed services. With the Atlantic Veterans initiative, there are now 7 funded prosecutor diversion programs or one third of the state. Necessary treatment and support services will continue to be a challenge. In 2017, legislation was signed that made the Prosecutor Division program for Veterans statewide, although no appropriation was made. There have been few referrals to this program as reported by the OAG as of 1/1/19. Municipal Court . DMHAS funds a Municipal Court Liaison (MCL) Program which works directly with the Jersey City Municipal Courts; they have a case manager/municipal court liaison, stationed at the Municipal Court who provides individual consultations to the judges and attorneys, upon request. This often results in diversion to treatment which the liaison facilitates. DMHAS also funds a similar program for Atlantic City. The city of Newark plea court arranges for needed services post plea. Asbury Park has been funding a social worker who provides similar liaison services for many years. The DMHAS, working with the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) continues to expand the availability of the MCL to include two to three municipalities within Passaic, Essex, Ocean, Monmouth, Mercer, Camden, Gloucester and Cumberland counties. The JIS programs will be providing case management services . The effort is ongoing with additional municipalities expected to be included as DMHAS resources are identified. Re-entry Services . Re-entry services (Forensic Case Management) are referrals from county correctional facilities; progr ams have between 1 to 2 case managers (typically 2 case managers) who interview and enroll potential candidate while in jail, provide pre -release planning and then successful linkage and coordination to mental health and other social/community services. No psychiatric or treatment services are directly provided by the programs but rather link existing mental health services. Counties include: Atlantic, Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Cumberland, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Monmouth, Morris (also included some county funding), Middlesex, Mercer (also included county funding), Passaic, Ocean, and Union. However, as a result of Criminal Justice Reform, the number of inmates in the county jails have been reduce by up to 20%, with upwards of 90% staying no more than 24 - 48 hours. This has resulted in a reduction of referrals to the JIS programs. PROMISE Parole Program & Parole Collaboration. A collaborative program of the State Parole Board, DMHAS and New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (HMFA) to assist parolees with serious mental illness to transition and integrate into their community and provide mental health and other wrap around services including employment and housing to reduce violations of probation. DMHAS funds a case manager to provide linkage/c oordination.

NJ Courts Veterans Assistance Initiative (VAI ). VAI program provides services to veteran's / service members who get arrested and need linkage and coordination with services through the local Veterans Service Offices of the New Jersey DMAVA. DMHAS licensed providers provide case management services and also treatment services as needed. The Veterans Assistance Project is a combine d effort of the Judiciary, the DMAVA and the New Jersey Department of Human Services, DMHAS. All vicinages in New Jersey have the VAI. Chief Justice's Interbranch Advisory/Implementation Committee for Mental Health Initiatives . The DMHAS was represented o n the Chief Justice's Interbranch Advisory Committee for Mental Health Initiatives which began in 2010. In 2012, the committee presented it 's report to the Supreme Court which accepted its recommendations in total which included among other things, the exp ansion of the Prosecutor Diversion Program, Municipal Court Liaison program and CIT. In December of 2014, the Chief Justice appointed the Interbranch Implementation Committee, the first recommendation of the report, to begin to operationalize the report's recommendations. The committee is co -chaired by the DMHAS Interbranch representative and a Judge from the AOC. The Implementation Committee continues working to operationalize the 17 recommendation of the report. Much has been done in educational activitie s on mental health of Judges and court staff; knowledge transfer at Superior and Municipal court conferences and enclaves. The Implementation Committee working with the Judiciary public information established a mental health resource page with links to me ntal health information and resources on the Judiciary webpage, NJ Courts Online. Criminal Justice Reform. January 1, 2017, the state shifted from a system that relies principally on setting monetary bail as a condition of release to a risk- based system that is more objective and thus fairer to defendants because it is unrelated to their ability to pay monetary bail. The statute also sets deadlines for the timely filing of an indictment and the disposition of criminal charges for incarcerated defendants. Under criminal justice reform, judges will assess the level of risk each defendant presents and impose conditions of release. Judges will use an objective risk- assessment tool that has been tested and validated with data from thousands of actual cases in New Jersey. With that information, each defendant will be classified as low, moderate, or high risk and may be released on conditions without having to post monetary bail. Defendants who are released pretrial will be monitored by pretrial services staff, s imilar to those in the federal system and a number of states. The result has been a 20% decrease in the inmate population in the jails. About 90% of those brought to jail on a warrant are released within 24- 48 hours. Legal Services . Legal assistance prov ided to mental health clients, either through agency referrals or self- referral, by a network of DMHAS -funded legal service agencies. Assistance may include advice and guidance, case coordination, and court representation for issues such as government enti tlements, housing, evictions, employment, etc. In SFY2018, 2,634 consumers were served by Legal Services.

Recovery Support including Consumer Operated Services . Consumer -operated Services continue to expand the availability of resources, as well as having a strong commitment from the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) toward building a recovery - based system -of-care. DMHAS strongly emphasizes the participation of the mental health, addiction and co-occurring consumer population and the families of those consumers into the development of its programs; the planning procedures for those programs; the careful monitoring of such programs; as well as consumer and family inclusion into the evaluation process for nearly all programs provide d. There are currently 33 Community Wellness Centers, Self -help Centers and/or Recovery Centers throughout the 21 counties of the state that are funded by the DMHAS. These centers are consumer -run, community -based , or on the grounds of the State hospitals and strive to provide support services to individuals experiencing mental health and/or substance use issues, with available resources and structure to foster their personal recovery and wellness. The Center members are supported through self-help, social ization, peer support, employment and education opportunities, and recovery -based activities. Some Community Wellness/Self -help Centers/ Recovery Centers are leaders in delivering support se rvices to the members. Many of the Wellness Centers that were orig inally conceived and set up to provide mental health support to the surrounding communities are seeing considerable changes in their membership structure and most are now servi ng not only individuals with mental health challenges, but are also providing se rvices to more individuals who are homeless; have co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders; have involvement with the criminal justice system; and individuals from diverse backgrounds whose primary spoken language is not English. An increase in Spanish speaking members has been seen recently . This shift in membership demands, has had an impact on the delivery of services and training needs of peer staff working at the Wellness Centers. All the Wellness Centers/Self -help Centers continue to ha ve access to the Recovery Library , that provides an opportunity to an array of online supports, group ideas, videos, and interactive exercises that focus on issues relevant to recovery, including addiction issues, wellness issues, parenting, advocacy, relationship building and developing natural supports in ones' community of choice. In 2019, DMHAS reallocated some of its already existing funding dollars under the auspice of Consumer -Operated Services and created a competitive opportunity for Wellness Cent ers/Self - help Centers to apply for additional \"Wellness Dollars.\" Through an application process in which the managers had to explain how they would use these particular funds to address the memberships needs surrounding specific dimensions from SAMHSA's E ight Dimensions of Wellness, and how that additional funding would assist to enhance services in dimensions that were important to the members of each Center. Some Community Wellness/Self -help Centers are leaders in delivering Wellness Recovery Action Pl ans (WRAP), Peer Outreach, Employment and Recovery support services. Journey to Wellness (JTW) in Ocean County has spearheaded an effort to engage residents of residential health care facilities with a community -wide reintegration effort. JTW offers Nights of Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 80 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 117 of 45625 Recovery, Weekend Wellness, and Substance Use Disorder support with many nights reaching 60 participants. Esperanza Self -help center engages in recovery support groups at multiple sites across Union County geared to the needs of the Latino and LGBTQ communities. The Individuals Concerted in Effort (ICE) self -help center in Atlantic County's provides extensive peer-focused case management, their support groups take place throughout the county and they offer boarding home outreach services. Multiple Cente rs sponsor a trained WRAP facilitator that enable them to offer the Evidence Based Practice level of WRAP to interested members and support Peer Outreach Support Teams (POST) providing peer case management and outreach serving hundreds of consumers each ye ar with WRAP -based recovery services. Additionally, Community Wellness Centers actively partner with local community providers and resources to engage in outreach activities that seek to enhance the community and wellness center participation.

Hudson County Integrated Services (HCIS) is a Community Wellness Center that we lcomes and supports people with mental health and substance use disorders who are seeking to improve their quality of life. This is accomplished through individualized, flexible services that promote respect, self -sufficiency, peer leadership and recovery, and community integration.

The Learning Recovery Community Wellness Center of Wildwood (LRCWC of Wildwood). The newest enhanced Community Wellness Center w as developed with the merger of the center and the Wildwood Wellness and Recovery Center (W2R2). The W2R2 functions as an overnight retreat and training site for Community Wellness Center members and other consumers statewide. The LRCWC of Wildwood has experienced a sizeable increase in membership of persons in recovery who cope with mental health issues as well as challenges of addiction, homelessness, shelter/motel residency and other special needs.

Over the course of 3 years, The LRCWC has been instrumental in providing naloxone training to 26 members and staff. Upon receipt of naloxone training, the individual receiving training is eligible to receive their own naloxone administration kit free of charge if desired. The naloxone kit is replaced free of charge if expiration date is reached or kit is used for opiate overdose reversal. NJ State Psychiatric Hospital -based Wellness Centers . These centers have been working to increase their membership. These centers created new half -page fliers with the hospital -based center's information on them to show -case SAMHSA's eight dimensions of wellness. They created business cards to remind hospital staff members that the centers are available resources for wellness and recovery services to the consumer population at the hospitals where they work. Another marketing strategy that these centers have developed is a Wel come to the Community Card. This card will remind consumers that when they are ready and when they get discharged into the community, after a long -term hospitalization, they have friends, family, wellness centers, peer-operated warm lines, agency support, including paid professionals, that they can reach out to for support and assistance in order to avoid re -entering the hospital system. These flyers can help consumers to know who to contact at their local community wellness centers and at the peer respite homes, as well as, other services available to consumers living in a community setting. The Hospital -based Wellness Centers have been working toward utilizing the R ecovery Library by incorporating the materials found at the site for use in support groups and one -on-one purposes. Personal Medicine cards are available to the membership as well as \"public logins \" that any of members can use when they need to and access the website information. There are many valuable resources in the library that consumers can learn from. The Trenton Psychiatric hospital -based center has also been providing support to the Ann Klein forensic Center (AKFC) since it began operating eight years ago. Originally the staff provided groups to the Transitional Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 82 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 119 of 45627 Alternative Programming (TAP ) program at Ann Klein . Most recently, groups are offered on the Rehab units at AKFC. Examples of the groups at the forensic site are groups focusing on the materials found i n the Recovery Library, W RAP topics, 8 dimensions of Wellness , \"Shared Recover y Stories \", \"Coping in a locked environment \", and other topics as requested by engaged group members. One on one peer -to-peer mentoring and support does happen on a regular basis, although sometimes it is at special request by staff or by patients who ar e serving time there. In the one on one encounters individuals have sometimes have expressed an interest in becoming peer support specialists when they get back into the community. In fact, one of the original peer mentors is currently working as a manager in the peer support community. Peer Respite Centers . Three peer-run crisis respite programs are operating in New Jersey. The purpose of the peer -run crisis respite is to offer a low -stress, home -like environment to an individual who is experiencing either a crisis or an emotionally distressing episode to take a \"time out\" of life pressures to re -evaluate what is going on with him/her to understand the source of the difficulty and then to plan on how to move forward in a more deliberate, self -protective way in order to divert this type of situation from recurring. This is done with the help of a peer counselor as well as in group settings with other guests at the respite. Respite has diverted many people in crisis from going into the hospital --saving money of a typical psychiatric stay and providing by all accounts a less traumatizing experience. Collaborative Support Programs of NJ (CSPNJ) operates three peer respite houses located within settings in New Brunswick, Newark, and Haledon, NJ. The Mission of CSPNJ's Wellness Respite Services is to instill a sense of hope, empowerment, and self -determination in people in emotional distress fostering recovery and wellness in order to pursue valued life roles and personal goals. Their peer -run respite is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They help consumers to restore capability and balance. The respite sites provide intensive short -term support for individuals in the community through an alternative environment to inpatient hospitalization. They empower a person in crisis to re -establish healthy habits and routines. The respite helps enhance coping skills to manage crisis or distress in order to resume valued roles. They encourage and strengthen wellness self -care so that the guest can be successful in managing the immediate crisis and resume valued life roles and responsibilities. The respites provide linkage to local Community Wellness Centers and assist guests to become or remain linked with their healthcare providers, jobs, schools and communities. CSPNJ serves New Jersey residents who are 18 years of age and older and who are in crisis or emotional distress due to mental health and/or substance use issues. Because the program is peer - run, the relationship between staff and guest is a collaborative one as staff comes from the perspective of a fellow traveler. Thus, Respite staff view the guest as the expert on himself or herself. The program offers up to a 10- day stay in a warm, safe and tranquil setting where the guests receive intensive support from peers which includes working through a Wellness Plan that addresses their emotional distress and overall health. The Wellness Plan consists of individuals' self -defined recovery goals which address their current distress and help them to avoid future ones. The Wellness Plan is the primary focus of a guest's stay. Staff and guests meet Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 83 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 120 of 45628 daily to work on their Wellness Plan. All guests are eligible for 30 days of follow up services after their respite stay has ended, wherein guests continue to work on their we llness plan goals while transitioning back to their homes. Referrals to CSPNJ's program come from a variety of settings including family physicians, case managers, therapists, psychiatrists, family members, and friends. However, anyone is able to self-refer to the program as CSPNJ seeks to speak directly to the person seeking services in order to complete an intake. All of the intakes occur directly over the phone and determinations are made during the intake process. Since their opening, both the New Bru nswick Respite and the Haledon Respite had nearly 500 combined guest stays and experienced their highest occupancy rate to date in 2016. Moreover, CSPNJ respite staff members are actively involved in their communities. For example, the respite staff member s participated in Middlesex County's Mental Health Awareness events, titled \"The Power of The Peer\" in May 2016 to reduce stigma. Respite staff also participated in a Behavioral Health and Justice Involved Taskforce and took part in multiple counties' Cris is Intervention Training for Law Enforcement which seeks to decriminalize mental health disorders and divert individuals from the criminal justice system. Furthermore, in 2016, CSPNJ respite staff collaborated with consumer groups such as NAMI and family s upports such as IFSS. Additionally, CSPNJ respite staff presented at the Spring 2018 conference of the New Jersey Association of Mental Health and Addiction Agencies, Inc. about their program's services. Legacy Treatment Services operates a Peer Crisis Respite Home in Toms River, NJ. Their mission is to break the cycle of hospitalization in persons experiencing acute mental health symptoms in a residential setting to prevent need for higher level of care. Staff at Crosswinds attempt to link consumers to a variety of community based mental health programs, such as: Wellness Centers, partial care, IOP, re -entry programs, traditional medication management and counseling, and case management support services. To ensure total quality care, consumers are also ass isted with linkages to a number of other services such as social services, medical specialists and housing programs such as supportive housing apartments, Oxford Houses, etc. As it stands, roughly 90% of consumers admitted, are experiencing some form of acute mental health issue that is concurrent and often attached to their housing circumstances. Though the intention and design of the program is mental health stability within a residential context and not housing, Crosswinds Peer Respite Center has a relat ively high degree of success linking homeless consumers to stable housing upon discharge (85%). Crosswinds recognizes the insight and understanding peer staff offer is invaluable and looks forward to continuing to pass that experience along to their cons umers as they work toward a life of wellness and recovery. Staff at Crosswinds is comprised of a number of peers who operate as those who are mental health consumers and/or co -occurring consumers. Many of the peers hired are done so in conjunction with com pleting the MHA CORE training that will allow them to become Certified Recovery Support Practitioners. Peers are active in their own recovery and help inform consumers of the variety of services in the mental health community. Specifically to Ocean County, peers are valued to help residents navigate the number of mental health resources based on their personal experience. The peers are trained in WRAPs and can work directly with consumers to develop a WRAP plan of their own. In general, staff utilize the MH ANJ as a resource to stay connected with other peer supports in the area. Staff lead supportive groups and Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 84 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 121 of 45629 individual wellness services with consumers, under the leadership and guidance of the director and supervisor. Lastly, staff attempt to further assis t consumers in a partnership capacity to maintain a focus as they work on maintaining their stability and as they set and achieve goals toward their recovery. Hearing Voices Self -Help Support Groups . These groups are transforming the lives of people all over the world by allowing them to understand and cope with the experiences that have long confused and frightened them. Statistics show that anywhere from 3- 10% of the population hears voices that others cannot. Although the traditional attitude in the me ntal health system has been to eradicate these voices, research now indicates that voices should be viewed as a meaningful experience, linked to a person's life story, and that talking about the voices is in fact crucial to recovery. Studies have concluded that most people who hear voices have experienced some type of trauma. The New Jersey groups offer people a safe environment where they have the opportunity to share their experiences without the threat of censorship, loss of liberty, or forced medication . Hearing Voices groups are not only comprised of those who experience auditory hallucinations, but those who experience any sensation perceived to be unusual and separate from one self. These groups act as a source of information to voice hearers, caregivers, and the general community by offering coping skills, support, acceptance, validation, recovery, and most importantly hope. Currently groups are operating at most of the CSPNJ operated Wellness Centers, as well as, at the Riverbank Self -help Center in Burlington, NJ which is operated by Catholic Charities, Diocese of Trenton. Residential Healthcare Facilities/Boarding Homes . Outreach is provided by MHANJ and CSPNJ Wellness and Recovery Centers to individuals residing in Residential Healthcare Facilities and Boardin g Homes . In Ocean County, the Journey to Wellness and Brighter Days centers have partnered with Ocean County Human Services, Police, social service agencies, and the NJ Department of Community Affairs to expand access to the services offered and bringing peer recovery services into the homes and transporting clients to community wellness centers. This effort has spawn ed legislation to create greater community engagement with the facilities. The residents have been assisted in setting up emails so that they can received outside information that they sometimes request. The center staff are helping the boarding home residents with computer skills so that they can find phone numbers, addresses for various agencies in Ocean County. The centers have been doing some groups specifically for the Boarding Homes residents: Budgeting, Independent Living Skills and a few others. Center staff have helped in transporting these residents to and from MVC to obtain identification and to Social Services for Social Security benefits. There have been many outreaches to benefit related program opportunities, shopping opportunities, etc. Residents have been assisted with clothing, small TVs and DVD players. There is much more that has been done in the past year to make the Boarding Home residents lives just a little more hopeful and empowered. Wellness Recovery Action Plans (WRAP) . Several NJ Self -help Centers are committed to providing WRAP as an Evidence Based Practice. For WRAP to be delivered following the Evidence Based Practice, there must be two certified \"Facilitators\" who has completed a Seminar II, WRAP Facilitator Workshop (37.5 hours) offered through Mental Health Association of NJ (MHANJ) and the Copeland Center. WRAP is designed to be delivered in mutual s upport groups. WRAP works to encourage an environment of self -determination.

The best practice method is to deliver Seminar I in 8 weeks, with each session being 2 1/2 hours or within three full days. In 2016, the Mental Health Association conducted the first WRAP Facilitator Training in NJ in ten years, and trained 15 new certified facilitators who are employed by agencies such as: MHANJ, Collaborative Support Programs of NJ (CSPNJ), and Richard Hall Community Mental Health Center. This training helped create the beginning of a NJ WRAP workforce accredited to train consumers and professionals to teach WRAP as an evidence -based practice. The MHANJ's Consumer Connections program offers training for Seminar I WRAP as part of the requirements for the Certified Recovery Support Practitioner (CRSP) certification. Their Consumer Connections training is currently offered 3 times per year. As part of their Community Education, MHANJ also provides WRAP introductions for 75- 90 minute s as well as, a slightly more in depth WRAP overview of 4- 6 hours. These are accomplished in 15 sessions per year. Overall MHANJ provides a level of WRAP training/education to 500 individuals a year. New Jersey is working to build a WRAP coalition in order to spread the evidence base practice model of WRAP throughout New Jersey. Certified Psychiatric Rehabilitation Practitioner. Certified Psychiatric Rehabilitation Practitioner (CPRP) is a national credential issued by the United States Psychiatric Rehabi litation Association.

With an attendance of 230 consumers re presenting a cross section of state and county hospitals, Community Wellness Centers, Recovery Centers, Support Groups and other consumer organizations throughout the state, the c onference offers not only topical workshops but affords the opportunity for inter -county networking, information sharing and gathering, as well a forum to share strategies used for both advocacy and wellness. A highlight of the conference is not only the yearly keynote address, which supports the yearl y theme -based on suggestions and the approval of the membership, but the NJ Assistant Commissioner of the Division of Mental Health and Addictions Services an nual State of Mental Health in New Jersey presentation. The presentation provides an update to ong oing issues of importance and informs members of new initiatives. This forum reinvigorates members to the value of their partnership in their personal recovery and reinforces the place that NJ Mental health, addiction and co -occurring consumers hold as sta keholders in NJ Wellness and Recovery Programs. Consumers are encouraged to become active in developing and supporting COMHCO's organizational activities and network strategies. Monthly meetings provide a regular forum for consumers to share their experiences while encouraging newer members to see the value of both personal and systems advocacy to strengthen the mental health system and to ensure that programs are aiding them in meeting their own Wellness and Recovery Plans while also reinforcing t he values of the Psychiatric Advanced Directives in daily living. These monthly membership meetings, which are combined with quarterly Board Meeting, strengthen the consumers' involvement. COMHCO has developed working relationships with: Collaborative Support Pr ograms of New Jersey, Disability Rights of New Jersey, State Consumer Advisory Committee, NAMI -New Jersey, Mental Health Association of New Jersey, Depression Bipolar Support Alliance of New Jersey, Consumer Provider Ass ociation of New Jersey, National Coa lition for Mental Health Recovery, Supportive Housing Association of New Jersey. Members hold representation on various State and county boards and committees, such as: NJ DMHAS Behavioral Health Planning Council, New Jersey Mental Health Citizen Advisory Council, NAMI -New Jersey Board and Committee, Consumer Public Policy Committee, New Jersey Mental Health Coalition, NJ State Consumer Advisory Committee, NJ Suicide Prevention Advisory Committee, and County Mental Health and Addiction Boards.

State and County Psychiatric Hospitals State Hospitals The Department of Health operates three non- forensic, regionally -based, adult psychiatric hospitals and one adult forensic hospital that serve people with persistent and severe mental illness who are in need of intensive, inpatient care and treatment. Effective August 20 , 2018, the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) was transferred to the Department of Human Services, while state psychiatric hospitals remained under the supervision of the Department of Health. The SMHA previously operated the state hospitals until this reorganization . Each regional state hospital has a Community Wellness Center. All of the state hospitals have person- centered treatment planning, shared decision -making , and IMR . The hospitals are dedicated to patient -focused treatment planning, emphasizing a continuum of care that is: holistic and highly individualized, promote s positive outcomes based on patient strengths and available supports, values the full participa tion of each patient, relies on shared decision making and client -defined outcomes, and promotes patient choice, empowerment, resilience, and self - reliance. Ancora Psychiatric Hospital is an adult inpatient facility located in Camden County , primarily serving the residents of southern New Jersey, that offers a multidisciplinary team approach to the development and implementation of mental health care. It offers adult psychiatric treatment, gero-psychiatry, sub- acute medical care, forensic care, and dual di agnosis (mentally ill and developmentally disabled and mentally ill and substance use disorder ) services. Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital (GPPH) is located in the northern area of the state in Morris Plains and predominantly serves residents from thi s geographic area. In July 2008, a state -of-the- art hospital was opened on its grounds, replacing five aging treatment buildings and the 131- year-old administration building. In addition to new housing and care facilities, the new Greystone Hospital facility contains a treatment mall with over 21 rooms for various activities. Trenton Psychiatric Hospital (TPH) , located in West Trenton in Mercer C ounty, primarily serves the residents of central New Jersey. TPH provides a holistic approach to patient care --from initial assessment and the treatment of the human response to current and potential mental health problems. TPH ensures its patients (and their families) competent, compassionate care as patients individualized care goals are reached. Ann Klein Forens ic Center (AKFC) is co -located in the same campus as TPH and serves New Jersey's statewide forensic population whom require a more secure environment. AKFC provides care and treatment to individuals suffering from mental illness whom are also under the custodianship of the legal system (e.g., Megan's law registrants, those found Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity, etc.) Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 92 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 129 of 45637 County Hospitals The SMHA supports four county operated psychiatric facilities that operate as part of the continuum of services . These cou nty hospitals receive most of their funding (85%) from the SMHA. They are county operated psychiatric hospitals located in B ergen, Essex, Hudson, and Union c ounties . 6. Olmstead Initiatives Over the last few years, the SMHA has been successful in its delivery of services to its consumers. Much of this success is due to the implementation of various initiatives resulting from the Olmstead Lawsuit. In April 2005, New Jersey Protection and Advocacy, Inc., now known as Disability Rights of New Jersey (DRNJ) filed suit against the New Jersey DHS on behalf of psychiatric patients who were been found to no longer meet commitment standards, but for whom no appropriate placement was available. The official term for the status assigned is Conditional Extension Pending Placement (CEPP). The SMHA issued its initial Olmstead Plan known as the Home to Rec overy CEPP Plan in January 2008. Although the Olmstead Settlement agreement was a result of a lawsuit initiated in 2005, this Settlement resulted in an investment in the mental health system in needed community residential and other services. The Olmstead Settlement agreement can be viewed at : http://www.state.nj.us/humanservices/dmhas/initiatives/olmstead/olmstead_settlement_agreemen t.pdf, and called for the following indicators of improved community integration, each with its own individual targets for every year covered by the Settlement Agreement: 1. Creation of community -based (i.e. Supportive Housing) placements; 2. Discharge of long -term CEPP consumers awaiting discharge since July 1, 2008 or prior; 3. Increased rates of discharge within four to six months of CEPP designation Based on a multitude of changes made to its service delivery systems, DMHAS was found to be in substantial compliance with the Olmstead Settlement Agreement such that the Agreement ended in June of 2016. Since that time, the Division's Office of Planning, Evaluation, Research, Prevention and Olmstead, continues to focus its efforts on improving community integration for its state psychiatric hospital consumers. The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) is in the process of revising Administrative Bulletin 5:11 in an ef fort to reduce hospital length of stay. Under this bulletin, consumers in state psychiatric hospitals are assigned to community service providers whom have the option of either accepting the consumer or requesting additional supports from DMHAS. In additio n to community providers, state psychiatric hospitals have the option within their discharge planning process of requesting additional supports for the consumer in their potentially new living situations outside the institutions. Such requests and other ef forts toward successful discharge are to be documented within the Individual Needs for Discharge Assessment (INDA). Assignments are based on hospital treatment team recommendations as well as consumer choice, and the assigned provider is expected to partic ipate in every treatment Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 93 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 130 of 45638 team meeting from the consumer's first to his/her last while in the hospital. The early involvement of community providers in the treatment planning process fosters familiarity between provider and consumer, allowing for immediate planning on the part of the provider to prepare to meet the individualized needs of each consumer upon discharge into their care. This preparation is critical to ensuring that the consumer is provided with necessary community supports and thereby maximizin g his/her chances of sustained integration within the community. It is born out of high- level interagency collaboration . As part of its Home to Recovery II Plan, DMHAS is focusing its efforts on enhancing the community -based resources available to its consumers. One such enhancement is the implementation of Community Support Services (CSS). A rehabilitative service billable by Medicaid, CSS offers education to consumers in the community on navigating daily activities, rather than performing these activiti es on their behalf. The goal of these services is to nurture independence and self-reliance on the part of the consumer, empowering them to thrive as functional and competent members of a community outside of an institutional setting. DMHAS has sharpened its focus on consumer employment as another key element to optimal community integration. To that effect, the Division has enhanced its Supported Employment services to include an in-reach pilot within the three regional state hospitals. Implemented in July 2015, this pilot program targets individuals who are ready for discharge and examines their interest in competitive employment outside the hospital. This in -reach is supplemental to the Division's existing Supported Employment services, which are availab le in each of New Jersey's 21 counties. Supported Employment services include assistance accessing benefits counseling; identification of occupational skills and interests; and the development and implementation of a job search plan based on the consumer's strengths, interests, needs, and abilities. The ultimate goal for consumers receiving Supported Employment services is to obtain meaningful and competitive employment as a means of further ensuring sustained integration within the community. According to the SMHA's Quarterly Contract Monitoring Report (QCMR) database, the number of referrals to Supported Employment resulting from the state hospital in -reach initiative was 36 in SFY 201 8 with an acceptance rate of 75%. Another area of focus for DMHAS' Hom e to Recovery II Plan is the examination of outcomes geared toward monitoring sustainability of the Division's community integration efforts. These outcomes include the completion of Medicaid applications within 30 days of determining the necessary level of care for consumers in state psychiatric hospitals; an increase in Peer Support Specialists across state psychiatric hospitals; expansion of the Behavioral Health Home initiative integrating primary and behavioral health care for mental health services ; enhanced utilization of Supportive Housing in the form of sustained tenure in CSS placements, expansion of CSS opportunities, and an increase in discharges to CSS as well as in the percentage of consumers served by CSS as compared to state psychiatric hospitals; and finally a decrease in hospitalizations in the form of lower census counts (for CEPP consumers and the total hospital population); fewer admissions to state hospitals; a reduction in length of stay on CEPP status and within the hospital overall; and a decrease in CEPP consumers as a proportion of the total hospital census. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 94 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 131 of 45639 Olmstead developed a pilot program with Centralized Admissions to divert admissions from the state psychiatric hospitals. This pilot began on January 22, 2019. The purpose of the pilot was to keep individuals in the community with the appropriate services. Olmstead worked with Centralized Admission to educate their staff on discharge planning. Each case that was referred to Centralized Admission, for transfer into one of the thre e state psychiatric hospitals, was assessed and reviewed for readiness for community integration. It was founded that with an appropriate discharge plan individuals did not require further hospitalization. Community individuals were provided the same oppor tunity of housing as if they were in the state psychiatric hospitals which resulted successful discharge. This pilot continues to assist in managing the total census in each of the three state psychiatric hospitals. Partnership with Vital Statistics . In October 2014, DMHAS issued Administrative Bulletin 4:27 in response to delays in hospital discharges resulting from missing patient identification documents. With the collaborative efforts between DMHAS and Vital Statistics, and subsequent development of the AB 4:27, a new process was implemented whereby DMHAS staff routinely retrieve birth certificates prepared by Vital Statistics for New Jersey born consumers that were previously unable to produce them for discharge planning. This process has greatly imp roved the discharge process by helping to remove a significant barrier to discharge, and in SFY2017, 471 birth certificates were obtained by way of this collaboration, alleviating identification as a barrier to discharge for each of those consumers. The nu mber of birth certificates obtained in SFY 2018 and SFY 2019 were 438 and 401 respectively. Validation of Vacancy Tracking Systems. The Bed Enrollment Data System (BEDS) was developed to help DMHAS manage and track vacancies. The system has replaced the process of cold calls to agencies and the utilization of quickly outdated paper tracking sheets. The Olmstead and Housing Offices within DMHAS are currently collaborating on reconciling the subsidy list maintained by the Housing Office with the vacancies t racked by BEDS. The housing subsidy list is undergoing augmentation to include any fields called for by BEDS not currently included in the subsidy list. This will enable definitive comparison of both tracking systems, as vacancies can be identified across each system by Bed ID and revised or updated as needed in cases of discrepancy. These efforts will serve to improve the validation of data within BEDS, allowing for greater validity and reliability within the Division's main vacancy tracking system. Enha ncements to Community Capacity . From 2010 through 2014, DMHAS was charged with the creation of 695 beds expressly for the community placement of consumers on CEPP status in the regional state hospitals and 370 beds to be created for consumers who are already in the community and at high-risk for hospitalization and/or homelessness. This equates to a total of 1,065 placements to be created over the five -year period covered by the settlement. The SMHA met and exceeded this goal, creating 1,436 new placements. Of these, 941 were set aside for the discharge of CEPP consumers from state hospitals (exceeding the settlement target of 695 by 246 or 35%), and 495 were reserved for consumers at risk of hospitalization (exceeding the target of 370 by 125 or 33.78%). In total, the SMHA exceeded its targets for placement creation by 34.83%, which amounts to 371 placements above its required deliverable. The Division continued creating new placements for these targeted populations, reaching a total of 1,808 new Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 95 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 132 of 45640 placements by the end of SFY 2016, with 1,274 reserved for CEPP discharges and 534 set aside for consumers at risk of hospitalization. Two hundred placements will be created in SFY 2020. Enhancements to the Individual Needs for Discharge Assessment ( INDA ). The INDA is an extension of the State Hospital Census database and captures each consumer's current needs for a successful discharge , as assessed by the hospital treatment team. Updated every 30 days (or earlier, depending on consumer circumstances), the INDA exam ines areas of need such as legal issues, finances, challenging behaviors (past and present), housing, medical needs, functional needs, and community needs (e.g. supported employment and aftercare rehabilitation). In keeping with the Division's 2015 updates to its treatment planning process, the INDA was expanded to capture provider involvement, including previous and current provider assignment(s) as well as the assigned providers' plans for addressing the needs identified by the hospital treatment team. As an augmentation to the state hospital census database, the INDA module also provides real -time data reflective of live information on all consumers in non- forensic state psychiatric hospitals. DMHAS has recently implemented INDA- specific canned reports, w hich provide hospital staff and central office users with immediate access to information contained within the assessment, including but not limited to provider assignments, attendance at treatment team meetings, functional needs of each hospital's census, and consumers refusing to be discharged. This information will be used by the Division and the state hospitals to drive efforts geared toward quality improvement and planning for the allocation of resources and the implementation of new initiatives. Cont inued Utilization of the Intensive Case Review Committee (ICRC). All consumers in the state hospital are reviewed by ICRC once every month weeks to ensure that consumer assignments have been made in preparation for discharge in a timely manner, barriers to discharge are addressed, systemic issues are addressed, and compliance with length of stay targets are maintained. The purpose of these meeting is to develop strategies for resolution of barriers and systems issues . Continued Utilization of Hospital Proj ect Teams. Project Team meetings are higher -level meetings that occur immediately after ICRC and are typically chaired by the hospital CEO/DCEO or Medical Director. Policy and systems issues as well as any issue that may involve collaboration with another Division or state Department, are discussed at these meetings and elevated to Olmstead leadership to address. In addition to policy and systems reviews, Project Team meetings also discuss newly -designated CEPP consumers to ensure that a discharge plan is i n place. On an as -needed basis, teams also hear brief case presentations in the event that Olmstead resources are needed. Finally, Olmstead staff will also use these meetings to update the hospital leadership on any new administrative bulletins, requests f or proposals, updates or changes to the vacancy tracking system, and/or trends identified in the data. Hospital Diversion Initiative. The Olmstead Office has partnered with Centralized Admissions within the state psychiatric hospitals on a process for red irecting would -be hospitalizations to less restrictive community settings. Regional Olmstead staff assist Centralized Admissions in securing additional supports needed for applicable consumers as a means of addressing their individualized circumstances and needs in the most integrated setting possible within their Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 96 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 133 of 45641 required level of care. This collaboration allows for reduced hospital census as well as enhanced community re-integration as mental health consumers otherwise on track for admission to state or county hospitals are able to continue to live independently with additional services or supports . Bed Enrollment Data System (BEDS ). BEDS was developed in the furtherance of deliverables to the Olmstead lawsuit settlement agreement with Disability Rights N J3 to facilitate the communication of accurate information between state hospitals and community residential providers regarding bed needs and available housing inventory. Utilization of a web -based system provides real -time access to vacancy information a nd helps facilitate assignments and avoid outdated spreadsheets. The system also enables planning at both the individual consumer level for placement purposes and system -wide for purposes of enhancements in community resources. BEDS expedites the assignm ent process of hospital patients into community -based housing through improved manag ement and track ing of vacancies. The system has replaced the process of cold calls to agencies , and the utilization of quickly outdated paper tracking sheets. Utilization of a web -based system provides real -time access to vacancy information and helps facilitate assignments and avoid outdated spreadsheets. Analysis of the utilization of Supportive Housing vs. supervised settings (e.g. group homes and supervised apartments) al lows for assessment of the Division's progress toward community integration. The system also enables planning at both the individual consumer level for placement purposes and system -wide for purposes of enhancements in community resources . At the time of w riting, there are over 4,641 community housing options within BEDS, comprised of: group homes, supervised apartments, supportive housing/community support services (assigned to existing DMHAS contracts with provider agencies) . DMHAS is planning to include 196 diversion beds to the BEDS system that will enable individuals to stabilize and be discharged to the community avoiding hospitalization. Criterion 2: Mental Health System Data Epidemiology: Contains an estimate of the incidence and prevalence in th e state of SMI among adults and SED among children; and have quantitative targets to be achieved in the implementation of the system of care described under Criterion 1. New Jersey currently uses the federal definition of SED and SMI : Children with SED re fers to persons from birth to age 18 and adults with SMI refers to persons age 18 and over; who (1) currently meet or at any time during the past year has met criteria for a mental disorder - including within developmental and cultural contexts - as specif ied within a recognized diagnostic classification system (e.g., most recent editions of DSM, ICD, etc.), and (2) display functional impairment, as determined by a standardized measure that impedes progress towards recovery and substantially interferes with or limits the person's role or functioning in family, school, employment, relationships, or community activities. 3 https://nj.gov/humanservices/dmhas/initiatives/olmstead/ Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 97 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 134 of 45642 Prevalence. According to the Federal methodology proposed for estimating the prevalence of SMI, the proportion of adults within the state wi th a SMI is 5.4% (Federal Register, Volume 64, No. 121, p. 33890)4. The lower limit of estimate is 3.7% and the upper limite of estimate is 7.1%. According to figures released by the United States Census Bureau , the 2018 adult population of New Jersey was 6,948,646. The size of the New Jersey child population was 1,528,702. Using the SAMHSA's SMI prevalence rate among persons 18 and older (5.4%) the estimated number of adult s with SMI in New Jersey in 2018 was 375,227. Using the upper SMI limit of 7.1%, t he estimated number of adults with SMI in New Jersey in 2018 was 493,354. Accordingly, using the lower SMI limit of 3.7%, the estimated number of SMI adults in New Jersey in 2018 was 257,100. According to URS Table 2a, a total of 341,808 unduplicated consumers ages 18 and over received services in programs provided or funded by the SMHA in FY 2018 . SMHA served 132,561 unduplicated adult consumers with SMI (refer to URS data table 1 4a) in FY 2018. That was 35.3% of the total estimated SMI adult consumers i n New Jersey (i.e. 375, 227). The objective of the SMHA is to continually increase the number of adults with SMI that may receive emergency mental health services and non -emergency community mental health services. Also shown in URS data table 1 4a, out of the total 132,561 unduplicated adult consumers with SMI served by SMHA in FY 2018, 54,867 (41.4 %) were ethnic minorities. SMHA will ensure that ethnic minority population continues to have access to mental health services in New Jersey. Like most other states, New Jersey has not established a methodology to estimate incidence in the state of SMI among adults. Criterion 3: Children's Services: Provides for a system of integrated services in order for children to receive care for their multiple needs. Services that should be integrated into a comprehensive system of care include: social services; educational services, including services provided under IDEA; juvenile justice services; substance abuse services; and health and mental health services . Please Refer to Children's Services Section of the Plan . Criterion 4: Targeted Services to Rural and Homeless Populations and to Older Adults: Provides outreach to and services for individuals who experience homelessness; community - based services to individual s in rural areas; and community -based services to older adults. Services to Homeless Populations DMHAS operates P rojects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program using a combination of federal and state funds. The target population i s homeless adults or those 4 https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR -1999- 06-24/html/99 -15377.htm Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 98 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 135 of 45643 at risk of homelessness who have a serious mental illness, including those with co- occurring substance use disorders who are not currently engaged in and are resistant to mental health and other community support services. All New Jersey PATH programs provide outreach, screening and assessment, case management and referral services for community mental health and substance abuse treatment services, financial benefits, primary health services, job training/vocational and educational services and relevant housing services including; emergency housing, transitional housing and permanent housing services. A limited number of PATH programs also provide some of the following services directly; security deposits and payment of back rent , mental health assessment and treatment, representative payee services and staff training. Recovery, community integration and housing stability are the long -term goals of the program, achieved through client -centered treatment planning. The SMHA contr acts with 25 non- profit agencies to operate PATH programs within the state's 21 counties. A small number of PATH programs use PATH funding to directly provide psychiatric assessment and outpatient mental health services. Many PATH providers are Community M ental Health Centers and link their consumers to mental health in their agency outpatient or partial care programs. All PATH programs link individuals to behavioral health and co-occurring services within their communities. In SFY 2018, the PATH programs in New Jersey provided outreach to 4,284 individuals and served a total of 2,417 persons. 1,108 program participants were linked to mental health services, 289 to substance use treatment services, 410 to primary health/dental care, 623 to financial services, 467 to temporary housing/shelter, 527 to long term housing and 198 were linked to employment or vocational and educational services. In addition, t he SMHA provides funding for At-Risk supportive housing beds for individuals who are at risk for hospital ization and homelessness. Services provided under the CCBHC initiative are available to all who meet programmatic criteria without regard for race, ethnicity, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, or place of residence. Policie s such as \"no wrong door\" allows any consumer access to CCBHC services regardless of insurance or pay status , place of residence, or lack of a permanent address. An average of three percent of CCBHC consumers at each CCBHC provider reported being homeless or living in a shelter during Demonstration Year 1. The two CCBHCs located in Trenton--Oaks Integrated and Catholic Charities, served the highest homeless populations at 10 percent and five percent, respectively. Services to Rural Populations The SMHA d efines a county as \"rural\" if, according to U.S. Census figures, 25% or more of its population lived in rural areas. Using this definition, New Jersey does not have any rural counties but pockets in some counties with rural population. Since there are no f ederally recognized rural areas in New Jersey, the Office of Rural Health Policy's Rural -Urban Community Area (RUCA) definition was utilized.

In December, 2016 New Jersey was selected as one of eight states from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) to participate in a two -year Certified Community Behavioral Health Center (CCBHC) demonstration program. The program was funded as part of a comprehensive effort to bring behavioral health care in parity with physical health care and to improve community behavioral health services overall as part of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA, \u00a7 223). New Jersey selected seven CCBHCs in six counties, including six CCBHCs in five metropolitan counties plus AtlantiCare in Hammonton, a rural underserved pocket of Atlantic County. The CCBHCs offer services within an integr ative, holistic framework, thereby closing a treatment gap that frequently results in inadequate service provision for individuals with co- existing social, physical and behavioral health care needs. New Jersey's CCBHCs offer 24 -hour crisis care, treatment for co -occurring substance use disorder and mental illness, ambulatory and medical withdrawal management, evidence -based outpatient counseling, case management, and family support services. CCBHC populations of focus include individuals with serious mental illness (SMI), those with severe substance use disorders (SUD), children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance (SED), former or current military personnel experiencing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and youth and adults with physical health risk factors and/or mental health diagnoses such as anxiety and depressive disorders other than Major Depressive Disorder who are not already covered in the target population. The CCBHC Demonstration Program was extended to September 13, 2019. The s tate is currently reviewing plans for sustainability. Services to Older Adults : Statewide Clinical Outreach Program for the Elderly (S -COPE) In 2011, DMHAS saw a need to develop specialized services to assist screening centers and nursing homes to res pond to an increasing number of older adults with behavioral problems. In 2012, DMHAS awarded a contract for the development of a program to provide specialized clinical consultation, assessment, treatment and intervention to older adults who were at risk for presentation to ER s for psychiatric hospitalization. Trinitas Regional Medical Center in Elizabeth, New Jersey was the recipient and has been administering this Statewide Clinical Outreach Program for the Elderly (S -COP E), which is fully funded by DMHAS and has been in operation since April 2012. S-COPE provides crisis intervention and stabilization, consultation, and training for the management of mental health and behavioral health issues in older adults (55+) residing in nursing homes and State -funded residential care facilities. S -COPE functions as a multidisciplinary team consisting of a geriatric psychiatrist (consultant), a gero -psychologist, geriatric advanced practice nurse, and master s level clinicians. Outcomes are carefully monitored and rep orted to DMHAS on a monthly basis. The S -COP E program is available 24 hours /7 day a week to offer face -to-face clinical consultative services. S -COPE staff also provide training and technical assistance to screeners, administrators, clinical staff, direct care staff and support staff, primarily in nursing facilities to Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 100 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 137 of 45645 improve staff's ability to assess, provide treatment, manage behavioral disturbances and stabilize crises for this population. The multidisciplinary clinical team advocates for acute care tr eatment of older adults who need psychiatric hospitalization and advocates within the facility for management of behavioral issues for individuals who would not benefit from inpatient psychiatric stays. Prior to S -COPE's inception, individuals with dement ia were more likely to be referred to mental health crisis screening centers and emergency rooms, and many were subsequently being admitted to inpatient psychiatric facilities, including state psychiatric hospitals. In 2018, there were 921 referrals to S -COPE and 189 were diverted from screening c enters. There were 1 ,532 face t o face visits conducted and 2,770 phone consultations. S -COPE continues to provide support in maintaining clients in facilities by closely working with nursing sta ff. With S-COPE involvement, at least 12 individuals have been diverted from state hospitals. S -COPE equips staff by sharing best practices and offering trainings. All trainings, assessments, and treatments offered are consistent with promising practices and/or evidence -based practices. Trainings are delivered by S -COPE Interdisciplinary team members consisting of Master level clinicians, Advanced Practice Nurse, Psychiatrist, Psychologist, and/or Licensed Clinical Social Worker s. Trainings are conducted on -site at facilitie s, via ECHO on ZOOM platform, and at regional locations. In 2018, there were 177 trainings completed, affecting over 2,300 people. There wer e 75 trainings completed in northern region, 47 trainings in the central region, and 55 trainings completed in the s outhern region. Trainings are open to all professionals including , but not limited to , Social Workers, Nurses, Psychiatrist, CNAs, and other professionals. In 2018, S - COPE exceeded the training contracted goals and it continues to find innovative ways to deliver evidence based trainings. S-COPE ensures that the program is culturally and linguistically competent, accessible, and responsive to agencies, consumers and families. The older adult mental health service system in New Jersey does not discriminate with regard to diverse racial, ethnic and sex ual /gender minorities. Criterion 5: Management Systems: States describe their financial resources, staffing, and training for mental health services providers necessary for the plan; provides for training of providers of emergency health services regarding SMI and SED; and how the state intends to expend this grant for the fiscal years involved. Staffing Resources and Training The DMHAS is dedicated to community --based mental health services and is advancing community supports for individuals no longer in need of hospital based psychiatric treatment and those at risk of hospitalization. The DMHAS coordinates with community based providers to administer behavioral health services, including prevention and earl y intervention, screening services, outpatient counseling, partial and day treatment services, case management, residential and supported housing, family support, self \u2014help centers and supported employment. In SFY 2019, State appropriations for mental heal th community providers were $352 million. A significant source of the increase has been the State's investment in the Olmstead - Home to Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 101 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 138 of 45646 Recovery Initiative, which has primarily provided funding for supportive housing placements for clients discharged from state hospitals, as well as for clients at risk of hospitalization. Additionally, DMHAS is now over two years into the transition of moving select community based mental health services from cost -reimbursement contracts to fee -for-service contracts, also known as the Mental Health Fee -for-Service Program (MH -FFS Program). This transition, which began January 1, 2017, represented an historic transformation for the New Jersey public mental health system. The State has transitioned providers and clients to Fe e for Service reimbursement, and away from fixed cost or overall cost reimbursement contracts. Concurrent with this, reimbursement rates were enhanced for many services and additional state funding (roughly $20 million) was appropriated for this purpose. D MHAS believes that the combination of more attractive Medicaid rates and the transition to a direct Fee for Service reimbursement approach for non- Medicaid services (with enhanced rates) , will lead to greater access for clients and a more transparent, acco untable and efficient behavioral health service delivery system. As part of its remaining cost reimbursement contract base, DMHAS continues to fund training and technical assistance that many community providers are able to access. The total contracted amount for SFY 2019 was approximately $ 5.2 million. In addition, State staff are continuously organizing conferences, meetings and webinars that providers attend on many subjects of interest to them in their daily operations. Notably, in SFY 2019, and continuing into SFY 2020, State staff have been holding weekly webinars/information sessions to help providers adjust to the new Fee for Service billing system for non- Medicaid services. While New Jersey currently has cost -based contracts and Fee for Service arr angements with 117 unduplicated agencies that provide eligible Block Grant services, to facilitate reporting, administration and minimize the audit burden on our providers, SMHA has allocated the available Block Grant funding to a selected group of 26 provider agencies. This group of agencies and the amounts allocated to each have been revised over the years to reflect changes in Block Grant requirements, funding and service levels, changes in the agencies' service programs due to mergers, name changes, and other reasons. In order to ensure that we are in compliance with the requirement to expend such funds only for services to adults with SMI and children with SED, DMHAS first reviews data on consumers served by each of the selected agencies' contracts to identify the percentage of total consumers receiving services who are either adults with SMI or children with SED. Based on these results, we calculate the portion of each agency's total contract ceiling that represents Block Grant eligible costs. The resul t of this calculation yields a total pool of eligible costs, just for the above noted selected group of agencies, of about $94 million for state fiscal year 2020. Consequently, the Block Grant funding for contracted services is then allocated to each of th e agencies in the selected group, based on the relative percentage of their eligible costs to the total eligible costs of all agencies in the group. APN Program . As licensed independent practitioners, psychiatric Advanced Practice Nurses (APNs) are an im portant component of NJ mental health service system and serve in a variety of settings in both inpatient and outpatient service s. Psychiatric APNs provide almost all of the services that psychiatrists provide (e.g., intake, assessment, etc.), except that they must prescribe medication under a joint protocol (collaborative agreement). While DMHAS had a program that funded psychiatric APN positions in community mental health services in the past, this program ended in 2017 with the state's conversion from a contract -based to a fee- for-service funding Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 102 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 139 of 45647 mechanism for community agencies. DMHAS continues to fund a few of its community agencies that remain under contract, such as in programs providing outreach. Technical Assistance Center. DMHAS continues to fund the Techn ical Assistance Center through UBHC , Staff and consultants from the TAC provide technical assistance training to community providers in priority areas identified by DMHAS. Some of the examples of projects include training in crisis management, emergency response, services to nursing home residents with psychiatric disorders, multicultural concern, Tobacco Cessation, wellness and recovery programs, and Illness Management and Recovery training. Multicultural Services T raining s. Under the DMHAS Mul ticultural Services Group, the SMHA has funded two Multicultural Training Centers. The overall goals of the training centers are to: Develop and review needs assessments relating to the cultural competency of the DMHAS system of care. Provide technical assistance to DMHAS agencies in the implementation of a cultural competence plan based on the information from both SAMHSA and CSAT TIP 59. Provide accredited trainings that match the cultural and linguistic competencies, skills and needs of staff. Design and implement curriculum to provide ongoing training and technical assistance to Wellness Centers, DMHAS agencies, their administrators and staff. Develop outcomes to measure the effectiveness of Cultural Connections' training and technical assistance. Collaborate with any other cultural competence training entities in the state, especially the Center in the South. Use pre and post tests and follow -up survey to examine change following training and technical assistance. Through contract , each Training Center offers annually two conferences o n topics relating to diversity and a t least 6 full d ay accredited trainings provided to DMHAS contract agency staff . Upon approval and release of the format for the DMHAS Cultural Competence Planning Toolkit for contract agencies, the Centers will also each hold annually at least 4 TA sessions for agencies in the catchment area with minimum 30 attendees at each session (total of 240) to assist in pla n development and implementation. Children's Behavioral Hea lth Services The New Jersey Department of Children and Families (DCF) - Children's System of Care (CSOC) is responsible for overseeing the public system of providers who serve children with emotional and behavioral health care challenges, children under t he age of 21 with developmental disabilities and youth up to age 18 with substance use challenges. In New Jersey, adult and children's mental health systems were separated in 2006 for those programs that served children only. On July 11, 2006, legislation was signed creating the New Jersey DCF , the state's first Cabinet- level department focused solely on child and family well - being. All services provided by the DHS Office of Children Services were transferred to the DCF. On June 29, 2012, Governor Chris Christie signed a bill that further reorganized DCF into Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 103 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 140 of 45648 a single point of entry for all families with children, youth and young adults with developmental disabilities and/or substance abuse disorders. This realignment of services is intended to remove barri ers to accessibility, provide more complete care through all service offerings, and improve efficiency for those families served by DCF throughout the state. The substance abuse programs that serve children under 18 years were transferred from DHS to CSOC in July 2013 and children in the South Jersey Initiative were transferred in December 2013. CSOC coordinate s the state mental health plan for children, youth and young adults; provide s support and assistance to child welfare youth who need to access intens ive or multiple mental health services; allocate s state and federal resources for mental health programs; promulgates standards for services; and is now responsible for the provision of services for children, youth and young adults with developmental disabilities as well as substance use challenges . A separate detailed overview of the Ne w Jersey DCF's CSOC is provided by CSOC. II. Description of the Organization of the Public Behavioral Health System at the State and Local Levels including the Roles o f the SMHA State Government The SMHA supports adult services in the following capacities: (1) direct service provider; (2) purchaser of services; (3) regulator of standards and services; (4) coordinator for immediate mental health disaster response; and (5) systems planner. In executing these functions, the SMHA must ensure continuity of care and coordination of services within the state and between the public and private sectors. In order to do so, the SMHA must provide leadership in the: (1) interface b etween the state and county psychiatric hospitals and community providers; (2) establishment and participation in key advisory boards and committees whose missions impact upon the delivery of mental health care and treatment; (3) promotion of effective com munication internally as well as in the broader mental health and human services communities; (4) advocacy of the needs of the mental health community at the state and federal levels; and (5) initiation of planning activities with input from key constituen ts and interested parties, that address the changing needs of New Jersey's residents. County Government In New Jersey, county governments also play an important part in the overall functioning of the public behavioral health system. The county Mental Hea lth Administrators were invited to participate in the community -based planning certificate program and the comprehensive planning process with the hope that, over time, both the substance abuse and mental health planning processes and products will integra te under a single county comprehensive, behavioral health plan. Each of New Jersey's 21 counties has a mental health board that is staffed by a mental health administrator. The boards advise the SMHA and the Behavioral Health Planning Council of issues a nd programs that are of significance to their locale and residents. A Mental Health Administrator representative is a member of the Behavioral Health Planning Council.

III. Roles of Other State Agencies with Respect to the Delivery of Behavioral Health Services/ Interdivisional and Interdepartmental Collaboration Department of Human Services, Division of Medi cal Assistance and Health Services (DMAHS) . The SMHA and DMAHS collaborated to implement a prior authorization process for community partial care that began on July 1, 2009. As a result, both DMHAS and DMAHS have realized both cost savings from this initia tive as well as the first step in transforming the long -term day program into one that is more recovery oriented, shorter term, focusing on rehabilitation and attaining community integration and inclusion goals. The SMHA and DMAHS have developed a State Plan Amendment (SPA) for community support services which was subsequently approved by CMS, effective October 1, 2011. The SMHA is currently pursuing a SPA to bring in federal funding for crisis remediation services. This will allow for greater community -based rehabilitation services while drawing down federal funds to best leverage existing resources. In addition, a staff member from DMAHS is part of the membership of the Behavioral Health Planning Council. The DMHAS and DMAHS are collaborating on sever al initiatives that are part of the New Jersey approved Medicaid Comprehensive Waiver. These include: transitioning of services for consumers with the dual diagnosis of Intellectual/Developmental Disorders and Managed Long Term Services and Supports (MLTS S); collaboration related to the carve -in of managed psychiatric inpatient services, including the waiver of IMD speciality private hospitals; and the development of Behavioral Health Home (BHH) Services. The DMHAS works with DMAHS and the Division on Aging Services (DoAS) to continue to coordinate the Managed Long Term Services and Supports (MLTSS) services . MLTSS refers to the delivery of long -term services and supports through New Jersey Medicaid's NJ FamilyCare managed care program. MLTSS is designed to expand home and community -based services, promote community inclusion and ensure quality and efficiency. MLTSS uses NJ FamilyCare managed care organizations ( also known as MCOs/HMOs/health plans ) to coordinate all MLTSS services. MLTSS provides comprehens ive services and supports for individuals who meet clinical eligibility , whether at home, in an assisted living facility, in community residential services, or in a nursing home. Effective July 1, 2014, MLTSS includes an array of services but is not limit ed to: Personal Care, Respite, Care Management, Home and Vehicle Modifications , Home Delivered Meals , Personal Emergency Response Systems , Mental Health and Addiction Services , Assisted Living , Community Residential Services (CRS) , and Nursing Home Care . The MLTSS Service Dictionary for a complete list of MLTSS services is available at http://www.state.nj.us/humanservices/dmahs/home/MLTSS_Service_Dictionary.pdf . Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 105 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 142 of 45650 The following behavioral health services are included in the MLTSS benefit through NJ FamilyCare/Medicaid MCOs: Partial Care/Partial Hospitalization , Adult Mental Health Rehabilitation (Group Hom es A+ through D), Independent Practitioner (Physician, APN, Psyc hologist) , Mental Health Services , and Inpatient Psychiatric Hospital Care . PACT, Transitional Case Managers (TCMs) and BHH are not covered by MCOs in MLTSS since they are duplicative care management services and remain Medicaid FFS. However, MCOs are required to coordinate these services for MLTSS mem bers, as clinically appropriate. NJ was also a recipient of a CCBHC Demonstration Grant, which includes a variety of services such as screening and referr al for physical health needs and Health and Wellness services . Currently, seven CCBHCs are in operation (as of 7/1/17). Medicaid has been a partner throughout, having developed the Prospective Payment System that NJ is utilizing for this project. DMHAS has explored several models of integration with DMAHS , and continues to evaluate the needs of its population. Together, the two divisions received assistance through CMS State Innovation Model grant that includes integration as one of its priorities, and technical assistance from the National Academy for State Health Policy (NASHP) to assist with developing a more integrated system. It also recognizes that many barriers to integration currently exist, including the need for agencies to seek licenses from several agencies in order to provide integrated behavioral health and primary care services. As a result, the Department of Human Services, with assistance from a private foundation, has procured the Seton Hall Law School to review Department of Health and Dep artment of Human Services regulations , to identify regulatory barriers and develop and implement strategies to eliminate them. Department of Human Services, Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD). SMHA staff collaborates with DDD staff regarding dis charge planning of dually diagnosed consumers with both intellectual developmental disabilities and mental illness (DD/MI) in the state psychiatric hospitals. Staff from DDD are also members of the Behavioral Health Planning Council. The SMHA has developed an RFP process to promote the development of community -based supportive housing opportunities and other support services for consumers with co -occurring mental health and developmental disabilities. DDD has also hired full time Transitional Case Managers (TCMs) that are stationed at each respective state hospital. The DDD TCMs have their sole or primary responsibilities at the state hospitals focusing on the state hospital DD /MI population, the DDD referrals , and working with hospital staff to address any discharge barriers that may be present. Joint DDD and State Hospital meetings occur at each hospital on a monthly basis to discuss discharge planning and address any systems issues. In addition, biweekly meetings with DMHAS and DDD Olmstead management occu rs to address systems level issues and barriers to community re -integration. Department of Children and Families. Interdivisional and interdepartmental collaboration between DMHAS and the DCF CSOC is frequent. Executive Staff from each Division have colla borated to make system recommendations for youth with mental illness and/or substance Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 106 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 143 of 45651 use challenges and families currently served in the CSOC whose youth are emerging adults. Recommendations were made in the form of policies, procedures and protocols that will ensure a seamless transition of youth and their families to all adult mental health services. In addition, several staff from CSOC attend monthly Behavioral Health Planning Council meetings to better coordinate services. DMHAS Medical Director's In tegration Office. The SMHA Medical Director's Office has an Integration unit with the goal of promoting integration between behavioral health agencies and primary health care providers. This office is working closely with the state Medicaid Office (Divisio n of Medical Assist ance and Health Services, or DM AHS) and DCF. The main goal of the initiative is to increase consumers with mental health and/or substance use disorders (SUDs) access to primary care and improve collaboration between behavioral health age ncies and primary health care providers. The behavioral health homes (BHHs) developed by DMHAS are considered the first step of a plan to integrate behavioral health and physical health services . Another integration project that the unit is overseeing is a two -year demonstration grant awarded by SAMHSA for Certified Community Behavioral Health Homes (CCBHCs), which began in July, 2017. The program has been extended to September 13, 2019. New Jersey was also fortunate to have had four agencies in four diff erent counties that were awarded Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration (PBHCI ) grants through SAMHSA . In addition to the health home project, DMHAS and DMAHS have partnered to expand integrated care t hroughout the adult system. Finally, the inte gration unit is also working with the Department of Health licensing office to comment on regulations that act as barriers to integrating services, with the goal of streamlining the regulations and increasing integration of services. The plan is to develop a single, unified regulation that will remove current barriers and allow integrated services to operate seamlessly. The final regulations will be developed in the next fiscal year, before being published for comment and promulgated. NJ Housing and Department of Community Affairs (DCA) . On January 1, 2019, the Supportive Housing Connection (SHC) was transferred to the Department of Community Affairs (DCA), Office of Housing. All direct care staff of the SHC were transferred to DCA, DoH as hourly employees as they were for HMFA. DCA, Office of Housing employed an SHC supervisor and began recruitment for vacant positions within the SHC. The role and function of the SHC remains intact, the changes are in the physical location of SHC and its employees, now housed at the DCA. The MOA between the HMFA and DMHAS, expired December 31, 2018; the new MOA between DCA and DHS/DMHAS, has an effective date of January 1, 2019 The Supportive Housing Connection (SHC), pay s housing subsidies for individuals served by appli cable DMHAS programs. Under this MOA, the SHC acts as fiscal agent and by agreement follows all DHS policy decisions. The SHC contracts with property managers and owners, completes all necessary apartment inspections makes subsidy payments to property mana gers and landlords. The SHC recruits landlords, provides training, assists with consumers completing Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 107 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 144 of 45652 paperwork and distributes welcome packets to afford a smooth transition for consumers. The SHC assists consumers in referrals for affordable housing units, administers DMHAS housing subsidies, and expands relationships for housing opportunities through developers and or other HMFA housing projects. In the event of disputes between consumers and landlords, the SHC brokers disputes and contract issues. In Stat e Fiscal Year 's 2017 through 2020, DMHAS issued supportive housing contracts that are for services only . When individuals require a housing subsidy the SHC processes the subsidy requests and pays awarded subsidy payments directly to the landlord. The SHC will continue to manage supportive housing subsidies, conducting crucial related services such as apartment inspections and rental payments to landlords. The SHC will respond to all submitted subsidy applications within one business day of receiving a com plete package. The SHC will provide apartment inspections within five days of the provider's submitted request. The SHC will also make rental payments by the payment due date for all individuals with a subsidy managed by the SHC. Lastly, DMHAS has launched a multiagency Suicide Advisory Council to aid in the prevention of suicide within all demographics. This initiative has partnered with a number of state agencies, including the Department of Health. IV. Description of Regional, County and Local Entit ies that Provide Behavioral Health Services ; How These Systems Address the Needs of Diverse Racial, Ethnic, Sexual, and Gend er Minorities In New Jersey, the administration and organization of the mental health system is centralized, rather than county or locally based. A broad array of mental health services are offered in the community. The SMHA funds community agencies that in turn provide an array of services including intensive services such as Integrated Case Management Services (ICMS) which consumers are linked to upon discharge from a state hospital, county hospital or Short Term Care Facility (STCF) for 12 months post discharge from the inpatient setting. Other mental health services include Programs for Assertive Community Treatment ( PACT ), Outpati ent, Acute Partial, Partial Hospital, Supported Employment, Community Support Services (CSS) , Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC), Jail Diversion, etc. The population in New Jersey is diverse in its ethnic and cultural makeup, and several counties have signi ficant minority ethnic populations. Staff providing services must be culturally competent, and education must ensure consumer access. Mental health agencies are required to adhere to licensing standards that require culturally competent services. The state has not announced specific goals in regard to the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act (PPACA ), but it has been actively working to promote structures to support the medical home component, and these are required to be culturally competent and meet the needs of a diverse population. The SMHA provides services to a diverse population of consumers. Several programs and the populations that they serve are described below. In addition, cultural competence mandates and training are also discussed. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 108 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 145 of 45653 By virtu e of setting (e.g. hospital emergency departments), coverage (e.g. urban, suburban, rural entities) , admissions practices, and regulatory protections, acute mental health care programs serve individuals of racial, ethnic and sexual/gender minorities. All PATH providers are required to complete Intended Use Plans in which they identify the gender, race and ethnicity of the individuals they are serving in their community; the gender, racial and ethnicity of their staff; and to specify how their staff will p rovide culturally sensitive services and what cultural competency training and support their staff are provided. At minimum, all agencies provide cultural competency training at initial hiring and at least annually thereafter . A number of agencies take adv antage of the trainings offered by the regional Cultural Competency Training Centers and other regional training opportunities. All PATH programs are informed by SMHA staff of any and all cultural awareness trainings being offered through SAMHSA or the Hom eless Resource Center . Multicultural and sensitivity training is mandatory for staff (per D MHAS regulations) upon hire to CSS programs and on an annual basis. This training is provided to ensure that staff are sensitive to age, gender and racial/ethnic differences of clients. Supported Employment and Supported Education are provided to a rich mix of diverse consumers : male and female as well as individuals of Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Asian and Asian Indian backgrounds and from many different countries. DMHAS Services to Special /Target Populations The SMHA provides services to adults with SMI and children with S ED with block grant funding. There are also special populations that have been assessed as target populations . They include consum ers who are at risk of hospitalization and homelessness, population experiencing First Episode Psychosis ( FEP), consumers in need of SE/SEd, consumers in crisis or receiving emergency services , older adults, women experiencing post partum depression and post partum psychosis, and youth population who are aging out of the children's system and into adult's system. The SMHA provides outreach to and services for individuals who experience homelessness; community -based services to individuals in rural areas; c ommunity based emergency services; and community -based services to older adults. A description of these services was provided in section I , when mental health Criterion 1 and 4 w ere addres sed. A dditional services to special populations a re described below. Services to Co -occurring Populaton. The SMHA fully supports and promotes creation of a co- occurring competent and seamless system of services for persons living with, and recovering from, co-occurring disorders (COD) . The DMHAS , in partnership with the D MAHS , developed FFS Medicaid and NJ Mental Health state FFS rates that enable clinic agencies to hire a workforce that is able to serve individuals who are dually diagnosed with a mental illness and substance use disorder. Additionally, Integrated Dual Dia gnosis Treatment (IDDT) was Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 109 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 146 of 45654 implemented in April 2004. The SMHA currently has ten contracted community mental health providers that have fully implemented IDDT into their existing program (ICMS, Partial Care, and Supported Housing) in five different counti es. However, IDDT is not fully implemented across the s tate. IDDT is provided to a diverse mixed of consumers : male and female as well as individuals of Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Asian and Asian Indian backgrounds and from many different count ries. Services to Families of Military Veterans. The SMHA has consistently provided mental health and related support services to members of the armed forces and veterans as part of its regular behavioral health service delivery system. When possible, the service member is connected to the VA healthcare system if eligible , however this is typically on 13% . In SFY 2016, During SFY 2016, SMHA served just under 7,000 individuals who identified themselves as veterans . They were provided with a range of service s, the most frequent being emergency services, outpatient, partial care, case management, Justice Involved Services , Supported Employment , and Supported Education . However, the SMHA believes that the actual number served is closer to 14,000 because many active or former service members may not consider themselves veterans in response to provider intake questions as well as based upon discussion with the NJ Healthcare System (VA). The SMHA and SSA had previously participate d in the state's now inactive Veter ans Services Enhancement Team, the result of participating in SAMHSA's Policy Academy on Service Members, Veterans and their families to better coordinate and provide services to this group in New Jersey. The SMHA also participated in Operation Immersion w ith the hopes that a similar training effort could be started in New Jersey. The SMHA has established quarterly meetings with the NJ Healthcare System (VA) to enhance collaboration, particularly around acute care services. A SMHA representative has recentl y reconnected with the NJ Department of Military and Veterans Affairs who was part of the SAMHSA Policy Academy to update and collaborate regarding needed services for NJNG and other military service personnel. Discussion included providing NJNG with Menta l Health First Aid training, the result of a SAMHSA grant, and reestablishing a points of contact between the two divisions for referrals to services. A SMHA representative recently provided an overview of the mental health and substance abuse system in New Jersey and how to access services for the Semi - Annual State and County Veteran Service Officers; it was very well received. Behavioral health prevention, early identification, treatment and recovery support system efforts targeted to New Jersey's popula tion of veterans is a high priority. The SMHA's Anti -Stigma Council has partnerships with federal and s tate military and veteran's organizations and spearheads initiatives such as the \"Life Doesn't Have to Be a Battlefield - Don't Let Stigma Stand in Your Way\" campaign. This campaign is designed to increase participation in state mental health services among veterans. The Anti -Stigma council also works to forge linkages to veteran's programs such as Vet2Vet and other veteran's referral, treatment and traini ng programs. DMHAS Disaster and Terrorism Branch (DTB ) is providing Question, Persuade and Refer (QPR ) to the veteran population. One of the team trainers is a combat veteran and regularly meets with veteran groups throughout the state to discuss Mental H ealth First Aid (MHFA ) and QPR training opportunities. A QPR training was provided to a Veterans support group in East Orange in July 2019 with 16 in attendance. Mental Health First Aid training was facilitated for a Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 110 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 147 of 45655 Teen Challenge program for at risk yout h. The staff for the program were primarily veterans and 25 were trained. Hudson County Office of Veterans Affairs hosted a QPR Gatekeeper Suicide Prevention Training on May 7, 2019. In this collaborative effort, the Hudson County Mental Health Administra tor and the Coordinator of Hudson County Office of Veterans Affairs invited various county agencies as well as Catholic Charities Support Services for Veterans Families (SSVF) to be certified as QPR Gatekeepers. The term \" gatekeeper \" refers to anyone who m ay benefit from learning how to use QPR to intervene to stop a suicide. Gatekeepers are people who may be in a position to recognize warning signs of suicide and that someone is considering taking their own life. 22 participants are now able to recognize a nd response positively to a veteran exhibiting suicide warning signs and behaviors. Justice Involved Services (JIS). The SMHA has been providing JIS since 2000. The services work to divert from incarceration individuals whose legal involvement may have re sulted from untreated mental illness or co -occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders. It is a short -term case management program designed to help consumers to successfully link to mental health or co -occurring and other services in order to sta bilize and enter valued community roles reducing their incidenc e and length of incarceration. The program provides access to community -based mental health and substance abuse treatment services. Clients receive treatment services, case management, housing and medications. The SMHA provides JIS services through 15 contracted community mental health provider organizations in 15 of the state's 21 counties. JIS is provided to a diverse mix of consumers, male and female as well as individuals of Caucasian, Afric an American, Hispanic, Asian and Asian Indian backgrounds and from many different countries. Deaf and Hard of Hearing . New Jersey has an array of services throughout the state for individuals who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing and have mental health issues. ACCESS at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Paterson is contracted to provide on- site outpatient services at several outpatient locations throughout the state with Master's level clinicians who are specialists in Deaf Culture and trained in American Sign Lan guage (ASL). They also provide 24/7 statewide consultation for psychiatric emergency services (available onsite during business hours and by phone/Videophone/TTY). Consultation is also available to inpatient settings, and outpatient programs. ACCESS staff participates in the New Jersey training for Certified Psychiatric Screeners so that they are able to understand, navigate, and explain the state's screening process. Additionally, ACCESS provides onsite clinical consultation and liaison services to New Jer sey's Short Term Care Facilities (STCF), assisting with treatment and discharge planning for each deaf patient. ACCESS operates residential services in Passaic County. These include an eight bed 24 -hour supervised community residence for deaf individuals with mental illness who have been discharged from a New Jersey state hospital or its equivalent, a four bed supervised residence, three semi -supervised apartments, and supportive housing services at apartments with consumers who are deaf and hard of hearin g with a mental health diagnosis living in the community. New Jersey has a Statewide Specialized Inpatient (SSIP) Deaf Program at Greystone Park Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 111 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 148 of 45656 Psychiatric Hospital. The SSIP consists of a 25 bed inpatient unit in the main hospital building and an eight bed capacity less restrictive residential cottage to prepare individuals for discharge. All SSIP staff are trained in ASL and Deaf culture. Certified ASL Interpreting staff are available for patient and staff interfaces, particularly clinical contacts. Two additional community programs located in the Northern Region of the state provide services to the deaf and hard of hearing population with mental health issues. Integrated Case Management Services provides a staff member to work with this specialty population, and the Partial Care program in Paterson has a specialty track for consumers who are deaf and hard of hearing. The Statewide Deaf Advisory Committee meets quarterly to review systems of care, as related to Deaf services and mental health in the St ate of New Jersey. Pursuant to P.T v. Gibbs, Administrative Bulletin 5:07 [Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (P.L. 93 -112), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (P.L. 101 -336)] the Committee is responsible for advising DMHAS concerning polic y, program, training and quality assurance issues/activities involving the service systems for individuals who are, deaf and also suffering from serious and persistent mental illness . The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Program for the Deaf, Hard of Hearing and Di sabled and a Program Advisory Committee were established pursuant to PL 1995, c.318 (NJSA 26:2B -36 to 39), and continue to meet on a quarterly basis to ensure quality substance abuse treatment services are provided to individuals who are identified as bein g deaf, hard of hearing or disabled in the community. Multi- cultural Services Group (MSG). DMHAS defines cultural competence as: \"...the ability to honor and respect the beliefs, languages, interpersonal styles, and behaviors of individuals and families re ceiving services, as well as staff members who are providing such services. Cultural competence is a dynamic, ongoing developmental process that requires a long -term commitment and is achieved over time\" (HHS 2003a, p. 12). The Division has had a long sta nding commitment to issues of cultural and diversity, originally forming a Multi- Cultural Advisory Committee in 1981. Since that time, the role and membership of this group has changed to meet the changing needs of the system. In June 2015, MSG was formed to devise strategies that are appropriate to the lifestyles, special needs, and strengths of New Jersey's diverse minority and cultural groups who receive services in the behavioral health system of care. The MSG will address the needs for ongoing plans wi thin all agencies in the system as we improve quality of care for minority, cultural, linguistic, LGBTQ, deaf and hard of hearing, and aging populations . MSG membership includes broad representation from providers in the behavioral health treatment commun ity, consumer representatives, LGBTQ, administrators, and academics. This group has begun agency self -assessment process, developing a mechanism to incorporate agency cultural competence plans into contracting, development of a strategic plan, and developm ent of a training curriculum.

At that time, New Jersey began to implement the elements outlined in the January 2000 New Jersey DHS Concept Paper, The Children's System of Care Initiative Concept Paper. The concept paper detailed key elements for system reform to better serve children with emotional and behavioral health care challenges and their families. The reform was ambitious and virtually unprecedented in its scope and commitment to individualized, integrated, culturally competent, and family driven services. The goal was to create an entity to coordinate and expand existing services and to develop new community services state-wide to help youth and their families recognize their strengths and plan services to meet their needs. When the Department of Children and Families (DCF), the state's first Cabinet -level department focused solely on child and family well -being, was created in July 2006 , the Children's System of Care (CSOC) was established as one of the three main Divisions of the new Department. DCF is the single state agency providing services to children, youth and young adults with emotional and behavioral health care challenges and their families through CSOC. The goal of DCF's CSOC is to enable the youth to remain at home, in school, and within their community. Therefore, through an organized system of care approach, CSOC is committed to providing services that are: A. Clinically ap propriate and accessible; B. Individualized, reflecting a continuum of services and/ or supports, both formal and informal, based on the unique strengths of each youth and his or her family/ caregivers; C. Provided in the least restrictive, most natural setting appropriate to meet the needs of the youth and his or her family/ caregivers; D. Family -guided, with families engaged as active participants at all levels of planning, organization, and service delivery; E. Community -based, coordinated, and integrated with the f ocus of having services, decision -making responsibility, and management resting at the community level; F. Culturally competent, with agencies, programs, services, and supports that are reflective of and responsive to the cultural, racial, and ethnic differen ces of the populations they serve; G. Protective of the rights of youth and their family/caregivers; and H. Collaborative across child -serving systems, involving; child protection, juvenile justice, and other system partners who are responsible for providing ser vices and supports to the target populations. The NJ Children's System of Care is founded on the following Core Values and Principles: Family Driven and Youth Guided - Families are engaged as active participants at all levels of planning, organization, and service delivery. Culturally and Linguistically Competent - learning and incorporating the youth and family's culture, values, preferences, and interests into the planning process, including the identified language of the family.

In the years since 2006, the mission of CSOC has expanded. On June 29, 2012 Governor Chris Christie signed a bill that reorganized CSOC into a single point of entry for all families with children, youth and young adults with intellectual/developmental disabilities and substance use challenges. This realignment of services removes barriers to access ibility, provides more complete care through all service offerings, and improves efficiency for those families served by DCF throughout the state. The transition of these services to DCF from the Department of Human Services (DHS) began July 1, 2012. On January 1, 2013 CSOC began coordinating services for youth with developmental disabilities and their families. Coordination of services for youth with substance use challenges and their families began on July 1, 2013. Highlights of the New Jersey Children's System of Care: 1. Keeping youth in NJ for treatment In 2007, there were over 300 youth being served in behavioral health residential centers out of state As of today, there is 1 youth in an out of state behavioral health pr ogram 2. Reducing the length of stay in residential treatment centers In FY 2003, average length of stay was 407 days In FY 2010, average length of stay was 349 days In FY 2016, average length of stay was 267 days In FY 2018, average length of stay was 2 56 days A 37% reduction in length of stay in residential treatment has been achieved over the last fifteen years 3. Expanding community -based care management, in -home, and day treatment programs for children In 2000, NJ served approximately 7,000 childr en, youth and young adults in community -based care management, in -home services and supports and day treatment programs In 2010 NJ served 35,000 children, youth, and young adults in community -based care management, in -home services and supports, and day tr eatment programs, a 500% increase in a ten -year period In 2018, NJ served approximately 56,000 children, youth and young adults in community -based care management, in -home services and supports, and day treatment programs, a 700% increase in an eighteen -year period Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 114 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 151 of 456 As of January 2019, 22% of the youth receiving care management are Developmental Disability (DD) eligible As of January 2019, 23% of the youth receiving care management are involved with child welfare 4. Reducing the number of juvenile justice commitments: The system of care is fully accessible to youth involved with the juvenile justice system and helps keep youth out of detention centers. There has been a significant decrease in the number of detention center admissions resulting in the reduction of the number of county detention centers from seventeen to seven in the past few years (Union County detention center closed in February 2019). In 2004 there were approximately 200 youth, statewide, in detenti on awaiting residential treatment post disposition.1 Today, it is rare to have even one youth awaiting residential treatment post disposition. The average waiting time to be admitted to a residential program is approximately 52 days (an increase from 40 d ays last year) across all levels of intensity for behavioral health. The waiting time increased this year due to increased demand for two co -occurring residential programs and specialty programs for girls. For youth in detention centers in need of out of h ome treatment, there are detention alternative beds that can be accessed on an emergent basis. 5. Creating a proactive safety net for youth: In 2003 40% of newly enrolled children were under 14 years of age; today that percentage has grown to over 50% This change in age distribution among youth served indicates that the system of care is effectively reaching youth at a younger age and thus able to engage youth and families to offer earlier intervention to address the child and family's needs. 6. Red ucing the number of children in out of home (OOH) treatment settings: In FY 2007, there were almost 4,000 children in behavioral health OOH treatment settings. In the intervening 5 years, the numbers of children in OOH decreased substantially. Between FY 2012 and FY 2018, the number of youth in all OOH placement settings (behavioral health (BH), substance use (SU) and Intellectual and Developmental Disability (IDD) continued to decrease. Year Children in OOH treatment settings FY2012 3,178 FY2013 3,100 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM Page 115 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB services to youth in crisis: Mobile Response maintains youth in crisis in their homes or current living situation, reducing disruptions for youth and their families and providing them with support and access to services during times of behavioral health instability. As of December 2018, over 97% of youth receiving Mobile Response services remained in the home or current living situation during the Mobile Response intervention. 8. The Children's System of Care continues to improve and continues to be the national leader and model for systems of care. NJ CSOC is frequently called upon by other states and jurisdictions to offer strengths, lessons learned and insights on how best to develop a system of care in commu nities and serve youth and families. NJ CSOC has been of interest to other states seeking to implement FFA (Family First Act) strategies related to prevention of child welfare involvement through development of community -based treatment, decreased use of congregate care, and creation of a structure that supports clinically appropriate out of home treatment. 9. In October 2015, Children's System of Care was awarded a SAMHSA system of care expansion grant, to implement trauma -informed care and provide wo rkforce development to our system partners. The grant, which is called Promising Path to Success, utilizes the evidence - based practices of Six Core Strategies and the Nurtured Heart Approach to reduce restraint and seclusion, while additionally striving to ward the goal of limiting out of home treatment to one episode of six to nine months in duration. The grant requires all system partners, including CSOC, to examine institutionalized practices and policies that could be trauma -inducing to achieve better ou tcomes for youth and families through improved system collaboration, policy creation, and the enhancement of youth and family voice. SAMHSA representatives conducted a project site visit in December 2017 . SAMHSA provided New Jersey with an exemplary exit report that recommended having enhanced youth voice within CSOC and the importance of supporting our Children's Inter Agency Coordinated Councils at the local level. In response to the report, the Children's System of Care recruited and hired its first Stat ewide Youth Ambassador, with lived experience from DCP&P as well as CSOC, in January of 2018. This Youth Ambassador has brought youth voice more prominently at the State Level into policies, program development and operations. Although youth voice was prev iously represented in the System of Care, having a Youth Ambassador employed by CSOC amplifies youth voice at the State level in a meaningful way and is true to the system of care approach.

Our vision is that all NJ residents are (or become) safe , healthy and connected. Our values are what we hold to be true of our work for the department. It is the core of our operations and interactions. It is the professional compass that guides us. Collaboration is about our willingness and intention to work in teams, in comfortable and uncomfortable ways . Equity means making sure we do what is needed to support each person we serve to be safe, healthy and connected. Evidence means using evidence -based, or promising practices, data and outcomes as our basis fo r advancing - or ending - certain programs and services. Family means all that we do should be in the interest of family and should be determined, as much as possible, by listening to their needs and providing appropriate supports. Integrity means that w e're honest, reliable and respectful in all that we do. DCF has also embraced five core approaches or practices that we will embed in all our work. Race equity - DCF is committed to integrating policies that advance racial equity in the work that we do. Healing Centered Practice - DCF will strengthen practice models, customer service, physical spaces and services that we purchase, so that they promote healing . Protective Factors Framework - DCF will structure practice models and purchased services to assess for and to promote the 5 protective factors: parental resilience, social connections, concrete support in times of need, knowledge of parenting and child development, and social and emotional competence for children . Family Voice - DCF's new Office of Family Voice will provide us with staff and families with lived experience to ensure that we're attentive to their ideas and input. Collaborative Safety - DCF will incorporate safety science into child and family services so that we do not merely respond to adverse events, but learn from them in such a way that we can reliably prevent future adverse events from happening DCF's strategic focus represents an effort to identify the major areas in ne ed of attention to maintain service excellence while simultaneously achieving significant transformation of the systems Four (4) major Departmental priorities have been identified: 1. Primary prevention of maltreatment and maltreatment related fatalities. This includes child maltreatment, domestic violence and sexual assault prevention. 2.

Staff health and wellness 4. CSOC In order to best align the priorities of the CSOC with the DCF vision and values, DCF is forming an external advisory group to collaborate with us to identify the specific goals for innovation and change that will sustain and grow the children's system of care in the years to come. DCF anticipate s framing the recommendations of the advisory group within these three priorities: o Promote integrated health and behavioral health o Build capacity to deliver evidence -based interventions and services o Enhance CSOC capacity to ensure equitable access DCF Children's System of Care Funding The DCF -CSOC provides behavioral care to youth and families every day in a broad continuum of services with total budget authority of state and federal resources consisting of Grants in Aid, Medicaid (Title XIX) and the State Children's Health Insurance Plan (S -CHIP) (Title XXI ), and for some youth (18 -20 yr. old) through an Alternative Benefit Plan (ABP). Funding Source Adjusted FY19 Recommended FY20 State $ 384,428,000 $ 77,578,000 Federal $ 244,570,000 $ 237,622,000 Total Budget Authority $ 628,998,000 $ 615,200,000 Description of the current Children's System of Care and Program Summaries Currently CSOC serves over 59,000 youth per year through a complement of needs -driven supports and services within a system of care approach: family driven, youth -guided, strengths - based, individualized care. The primary goals of CSOC are to ensure youth receive quality care in the most a ppropriate, community -based setting whenever possible to maintain connections to family and communities for sustainable relationships and planning. CSOC also has a continuum of out -of-home treatment settings of varying degrees of intensity of service acces sible based on youths' individual needs. 1. CSOC employs the use of the system of care approach and collaborates with many system partners throughout the State to leverage expertise of the local communities. There are state administrative and management sta ff, and services are provided by private agencies - primarily not -for-profit agencies. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 118 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 155 of 4562. There is generally one CSOC staff member assigned to manage each of the key services available through CSOC (i.e. CMO, MRSS, IIC/BA, FSO). 3. Services are primarily fun ded through Medicaid state plan amendments (Title XIX and Title XXI) Mental Health Rehabilitation Services Behavioral Assistance (01 -04); Mental Health Rehabilitative Services Intensive In -Community (01 -06); Reimbursement for Mental Health Rehabilitati on Services Children's Mobile Response (01 -10); Reimbursement for Mental Health Rehabilitation Services Residential Care Facilities, Children's Group Home, and Community Psychiatric Residences for Youth and Other Programs for Children Licensed/Certified b y New Jersey Government Agencies (02 -8, 02 -09 and 02 -14) and; Behavioral Health Homes (16 -0002) and; 4. CSOC also receives funding through the NJ FamilyCare Comprehensive Demonstration (1115 Waiver) approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2017. 5. Services are provided based on medical necessity. 6. Medical necessity is authorized by PerformCare, the Contracted System Administrator (CSA) /Administrative Services Organization (ASO) which provides the administrative services to our system of care. Care Management Organization (CMO) - CMOs are county -based, nonprofit organizations that combine face -to-face care management and comprehensive service planning for high and moderate need youth and their families into a single, integrated system of care. Youth are enrolled with a CMO when independent CSOC CSA review of clinical and need based information about the youth meets the threshold of clinical criteria and the youth and family can benefit from services. CMOs facilitate the Child/Family Team (CFT) meetings and implement Individual Service Plans (ISP) for each youth and their family. The CMO provides a single point of accountability for the organization, the delivery of services and the supports needed to maintain stability for each youth. Child Family Team (CFT) - The CFT/ Wraparound is an ongoing coordinated process that includes participation from the youth, the youth's family, the CMO care manager, and any other individual identified by the youth and family to help support the family towards a sustainable plan of care. Behavioral Health Homes - Each Behavioral Health Home (BHH) is a designated Care Management Organization (CMO) with enhanced care management teams that include medical Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 119 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 156 of 456expertise and health/wellness education for purposes of providing fully integrated and coordinated care for youth remaining in their home and who have chronic medical conditions. BHH services are a \"bridge\" that connects prevention, primary care, and specialty care. Medical and wellness staff are integrated into the existing CMO CFT structure responsible for care coordination and comprehensive treatment planning for youth and their families which includes planning for the holistic needs of the youth. Family Support Organizations (FSOs) FSOs are operated by 15 agencies under contract with CSOC to: ensure that service plans developed for families are child -centered and family -focused; provide support to families through peer counseling, family training and workshops; advocate for families at the local level with other system partners; and cultivate and empower youth development consistent with the wellness and recovery model. Mobile Response and Stabilization Services (MRSS) MRSS provides rapid response to youth an d families experiencing family -defined crisis, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year, that focuses on crisis intervention and stabilization that is intensive, therapeutic and rehabilitative. MRSS approach is engagement focused, strengths ba sed, collaborative with youth and families, culturally sensitive and based on individual needs. The purpose of MRSS is to provide crisis intervention, assessment, and planning services designed to stabilize escalating behaviors and/or emotional challenges , maintain children and youth in their home environment and community, and avoid unnecessary psychiatric hospitalization, out of home care and legal involvement Intensive In -Community/Behavioral Assistance (IIC/BA) services Intensive In -Community/Behavior al Assistance (IIC/BA) services are short term, intensive, community -based therapeutic interventions, rather than clinic or office -based, that are needs - driven, youth and family guided, and accessible. IIC/BA are aimed at engaging youth and families in a t herapeutic process to reduce and stabilize challenging behavioral and emotional patterns and symptoms, introducing \"replacement\" skills, and developing parent skills for sustaining positive change and connecting to continued therapeutic supports when the n eed presents. IIC services have two components: IIC Bio -Psychosocial and Strengths and Needs Assessments are conducted and submitted to the CSA for review by licensed behavioral health clinicians within 10 days of request. The assessment describes presen t challenges, strengths, identified goals, youth and family perspective and recommended intervention strategies. Assessments are provided in a youth's current living situation, including resource homes and detention centers. Assessments provide necessary information for a level of care determination.

Time limited and goal -oriented, these services aim to reduce acute symptomatology, enhance strengths, and transition youth and families to more traditional, i.e. clinic/office -based, se rvices as soon as possible. BA services are adjunctive to IIC services. They are never stand -alone. BA services are delivered by a license -supervised individual who holds a bachelor's degree at minimum and has 1-year experience working with the populatio n served. The BA is the agent of the IIC plan of care. The BA service provides direct youth and parent training, support, and intervention to maximize the potential of positive and sustainable change. Evidence -Based Practices The Children's System of Ca re is dedicated to providing behavioral health services that are based on the best evidence available and to improving outcomes and the quality of life for children, youth and young adults receiving services through the Division. The following EBPs are available through CSOC: MST, FFT, Wraparound approach, FFT for Foster Care, Six Core Strategies and Nurtured Heart Approach and the ARC GROW Model. Youth Outpatient programs Outpatient Outpatient treatment services provide behavioral health care to youth and families in a licensed community agency. Outpatient services are designed to support, enhance and encourage the emotional development of life skills to preserve or improve individual s' functioning, strengths and resources. Interventions may include individual, group and family therapy; and referral. Interventions are provided on maintenance, assessment and testing; outreach services; and referral. Interventions are provided on a lo ng-term basis when necessary. Partial Care/Partial Hospitalization Partial Care/ Partial Hospitalization programs are highly structured, intensive (minimum 2 hours, 3 to 6 times per week) behavioral health services for youth with serious emotional challen ges. Multi -disciplinary behavioral health interventions include rehabilitation programming such as activities for daily living, recreation, socialization, and community reintegration. Programs are typically located in, but not necessarily limited to, a c ommunity -based mental health or hospital setting (N.J.A.C. 10:37 -12). Partial Care services assist in stabilizing youth with acute needs, either following or in lieu of hospitalization or other out of home treatment.

Through enhanced coordination of systems partners, the CIACC also identifies service and resource gaps and priorities for resource development. Functions of the CIACCs include: Evaluating the local coun ty policies and policies to understand and minimize the impact of local barriers to serving youth with behavioral and emotional health needs substance use and/or intellectual and developmental disabilities in their community. Identifying local strategies a nd mechanisms to promote the integration and coordination of county, State, or other resources serving youth with behavioral and emotional health needs, substance use and abuse, and /or intellectual and development disabilities. Assessing local systems nee ds using information received from DCF, the Contracted System Administrator (CSA), any child -serving agency identified by DCF, and other bodies to make recommendations regarding service and resource development priorities. Identifying and informing DCF/CSO C regarding gaps and barriers to local service effectiveness. Providing input to State, regional, and county entities regarding system performance and service need. In collaboration with the Department of Education, DCF initiated the creation of an \"Educat ional Partnership\" in every county in NJ. These partnerships use the County Inter - Agency Coordinating Councils to build a better working partnership between the DCF system of care and the local education system in each county. This initiative has many goa ls, but one simple goal is to have at least one person in every school in NJ formally trained on the DCF service delivery system. This will help to facilitate a more preventative response to behavioral health challenges. Efforts to achieve this goal cont inue. DCF believes bringing systems together through the Educational Partnership will improve coordination in the service delivery process. Out-of-Home Treatment Services Funding for CSOC OOH care encompasses a full continuum of services for behaviora l health, intellectual/developmental disabilities, substance use, and co -occurring treatment needs. OOH treatment intervention must be directly related to the goals and objectives established by the Child/Family Team (CFT) process in coordination with the multidisciplinary Joint Care Review (JCR)/treatment plan. The OOH provider submits the JCR to the CSA for utilization review and for clinical determination of continued stay in out of home treatment. Family/guardian/caregiver involvement is essential, and, unless contraindicated, should occur consistently and on a regular basis (or as determined in the JC R/treatment plan). The recommended length of stay for OOH intervention is typically nine to twelve months. One single episode of OOH care is optimal. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 122 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 159 of 456Clinical criteria for the OOH continuum of services is available at http://www.performcarenj.org/provider/clinical -criteria.aspx . CSOC data have demonstrated a gradual decline in OOH utilization over the past several years, which is attributed to the success of maintaining more yo uth at home with community supports. Based on the analysis of utilization data, youth with high needs are requiring OOH intervention, whereas youth with low needs are more likely serviced in the community. Due to this decrease in utilization, as well as reduced lengths of stay, several OOH programs closed during FY 2018, resulting in a net loss of 132 beds. The Specialized Residential Treatment Unit (SRTU) provides administrative programmatic oversight of these programs and thus conducted a needs analysi s to identify the types of OOH programs where additional capacity is needed. Children's Crisis Intervention Services Psychiatric inpatient hospital services, located in community hospitals, provide acute inpatient treatment, stabilization, assessment and short -term intensive treatment. The units are licensed by the Department of Health, following yearly designation by CSOC. The Children's Crisis Intervention Service (CCIS) designation process ensures that CCIS units, established to meet the intent of th e 1987 Children's Regional Plan, are following both the intent and spirit of the plan and comply with the Certificate of Need criteria for CCIS units (N.J.A.C. 8:33) and Hospital Licensing Standards (N.J.A.C. 8:43G). Nine CCIS units are located around the state and provide services to all 21 counties. There are currently 164 beds. They are funded through Medicaid and private insurance. Seven of the nine CCIS' receive additional support through a mental health subsidy ($15, 056 annual per bed) from the Di vision of Mental Health and Addiction Services. Substance Use (SU) Treatment The Children's System of Care offers an array of substance use treatment services for youth and young adult, including four withdrawal management beds, contracted outpatient/inte nsive outpatient services through 10 providers statewide, partial care services through one provider, short term out of home treatment through one provider with 22 beds, and long term out of home treatment through two providers - one with 36 beds and the o ther with 64 beds). In addition, residential treatment services for youth with co -occurring substance use needs and significant behavioral health needs can be accessed through the CMO from five providers with a total of 54 beds. The South Jersey Initiativ e provides fee for service funding to 11 providers for outpatient and intensive outpatient substance use services for the eight southern counties. One agency, with a capacity of three beds, provides short term out of home treatment. Outpatient and Intensi ve Outpatient services are authorized based on individual clinical need and are not monitored on a slot -based method. This allows the providers to serve more youth and avoid waiting lists. The contracted providers manage their annual funding for these services.

The CSA licensed clinicians complete the CSOC standardized substance use assessment via phone, determine appropriate levels of care, provide referrals, and authorize services. If a youth meets clinical criteria for out of home co -occurrin g services, he/she will be opened with a CMO from their service area. The CMO Care Manager will assist in coordinating treatment services for youth and families, including meet and greets with treatment providers, educating families about services for thei r youth during and after treatment process, as well as providing support and encourage family involvement throughout this process. Families may also access services directly through one of the CSOC contracted substance use treatment providers. The provi der will complete a substance use assessment and submit it to the CSA for review by licensed clinicians for intensity of service determination and authorization for treatment. Supports and Services for Youth with Developmental Disabilities DD Eligibility As of January 1, 2013, CSOC assumed responsibility for determining eligibility for developmental disability services for children under age 18. The CMOs and MRSS work with family members to make application for eligibility determinations. DDD continues t o determine eligibility for individuals aged 18 and over, and the Children's System of Care provides services to those youth. DDD and CSOC collaborate through an established protocol to provide a seamless transition to adult services. During SFY 2018, 14,422 DD eligible youth were active with CSOC. Intensive in Community - IIH Clinical/Therapeutic Supports Intensive in community - Habilitation (IIH) clinical supports are intensive community -based, family -centered services delivered face -to-face as a defined set of interventions by a clinically licensed practitioner. The purpose of IIH services is to improve or stabilize the youth's level of functioning within the home and community to prevent, decrease or eliminate behaviors or conditions that may lead to or that may place the youth at increased clinical risk, or that may impact on the ability of the youth to function in their home, school or community. Family Support Services for children with intellectual/developmental disabilities CSOC began to provide funding for family support services in 2013. These services provide a wide range of supports including, b ut not limited to, respite, assistive technologies, camps, and home and vehicle modifications for uncompensated caregivers of youth with developmental disabilities living at home. Family Support Services are federally mandated and detailed under NJ Statute .

There has been a significant decrease in the number of detention center admission s resulting in the reduction of the number of county detention centers from seventeen to seven in the past few years (Union County detention center closed in February 2019). Detention Alternative Program/Youth Advocate Program CSOC funds Community Re -Integ ration Services through YAP (Youth Advocate Program) to maintain youth in their community who, without this program, would enter out of home treatment due to juvenile justice involvement. The program provides services both individually and in groups, along with a mentor, life skills groups and employment skills. The program is located in the three counties (Middlesex, Camden and Essex) with the highest rate of court ordered out of home referrals. Additionally, this program has enabled DCP&P to successfully maintain youth in resource homes after their arrest. Medicaid Currently, youth in juvenile detention facilities are eligible for Medicaid or New Jersey FamilyCare (S-CHIP) only after adjudication and referra l to a non-secur e setting.

The Contracted System Administrator (CSA) The Contracted System Administrator (CSA) was designed to provide the State with overall healthcare system management to assure 24 -hour access to appropriate and coordinated services and provide child -specific and systemic data analysis on all children under the jurisdiction of CSOC. The CSA creates a common single point of entry for youth and families. The CSA functions as and is inclusive of the activities of a non -risk Administrative Services Organization (ASO). The CSA registers al l youth requesting services , authorizes services in a single electronic record , and tracks and coordinates care for all New Jersey youth enrolled in CSOC. CSOC retains all regulatory and policy -making authority. As such, there are key functions that remai n the responsibility of CSOC, including, but not limited to, network development, provider contracting, and provider outcome standards. As a partner to CSOC, the CSA provides administrative support and is encouraged to offer recommendations for improvemen ts to the delivery of services which may be implemented with the approval of CSOC. The CSA performs a broad range of administrative service functions including, but not limited to, the following: Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 126 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 163 of 456 Providing a Call Center with 24 -hour/7 -day intake and Customer Service capability; Providing a web -based application/interface with the CSA's Management Information System (MIS); Managing care, which includes utilization management, outlier management (including authorization of services), and care coordinati on; if youth are involved with a Care Management Organization, the CSA reviews service requests based on the youth's comprehensive plan of care which is developed by the Child Family Team (CFT).

To support these administrative services, the CSA provides an MIS called CYBER ( Child and Youth Behavioral Electronic Record) that is backed by strong, clinical guidance and fosters flexibility, system integration, comprehensive information management, and production of management reports that support business decisions. Traumatic Loss Coalitions for Youth (TLC) - UBHC Suicide Prevention Suicide is the third leading cause of death for New Jersey's youth. CSOC is dedicated to the prevention of youth suicide. New Jersey's primary youth suicide prevention program is the Traumatic Loss Coalitions for Youth funded by CSOC. The Traumatic Loss Coalitions for Youth Program at Rutgers -Univers ity Behavioral HealthCare is an interactive, statewide network that offers collaboration and support to professionals working with school -age youth. This is accomplished through county, regional and statewide conferences, training, consultation, onsite traumatic loss response, and technical assistance. Since its inception, the TLC has trained thousands of individuals throughout the state with the purpose of saving lives and promoting post trauma healing and resiliency for the youth of New Jersey. The TLC we bsite can be accessed at http://ubhc.rutgers.edu/tlc/ 2ND Floor Youth Helpline Accredited by the American Association of Suicidology, 2ND Floor confidentially serves youth and young adults (ages 10 -24).

Crisis Text Line is a free 24/7 support that connects anyone experiencing a self -defined crisis with a trained counselor. It can be accessed from anywhere in the United States. When texts are received, they are screened by an algorithm for severity, and texts that indicate imminent risk are placed at the top of the queue for faster response. Crisis counselors are trained to bring texters from \"a hot moment to a cool calm\" using empathic listening techniques. They collaboratively problem -solve to help the te xter come up with a plan to stay safe. Calls are anonymous and confidential, unless referral to emergency services is necessary . DCF has a Memorandum of Understanding with the Crisis Text Line for sharing frequency data. For cell phone plans with AT&T, T -Mobile, Sprint or Verizon, texts are completely free and will not show up on the phone bill. For plans with another carrier, normal text rates will apply and will appear on the phone bill as 741741. Additional information about Crisis Text Line can be foun d at crisistextline.org. CSOC Training and Technical Assistance CSOC offers a broad array of t raining and technical assistance to system partners through contracts with several entities including Rutgers University Behavioral HealthCare, the Boggs Center, and Autism New Jersey. SAMHSA Grant Program Community Programs for Outreach and Intervention with Youth and Young Adults at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR -P) On September 30, 2018, SAMHSA awarded a 4 -year grant to the Children's System of Care to address youth and young adults at clinical high risk for psychosis. CSOC worked in partnership with DMHAS to develop the program, which will provide outreach and intervention for youth and young adults up to age 25, who may be experiencing prodromal symp toms of psychosis. The NJ CSOC/DMHAS partnership is well positioned to add services for youth and young adults at clinical high risk for psychosis to the already robust care continuum available throughout the state, as the program will utilize establis hed behavioral health agencies who are currently providing treatment services for persons experiencing first episode psychosis (FEP). NJ PROMISE anticipates providing intervention to approximately 150 youth and young adults across three regions annually, and more than 600 youth and young adults over the four -year grant period. Through extensive outreach, coordinated care, the use of evidence -based, evidence informed, best, and promising practices as well as the expertise of a team of professionals, partic ipants and their families will have the tools necessary to lead productive lives in their homes and communities. The project's measurable goals are to: Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 128 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 165 of 456 Reduce the percentage of youth/ young adults at clinical high risk for psychosis who become hospitalized.

Increase the overall functioning of youth and young adults at clinical high risk for psychosis, as evidenced by increased participation at school, employment, and in their communities. NJ FamilyCare Comprehensive Waiver (1115 Medicaid Comprehensive Waiver ) In 2012, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved New Jersey's 1115 Comprehensive Waiver for a five -year period with the goal of changing New Jersey's health care delivery to ensure a broader community base and person -centered continuum of care. Key changes for CSOC under the waiver authority included: Federal participation on behavioral health services for youth with severe emotional disturbance (SED); Targeted home and community -based services (HCBS) for populations of youth; In-home and community supports for children and youth with SED and/or intellectual and developmental disabilities(I/DD) and; Authority to provide and receive federal participation for services t o youth with Autism under the Autism pilot. In 2017, CMS granted New Jersey a five -year extension on the 1115 waiver (renamed NJ FamilyCare Comprehensive Demonstration) to include: Additional in -home supports for an expanded population of youth with in tellectual and developmental disabilities; Needed services including HCBS supports for an expanded population of youth with severe emotional disabilities; and Needed services and HCBS for an expanded population of youth with co -occurring developmental/ men tal health disabilities. Children's Support Services Program (CSSP) SED The Children's Support Services Program SED provides behavioral health, home and community - based services for youth under age 21 who have a serious emotional disturbance (SED) which places them at risk for hospitalization, out of home treatment, or at hospital level of care. For youth not eligible for Medicaid, this provides federal support for behavioral health services under Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 129 of 132 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 166 of 456the State Plan amendment, and home and community -based se rvices that are authorized through the children's Administrative Service Organization (PerformCare , also known in New Jersey as the Contracted System Administrator, CSA ). The program also allows for Medicaid eligibility based on SED determination for youth who have a plan of care through CMO, irrespective of parental income. It also adds new services that have been found to be critical for the success of youth. Children's Support Services Program (CSSP) Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities (I/DD) The Children's Support Services Program for youth with intellectual/developmental disabilities (I/DD) provides home and community -based services and supports to individuals under the age of 21 that meet DCF/ CSOC functional eligibility for youth with I/DD as defined by state and federal law. Youth may also have co -occurring I/DD and mental health diagnoses (I/DD -MI). For youth not eligible for Medicaid, this provides federal support for home and community -based services that are authorized through the childr en's ASO. The program also allows for Medicaid eligibility based on functional eligibility for youth who have a plan of care through CMO, irrespective of parental income. It also adds new services that have been found to be critical for the success of you th. The goals for the waivers are to: improve youth's emotional stability; maintain youth in the community and increase community integration; support youth with SED or I/DD that are transitioning into adulthood; improve youth success in a wide range of life d omains; reduce lengths of stay in out of home care settings by providing a less restrictive but medically appropriate treatment option; reduce acute hospitalization lengths of stay, episodes and repeat episodes; improve social and educational functioning; reduce incidents of juvenile justice involvement. Waiver Services Operationalized Individual Supports (Implemented SFY 2015) assist youth with I/DD with acquiring, retaining, improving, and generalizing the behavioral, self -help, socialization and adaptiv e skills necessary to function successfully in the home and community. Intensive in Community / In Home Clinical and Therapeutic Services (Implemented SFY 2015) are rehabilitative services that are not otherwise covered by the State Plan for youth with I/DD and assist family/caregiver in carrying out individual treatment/support plans and are necessary to improve the youth's independence and inclusion in his/her community. Intensive in Community / In Home Behavioral Services (Implemented SFY 2015) are rehabilitative services that are not otherwise covered by the State Plan that include a comprehensive integrated program to decrease challenging behaviors while assisting the youth in acquiring, retaining, and improving self -help, communication and adaptive skills. Respite (Implemented SFY 2016) services, including assessment and respite care planning, temporarily relieve the family/caregiver from the demands of care for the youth with I/DD.

Non-Medical Transportation (Implemented SFY 2018) provides short -term non -medical transportation for youth and families involved with CSOC's MRSS or CMO. Services are provided throughout New Jersey, although it is expected that most appointments will be within the youth's county of r esidence. Interpreter Services (implemented SFY 2017) are delivered face to face, to support providers and families in carrying out the plan of care that are not otherwise covered by the State Plan. Services must be delivered by an individual proficient in reading and speaking or signing in the language in which the youth is most comfortable communicating. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Pilot, is one component of the NJ FamilyCare Comprehensive Demonstration. This component is the same design as prior wai ver approved (10/2012 -7/31/2017). CMS will not allow any technical adjustments to be made to the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) pilot under the newly approved waiver as the state is expected to include Autism services under the State Plan. Currently, CSOC 's ASO authorizes ABA and the Managed Care Organization coordinates speech, occupational and physical therapy. Note: this component will become defunct when the Autism state plan amendment is approved by CMS. At approval, autism services will become an entitlement for NJFC enrolled youth (see below Autism state plan section). Autism Benefit as part of the NJ Medicaid State Plan Currently, some services for youth with autism are reimbursed by NJ FamilyCare through the NJ FamilyCare Comprehensive Demonstration Autism Spectrum Disorder Pilot. The services (Applied Behavioral Analysis) are authorized by CSOC's CSA and are eligible for federal participation for youth that are enrolled as a waiver participant and meet the medically necessity criteria for the service. In addition, these services are currently authorized through the CSA to non - waiver enrolled youth that meet medically necessity and are funded with state dollars only. On July 7, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS ) issued clarification and guidance of Medicaid coverage of services to children with Autism. CMS described the overarching requirement that states must arrange for and provide coverage for individuals eligible for the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagno sis and Treatment2 (EPSDT) benefit (ages 0 -21) to receive any Medicaid coverable service listed in section 1905(a) of the Act that is determined to be medically necessary to correct or ameliorate any physical or behavioral conditions. Therefore, 2 EPSDT is a Medicaid mandated program that covers screening and diagnostic services to determine physical and mental defects in individuals under the age of 21, and health care, treatment, and other measures to correct or ameliorate any defects and chronic conditions discovered, pursuant to N.J.A.C. 10:49 -18.1 and Title XIX of the Social Security Act.

This includes children with ASD. The EPSDT requirements apply to all children covered under Medicaid. Federal regulatory authorities have taken great care to ensure that services furni shed are not limited in amount, duration, or scope and are furnished to all eligible children if medically necessary. As a result, states are not permitted to limit the duration of services to designated timeframes such as years, months, days, and/or hours . In addition, states may not target subpopulations of the EPSDT population based on age, such as furnishing unique services to those children within a designated age range. States are unable to target specified age ranges within the EPSDT population becau se, in accordance with 42 CFR 440.250(b), the state plan must provide that the services available to any categorically needy beneficiary under the state plan are not less in amount, duration, and scope than those services available to any other beneficiary . Additionally, Governor Murphy allocated $17 million in FY 2019 to expand services for youth with autism. CSOC, the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (DMAHS) and a group of external stakeholders facilitated by the Center for Health C are Strategies (CHCS) met from June 2018 through October 2018 to design the elements of a state plan amendment (SPA) and a comprehensive benefit that is most advantageous to children and families. Services offered through state plan amendment will include but not be limited to therapeutic, behavioral and medical interventions such as Developmental Individual -differences Relationship (DIR)/ Floortime , Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), naturalistic, occupational, physical and speech therapy and through waive rs (respite, community inclusion). Following a public comment period, DMAHS in partnership with CSOC, and including input from external stakeholders, drafted a SPA outlining the State's proposal to provide Autism services to youth under 21. It is ant icipated that this document will be submitted to CMS no later than March 31, 2019, with the requested date of federal participation on autism services beginning January 1, 2019. DMAHS, CSOC and CHCS are currently developing the implementation plan as the current service package includes existing services ABA authorized by the CSA and occupational, physical and speech therapy provided by the Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCOs).

Narrative Question: This step should identify the unmet service needs and critical gaps in the state's current M/SUD system as well as the data sources used to identify the needs and gaps of the required populations relevant to each block grant within the state's M/SUD system. Especially for those required populations described in this document and other populations identified by the state as a priority. This step should also address how the state plans to meet the unmet service needs and gaps. A data-driven process must support the state's priorities and goals. This could include data and information that are available through the state's unique data system (including community-level data), as well as SAMHSA's data sets including, but not limited to, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), the National Facilities Surveys on Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services , and the Uniform Reporting System (URS). Those states that have a State Epidemiological and Outcomes Workgroup (SEOW) should describe its composition and contribution to the process for primary prevention and treatment planning. States should also continue to use the prevalence formulas for adults with SMI and children with SED, as well as the prevalence estimates, epidemiological analyses, and profiles to establish mental health treatment, substance use disorder prevention, and SUD treatment goals at the state level. In addition, states should obtain and include in their data sources information from other state agencies that provide or purchase M/SUD services. This will allow states to have a more comprehensive approach to identifying the number of individuals that are receiving services and the types of services they are receiving. In addition to in-state data, SAMHSA has identified several other data sets that are available to states through various federal agencies: CMS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and others. Through the Healthy People Initiative16 HHS has identified a broad set of indicators and goals to track and improve the nation's health. By using the indicators included in Healthy People, states can focus their efforts on priority issues, support consistency in measurement, and use indicators that are being tracked at a national level, enabling better comparability. States should consider this resource in their planning. 16 http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx 1 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 170 of 4561 Planning Step 2: Identify the unmet service needs and critical gaps within the current system.

State Mental Health Authority (SMHA) The State of New Jersey is geographically, demographically, culturally, and socioeconomically diverse. Identifying populations historically under -served by mental health services is vital to the SMHA's success at facilitating the wellness and recovery of all of its citiz ens. The SMHA has undertaken needs assessments to determine underserved areas for targeting RFPs and contract efforts (e.g., Outpatient Services, Communi ty Support Services ), using a myriad of data sources in order to better understand the needs and servic e gaps on a statewide basis. Examples of relevant indicators to be observed on a county level include (but are not limited to): population density, racial composition, proportions of residents age 65 and older, unemployment rates, median household income, screening center admissions, and crime rates. I. A Data Driven Process f or Identify ing Unmet Needs and Critial Gaps Data Sources - The SMHA has steadily improved its capacity to organize mental health promotion initiatives utilizing prevalence estimates and epidemiological analyses at the s tate and county levels. The data sources SMHA will continue to utilize in driving the planning for the prevention and mental health promotion initiatives include: DMHAS internal data systems such as Quarterly Contract Monitoring Report (QCMR) , Beds Enrollment Database (BEDS) , Unified S ervices Transaction Form (USTF) database, S ystem R eview C ommittee (SRC) Data, and Oracle Hospital Census Database. Data obtained from different mental health community programs funded by DMHAS. SMHA Consumer Perception of Care Survey Other State and National Data Sets Demographic Data from the US Census Bureau.

New Jersey DOH Healthcare Facility Licensing data, with which occupancy rates for psychiatric beds in general hospitals are calculated. The SMHA 's data sources in details: Quarterly Contract Monitoring Report (QCMR) Database. QCMR collects quarterly, cumulative, program -specific data from each of the service providers contracted by DMH AS via a web -based portal. It tracks data consisting of consumers served, as well as quant ifies service utilization across the mental health system. QCMR data is provided to the SMHA by 118 separate agencies on 17 different program elements for roughly 630 separate sub- program elements (e.g., a specific program element, run by specific agency and specif ic site) on a quarterly basis. The 17 program elements include Acute In tensive Family Support Services , Bilingual Bicultural Services, Career Services (e.g. Supported Employment (SE), Supported Education (SEd), and Justice Involved Services (JIS)) , Community Advocates, Designated Screening Centers (DSCs), Early Intervention and Support Services (EISS), Affiliated Emergency Services (AES), Integrated Case Management Services (ICMS), Intenstive Family Support Services (IFSS) , IOTSS, Legal Services, O utpatient Services, Programs for Assertive Community Treatment ( PACT ), Partial Care, Involuntary Outpatient Commitment (IOC), and Self-help Centers . As new program elements are added, new QCMRs are developed. The two QCMRs that have recently been implemented are QCMRs' for Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) programs for individuals with first episode psychosis and Community Support Services (CSS). These two new programs do not currently exist within the web -based QCMR portal, as is true for Supported Education, IOC, and JIS. Data for these five programs is collected separately and updated by DMHAS central office staff. But beginning with CSS, DMHAS will be working with QCMR programmers in early SFY20 to add each of these program elements into the QCMR portal, allowing for standardized and automated data collection and reporting of all DMHAS -funded programs. The QCMR historically emphasized program -level data, but as the QCMR data field layouts change over time, increasing numbers of data points related to cons umer outcomes have been included. QCMR does not collect client level data. The QCMR provides essential data for many routine reports generated by the SMHA including: DMHAS Evaluation data table for URS reporting of numbers served by program, annual Budget Briefing reports, and planning resources for the annual Consumer Perception of Care Survey. In addition, the QCMR provides reliable information for the majority of ad- hoc reports created by the Division, specifically around the topics of utilization manage ment, provider performance and the geographic distribution of available services. Beds Enrollment Database ( BEDS) . In May 2012, the SMHA began development on a web - based bed enrollment data system. BEDS is a secure web -based system designed and administe red by the SMHA to facilitate the assignment of consumers from state psychiatric hospitals into safe and appropriate community -based residential settings, in accordance with SAMHSA's Supportive Housing EBP1, the SMHA's Olmstead Page 3 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 172 of 4563 revised DMHAS Administrative Bulletin 5:113. Utilization of a web -based system provides real - time access to vacancy information and helps facilitate assignments and avoid outdated spreadsheets. Analysis of the utilization of independent (e.g. Community Support Services) vs. supervised settings (e.g. group homes and supervised apartments) allows for assessment of the Division's progress toward community integration. The system also enables planning at both the individual consumer level for placement purpo ses and system -wide for purposes of enhancements in community resources. In addition to Community Support Services and residential (i.e. group home and supervised apartment) living arrangements, DMHAS is in the process of adding short -term care facility (S TCF) placements to BEDS. This will allow for analysis and quality improvement measures geared toward improved wait times in STCF beds prior to discharge to long -term housing. For the purpose of data -driven planning, BEDS is a powerful utilization manageme nt and planning tool that will allow the SMHA to observe resource utilization, vacancy rates, and the geographic distribution of resources and housing requests. Unified Services Transaction Form (USTF) . The USTF database is an electronic client level registry originally developed in 1978 (and revised in SFY 1990) which still serves as one of the primary sources for populating the URS data tables. The current system is an Access desktop application which was rolled out in 2000 and used by all MH providers who submit their files to DMHAS each quarter. In SFY 2018, there were over 400,000 records \u2014with each record containing the potential for over 50 separate data fields. The development of a secure, web -based comprehensive client level data system (CLD) is essential at this time due to four key imperatives at the NJ Division of Mental Health Addiction Services (DMHAS): 1. To facilitate the transformation of DMHAS into a recovery oriented service organization, 2. to manage the transition of DMHAS to outcomes reporting), 3. to provide the public with more \"forward facing\" online performance data, and 4. to satisfy federal mandates of SAMHSA \u2014including reporting of data required by the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant ( CMHBG ), Mental Health National O utcome Measures (NOMS), using Client- Level Data, and Mental Health Treatment Episode Data Set (MH -TEDs). Work had begun on the development of a web- based client system during 2013- 2014, but the plan to replace the the USTF database with a Client Level Database has been met with funding and resource delay s. In addition, t he Division has been in the midst of developing another data system (NJMHAPP) for the payment of claims using state dollars under fee -for-service. Administrative block grant dollars have e nabled the Division to develop the NJMHAPP data system to track state dollars as well as eligible block grant expenditures. The development and implementation of the proposed CLD data system would greatly facilitate the reporting of URS Data tables, MH -TEDS, and Client Level NOMS, as well as sigificiantly improve the quality of ad hoc reporting and production of data dashboards. In addition to the reporting mentioned above, the SMHA will be including evidence based assessment tools in the CLD with the goa l of reporting client level outcomes as well as program level outcomes. The CLD will enable the SMHA to provide data dashboards for provider agencies as well as the SMHA senior leadership to drive planning. It will allow the SMHA to collect detailed data o n 3 http://www.state.nj.us/humanservices/dmhas/regulations/bulletins/Mental%20Health/5_11.pdf Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 4 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 173 of 4564 various target populations to help determine unmet needs. It will serve to : 1. streamline community reporting processes by providing DMHAS (and its contracted agencies) with a single source of data entry for its users \u2014thereby replacing several outdated d ata systems (e.g., the Unified Services Transaction Form (USTF), the Quarterly Contract Monitoring Report (QCMR), and the Systems Review Committee (SRC) data system) and reducing duplication of data entry, 2. provide fine -grained utilization management data that allows the Division to drill down to service use at the program level, the agency level, the county level and the client level, 3. document consumer outcome measures to evaluate program (and provider) effectiveness, 4. provide users with reliable an d meaningful data to drive and inform decision- making. With the ability to utilize encounter data from Medicaid and NJMHAPP combined , along with the data from the CLD (client level of functioning, quality of life measures, etc), the SMHA will be able to ga uge the impact of services and the cost of delivering those services. The SMHA would be able to significantly enhance its planning efforts and capacity for data informed decision making. It would be able to prepare a comprehensive need assessment inclusive of county based needs, barriers, critical gaps, and reporting on target populations. The development of the CLD would eliminate the need for the QCMR database described above, the Systems Review Committee (SRC) dataset described below, and the current USTF described above. In doing so, the SMHA would be eliminating the disparate data systems that currently exist in the DMHAS and replace them with one client level database that will function as a client registry and will be able to report the aggregate d ata of the QCMR and the quality, volume and capacity data of the SRC. Systems Review Committee (SRC) Datasets . SRC are a series of linked MS -Excel documents submitted monthly from 32 Short Term Care Facilities (STCFs) and 23 Designated Screening Centers (DSCs) . By regulation, SRC data is collected and reviewed monthly by localized county specific committees comprised of acute care providers and governmental staff. These SRC processes include review of trends related to volume, capacity, referral patterns, system flow, length of stay and disposition. The SRC dataset provides program/agency -specific data that is the aggregate of each program's consumers served within a given month. The conversion of the SRC data submission files (from STCF and DSC provider agencies) into single 'flat files' has improved the ability of DMHAS staff to efficiently and accurately querty SRC data. Oracle Hospital Census Database. Oracle Hospital Census database is the central information system used by the SMHA for storing client -specific records on consumers admitted into New Jersey's four inpatient adult psychiatric hospitals. To keep up with the flow of consumers entering, and exiting the SMHA's state hospitals, this data is updated on a daily basis by hospital personnel. Becaus e Oracle is scalable, the Hospitals Census database has been modified slightly at each of the SMHA's psychiatric hospitals to meet not only the overa rching needs of the SMHA, but also to meet the unique needs of each hospital. The scalable nature of the Ho spital Census database has allowed the SMHA to also develop modules specific to data requirements imposed by the Olmstead Settlement Agreement, including a n \"Individual Discharge Needs Assessment\" designed to identify barriers and consumers needs upon disc harge . Although Oracle provides client -level data, this information is aggregated on a daily basis to provide critical reporting at the hospital level as well as the statewide level. Both the INDA and Oracle hospital census database provide a list of canne d (i.e.pre -programmed) reports allowing for hospital and Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 5 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 174 of 4565 central office users to summarize and examine hospital census data in an aggregated and/or snapshot view of over 3,000 consumers served each year. The Hospital Census database is used by the Division for utilization managemen t; Olmstead monitoring, planning and evaluation; and reporting of URS data. Consumer Perception of Care Survey . Since 2011, the SMHA Consumer Perception of Care Survey s have been distributed in the summer /fall of each year to a r epresentative sample of adult consumers of all community -based, non- acute programs4. The survey results are reported in the annual CMH BG Implementation Report. An unmodified version of the Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program (MHSIP) Adult Survey (Draft Version 1.2, February 17, 2006)5 is used as the survey instrument , with the addition of ten questions related to primary health, from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey6. Each non -acute mental health program contracted by t he SMHA, serve s as sampling stratum. Agency program coordinators are instructed by the SMHA on techniques of random sampling and bias reduction. Consumers are empowered to participate in this survey with little/no intervention from direct care staff. The results of this survey are s tudied and used to guide the SMHA's planning efforts for future initiatives and resource allocation. The information gleaned from these survey efforts is used to populate the relevant URS Data Tables, as well as inform the SMHA o n the quality of community -based, state funded mental health services, as perceived by the sample of consumers responding to these surveys. This survey data is helpful at looking at needs among specific program elements and at service needs in different parts of the state . Between 2011 and 2018 the average General Satisfaction score is 97.8% +/ - 4.9%7. First Episode Psychosis (FEP) System. DMHAS is currently working on a data collection system to capture client level demographic and outcome data on partici pants in the FEP program . Before this system is completed, DMHAS has a data collection tool to capture demographic and outcome data elements using an Excel spreadsheet. The data is collected every 90 days and analyzed to track the progress of CSC clients w ho have received services. C lient measures include client referral source ; age; gender ; race; p sychiatric and medical hospitalization s; psychotropic medication adherence; c o-cccurring substance use disorder ; discharge and r e- admission ; insurance status ; language , and g lobal functioning by MIRECC GAF scale. In addition to the CSC data spreadsheet, CSC programs submit a quarterly progress report to DMHAS . The quarterly progress report outlines community outreach progress and any problems with the client service model, client referral demographic data, and other services on the client population. Other Statewide and Nationwide Data Sets The SMHA uses several independent datasets, alongside national and statewide datasets to shed light on goals, priorities and success . Specifically, this constellation of datasets is most 4 Prior to the 2011 survey, the SMHA administered survey questionnaires to all consumers of one specific program element , which varied annually. 5 http://media.wix.com/ugd/186708_3175909b8c1640988e6bee6edf865edd.doc?dn=%22URS_MHSIP_Adult_Survey2.doc%22 6 http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/questionnaires/pdf -ques/2011brfss.pdf 7 Based on the average General Satisfaction scores of all adult consumer perception of care survey data submitted in URS Table 11, from 2011 to 2018 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 6 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 175 of 4566 commonly used to identify counties that are most appropriate (in terms of need and access to mental health services) for new community services and Requests for Proposals ( RFPs ). Additional statewide and county -specific data is obtained from the US Census Bureau (e.g. http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml ) to inform comparisons of population density, residential characteristics, racial diversity, unemployment rate, age distribution, household income, poverty levels and other factors helpful in determining need. The New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development also generates important economic and employment data ( http://lwd.dol.state.nj.us/labor/lpa/content/njsdc_index.html ) which is often used by the SMHA in making inter -county comparisons of economic need. Data on crime statistics in New Jersey is compiled by the NJ State Police, and its reports http://www.state.nj.us/njsp/info/stats.html) are utilized by the SMHA in obtaining a clear picture of county stressors and crime rates . National data is often examined by the SMHA to shed light on New Jersey mental health efforts, relative to similar states. SAMSHA, through its compilation of Behavioral Health Baro meter (https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/2015_New -Jersey_BHBarometer.pdf ) and URS data tables, and state level detail reports provide useful information in this regard (https://www.samhsa.gov/data/report/2018- uniform -reporting -system -urs-output -tables ). The National Research Institute (NRI) of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) is another source that the SMHA consults on a regular basis for national mental health data ( http://www.nri -incdata.org/ ). The state's priorities and goals are supported through a mix of data -driven processes, political mandates, and legal obligations. Initiatives such as the Involuntary Outpatient Commitment (IOC) Program are mandated (and legislated into being) by state gover nment. The myriad of Olmstead -related activities are conducted under the aegis of the Olmstead settlement agreement. The existence of such programs is determined by legal/legislative processes, but the execution and implementation are based on data and qua ntitative analysis. Local data identifies the need, statewide data determines the presence of existing relevant resources, national inference provide guidance on the shape such programming might take, and program data evaluates the degree to which such int erventions are successful. II. Unmet Needs and Criti cal Gaps and How to Meet the Identified Unmet Service Needs and Gaps New Jersey currently uses the federal definition of SED and SMI : Children with SED refers to persons from birth up to age 18 and adults with SMI refers to persons age 18 and over; who (1) currently meet or at any time during the past year has met criteria for a mental disorder - including within developmental and cultural contexts - as specified within a recognized diagnostic classifi cation system (e.g., most recent editions of DSM, ICD, etc.), and (2) display functional impairment, as determined by a standardized measure that impedes progress towards recovery and substantially interferes with or limits the person's role or functioning in family, school, employment, relationships, or community activities.

According to figures released by the United States Census Bureau , the 2018 adult population of New Jersey was 6,948,646. The size of the New Jersey child population was 1,528,702. Using the SAMHSA's SMI prevalence rate among person s 18 and older (5.4%) the estimated number of adult s with SMI in New Jersey in 2018 was 375,227. Using the upper SMI limit of 7.1%, the estimated number of adults with SMI in New Jersey in 2018 was 493,354. Accordingly, using the lower SMI limit of 3.7%, t he estimated number of SMI adults in New Jersey in 2018 was 257,100. Estimates of SMI, SED, and General Population of New Jersey, 2010, 2011, 2016 and 2018 Year Total Adult Population Total Adult SMI (5.4%) Adult SMI Lower Limit of Estimate (3.70%) Adult SML Upper Limit of Estimate (7.10%) Total Children Total Children SED (8%) Total New from http://lwd.dol.state.nj.us/labor/lpa/dmograph/est/est_index.html#state The 2018 estima te is from https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/NJ/PST045218 According to URS Table 2a, a total of 3 41,808 unduplicated consumers ages 18 and over received services in programs provided or funded by the SMHA in FY 2018 . The SMHA served 132,561 unduplicated adult consumers with SMI (refer to URS data table 1 4a) in FY 2018. That was 35.3% of the total estimated SMI adult consumers in New Jersey (375,227) . Also shown in URS data table 1 4a, out of the total 132,561 unduplicated adult consumers wit h SMI served by the SMHA in FY 2018, 65,466 (49.4%) were ethnic minorities (and those who did not report a racial affiliation) . The SMHA will ensure that ethnic minority population continue to have access to quality mental health services in New Jersey. The demand for SMHA -funded community programs for people aged 55 and older has continued to grow in New Jersey. This population is considered older adults in mental health services. Rising enrollments are consistent with a general increase in the populatio n size of older adult state residents. In 2010, New Jersey had 2,232,158 residents who were 55 years of age or older. The US Census estimates for 2015 is 2,523,416 New Jersey adults aged 55 and older . This represent ed an increase of 291,258 from 2010 to 2015 (an increase of 13.0%). In 11/19/2020 8 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 177 of 4568 Department of Labor9 reported that there were 2,635,408 residents aged 55 and older . This is an 4.4% increase from 2015. Persons who are SMI are the primary target population for SMHA funded services. However, the SMHA also prioritizes services to persons with special access needs, including older adults, ethnic and linguistic minorities, and individuals with co -occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders, hearing impairment, developmental disabilities, a nd criminal justice involvement. SMHA uses a few different approaches to determine unmet mental health services need s and gaps for New Jersey . They include 1) community surveys (e.g., direct survey, key informant), 2) local, state, and national data , which include the client level data and 3) the input from different stakeholders, such as members of the Behavioral Health Planning Council . With the aid of these tools, t he SMHA has identified unmet need s in these target populations : SMI/SED, homeless people, older adults, LGBT Q populations, women with maternal depression, and persons with past criminal involvement. I n addition, the SMHA faces the urgent needs for developing a client level data base. The current situation and the future plans for addressing the needs are described. the SMHA has identified unmet needs in these target populations: SMI/SED, homeless people, older adults, LGBTQ populations, women experiencing maternal depression and psychosis , and persons with past criminal involvement. Homeless Ad ults. The SMHA is the recipient of the federally funded PATH program, which is matched with state funding. The SMHA contracts with 22 non-profit agencies to operate 25 PATH programs within the state's 21 counties. The target population is homeless adults or those at risk of homelessness who have a serious mental illness, including those with co- occurring substance use disorders who are not currently engaged in and are resistant to mental health and other community support services. Programs for homeless ad ults are described in Planning Step 1 under Criterion 4. The most critical gaps and unmet needs identified by PATH providers are: 1) lack of shelters in some counties and not enough emergency shelter beds in comparison to the number of individuals who nee d temporary housing in other counties. 2) The lack of available affordable, safe, permanent housing; 3) There is no way to pay for shelter stay if an individual does not qualify for General Assistance/Emergency Assistance because PATH dollars cannot be used to support emergency shelters. The SMHA has created some housing for the population at risk for homelessness , but sustained efforts are needed to combat the housing problem. Through its Olmstead Initiatives, SMHA has developed s upportive housing beds for individuals with SMI who are at risk for hospitalization and/or homelessness. Between 2010 and 2014, the total number of beds to be created in the community for consumers at -risk for psychiatric hospitalization and/or homeless was 370. The actual number created by DMHAS over the five- year period was 495. DMHAS exceeded this target for At Risk bed development by 125 beds, or 33.8%. DMHAS has also created an additional 19 beds for the at -risk population during SFY 2015 and 20 during SFY 2016, thus creating a total of 534 beds from 2010 to 2016. Two Hundred placements will be developed in SFY 2020. 9 https://www.nj.gov/labor/lpa/dmograph/est/nj_single2017.xlsx Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 9 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 178 of 4569 Older Adults. In 2011 the SMHA saw a need to develop specialized services to assist screening centers and nursing homes to respond to an increasing number of older adults with behavioral problems. In 2012, the SMHA awarded a contract for the development of a program to provide specialized clinical consultation, assessment, treatment and intervention to older adults who were at risk for presentation to emergency ro oms for psychiatric hospitalization. Trinitas Regional Medical Center in Elizabeth, New Jersey was the recipient and has been administering this Statewide Clinical Outreach Program for the Elderly (S -COPE), which is fully funded by NJ - DMHAS and has been in operation since April 2012. Prior to S -COPE's inception, individuals with dementia were more likely to be referred to mental health crisis screening centers and emergency rooms, and many were subsequently being admitted to inpatient psychiatric facilities , including state psychiatric hospitals. With S -COPE involvement, many of these older adults were referred to S -COPE, and diverted from screening centers and hospitalizations. In 2018 there were 921 referrals to S -COPE and 189 were diverted from screening c enters. Services to older adults are described in Planning Step 1 under Criterion 4. Services for the LGBT Q Population. Since 1985, DMHAS has had the commitment to improve services to individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds, including LGBT Q. The DMHAS defines cultural competence as: \"... the ability to honor and respect the beliefs, languages, interpersonal styles and behaviors of individuals and families receiving services, as well as staff members who are providing such services. Cultural competence is a dynamic, ongoing developmental process that requires a long term commitment and is achieved over time\" (HHS 2003a, p- . 12). The impetus to grow this initiative further and address these system needs began with the 2015 reformation of DMHAS' multi -cultural activities into a Multi- cultural Services Group (MSG.) The MSG has developed a process for systems assessment that will begin with all contract agencies surveying their existing planning and service delivery to diverse populations. As the SMHA revi ews the results of those surveys, areas of gaps in service, and needs for technical assistance (TA) will be identified. Beginning in early 2016, TA groups were held in the north and south to assist agencies in formulating multi -cultural plans. Those plans ha ve become a part of the SMHA's contracting process in FY 2017, and followed up through DMHAS Multi - cultural Training Centers each year to ensure that the plans continue to grow. In Fiscal Year 2018, the DMHAS committed funding and resources to hire a Mul ticultural Diversity and Statewide Consultant. This individual provides consultation, technical assistance, development of a training curriculum, and services as a statewide resource for the DMHAS contracted mental health and addiction providers on issues relating to culture, language and diversity in the DMHAS system of care. Moving on Maternal Depression (MOMD) Initiative . In August 2018, New Jersey was one of three states awarded a request for proposal from the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) through its MOMD initiative. The 18- month initiative provides technical assistance, which is administered in the form of monthly calls with CLASP and other participating states; site visits with CLASP; and a conference with other states on promising practi ces toward serving populations with maternal depression. New Jersey's efforts under this initiative come from a collaborative which is co -lead by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DHS - DMHAS) and the Department of Health (DOH), and inclusive of the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (DHS -Medicaid) the Department of Children and Families Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 10 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 179 of 45610 (DCF), and three maternal health consortia consisting of the Partnership for Maternal Child Health, Central Jersey Family Health Consortia , and South Jersey Perinatal Cooperative. The collaborative, known as the MOMD Core Team, has, as its focus, three individual goals for improving its ability to serve mothers with maternal depression. Each of these goals is the focus of its own subcommitte e of core team members, which meets monthly to discuss progress, share insights, and discuss any questions or concerns arising from their efforts. The core team subsequently reports on these meetings to CLASP on monthly calls and receives feedback and consultation where necessary. The three goals comprising New Jersey's MOMD initiative consist of 1) Enhanced Data Capacity related to examination of maternal depression in New Jersey; 2) Increased Access to Services related to maternal depression; and 3) Reduc ed Racial, Ethnic, and Socioeconomic Disparities in utilization of maternal depression services. Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) . Early Serious Mental Illness, which includes First Episode Psychosis (FEP), has been a rising concern with the young adult population in the state of New Jersey. According to the 2016 SAMHSA National Survey on Drug Use and Health, in New Jersey the estimated prevalence of Serious Mental Illness rose from 3.77% to 5.36% in young adults between the ages of 18 -25 between 2008 an d 201610. Coordinated Specialty Care is a collaborative, recovery -oriented approach to treating First Episode Psychosis based on the Recovery after an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) Model. As of 2014, there were 49 states and territories with progr ams that comprehensively serve the FEP population using the RAISE model11. Over 261 FEP treatment programs are currently active at various phases of operation. States use a combination of Mental Health Block Grant (MHBG) 10% set-aside funds, other MHBG funds, and/or other grants to support CSC programs around the country. Twenty -five states and territories have provided additional state funding to support FEP treatment programs in addition to the MHBG set -aside (not including state Medicaid matches). States are also required to measure the efficacy of CSC though federal data reporting requirements. The reporting requirements are: identification , intake, and enrollment ; improved symptoms ; improved functioning (including global functioning, employment, school participation, legal involvement, living situation, and social connectedness) ; physical health ; program involvement ; substance use ; suicidality ; psychiatric hospitalization ; use of emergency rooms ; and p rescription adherence and side effects . New Jersey C SC programs were implemented in November 2016. As of the end of State Fiscal Year 2019, the CSC program s have served over 266 clients total that prompted an expansion of service per agency from serving 35 clients to 70. An increase of clinical staff from 5 .2 FTE to 6.8 FTE was also added to accomadate the increased client service. The increase in the block 10 SAM HSA .

The success of the CSC program s has allowed for DMHAS to cover the \"continuum of care\" with regard to First Episode Psychosis. In addition to the CSC program DMHAS has taken a grant co -lead with the Children's System of Care (CSOC ) for the Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR -P)/NJ -PROMISE program to serve youths and adults who are experiencing the prodromal phase of psychosis. This provides evidence- based interventions to prevent the onset of psychosis or lessen the severity of psychotic disorder s for individuals not more than 25 years old, at clinical high risk for psychosis. Additionally, DMHAS is assessing the options for a stepped care model for those who either complete the 2 years of service in the CSC program or fall out of the range of CSC program inclusion criteria. With over 200 CSC programs across 46 states there is now a growing need for transitional programs to support the FEP population. New research has shown that many clients struggle to maintain superior outcomes after CSC12. Evidence also has shown that shortening the duration of untreated psychosis by limiting gaps in service can have a positive impact on long - term outcomes for the FEP population13. Transitional programs will provide clinical stability through reducing external triggers after care as well as a continuation of client medication motoring and referral networks that provide external community supports for FEP clients. That is why some states now have placed an emphasis on connecting clients to the best possible ongoing treatment and support services, whether formal or informal to have better long -term positive outcomes post -CSC. The EASA program in Oregon has begun to use the transitional FEP model where their FEP population has benefited from its servi ces. A Stepped Care Model Approach will expand the current FEP model to provide the opportunity for FEP clients to titrate up or down in the level of service continuum while still remaining connected to the community provider, prescriber, and clinician. Service for Those With Criminal B ackgrounds . DMHAS funds 15 mental health Justice Involved Services (JIS) programs and several other criminal justice initiatives. DMHAS is involved in very active collaborations with the Judiciary, Office of the Attorney General, local law enforcement, State Parole Board and Department of C orrections. JIS is provided to a diverse mix of consumers, male and female as well as individuals of Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Asian and Asian Indian backgrounds and from many different countries. The SMHA has been providing Justice Involved Services since 2000. SMHA funded JIS services and criminal justice initiatives include , but are not limited to , Pre-booking Diversion, Post- D and Veter ans Assi stance Initiative (VAI).

The SMHA funds JIS programs in fifteen New Jersey counties. Additional resources are needed to establish JIS programs in the remaining six counties. Both the Municipal Court Liaison program and the Prosecutor Diversion Program are in limited counties. Additional resources will be needed to expand them in all 21 counit es. In addition, many of the existing JIS programs need additional staff to handle the increased population of probationers coming from the NJ court system. These JIS programs are the infrastructure to which additional resources can be directed to assist w ith re -entry from state prison and linkage for State Parole Board parolees to needed mental health services. Pre-booking diversion. Pre-booking diversion typically involves a police based intervention to avoid arrest for non- criminal, non- violent offense s. Police are trained to identify and de -escalate situations involving consumers and diverting to mental health crisis or pre -crisis services. Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) is a local initiative designed to improve the way law enforcement and the communit y respond to people experiencing mental health crises. DMHAS funds the CIT Center of Excellence through M ental Health Association of S outhwest New Jersey . The Center facilitated the development of new county CIT efforts. Presently sixteen of twenty -one counties as well as the NJSP provide training to law enforcement, dispatcher and mental health staff in CIT. These counties offer the training to other counties and municipalities as well as their own. Post-booking Diversion. Post booking diversion i nvolves intervening so that consumers are released from detention earlier than they otherwise would be; released on their own recognizance or released from jail with mental health intervention and treatment conditions or helping to avoid detention. Superior Court . One form of post booking diversion has been formally accomplished in NJ through Prosecutor Diversion Programs. Prosecutor Offices identify a defendant who has a serious mental illness confirmed by the MH JIS program who arranges for mental health and other services. These become a condition of a pleas bargain or dismissal of the indictment. Municipal Court . DMHAS funds a Municipal Court Liaison (MCL) Program which has been working directly with the Jersey City Municipal Courts; they have a case manage r/municipal court liaison, stationed at the Municipal Court who provides individual consultations to the judges and attorneys, upon request. This often results in diversion to treatment which the liaison facilitates. DMHAS also funds a similar program for Atlantic City. The city of Newark has a plea court which arranges for needed services post -plea. Asbury Park has been funding a social worker who provides similar liaison services for many years. The DMHAS, working with the Administrative Office of the C ourts (AOC) continues to expand the availability of the MCL to include two to three municipalities within Passaic, Essex, Ocean, Monmouth, Mercer, Camden, Gloucester and Cumberland counties. The JIS programs will be providing the case management. The effor t is ongoing with additional municipalities expected to be included as DMHAS resources are identified.

Re-entry services (Forensic Case Management) are referrals from county correctional facilities . Programs have between 1 to 2 case managers who interview and enroll potential candidate while in jail, provide pre -release planning and then successful linkage and coordination to mental health and other social/community services. No psychiatric or treatment services are directly provided by the programs but rather link existing mental health services. Counties include: Atlantic, Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Cumberland, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Monmouth, Morris (also included some county funding), Middlesex, Mercer (also included county funding), Passaic, Ocean, and Union. However, as a result of Criminal Justice Reform, the number of inmates in the county jails have been reduce by up to 20%, with upwards of 90% staying no more than 24 - 48 hours. This has resulted in a reduction of referrals to the JIS programs. Veterans Assistance Initiative (VAI) . VAI program provides services to veterans / service members who get arrested and needs linkage and coordination with services through the local Veterans Service Offices of the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMAVA) . DMHAS licensed providers provide case management services and also treatment services as needed. The Veterans Assistance Project is a combined effort of the Judiciary, the New Jersey Department of Military and V eterans Affairs and the New Jersey Department of Human Services, Division of Mental Health & Addiction Services (DMHAS). All vicinages in New Jersey have the VAI . Chief Justice's Interbranch Advisory/Implementation Committee for Mental Health Initiatives . The DMHAS was represented on the Chief Justice's Interbranch Advisory Committee for Mental Health Initiatives since 2010. In 2012, the committee presented it s report to the Supreme Court which accepted its recommendations which included the expansion of t he Prosecutor Diversion Program, Municipal Court Liaison program and CIT. In December of 2014 the Chief Justice appointed the Interbranch Implementation Committee , the first recommendation of the report, to begin to operationalize the report's recommendati ons. The committee is co -chaired by an individual from DMHAS and a Judge from the AOC. The Implementation Committee has been working to operationalize the 17 recommendation of the report. Much has been done in educational activities on mental health of Judges and court staff, knowledge transfer at Superior and Municipal court conferences and enclaves. The Implementation Committee working with the Judiciary public information established a mental health resource page with links to mental health information a nd resources on the Judiciary webpage, NJ Courts Online. Gaps Observed by the New Jersey Behavioral Health Planning Council The partnership of community stakeholders with the SMHA is critical to the success of the Division. The New Jersey Behavioral H ealth Planning Council (NJBHPC, a.k.a., \"The Planning Council\") is the primary (but by no means sole) voice of the community. Through the participation of the Planning Council, and its Advocacy subcommittee, the Division has obtained the following guidance on service needs and gaps within the current system of care. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 14 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 183 of 45614 Older Adult Populations. The Planning Council expressed an interest in continued improvement on the availability of behavioral health services for older adults. Specific areas of interest inclu de the Divisions's Medicaid Managed Long Term Services and Supports (MLTSS) , and the need for inpatient psychiatric hospitalization services for seniors, following the closure of the Hagedorn State Psychiatric Hospital. DMHAS recently posted a new request for proposals (RFPs) for older adults to educate them on the use of alternative pain management strategies rather than reliance on opiate prescriptions. Barriers to Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) . Planning Council members expressed some interest in the possible role of transportation barriers and homelessness on the delivery of MAT . Transportation barriers (especially in more rural parts of southern and northwestern New Jersey) are found to limit access to sites where MAT is offered. The SSA is working with its providers on increasing awareness among consumers about the use of public transportation, to encourage its use. The SMHA's PATH program is fostering awareness among providers about the efficacy of MAT. Members of the Planning Council (especiall y those in the southern part of the state) expressed a need for additional hospital diversion programs . The SMHA will be examining this issue in SFY2020. Training of Front Line Staff on Community Resources. The Advocacy Subcommittee of the Planning Counci l is currently examining differential levels of training and awareness of community -based resources among front -line behavioral health workers. The Division is working to improve this via: public presentations at the meetings of the Planning Council, and increased collaboration with county -based Mental Health Planner s and their offices. Increased attention to the knowledge base of front -line staff at contracted agencies . Members of the Council have anecdotally reported inconsistent levels of knowledge among front -line staff members of behavioral health agencies which may lead to consumers and families receiving less - than-accurate or complete information on available community -based resources. The SMHA and SSA will continue to encourage proper staff training among all contracted agencies, and also encourages providers, consumers and families to contact their respective county -based mental health administrators for the fullest, most current information on locally -available resources. Resources for Youth leavi ng Juvenille Detention Centers . Members of the Planning Council who represent the NJ Juvenille Justice Commission (JJC) report a need for increased recovery environments for children leaving juvenile detention facilities.

Obtaining reliable substance abuse treatment need es timates is critical to the state's ability to promote a rational planning and resource allocation process. The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services ( DMHAS ) employs a variety of scientifically - valid methods for estimating substance abuse treatme nt needs. Primary among these are 1) surveys, 2) social indicator analysis, and 3) \"synthetic\" statistical estimation techniques, called modeling. Our methodologies also allow us to determine need at the county level. This information is important for th e planning and development of new substance abuse prevention and treatment services. Needs assessment data are incorporated into our RFPs for developing new substance abuse and treatment services , are incorporated into funding formulas for distribution to our counties per Alcoholism, Education, Rehabilitation and Enforcement Fund1 (AEREF ) legislation and utilized in the Division's applications for federal grants . Various social indicators that have been demonstrated to have a relationship to substance abuse are employed in our relative needs assessment methodology , such as , mortality from alcohol and drug poisoning, treatment admissions, child abuse and neglect, DUI arrests and drug law vi olations. The SSA utilizes numerous data sources, e.g., national, state, SSA data systems and surveys to inform its need assessment and planning processes. The SSA uses a variety of methodologies such as large -scale population- based surveys (NJ Household Survey ; Middle School Risk and Protective F actors Survey) ; targeted surveys such as Older Adults, Veterans ; relative needs assessment ; synthetic estimation such as capture- recapture; and social indicator analysis . in order to develop it needs assessment st rategies. For 23 years, New Jersey has used a household survey to estimate: 1) the prevalence of both legal and illegal substance use, 2) alcohol treatment need and 3) unmet treatment demand. The SSA also utilizes Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for the spatial visualization of social service needs and advanced analytic techniques such as multiple regression, logistic regression, survi val analysis and structural equation modeling. 1.Data Driven Planning Process Data Sources Used t o Identify Needs and Gaps The SSA use s a wide variety of data sources in its needs assessment process in order to identify needs and gaps across the full continuum of care . These include: SSA Information Systems 1 The AEREF legislation refers to P.L.1983, c.531, amended by Chapter 51 of P.L.1989.

Also, utilizing Federal data allows New Jersey to examine its state performance in comparison to national data. Data Collection Systems Since the SSA promotes the use of data to drive its planning, there are several key IT systems that are in strumental in achieving this goal and are described below. Depending on the system, information is able to be reported at the client, program, financial, provider, and encounter level. Information systems exist for treatment, prevention, fiscal management and billing data. These systems provide needed data for SABG and TEDS reporting, needs assessment, evaluation and planning processes. Other new systems allow for the collection of outcome data and performance incentive payments. New Jersey Substance Abuse Monitoring System . The client level data system, known as the New Jersey Substance Abuse Monitoring System (NJSAMS) was developed and imple mented in 2005 by the SSA to be a real -time, web -based substance abuse treatment data collection and reporting system. The system is required to be used by all licensed substance abuse treatment providers in New Jersey, regardless of whether or not they c ontract with the SSA. It collects basic demographic, substance use, financial, clinical and service information on all clients enrolled and served in New Jersey's substance abuse treatment system. Encounter data are collected and reported for services that may have different payers. In 2018 there were 89,629 admissions to treatment. The system consists of numerous modules and contains all the clinical assessments providers are required to complete. There are 288 licensed providers reporting on NJSAMS, representing 439 sites with 2884 active users There are also 190 Intoxicated Driver Resource Center (IDRC) affiliated providers representing 237 sites and 75 active users. NJSAMS was developed over time under the initial auspices of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT). The purpose was to develop the state's capacity to use web- based information technology for the collection and reporting of data necessary to meet Federal Performance Partnership Grant (PPG) and G PRA reporting requirements. NJSAMS was developed in response to the need for: timelier reporting on substance abuse treatment episodes, better monitoring of client outcomes, quality improvement, better client placement, and tracking of treatment through the continuum of care. The NJSAMS website is hosted by the Rutgers University Computer Center under a Memorandum of Agreement with the SSA. It is a secure web-based system designed to collect confidential health information and is HIPAA and 42CFR complia nt. A major IT accomplishment was the complete re -architecture of NJSAMS, which was originally written in classic ASP and included numerous webpages making data entry slow. Work began on this project in September 2011 and the new system was successfully launched mid -November Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 20 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 189 of 4562013. The NJSAMS includes the latest Addiction Severity Index V.5, the Level of Care Index (LOCI -3), DSM -5, as well as additional modules that can collect further information on client care and needs. The system is capable of producing the CSAT National Outcome Measures (NOMs) and generates the data needed for Provider Performance Reports. Data from NJSAMS are used to fulfill Block Grant reporting requirements and are also submitted quarterly to the Treatment Episode Data System (TED S). The system contains nearly 1000 data elements and over 1 million records, dating back to 2006. Fiscal Intermediary MIS. A Fiscal Agent Billing system contract was awarded to the Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) through an open competitive bid. This system went live July 1, 2010. The CSC system is a web- based billing system for all of the SSA's fee -for-service (FFS) . The amount of funding dedic ated to these initiatives was approximately $72 million for FY2019 and $71 million is available for FY2020. Providers submit a request via a web service to CSC for authorization approval then submit their claims through the CSC system for payment. Detailed service data is input ted which includes the CPT code. In CY 2018, there were 22,393 FFS admissions out of 89,629 total admissions. CSC and the SSA have developed an automated interface with NJSAMS to link services data reported in NJSAMS which correspond to the claim for payment. Approximately 1 million claims are processed each year. All the CSC billing data tables, approximately 76, are transferred to NJSAMS on a nightly basis to the SSA's server. This allows the SSA capability to analyze detailed encounter data. This information is easily linked to NJSAMS data so service utilization patterns can be analyzed by client characteristics and levels of care. Prevention Outcomes Management System . The web -based Prevention Outcomes Management System (POMS) collects process data on evidence- based substance abuse prevention services that are delivered in New Jersey. This system went live in August 2009 and has been enhanced since that time. All New Jersey substance abuse prevention providers that receive SSA contracts are required to use the system for data reporting. POMS includes two modules that collect county -based prevention coalition a nd education data. The system supports download of 1 -6 reports per module, and has 113 password- registered agency users (representing 25 agencies and 88 grants), 5 administrators, and 2 system administrators. Contracted agency users report data into POMS via: (1) Environmental Module, and (2) Curriculum -based Module. The Environmental Module, deployed in March 2016, includes 10 items. It collects priority -specific data on implementation of CSAP strategies and engagement with community sectors. It also measures progress on: (1) the use of environmental strategies, (2) the development and enforcement of policies (and laws/ordinances) to: (a) Reduce Underage Drinking, (b) Reduce use of Illegal Substances, (c) Reduce Prescription Misuse Across the Lifespan, and (d) Reduce use of New and Emerging Drugs. The Environmental Module also collects data on media campaigns, public service announcements, and information that is shared with lawmakers, schools, and businesses. Quarterly reports for the Environmental Module include summary data for each item of the questionnaire. These reports are used for program monitoring and evaluation.

It allows users to track participant attendance, retention, and program completion levels. Curriculum -based data entry includes: (1) type of service, (2) target audienc e, (3) priority, (4) curriculum/program name, (5) county of service, (6) date of service, (7) # of individuals/families in attendance, and (8) applicable CSAP strategy. Curriculum -based reports include participant demographic data by county, priority, strategy, and curriculum. These reports are used for program monitoring. Contract Information Management System. The Contract Information Management System (CIMS) is a web -based, paperless contract processing system that providers use to submit their contr act actions . CIMS went live July 1, 2010 for renewal contracts which included the electronic submission of the Annex B (budget). On January 1, 2011 the system went live for the Annex A and Programmatic Requirements. The four main areas CIMS was designed t o address are: ensure compliance with Department of Human Services ( DHS ) contracting policies provide more accountability for the utilization of state funds improve transparency and tracking of SSA contracting develop a more efficient process for submit ting, reviewing and approving contract documents Clinician Roster Information System. The Clinician Roster Information System (CRIS) supports the collection, review, and maintenance of provider agency clinical and medical staff information to ensure that each approved agency site meets licensure requirements for counselor credentialing as required by SSA regulations. Participating agencies are responsible for entering and maintaining up- to-date staff information through an accessible web -based portal. The system also facilitates reporting on systems -wide adherence to licensure requirements . The system was piloted in December 2011 and deployed in January 2012. All outpatient providers are required to use the system and residential providers were encouraged to begin using it prior to the adoption of the SSA's Residential Regulations which occ urred in July 2013. The system will begin to be utilized more strategically by the DMHAS Workforce Coordinator to help better identify workforce training needs. Performance Incentive Payment System (PIPS). PIPS is a new system designed to track the attain ment of key outcomes for participants in the Prison Intensive Recovery Treatment and Support Program (PIRTS). The information is linked to client demographic , encounter and clinical information so that factors that impact the attainment of outcomes can be determined. Maternal Wrap Around System (MWRAPS). MWRAPS is a new system that has been developed to capture information and outcomes on women who are participating in the MWRAP program. The data system will also be adapted to accommodate information on the women participating in our SEI/NAS program. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 22 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 191 of 456Opioid Overdose Recovery Program System (OORPS). A data collection system has been designed to collect detailed information on clients who are brought to the emergency department after being reversed with nal oxone. Information is collected on patients, the follow -up provided by the Recovery Specialists and Patient Navigators, and the outcome of the visit. As a result of our IT and data collection systems, t he SSA can report any of its data at the client level (demographic, clinical, financial, encounter, etc.). Currently it reports on all Treatment Episode Data System (TEDS) items, which includes the System Data Set (SDS), the Minimum Data Set (MDS) and the Supplemental Data Set (SuDS). The SSA has been repor ting TEDS data through NJSAMS for many years. The Fiscal Agent system allows the SSA to determine costs for episodes of care and by specific services. The new systems allow for reporting outcomes on four new programs: M -WRAP, SEI/NAS , PIRTS and OORP at multiple points in time, rather than only a t admission and discharge. 2. Need Assessment Overview Over the years, the SSA has performed regular statewide needs assessments for substance abuse prevention and treatment. Information from general and special populations surveys combined with treatment utilization data from the New Jersey Substance Abuse M onitoring System (NJSAMS), as well as the application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) methodology using Arcview for visual data presentations, provides the SSA with data to assess both service needs and delivery capacities which drive its SAPT Block Grant Application, its statewide strategic planning, and its multi- year county comprehensive planning. Assessing the well -being of community health through social indicators has been a long -standing concern to the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment ( CSAT). To meet this objective, CSAT has encouraged the use of social indicators to assess social and health risks related to substance misuse in order to inform policy makers. Following the Social Indicators Core Protocol guidelines provided by CSAT, the S SA developed the NJ Chartbook of Substance Abuse Related Social Indicators . The Social Indicators Chartbook is intended to identify social and health problems directly or indirectly related to substance use and to aid in the assessment of needs for treatme nt and prevention services. This is achieved, in part, by using key social indicators outlined in the core protocol by CSAT, and by identifying risk and protective factors affecting health outcomes. Summary analysis of the core indicators is presented using census data, criminal justice data and substance abuse treatment admissions data. Additional indicators were identified using guidance from three sources: 1) The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad ministration's Risk and Protective Factors for Mental, Emotional, and Behavioral Disorders Across the Life Cycle; 2) The Community Anti- Drug Coalition's (CADCA) Assessment Primer: Analyzing the Community, Identifying Problems and Setting Goals; and 3) CADC A's Community Assessment Needs Assessment Data Collection Examples of Local Data worksheet. These documents rely on the Center on Substance Abuse Prevention's (CSAP) Strategic Prevention Framework to guide the identification of individual, family, and comm unity factors that are related to substance abuse. Additionally, CADCA's Assessment Guide is specifically concerned with aiding community coalitions during the needs assessment process and in identifying communities to Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 23 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 192 of 456target for prevention initiatives and the organization of the county and municipal social indicators follow CADCA's conceptualization of domains useful in prevention planning. The specific objectives of the Chartbook are to: 1) Present an objective profile of New Jersey at the state, county , and municipal levels using key social indicators related to substance abuse; 2) Show the effect of substance use and related health consequences in New Jersey at the state, county, and municipal levels; and 3) Provide information to support needs assessm ent and prevention, as well as treatment planning, at the community level. At both the s tate and local levels, the New Jersey substance abuse planning process is designed to employ both quantitative and qualitative data to assess the relative need for alcohol and drug abuse prevention, early intervention, treatment, and recovery support services. It uses both administrative data bases prepared by federal, state, and local governments , as well as general and special population and servi ce-provider surveys conducted by DMHAS to engage in \"gap\" analysis of unmet treatment demand by age, race and sex among New Jersey residents . The periodic schedul ing of surveys and other studies has provided the SSA with the capacity for longitudinal anal ysis and forecasting to estimate future prevalence of substance ab use treatment need and demand at both state and county levels and by demographic characteristics of subpopulations warranting special surveillance . Analysis of treatment admissions and deliv ery at the municipal level provides the SSA with the capacity for spatial analysis of unmet treatment demand and access to care. Thus, analysis of both primary and secondary data sources drives New Jersey's s tate planning and policy development for substa nce use services . Needs Assessment: Treatment In 1993, 1998 and 2003, the SSA was awarded a State Treatment Needs Assessment Program (STNAP) grant from SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) to conduct a \"family of studies\" centered around a statewide household survey supplemented by special surveys of sub- populations not expected to be included in the telephone sampling frame. Over time, the SSA expanded the size of its household sa mple to 4,200 completed telephone interviews in 1998 and to 14,700 in both 2003 and 2009. The expansion to N = 14,700 provided approximately 700 completed household interviews per county, enough to allow survey data analysis for planning purposes in each c ounty. After the STNAP ended in 2003, the SSA conducted its 2009 needs assessment \"family of studies\" using SAPT Block Grant funding. The SSA planned a fifth \"family of studies\" needs assessment program again using the SAPT Block Grant. The SSA conducts the New Jersey Household Survey of Drug Use and Health (NJ -HSDUH) at five-year intervals using a questionnaire developed by CSAT during the STNAP that is nearly identical to the questionnaire employed for the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) . For 2 3 years, New Jersey has surveyed its adult population 18 years of age or older by telephone using a random -digit dialed sample to estimate: 1) the prevalence of both legal and illegal substance use, 2) alcohol treatment need and 3) unmet treatment demand. The questionnaire employs a core set of questions provided originally by the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment. The need for alcohol treatment is derived from a series of questions based on Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 24 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 193 of 456Diagnostic Statistical Manual (now DSM -5) criteria. Questions address use, quantity, effect on behavior, symptoms experienced, associated health problems, etc. Sample proportions are applied to state and county population estimates. Since t he household survey underestimates drug treatment need due to under -reporting of illicit drug use , a statistical technique known as the two-sample capture- recapture model is applied to illicit drug treatment unique admissions data to estimate drug treatment need at both the state and county levels. The admissions data for the model are obtained from the web -based New Jersey Substance Abuse Monitoring System (NJSAMS), DMHAS' administrative, client information system for substance abuse treatment. Together with the alcohol treatment need estimates obtained from the aforement ioned household survey, DMHAS produces an annual estimate of total treatment need that is used in the distribution of alcohol and drug abuse treatment funds. The primary focus is the population distribution of substance use and the population prevalence of substance abuse and addiction. It employs DSM diagnostic criteria of abuse and dependence in combination with \"past 12 month\" drug use to obtain alcohol and illegal drug treatment need estimates. The questionnaire also asks those with a treatment nee d about their treatment histories and obtains an estimate of unmet treatment. Beyond these core elements, the SSA's questionnaire regularly includes sections on tobacco use and gambling behavior. Typically, the NJ -HSDUH includes one or more special topics, such as the needs of pregnant women in 1993 and 1998, the needs of persons impacted by the 9/11 attacks in NYC in 2003, and in 2009, both substance use among New Jersey Veterans and obstacles to treatment access among persons who need but do not get care. For the 2013- 2014 NJ -HSDUH, which was the first NJ-HSDUH after the merger of the Divisions of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the SSA include d a new permanent section on mental health treat ment needs and access to community - based, mental health treatment opportunities and to return to the special topic of substance use among pregnant women. Due to changes in state procurement rules, the survey was not fielded as planned in 2014. As an interim measure, the survey was repeated in 2016 with a much smaller sample ( N=1,052). Approximately 55% of the sample were households contacted via a landline while 45% were cell phone only households. The interviews were distributed by regions: north ( N=422), central, (N=338) and south ( N=292). The 2016 questionnaire introduced a new permanent mental health section that uses validated questions from the federal behavioral risk factor surveys to estimate New Jersey's mental health treatment needs. Beginnin g in 2018, DMHAS began collect ing an annual rolling statewide sample, stratified by county, of N=2,835 residents (135 per county). At the end of three years, the annual samples will be combined to create one statewide sample of N = 8,505 subjects, with 405 subjects represented per county. DMHAS intends to continue this annual data collection plan beyond 2020 so that every year thereafter the sample of N= 8,505 will be replenished with a new annual subsample of N = 2,835, while the oldest subsample of N = 2,835 subjects will be removed. In the process, D MHAS will always have an updated sample that consists of 8,505 subjects, 405 per county, that have been interviewed within the previous three years.

An updated, social indicators chart book that presents secondary source data, including those from the 2010 census, re lated to prevention and treatment admissions over multiple years was developed and update d in 2016. Another keystone source of information for need assessment and gap analysis for addiction services is the NJSAMS . The S SA is able to establish the number of persons receiving substance abuse treatment from licensed treatment providers through its mandated reporting of essential client health data to this combined public health disease surveillance and provider -oriented, management information system. By app lying the two sample capture -recapture model to multiple years of NJSAMS data, the SSA can estimate the drug treatment need which is not observed in NJSAMS. When combined with findings on alcohol treatment need obtained from the NJ Household Survey, the SS A can estimate both the need and demand for treatment and differentiate between met and unmet treatment demand . The SSA also utilizes local input such as this to help guide its overall statewide program development. As some specific examples, the Medicati on Assisted Treatment Initiative (MATI) has helped improve \"access on demand\" to medically assisted treatment for opiate injection drug- users in six urban locations. It has also provided 63 units of supportive housing for clients referred through the MATI . As part of its fee -for-service initiatives, the SSA developed a network of providers with \"co- occurring treatment capability\" to enhance treatment effectiveness for individuals who have a substance use disorder and co- occurring mental illness . This netw ork helped community advocates realize \"one- stop\", \"treatment on demand\", or \"no wrong door\" access to care. One County noted a service gap for early intervention services and planned for better integration of ASAM Level .5 into Level 1.0 outpatient progra ms and advocated for the inclusion of Level .5 (Early Intervention) into NJSAMS reporting . As noted in Ste p 1, the SSA in 2014 was awarded technical assistance through the SAMHSA supported National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare (NCSACW) to a ddress the multi- faceted problems of Substance Exposed Infants (SEI) and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). New Jersey DHS/DMHAS as the lead State agency partnered with the Departments of Children and Families (DCF) and Health and submitted a successful a pplication for In- Depth Technical Assistance on Substance Exposed Infants and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (IDTA SEI NAS) . The NJ IDTA focused on strengthening collaboration and linkages across multiple systems such as substance use disorder treatment, chi ld welfare, home visiting and early intervention systems, medical communities and other key stakeholders to improve services for pregnant women with opioid and other substance use disorders and outcomes for their babies. The goal was to develop uniform policies/guidelines that address the entire spectrum of NAS and SEI from pre -pregnancy, prevention, early intervention, assessment and treatment, postpartum and early childhood.

The IDTA established three goals: (1) Increase perinatal SEI screening at multiple intervention points (Health system, SUD/MH system); (2) Leverage existing programs and policy mechanisms to collaboratively increase the rat e at which women screening positive on the 4P's Plus get connected for a comprehensive assessment by establishing formal warm -handoffs and other safety net measures; (3) Leverage existing programs and policy mechanisms to collaboratively increase the rate at which women delivering SEIs and their babies and any other eligible children, receive early support services for which they are eligible. NJ IDTA received two extensions beyond the 18- month timeframe to improve service needs for pregnant women and their SEI, and to guide the state in facilitating a coordinated cross - disciplinary approach to improve critical service gaps and reduce barriers among providers, agencies, medical community an d other stakeholders. Estimation of the Population in Need of Treatment . The estimated size of New Jersey's 2017 resident adult population in need of treatment for alcohol abuse or dependence is 602,018 persons. It is found by applying the proportion in need identified by the 2009 NJ -HSDUH to the U.S. Census Bureau's estimate of New Jersey's resident adult population for 2017. The size of the 2017 adult population needing treatment for drug abuse or dependence in New Jersey is 276,323 persons. It is fo und by applying a procedure known as the two- sample capture - recapture method to the count of unique clients receiving drug abuse treatment in 2016 and 2018 as reported in the NJSAMS. This technique was utilized due to under -reporting of illicit drug abuse or dependence observed in the household survey. The sum of these two estimates of treatment need, one for alcohol abuse and one for drug abuse, equals the 2017 New Jersey total substance abuse treatment need or 878,341.

Relative Needs Assessment Scale. In addition to utilizing survey data, the DMHAS addiction research team developed methods for using social indicators to supplement estimates of need obtained through other methods. Because social indicator data are compiled by their primary users and archived for use by others, indicator data are somewhat convenient to obtain, especially when random samples surveys are not feasible to undertake. One such method of social indicator analysis is the Relative Needs Assessment Scale (RNAS), developed by DMHAS researchers, Mammo & French (1996), using social indicators with known correlations to the incidence and prevalence of substance abuse. The RNAS is used to target prevention and treatment resources by location and socio -economic characteristics of at -risk populations . The scale calculates an index of risk for each county for which the indicators can be obtained. Because the scale is an interval level of measurement that sums to one, scores are comparable and easily interpreted across jurisdictions. In FFY 2014, the SSA provided RNAS indexes down to the municipal level for use in the county comprehensive planning process . In the current county comprehensive planning process for 2016 to 2019, the RNAS model, updated to include data from the 2016 U.S. Census, will be used to identify areas within counties with potentially high concentrations of people with substance abuse prevention, treatment and recovery support service needs. Geograp hic Information Systems. The SSA maps the spatial distribution of treatment services across all counties and modalities of care and use s this information in its county comprehensive planning. It routinely uses Geographic Information Systems ( GIS) to map its treatment services in order to guide its planning of services in underserved areas. GIS is used in the County Substance Abuse Overviews to assist counties by providing color -coded choropleth maps that show the distribution of treatment adm issions in their municipalities and where utilization is greatest. In the statewide report a chor opleth map is also provided so the SSA can easily see the counties with the greatest treatment utilization. It is used to present spatial visualizations of key issues. It is used for the SYNAR coverage study and annual SYNAR inspections to produce walking maps for the inspectors to follow. Treatment /Recovery Initiatives Based on Need Medication Assisted Treatment. Data from NJSAMS for Calendar Year 2018 indicates that only 15% of methadone is planned and 7% of buprenorphine in treatment for clients admitted to treatment, yet heroin and other opiates are the primary drugs of admission for 50% of clients entering New Jersey's addiction treatment system. The development of the Medication Assisted Treatment Initiative (MATI) has been an attempt to help reduce this gap by providing increased access to medication assisted treatment by offering methadone, as well as buprenorphine, to individuals with an opioid use disorder through mobile medication units. Another attem pt to increase access to MAT, specifically buprenorphine, has been the development of statewide buprenorphine training courses utilized as an educational component for physicians, Advanced Practical Nurses (APNs) and Physician Assistants (PAs) to attain th eir Buprenorphine Waiver. The State plans to hold a total of 16 trainings through both Rutgers University (northern region) Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 30 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 199 of 456and Rowan University (southern region) in CY 2019 in an effort to train over 1,000 prescribers in CY 2019. The SSA's goal is to con tinue to develop a system of care that offers high risk clients the means to enter and sustain recovery. In this effort, the SSA implemented a pilot program in September 2011 for the DUI offender with an alcohol or opioid use disorder that include d medication assisted treatment using the FDA approved medication Vivitrol (an injectable form of naltrexone) . A comprehensive research protocol was developed, and numerous client outcomes were assessed. The pilot was launched in September 2011; clients received the medication for up to six months. There was a follow -up survey six months after the client's last injection. The pilot ended in September 2013 once 100 clients had received the medication. Since results were promising, Vivitrol has since been incorpor ated as an enhancement in most of its current substance use disorder Fee for Service Initiatives , including Drug Court, New Jersey Statewide Initiative (NJSI), South Jersey Initiative ( SJI), State Parole Board (SPB), State Targeted Opioid Response Initiati ve (STORI) and the Driving Under the Influence Initiative ( DUI). Acknowledging that addiction is a medical disorder that postulates client- centered treatment, the purpose of this funding is to have an array of medication treatment alternative s for individual s with an opioid use disorder. The Division has mandated trainings on medication assisted treatment for licensed substance use disorder treatment providers, incorporated language requiring acceptance of clients on all forms of medication assisted treatment into contract requirements as well as all applications for new funding, and has provided training on medication assisted treatment for systems to include, but not limited to, Drug Court, the Administrative Offic e of the Courts , the Department of Children and Families ' Children System of Care , and the New Jersey County Jail Wardens Association. Also, the SSA continues to incorporate course work requirements in the workforce development initiative described above. Most recently, i n order to decrease deaths caused by opioids, the DMHAS, alongside representatives from the NJ Professional Advisory Committee (PAC) for Addictions, the NJ Citizen's Advisory Council, the Department of Health Certificate of Need and Licens ing (formerly the Office of Licensing), the Department of Children and Families and the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) formed a Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) Work Group. The primary goal of the work group was to focus on areas critical to expanding the use of MAT across the State and ultimately provide recommendations regarding increased education, expanding access and policy changes to the Assistant Commissioner of DMHAS in February 2018. DMHAS continues to work on strategies for impleme ntation of these recommendations. State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis. In May 2017, SAMHSA awarded New Jersey $12,995,621 annually for two years for its State Targeted Response (STR) to the Opioid Crisis grant . New Jersey 's project is known as the State Targeted Opioid Response Initiative (STORI). The goal of the STORI is to address the opioid crisis confronting New Jersey using a variety of strategies. A key objective is to increase access to treatment and reduce unmet treat ment need. Another key objective is to reduce opioid related deaths. New Jersey's plan also address es retention in care and the provision of peer and recovery supports . Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 31 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 200 a new STORI fee- for-service (FFS) treatment initiativ e was developed within the existing addiction fee for service treatment network, which provides access to treatment for underinsured and uninsured clients. It includes a wide range of services within the continuum of care and includes the use of EBPs, part icularly MAT. The STORI FFS went live July 3, 2017. There was an expansion of DMHAS' Opioid Overdose Recovery Program (OORP) to an additional 10 counties in New Jersey using STR funds, so coverage is now statewide. The use of peers has been incorporated in the Support Team for Addiction Recovery (STAR), which include s peer recovery specialists as part of the team. The goal is to prevent an opioid overdose and help prevent relapse. The team is charged with trying to keep clients in the \"recovery zone\" fo r as long as possible and assist them with their recovery journey. A peer - delivered statewide Telephone Recovery Support (TRS) service was developed . Family support is provided through the development of three regional Family Support Centers (FSCs). The STORI also include s trainings related to best practices for the prescribing of opiates and expanded use of MAT. Training include s the implementation of an Extending Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) project on substance use disorder . A key objective is to expand the knowledge and capacity of primary care providers to implement best practices for substance use disorders related services in the primary care setting taking into consideration the efficacy of screening and intervention in a primary care setting , as well as how to deliver more specialized care to patients with identified addiction issues . A three -module training was developed by Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine . The Rowan training is a live webinar and self-paced learning series that uses a standardized, evidence- based curriculum to train and inform healthcare providers on the most up- to-date practices and guidelines regarding medication - assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. This t raining covers best practices in opioid treatment and management, review of MAT for opioid use disorders and buprenorphine use in the emergency department . State Opioid Response Grant. SAMHSA, Center for Substance Abuse Treatment released the State Opioid Response (SOR) grant funding opportunity for states and territories in June 2018. New Jersey was awarded f unding in October 2018. The goals of the SOR are to address the opioid crisis by: (1) increasing access to MAT, (2) using the three FDA -approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorders, (3) reducing unmet treatment needs, and (4) reducing opioid overdose related deaths through the provision of prevention, treatment, and recovery activities for OUD . In 2019, DMHAS entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with both Rutgers University and Rowan University/Cooper Hospital to coordinate statewide DATA 2000 Waiver trainings for practitioners to include physicians, Advance Practice Nurses (APNs) and Physician Assistants (PAs). The goal is to have over 1,000 eligible practitioners trained in 2019 with the hopes of having them able to prescribe buprenorphine within the NJ system of care . DMHAS plans to expand its strategy to develop infrastructure support with SOR funds to provide buprenorphine in both ambulatory substance use disorder (SUD) treatment programs as Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 32 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 201 of 456well as other programs, such as licensed mental health programs . DMHAS is also launching a low-threshold buprenorphine induction program at two Harm Reduction Centers (HRCs) in the Summer of 2019. DMHAS also plans to fund Interim Services in October 2019 for individuals on waiting lists for outpatient and residential programs to provide immediate access to MAT to prevent relapse. DMHAS will partner with both Rutgers University and Rowan University to ensure funding is available to support individuals at clinics who are indigent, so they can be inducted and/or maintained on MAT. Services for these individuals are planned to include other ancillary services su ch as care coordination and peer services. In addition, DMHAS will assist all State county correctional facilities establish MAT programs or enhance existing MAT services for inmates with an OUD as well as provide care management services. Funding is being made available in 2019 to promote clinical stability and effective recovery processes for inmates prior to release from incarceration. Needs Assessment: Prevention In December 1993, the SSA was awarded a three- year contract with the Center for Substanc e Abuse Prevention (CSAP) to conduct studies to assess needs for prevention of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs misuse and abuse in the s tate and in its health planning regions. The contract included the Middle School Survey, the Mature Citizen Survey and the Community Leaders Survey. In addition, a social indicators study and companion chart books of social and health indicators for each of New Jersey's 21 counties and selected municipalities were completed. The data generated by these surveys and stud ies were utilized in policy formulation, resource allocation and the provision of revised data requested within the SAPT Block Grant Application process beginning in FFY 1998. Due to the perceived importance of monitoring levels of risk for substance abus e among New Jersey's youth, the SSA has supported continuation of the Middle School Survey beyond the CSAP funding period. The SSA subsequently conducted a second Middle School Survey in 1998, a third survey in SFY 2001, a fourth survey in 2003 and a fift h survey in 2007. The sixth Middle School Survey was conducted during the 2011- 2012 school year and the latest covers the 2016 and 2017 school years and the next administration of the survey will take place during the 2019- 2020 academic year . Implementat ion of the SSA's first High School Survey was completed in June 2008. It used the same survey instrument as the middle school survey (Pride Survey) and is the first New Jersey report at the county level on 9th through 12th grade youth. The SSA has also b een collaborating with the NJ Department of Education (DOE) on its Student Health (High School) Survey and has provided financial assistance for the 2010- 2011, 2013 and 2016 survey s. While the DOE does not sample at the county level, the findings still provide important information regarding factors protecting and posing risk to adolescents concerning substance use as well as reported substance use. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 33 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 202 of 456Through data obtained in all the prevention studies, the SSA identified risk and protective factors for substance abuse and ranked communities by risk scores . These school surveys have allowed the SSA to establish substance abuse risk and protective factors at the community level and to identify trends in factor scores over the past 18 years. However, one o f the state's challenges is that active parental consent is required for students to participate in these surveys , which impacts response rates. The SSA would support a change in the legislation to require passive parental consent instead . In 2012, DMHA S established seventeen coalitions in New Jersey. These regions in which the coalitions are located were identified based the \"Prevention Needs Assessment Using Social Indicators: State of New Jersey Substance Abuse Prevention County Level Needs Assessment\". The \"Prevention Needs Assessment\" utilized archival data of social indicators to develop composite indices of risks to estimate the need for prevention services among New Jersey's 21 counties. Criteria including population, substance abuse treatment admissions and rates within the region as well as prevalence of alcohol and prescription drug misuse among middle and high- school students were also considered in identifying the seventeen regions. Additional criteria used to determine the regions include d that: Each region must be comprised of at least one county Each region must have reported a minimum of 2000 treatment admissions (according to the latest available data) for the previous year Relative Needs Assessment Scale. The Relative Needs Assessment Scale (RNAS) was developed for alcohol and drug prevention planning in 1995 and updated in 2008 and 2013. It was updated for 2016. A report was prepared in May 2014 \"Substance Abuse Prevention Needs Assessment Using Social Indicator s\" which is also being updated. The RNAS employs social indicators of substance use -related mortality and morbidity and calculates relative risk for each county and municipality , thus, permitting comparisons of relative risk among counties across t he state and among municipalities within each county. The RNAS is used to target prevention and treatment resources by location and socio- economic characteristics of at -risk populations . It was utilized in the 2008 and 2014 RFP process es for awarding five -year prevention contracts utilizing SAPT Block Grant funding . Addictions Prevention Strategic Plan . In 2012, the SSA completed an addictions strategic prevention planning process to identify prevention priorities and provide direction regarding the use of environmental management strategies to address those priorities. The planning method relied on the full range of DMHAS' available quantitative data in order to identify meaningful priorities at both the state and community levels for which measurable c hange could be achieved when prevention efforts employed targeted, evidence -based prevention strategies. It provides direction for all DMHAS -funded prevention services. In keeping with the aforementioned purpose of the Plan, the priorities identified wer e included in the RFP entitled, \"Funding for Regional Coalitions to Utilize Environmental Strategies to Achieve Population- Level Change\". The primary goals of the RFP were to identify and fund regional coalitions to utilize the SPF and undertake a rigorous needs assessment process to Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 34 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 203 of 456identify which of the statewide DMHAS prevention priorities identified in the Plan are the most significant in their region. Seventeen coalitions were awarded contracts. State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup. The SSA was awarded a Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant (SPF -SIG) by SAMHSA i n October 2006 to prevent the onset and reduce the progression of substance abuse, including childhood and underage drinking. In addition, it was intended to build prevention capacity and infrastructure at the s tate and community levels. A key component of this grant is the use of a data- driven strategic approach and conducting a statewide needs assessment through collection and analysis of epidem iological and community readiness data. As one requirement of the SPF-SIG, the SSA convened the New Jersey State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup (SEOW ), comprised of individuals from various state departments including Health, Transportation, Educati on, Human S ervices, Juvenile Justice, county offices, universities, community provider agenc ies and statewide organizations. The SEOW continues to meet monthly to discuss ways to prevent the onset and reduce the progression of substance abuse disease in N ew Jersey. The SSA continues to actively recruit for new members of the SEOW . This past year has seen the addition of members from the NY/NJ High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA), the Department of Health's (DOH) Division of Family Health, DOH Di vision of HIV, STD, and TB Services (DHSTS), Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, the NJ Poison Information and Education System (NJPIES), the New Jersey Hospital Association Behavioral Health Group, NJ Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (NJHMFA), Office of Managed Health Care Behavioral Health Unit, Office of the Secretary of Higher Education (OSHE), representatives from the NJ State Police's Regional Operations Intelligence Center, and representation from the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program which bec ame operational in September 2011. Originally, the role of SEOW was to conduct a statewide prevention needs assessment to recommend a statewide priority for the SPF -SIG project . Beginning in late 2006, t he SEOW developed the New Jersey Epidemiological Profile for Substance Abuse, which it submitted to SAMHSA in April 2007. The plan was updated in 2008 and will be updated again during 2019. Examples of datasets reviewed for production of the Epidemiological Profile included: 1. The Be havioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2. The Core Alcohol and Drug Survey (CORE) 3. The New Jersey Household Survey on Drug Use and Health (NJ HSDUH) 4.

The Commissioner's Annual Report to the Education Committees of the Senate and General Assembly (CRVV) Originally , the profile served as the basis for recommending prevention priorities to be addressed through the SPF -SIG grant . The SEOW conducted an extensive review of data describing substance use and its consequences available from a multitude of sources . Using prevalence and incidence rates, severity ratings and trends, the SEOW developed a formula incorporating these variables to produce need scores and ranked the needs in order of importance. \"Alcohol dependence of 18- 25 year olds in the past year\", \"drug dependence of 18- 25 year olds in the past year\" and \"past month use of illicit drugs by 18- 25 year olds\" were the three highest ranked indicators. Based on these data, the priority \"to reduce the harmful consequences of alcohol and drug use among 18 -25 year olds ,\" was selected as the guideline for the SPF -SIG project. It was noted that there are very few prevention programs tailored for the 18- 25 year old population. In 2008, the SSA awarded eleven community contracts to implement this prevention priority. As the projects were implemented, most were focused on the harmful consequences of alcohol consumption and in particular, motor vehicle crashes. SPF -SIG funding ended in 2012, after which, most of the SPF -SIG communities received funding (from the SABG) to continue their coalition work by focusing on the priorities identified in the prevention stra tegic plan. The role of the SEOW was expanded in 2010 when the SSA charged the group with developing both treatment and prevention priorities. Upon further review of the data as described above, which included updated information, the SEOW then identifie d the following statewide prevention priority problems/issues in 2010: 1) Drug dependence of 18 -25 year -olds in the past year; 2) Binge drinking by college students; 3) Use of illicit drugs by persons 12 -17/18- 25 in the past 30 days; 4) Drug dependence of persons 12- 17 years old in past year; and 5) Use of alcohol by high school students in the last 30 days. The Division was awarded a SEOW grant from SAMHSA for $180,000. Funding from the SEOW grant, in part made possible the development of a Social Networ k Analysis Project (analysis of linkages between/among the disparate prevention organizations in New Jersey). Additionally, in 2011, New Jersey received a $561,000 State Prevention Enhancement (SPE) Grant from SAMHSA, which enabled the state to expand its prevention system and make numerous enhancements to the substance abuse prevention infrastructure. New Jersey utilize d SPE funding to make numerous enhancements to its prevention infrastructure by: addressing gaps in data regarding older adults and binge drinking rates among young adult women of child bearing age (21 -29 years), expanding the capacity of the Prevention Outcomes Monitoring Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 36 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB DMHAS' prevention management information system) to collect data on environmental s trategies and program s, in early 2016 updated its Chartbooks of Social and Health Indicators , the information which can be used to identify health problems directly or indirectly related to substance use and to aid in the assessment of needs for prevention and treatment servic es, and further enhanced the database of all prevention services and programs being delivered throughout the State. The Chartbooks will again be updated in 2020. Selecting indicators to describe the consequences of substance use and the consumption patterns associated with those consequences is a critically important aspect of the needs assessment process. The SEOW Epidemiological (Epi) Profile Workgroup identified various dimensions that could describe the extent of a problem, including the size of the problem, its magnitude relative to other states' problems, the severity of the problem's impact on an individual and/or community, trend characteristics, attributable risk to substance abuse, and availability of data. In addition, the Epi -Profile Work group identified additional criteria that could impact efforts to address a problem, including capacity/resources, perceived gap between capacity/resources and need readiness (political will/public concern), economic impact, and social impact. The SEOW Epi-Profile Workgroup compiled a list of the data gaps they identified in their process. Some of the data gaps identified by the SEOW Epi -Profile Workgroup included: Medical Examiners data - not all counties report to state; need to search for data on presence of AD in system of homicide victims; more collaboration / cooperation between New Jersey State Police and New Jersey Medical Examiners on ALL AOD related deaths Secondary cause of death via alcohol data need to be collected Pedestrian fatalities and n on-fatalities by age and substance need to be collected Alcoholic Beverage Commission needs to collect routine statistics on citations, fines, etc. Current use of ATOD by high school students Prescription usage patterns (misuse/abuse) General education referrals to school Substance Awareness Coordinators General education referrals to treatment High school dropout rate New Jersey Regional Coalition Needs Assessment The 17 New Jersey Regional C oalitions conducted an update to their needs assessment in 2018. Building on their initial needs assessment conducted five years prior, the Regional Coalitions built on that process to update their logic models and plans in order to capture current substance abuse prevention needs and trends. Using the Strategic Prevention Framework (PFS) as a model, the coalitions work on all steps (i.e., needs assessment, building capacity, implementation, etc.) at different times. Given the length of time that ha d passed since the coalitions' original needs assessment, an update was needed to assess their accomplishments so far and determine any shifts in community needs. The primary goals of these community needs assessment updates were to assess what they have accomplished in their first several years of t he statewide initiative , assess current community needs and readiness, prioritize strategies, and update logic models to reflect any changes in their plans to address current needs. The Rutgers Center for Prevention Science (RU -CPS) and New Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 37 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 206 of 456Jersey Preventi on Network (NJPN) provided guidance, technical assistance, and training as the coalitions moved through their community needs assessment updates. The overall needs assessment questions guiding the coalitions' process include the following: What substanc e use problems (i.e., overdoses, alcohol poisoning) and related behaviors (i.e., prescription drug misuse and underage drinking) are occurring in your community? How often are these problems and related behaviors occurring? Where are these substance use pr oblems and related behaviors occurring (i.e., at home or in vacant lots; in small groups or during big parties)? Who is experiencing more of these substance use issues and related behaviors? (i.e., are they males, females, youth, adults, or members of cert ain cultural groups?) The needs assessment update process was broken down into major tasks, using the Strategic Prevention Framework fidelity guidance. Some of the overall tasks include the following: re - establishing their data work groups; obtaining exi sting and relevant data; analysis of these data; processes of prioritization; and assessing community readiness. The RU -CPS team and NJPN provided several technical assistance and training sessions to guide their needs assessment update processes and cover ing all of these related topics . The final step for all coalitions was to update their regional logic models based on their needs assessment update process. Across all coalitions, logic models were developed for the following substance priorities: underage drinking, marijuana, prescription drug misuse, illegal drugs, and tobacco. Most coalitions have two or three logic models. Across all coalitions, a total of 62 logic models were submitted to RU - CPS and NJPN for a review process. RU-CPS and NJPN reviewed all logic models with the goal of providing individual feedback to each coalition as well as to capture efforts common across most or all coalitions to inform the state-level logic models. RU -CPS developed documents to show frequencies of the follow data elements across all logic models: 1) problem statements, 2) root causes, 3) local conditions, and 4) strategies. RU -CPS used these documents to also determine where there were instances in which coalitions are using slightly different language to indicate the same data element. These instances were used to collapse categories and help align language in the logic models when data elements are the same across coalitions. RU -CPS and NJPN held several technical assistance sessions with small groups of coalitio n staff to provide feedback and recommendations on their logic models. Prevention Initiatives Based on Need Regional Coalitions . Effective January 1, 2012, seventeen regional substance abuse prevention coalitions were funded under an RFP that was issued by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in the fall of 2011. The goals of this project are to engage community stakeholders to address prevention priorities identified by DMHAS' Prevention Strategic Planning Committee in 2010 and to comple ment and reflect the first of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Eight Strategic Initiatives. The prevention priorities are: Reduce underage drinking Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 38 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 207 of 456 Reduce the use of illegal substances - with a special focus on the use of opioids among young adults 18- 25 years of age Reduce prescription medication misuse across the lifespan Reduce the use of new and emerging drugs of abuse across the lifespan The SSA identified seventeen coalition regions in New Jersey. These regi ons were selected based the \"Prevention Needs Assessment Using Social Indicators: State of New Jersey Substance Abuse Prevention County Level Needs Assessment.\" The \"Prevention Needs Assessment\" utilized archival data of social indicators to develop composite indices of risks to estimate the need for prevention services among New Jersey's 21 counties. Criteria including population, substance abuse treatment admissions and rates within the region as well as prevalence of alcohol and prescription drug misus e among middle and high -school students were also considered in identifying the seventeen regions. The coalition intensively collaborate with Municipal Alliances in their region, which are funded and overseen by the Governor's Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse ( GCADA) . Coalitions also coordinate their efforts with those of the 29 Federally -funded Drug Free Community Support Programs in New Jersey. This initiative seeks to achieve an enhanced level of communication and collaboration among all groups a nd organizations that are working to reduce the misuse and the harmful consequences of alcohol and drug use among the citizens of New Jersey. Strategic Prevention Enhancement Grant . In May 2011, the SSA submitted a Strategic Prevention Enhancement (SPE) grant to SAMHSA which was awarded. New Jersey's SPE Project served six high- need counties: Bergen, Camden, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, and Monmouth. Archival data of social indicators wer e used to develop composite indices of risks to estimate need for prevention services among the 21 New Jersey counties. Risk factors related to alcohol and drug misuse in these identified counties were far more prevalent than in other counties throughout the State. In addition to serving these high -need communities, New Jersey utilized SPE funding to make numerous enhancements to its prevention infrastructure by: addressing gaps in data regarding older adults and binge drinking rates among young adult w omen of child bearing age (21 -29 years), expanding the capacity of the Prevention Outcomes Monitoring System (POMS ), which DMHAS' prevention management information system, and to collect data on environmental strategies and programs. Additionally, DMHAS w as able to update its Chartbooks of Social and Health Indicators , the information in which can be used to identify health problems directly or indirectly related to substance use and to aid in the assessment of needs for prevention and treatment services. Funding was also used to create a database of all prevention services and programs delivered throughout the State. The training and services that DMHAS provided to high- need communities as well as the enhancements to its prevention infrastructure better enabled New Jersey to support more strategic, comprehensive systems of community -oriented care. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 39 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 208 of 456State Targeted Response (S TR) Grant . Primary prevention efforts focus ed on community education programs for older adults with the goal of reducing demand for opiate prescriptions. Secondary prevention efforts include d additional training on naloxone to schools, jails and prisons, and the distribution of naloxone kits. Partnership for Success. In October 2013, DMHAS received a five -year Strategic Prevention Framework - Partnerships for Success (SPF -PFS) cooperative agreement from CSAP. The goals of New Jersey's SPF -PFS initiative are threefold: 1) to strengthen and enhance th e work of 17 DMHAS -funded regional prevention coalitions; 2) to further develop the prevention data infrastructure and information systems capacity at the state level; and 3) in collaboration with state partners and community stakeholders, to continue work in developing a unified statewide prevention planning and service delivery system. Specifically, New Jersey's SPF -PFS seeks to 1) reduce underage drinking among persons aged 12 to 20; and 2) reduce prescription drug misuse and abuse among persons aged 12 to 25. As additional components of its PFS programming, New Jersey also focuses on unhealthy drinking patterns and prescription drug abuse among adults age sixty and older; and serves military families with prevention education, addressing military commu nity risk levels, striving to mitigate the risk factors, and enhancing the protective factors to support military members and their families in making responsible parenting and individual choices in regards to drug and alcohol use. DMHAS utilize d these funds for numerous prevention infrastructure developments and enhancements . For instance, N ew Jersey is taking advantage of emerging technologies to better promote prevention messaging, and has developed a prevention- focused mobile app for iPhone and Andr oid smartphones called \"Be the One\". The Division was awarded another Strategic Prevention Framework Partnerships for Success Grant (PFS) in 2018. The focus of New Jersey's Partnership for Success is twofold. First, the Department of H uman Services - Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DHS/DMHAS) will focus its efforts on providing prevention education and services to youth who are involved with the Department of Children and Families - Children's System of Care (DCF/CSOC). New Jersey has a fully -developed, organized statewide children's system of care, the Division of Children's System of Care (CSOC), under the auspices of the Department of Children and Families (DCF), that provides a single point of entry 24/7, for youth (under 21) and their families, with behavioral health challenges, substance use challenges, intellectual/developmental disabilities, and a utism . The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS), within the Department of H uman Services (DHS), provides services to adults who seek behavioral health and substance abuse treatment. The Departments and their respective Divisions (CSOC and DMHAS) will partner to implement prevention strategies that include outreach, education and training service s to communities and families throughout the entire state of New Jersey. Concurrent with these services, the DMHAS - funded county coalitions will provide community -based prevention services throughout their counties, resulting in a cohesive, unified statewi de prevention system. Prevent Drug Overdose . In September 2016, DMHAS was awarded a SAMHSA grant to Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Overdose -Related Deaths $1M annually over 5 years. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 40 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey (OOPN) initiati ve, DMHAS will receive real - time, statewide information about drug overdoses from the state's police fusion center that uses cutting edge data collection and transmission technology. This capability will allow DMHAS to almost immediately alert front- line p ractitioners and to make data -driven decisions about where to deploy prevention interventions, which includes community education and distribution of naloxone. Our project will implement an Early Warning and Rapid Response System (EWRRS) that will allow a n extensive network of practitioners and community workers in a variety of healthcare settings (e.g., FQHCs, EDs, hospitals) who will be informed when their communities are affected. The alerts will also mobilize opioid overdose prevention practitioners who can provide emergency response training and distribute naloxone to at -risk individuals and their families, as well as disseminate information about addiction treatment services to the local communities that are affected. Strategic Prevention Framework R x. In September 2016, NJ was awarded $371,616 per year for five years. The SPF Rx provides an opportunity for states that have completed a Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant (SPF SIG) to target the priority issue of prescription drug mis use. Called NJAssessRX, the grant expands interagency sharing of the state's prescription drug monitoring program, data and gives the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) the capability to use data analytics to identify prescribers, prescriber groups and patients at high risk for inappropriate prescribing and nonmedical use of opioid drugs. Informed by the data, DMHAS and its prevention partners will strategically target communities and populations needing services, education or other interventions. The target population is youth (ages 12- 17) and adults (18 years of age and older) who are being prescribed opioid pain medications, controlled drugs, or HCG, and are at risk for their nonmedical use. One aspect of New Jersey's SPF Rx proje ct will focus on young athletes. Literature suggests that when young athletes are prescribed opioid pain relievers for sports - related injuries, there is a risk of addiction and medication misuse. The 17 regional coalitions that were established by DMHAS w ill provide education regarding this issue to coaches, parents, prescribers, and young athletes. DMHAS will conduct epidemiological analysis on the NJPMP data and employ geographic information systems (GIS) to identify communities and issues that require targeted interventions and public health initiatives. Reports will identify those populations, practice settings and geographic areas, with the highest rates of nonmedical use of opioids and opioid prescriptions. The reports developed from the DMHAS da ta analysis will be shared with other state agencies and with DMHAS' Regional Prevention Coalitions to inform planning in local communities, which might, for example, target locales for naloxone distribution to prevent drug overdoses. These reports will a lso be the basis for a public awareness campaign and for training of providers and the health care community on addictions and the risks of opioid prescribing. DMHAS will work with its state and community partners in promoting evidence -based practices on the prescribing opioid analgesics. DMHAS and its partners will use plans to implement soon Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 41 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 210 of 456to be released recommendations of a state workgroup, the Pain Management Council, which will be incorporating the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chroni c Pain. Medical practitioners and pharmacies will also be involved in efforts to promote awareness of naloxone and its availability. SAMHSA's Overdose Prevention Toolkit will be used to educate at risk individuals and their families in strategies to preven t opioid overdoses. Prevention Statewide Request for Proposals. A Request for Proposals (RFP) for Statewide Services and Special Projects for Substance Abuse Prevention was released in September 2014 for community -based substance abuse prevention services and two special prevention projects described below . The guidelines and requirements of the RFP were developed by DMHAS in accordance with the DMHAS Substance Abuse Prevention Strategic Plan. Funding for all services is provided by the SAPT Bloc k Grant. Each county in the state was assigned a funding allocation from the total funds available based on its relative need. The funding allocation was determined based on the presence and intensity of social indictors, past 30- day use rates, treatmen t admission rates, as well as need and risk factors within each county. Bidders respo nding to the RFP were required to utilize evidence -based programs and address the risk and protective factors specific to the prevention priority as well as the population (e.g. families, middle or high school students, older adults, workplaces, etc.) they propose to serve. In addition, bidders were required to provide quantitative data to substantiate the need for the substance abuse prevention services within the community and population they intend to target. From the 98 proposals that were received, 51 community -based contracts and two special project contracts were awarded totaling $5,700,200. Prevention Services to Families of Military Veterans . Working with the New Jersey National Guard Family Program and its eight Family Assistance Centers based at armories around the state, the SSA funds the New Jersey Prevention Network to provide programs to serve returning military personnel and their families through two ev idence -based programs, Coping with Work and Family Stress and the Strengthening Families Program. Both programs are designed to enhance protective factors to support military members and their families in making responsible parenting and individual choice s in regards to drug and alcohol use. Prevention Services to Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered and Questioning Youth. According to a study by University of Pittsburgh researchers published in the April 2008 issue of Addiction2.the likelihood of substa nce use by gay, lesbian bisexual, transgendered and questioning (GLBTQ) youth are on average 190 percent highe r than for heterosexual youth, t he SSA funds the North Jersey Community Research Initiative to continue and expand their existing programs for hig h-risk GLBTQ youth of color by adapting a prevention model developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, early intervention services, social marketing, and structured recreational activities. A CSAP -sponsored evaluation of the program deter mined that the program was effective in reducing rates of substance use among participants and that participants were highly satisfied with the services that were provided. Prevention Services to Older Adults. As part of the STR and SOR grant s, primary p revention efforts are focused on community education programs for older adults with the goal of reducing 2 Marshal, Michael P., Friedman, Mark S., Stall, Ron, King, Kevin M., et. al .

Opioid Overdose Preventi on Program. DMHAS issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) in June 2015 to establish an annually renewable opioid overdose prevention program. The RFP funded by DMHAS and the Governor's Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (GCADA) established three programs commencing in the fall of 2015 in the following regions: North: Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Morris, Passaic, Sussex and Warren Counties Central: Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Somerset, and Union Counties South: Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, Ocean and Salem Counties. The program provides education to individuals at risk for an opioid overdose, their families, friends and loved ones to recognize an opiate overdose and includes the distribution of naloxone kits and information on how to access treatment, including Medication Assisted Treatment, which is the best practice for someone living with an opioid use disorder. Request for Letters of Interest (RLI) were issued in June 2017 by DMHAS for contracted OOPPs operating regionally across the State of New Jersey to partner with DMHAS in its State Targeted Opioid Response Initiative (STORI) funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis (ST R) grant. DMHAS made three awards in the amount of $75,000 each. DMHAS expects to educate and distribute naloxone kits to a larger spectrum of specialized groups including, but not limited to, school nurses and other personnel at statewide school distric ts, medical and clinical staff at jails and prisons, and medical and clinical staff working for residential substance use disorder treatment programs. Opioid Overdose Recovery Program . A Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued in June 2015 to develop an Opioid Overdose Recovery Program to respond to individuals reversed from opioid overdoses and treated at hospital emergency departments as a result of the reversal. This new two-year initiative funded by DMHAS, the Governor's Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (GCADA) and the Department of Children and Families (DCF) funded five programs . In 2017, additional funds were received from a Governor's Initiative to fund an additional six progr ams. With the STR funding the remaining 10 counties were funded so OORP is now in all 21 New Jersey Counties. The Opioid Overdose Recovery Program utilize s Recovery Specialists and Patient Navigators to engage individuals reversed from an opioid overdose to provide non- clinical assistance, recovery supports and appropriate referrals for assessment and substance use disorder treatment. The Recovery Specialis ts and Patient Navigators will also maintain follow - up with these individuals. Recovery services provided for these individuals should be fundamentally strengths -based. Additionally, they should deliver or assertively link individuals to appropriate and culturally -specific services and provide support and resources throughout the process. It is planned that, at minimum, recovery specialists will be accessible and on- call from Thursday evenings through Monday mornings in the specific locations where fundi ng is made available. This initiative commence d in January 2016.

The counties obtain local data from 1) key informant and stakeholder focus group data, and 2) quantitative data produced from locally -funded research or made available to county pl anners from multiple health and behavioral health care planning initiatives occurring in their counties. The county level planning process is most informative regarding the identification of gaps in the delivery of services and recommendations for system level changes that can close these gaps . In addition to independent local planning and investment in local systems development, the SSA also relies on county level planning to provide \"feedback\" regarding the functioning of New Jersey's behavioral health c are delivery system and policy recommendations regarding improvement of its performance . In the current county planning cycle, 2016- 2019, there were several changes that lead to challenges in planning amongst the counties. With the elimination of the fed eral IMD exclusion in July of 2018, Medicaid is now available to cover many of these expenses for most county residents enrolled in Medicaid. As the funder of last resort, the counties are trying to redirect their funding efforts from clinical treatment to prevention, early intervention and post -treatment, and recovery support services. The addition of federal and state initiatives to the fight against the opioid epidemic has reduced the number of county residents that must rely on county funding to afford outpatient and intensive outpatient care. Hence, counties have been reallocating planned service funding to residential withdrawal management and short - or long -term residential treatment to spen d all their AEREF resources within a given year. Continuing in the new 2020- 2023 planning cycle, each county will be required to report on its quarterly progress implementing and measuring the outcomes of each year's objectives as well as monitoring of sy stem level changes following upon the state's Medicaid expansion, the state's move to managed care for substance abuse treatment and the elimination of the IMD exclusion . These developments have begun to change the demand for the use of county dollars to subsidize access to care for the medically indigent and this in turn is expected to permit counties to emphasize the development of prevention, early intervention and recovery support services and foster innovative programming to meet the needs of their constituents. Each county planning cycle is limited to four years with the current cycle beginning in calendar year 2020 and ending in calendar year 20 23. New county comprehensive plans were received by DMHAS by the end of 2018. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 44 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 213 of 456The SSA collabora tes with t he County Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors in the administration of the aforementioned AEREF program. In 2019, the s tates' 21 counties received $8,756,174 from the AEREF program, based on county population size, per capita income and estimated treatment n eed. Additionally, each county received a $20,000 planning grant. T he SSA supplement ed these awards with an additional $6,908,371 for a total state investment of $16,084,545 in county provision of services. Further, each county is required to contribute 25% of its AEREF award to the program. In 2019, counties contributed an additional $2,189,044 to this program for a total combined state and county investment of $18,273,589. According to the AEREF enabling legislation, each participating county is required to submit \"an annual [county] comprehensive plan (CCP) for the provision of community services to meet the needs of alcoholics and drug abusers .\"3..Further, this plan \"shall...demonstrate linkages with existing resources which serve alcoholics and drug abusers and their families.\" The law also stipulates that counties pay \"special attention\" to the needs of youth, drivers -under -the-influence, women, persons with disability, workers, and offenders committing cri mes related to substance abuse. Thus, the counties are mandated by statute to develop unified, data -informed, comprehensive plans for the coordinated provision of community -based prevention, early intervention, treatment , and recovery support services for all county residents at both state and local levels . The SSA provides counties with quality assurance planning protocols and is responsible to review each CCP to determine: 1) whether the plan complies in form and function with the requirements of Chapter 51 by rationally relating county resources with the needs of county residents , and 2) whether it is designed and developed in a manner consistent with the state's quality assurance standards for county planning. Local Citizen Advisory Planning Boards . A key component of the county comprehensive planning system is the county Local Advisory Committee on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (LACADA), an independent, citizen's advisory group. The LACADA is required to assist the governing authority to develop and present to the County Board of Freeholders the aforementioned CCP for adoption. The LACADA is also required to establish a County Alliance Steering Subcommittee (CASS). The CASS is the county -level planning body for each county's GCADA m unicipal alliance which, in turn, is a coalition of municipal level residents and other stakeholder volunteers that recommend a set of local prevention priorities to the LACADA based on their own data analyses and prevention service inventories. Municipal alliance plans are coordinated by the CASS with a county's comprehe nsive plan through a process known as Unification Planning . The SSA works closely with GCADA to prepare for and implement the Unification process. Additionally, the counties are required to allocate approximately 11% of the county AEREF dollars to suppor t prevention education services. Length of County Planning Cycle . In 2004, the SSA established a three -year planning cycle for the county AEREF program that allowed counties to submit multi -year plans for the period 2006- 2008. In 2008, the SSA lengthened the planning cycle to four years from 2009 through 2012, in order to establish the principle that county RFPs for substance abuse services were to be published subsequent to SSA certification of the county comprehensive plan and in accordance with its goals and objectives. In January of 2011, the SSA extended the effect ive period of the 3 Chapter 51, Laws of 1989, paragraph 14 incorporating Section 4 of P.L.1983, c.531 (C.26:2b- 33 as amended).

As a consequence of the devastating impacts of \"Superstorm Sandy\" in October 2012, the SSA, in collaborat ion with the county planners, extended the current planning cycle for an additional year through the end of 2014. An additional one-year extension was implemented in spring 2014 for reasons related to the storm's impact and the focus of many counties on t he implementation of Federal Disaster Relief Funds. The prior CCP governed the four -year period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2019. The new planning cycle, which is four years, encompasses January 2020 to December 2023. SSA Planning Standards . Additionally, in 2008, the SSA established planning processes and quality standards that required: 1) state certification of CCP compliance with all Chapter 51 and the SSA planning requirements as a condition of recommending the release of county AEREF and other state discretionary funding; 2) engagement of community stakeholders in a formal community needs assessment based upon state and local data describing substance abuse treatment needs and gaps in the delivery of services required to meet those needs; 3) a logic model of the interrelationships of needs, goals, objectives, strategies, resource allocations and outcomes for prevention, early intervention, treatment, and recovery services; 4) one system - level change to enhance the local continuum -of-care; 5) an action and resource allocation plan that implements the CCP according to its goals, objectives, strategies and intended outcomes; 6) a draft RFP for the provision of those services that would implement the CCP in accordance with its corresponding planned resource allocation; and 7) establishment of an annual plan implementation and outcomes monitoring procedure to document plan implementation obstacles encountered and corrective actions taken to overcome them. Thus, the SSA, in collaboration with its partner county governments has established planning standards intended to produce rational, goal -oriented, data -driven county plans for the development of the full continuum of care from primary prevention through recovery support. The SSA supplies c ounties with data from the SSA's needs assessment program. For instance, the counties review: a) primary data obtained from the household survey , b) secondary social indicator data from the county and municipal chart books, c) administrative data from sou rces like NJ-SAMS and facility licensure . The SSA's County Planning Guidelines also encourage county behavioral health planners to incorporate local perceptions of substance abuse issues and treatment system capacity by means of county focus groups and ot her encouragements to citizen participation . The SSA provides planning education, training, and technical assistance to the county directors throughout the process. Future Developments in the State -County Collaborative Planning Process . For the 2016- 2019 planning cycle, the SSA will continue to assist counties with planning data and analyses as well as understanding of federal and state level changes to health care delivery that will affect access to care for their residents. It will co ntinue to help counties identify and implement a greater number of evidence -based prevention education programs and encourage counties to participate in planning environmental approaches to prevention at the county and municipal levels . It will encourage counties to increase their investments in recovery support services in order to help treated individuals maintain the benefits of clinical services, forestall relapses, and when necessary, return to treatment sooner before clinical treatment needs become s evere.

The NJ Prevention Collaborative includes members from the New Jersey Division of Mental H ealth and Addiction Services ( DMHAS ), New Jersey Prevention Network (NJPN) , Rutgers Center for Prevention Science ( RU-CPS), and the Governor's Council on Al coholism and Drug Abuse (GCADA). The Prevention Technology Transfer Center operated by RU -CPS provided state-level technical assistance to this state -level group as well . It was decided to re -brand \"Prevention Unification\" and now this workgroup is referred to as the NJ Prevention Collaborative. The overall aim of the NJ Prevention Collaborative was to a lign all state-funded substance abuse prevention initiatives. The primary goals include the development of state -level logic models for underage drinking, prescription drug misuse, marijuana , and tobacco . These logic models will be used to integrate with the coalition logic models and then more locally, the alliances would use these to fit in their efforts. During the earlier meetings in the summer and fall of 2018, the team created a list of objectives, action steps, and an overall plan that included mil estones through the end of 2019. In the early planning, some of the expectations for what the state -level logic model included: Minimize service duplication and complement each other's work; build upon past success of prevention unification processes; cont inue alignment of regional coalitions, \"B\" grant providers, Municipal Alliances, and Division Substance Abuse Directors; determine state -wide priorities and solidify desired outcomes for prevention system; and support a state -wide cohesive message about wh at effective prevention looks like. The NJ Prevention Collaborative decided on a scope for the state-level logic models, which included the 17 Regional Coalitions, all Municipal Alliances, individual and family program providers, and Drug Free Communities grantees. These are also the entities that would act as primary users of the state -level logic models. Once the group decided on the overall objectives, scope, and intended audience, a planning process began. The NJ Prevention Collaborative started to meet regularly, from once a month to once a weekly, depending on the time and deadlines. RU-CPS started with an initial first step to extract data from the regional coalitions for inclusion in the state -wide logic models . This process began by extracting problem statements, roots causes, local conditions, strategies, and outcomes from all regional coalition logic models and organized databases with frequencies for each of the substance priorities: underage drinking, prescription drug misuse, marijuana, and tobacco. Several iterations of data extraction were conducted, and the group reviewed at each iteration and worked to condense data elements. NJPN extracted data from Drug -Free Community initiatives and DMHAS extracted data from prevention agencies with block grant funding (\"B grantees\"). Once all of these data sources were integrated, the group began to populate a state -wide logic model. Throughout the process, the members have presented on the NJ Prevention Collaborative to the different constituents in order to get all stakeholders involved in the process and to collect feedback along the way. For example, NJPN presented multiple times to the regional coalitions; GCADA presented to the county municipal coordinators and alliances; and DMHAS presented at their meetings. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 47 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 216 of 456The NJ Prevention Collaborative facilitated a statewide logic model presentation followed by a focus group in June 2019. Invited participants included regional coalition coordinators and municipal alliance coordinators whose agencies were representative of the state geographically and in terms of size (e.g. number of municipal alliances, funding resources, community partnerships, etc.). The statewide logic model was presented as an opportunity to acknowledge efforts at the state, regional, and municipal level while incorporating important factors cited in prevention literature. The logic model was also cited as a useful tool for identifying any gaps in the work being done and serve as a resource for coalitions to strategically address healt h disparities in their communities at the local level. The presentation was followed by a focus group in which participants expressed overall thoughts on the purpose of the logic models, cited potential challenges to successful implementation, and communic ated their expectations for their agency's role going forward. The final steps of the state -level logic models included the gathering of state level data to complete the problem statement for each of the 4 logic models. The goal is to include multiple data points for consumption patterns and consequences (i.e., crime indicators, injuries, ER visits, overdoses) for each logic model. These data points are state -level. RU -CPS led this step and built a database of over 300 outcome measures. Each data point was tracked for a minimum of three years in order to observe trends across time. Data points were collected for New Jersey as well as for the US, in order to compare New Jersey trends to the US. The NJ Prevention Collaborative reviewed all of these data elements and trends and then created a process for prioritization. It was decided to rank data indicators as high, medium, and low priority based on the prevalence of the problem, the trends over time, and how NJ compares to the US. All data points for the four substance priorities where then entered into a prioritization database, which showed prevalence, trends over time, and how NJ compares to the US in order for the group to make final decisions on which high and medium priority measures will be included int o the final state -level logic models. The group plans to finalize the prioritization process and create a list of interventions to be included in the final logic models. The NJ Prevention Collaborative plans to complete the four state-level logic models in the summer of 2019 and share them with the different state -funded groups and stakeholders. The efforts of the Prevention Collaborative will be shared with the regional coalitions for their continued assessment, planning, and evaluation processes for the ir regiona lly based prevention strategies and with the municipal alliances as they conduct their needs assessment process this Fall and Winter, 2019. Additionally, the group is working on a systems -level logic model for the state. 4.Data Gaps Older Adult Survey. Through its strategic planning processes, DMHAS determined that one of the top data gaps in New Jersey was the lack of information on the older adult population and the prevalence of substance use, misuse, and mental health issues within this group. The first New Jersey Older Adult Survey was conducted in 2012, with a total of 800 individuals living in New Jersey who were age 60 and older responding. DMHAS was awarded the Partnerships for Success grant by SAMHAS in 2013, and allocated funding to address the need for further research on this population relating to substance use and Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 48 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 217 of 456mental health issues. The overall goals of the New Jersey Older Adult Survey (NJOAS) were three- fold: (1) to assess the prevalence, risk, and protective factors of subs tance misuse and mental health issues among New Jersey older adults; (2) to obtain enough data to create small - area estimates of the prevalence of substance abuse and mental health for the target population in specific geographic areas; and (3) to analyze the results of the survey with the aim of providing policy suggestions to the state of New Jersey that would help better allocate resources for New Jersey older adults. In February 2014, Avalon Health Economics was contracted by Rutgers University School of Social Work and the New Jersey Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (NJ DMHAS) to conduct a needs -based survey among the New Jersey older adults. New Jersey was divided into four sections; Central, Metro, Northern, and Southern. The survey respondents represent each area equally (23%, 32%, 25%, 21%, respectively). The NJOAS instrument was developed and then implemented through telephone interviews, using random digit dialing sampling methods and stratified by four New Jersey regions. The survey instrument included items based on commonly used and validated subscales, to measure the prevalence of substance use and misuse, mental health issues, consequences of use, risk and protective factors, and basic demographic information (race, ethnici ty, education, job status, etc.). The sample was randomly selected from a database of over 600,000 New Jersey residents who were age 60 and older (older adults) at the time of the interview. A total of 3,701 responses were collected during October and December 2015. New Jersey was divided into four geographic sections; Central, Metro, Northern, and Southern. The survey respondents represent each area equally (23%, 32%, 25%, and 21%, respectively). The PFS team worked with the Technical Assistance Team through SAMHSA's Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies (CAPT) to meet with an expert in small -area estimation techniques. The CAPT team arranged for consultation with Dr. Robert E. Fay. Dr. Fay is a Westat Senior Statistician with more than 40 years of experience in multiple aspects of sample surveys to include survey design, estimation, variance estimation, imputation and analysis of missing data, statistical modeling of data from complex samples and small area estimation. As a consultant to the CAPT and in collaboration with the CAPT Epidemiology Team, Dr. Fay provided expert guidance on small area estimation to the state of New Jersey. The PFS team consulted with Dr. Fay in June 2017, and will meet again in August 2017, after the team incorporates his recommendations into their methodology to be used with the NJOAS results. Once the methodology is finalized, the PFS team will prepare a report of findings. Veteran's Survey . New Jersey continues to focus on returning Veterans as a priority population for its PFS initiative and other programming. This is another population for which there were limited data. DMHAS has reached out to New Jersey Department of Military and Veteran's Affairs a s well as the New Jersey National Guard to solicit their active participation on the SEOW and Advisory Council in light of this priority. DMHAS collaborated with its partners at Rutgers University and Avalon Health Economics to conduct a survey of returni ng Veterans in order to gather information about behavioral health issues and concerns within this population in New Jersey. Interviews were completed in late 2015. Almost 1200 New Jersey veterans responded to the survey. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 49 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 218 of 456Municipal Level Data. A critica l challenge for the 19 county prevention coalitions, as well as County Drug and Alcohol Directors, and Municipal Alliance Coordinators in New Jersey, has been the lack of available data at very specific and detailed geographic units of analysis (e.g., muni cipal, census tract, neighborhood, etc.). A social indicator database project was completed under the SPE grant which used a variety of methods to acquire new data and merge information from existing systems to provide a foundation for an integrated data i nfrastructure. Purposes of this database are: to help identify high need communities; promote data -driven planning; support funding allocation methods based on need; enhance capacity in local communities and strengthen their ability to identify meaningful local indicators; and to help produce community -level epidemiological profiles. 5.Current Gaps in the Substance Use Disorder Continuum of Care In order for clients who have a substance use disorder it is critical that there are recovery supports in place so clients can realize their full potential and clients have access to evidence- based treatment. The following areas have been identified by the SSA as areas that need enhancement. Relapse Prevention . Drug and alcohol rehab statistics show that the percentage of people who will relapse ranges from 50% to 90%. Data from NJSAMS for CY 15 indicated that of 48,638 individuals, 4,508 individuals experienced two or more episodes of care during the year. Of the 4,103 individuals who experienced two episodes, 52% re -entered care within three months and another 34% were back in treatment within three to six months. We plan to update these data for CY18. Our goal is to provide recovery supports to help these i ndividuals move to and remain in recovery for longer periods of time. Several activities proposed are designed with this purpose in mind, such as the Opioid Overdose Recovery Program, the Support Team for Addiction Recovery and the Telephone Recovery Support system. However, the latter two services are only being made possible by the STR grant DMHAS received, which is for two years , and rece ntly extended another two years with the SOR grant. Housing . Under the leadership of Governor Phil Murphy, New Jerse y has responded to the state's increasing number of opiate overdose deaths and adverse events with numerous initiatives. Stable, affordable housing is a crucial component of recovery for individuals with substance use disorders. Supportive housing combines affordable housing with services that help people who face the most complex challenges to live with stability, autonomy and dignity. Supportive housing has been proven as an effective solution to ending homelessness for active substance users; barrier -free housing provides a necessary platform to access a variety of services, participate in long -term recovery and give individuals the opportunity to engage in important community roles. One such RFP address ed individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD) throughout the state who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. DMHAS solicited proposals from potential community partners to provide individualized case management and supportive services to consumers with an OUD, on average, up to 8 hours per month, billable in 15 units, based on individual needs. These services will assist individuals in seeking and connecting with behavioral health and or physical healthcare needs . DMHAS will provide 200 rental subsidies, Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 50 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 219 of 456up to the fair market rate (FMR) as defined by the Department of Community Affairs (DCA) for lease based housing. One -time funding will be available to consumers for security deposits, utility start- up costs and furnishings. Contracts were awarded four agenci es to serve individuals in five counties: Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Mercer and Monmouth. Another such RFP , DMHAS solicited proposals from potential community partners to pilot three recovery based housing residences (a minimum of five individuals i n each residence), one in each region, for individuals with an OUD who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and are in or recently discharged from treatment. Housing provided must be licensed as a Class F, Cooperative Sober Living Residence (NJAC \u00a7 5:27). Accordingly, individuals will be responsible for providing their own food and taking care of their own laundry. Treatment and counseling may not be provided in the residence; however, non- clinical recovery support services may be provided at the site and the agency may require, at its discretion, drug or alcohol testing of residents. (NJAC \u00a7 5:27- 2.1). This RFP calls for individualized case management and sober housing servi ces for 15 individuals (a minimum of five individuals in each region) who have been identified as needing a safe, healthy, peer -lead, recovery -oriented environment. Contracts were awarded to three agencies with each serving one region of the state (North, Central and South). DMHAS has 166 supported housing slots for individuals with a substance use disorder : two 31 bed programs in Camden and Atlantic counties , a 10 bed program for women in Somerset county , and 94 supportive housing subsidies funded by the Supplemental Social Service Block Grant (SSBG). Supportive housing is a suc cessful, cost -effective, combination of affordable housing with services that help people live more stable, productive lives. It offers permanent housing with services that work for individuals and families who face complex challenges such as homelessness and/or have serious and persistent issues that may include substance use, mental illness, and HIV/AIDS. Studies cited by the Corporation for Supportive Housing (CSH) indicate that supportive housing has positive impacts on reducing or ending substance use. Once people with histories of substance use achieve sobriety, their living situation is often a factor in their ability to stay clean and sober. According to the Kentucky Interagency Council on Homelessness (KICH), a one - year follow -up study of 201 graduates of the Eden Programs chemical dependency treatment programs in Minneapolis found that 56.6% of those living independently remained sober, 56.5% of those living in a halfway house remained sober, while 90% of those living in supportive housing re mained sober. An additional 10 beds were created for women with children known as the Women's Intensive Supported (WISH) program. There are also studies that documented positive impacts on health with decreases of more than 50% in tenants' emergency room visits and hospital inpatient days; decreases in tenants' use of emergency detoxification services by more than 80%; and increases in the use of preventive health care services. Positive impacts on employment have also been found, with increases of 50% in earned income and 40% in the rate of participant employment when employment services are provided in supportive housing. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 51 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 220 of 456Recovery Centers . There is a need for DMHAS to develop more Recovery Centers. T here were only two state funded centers: Eva's Village in Paterson and Living Proof in Voorhees. Recovery support is an essential part of the continuum of care since addiction is a chronic biologically based disease of the brain and as such requires a system of care designed to treat a chronic condition rather than an acute illness. With other chronic conditions, e.g., diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, that are characterized by periods of wellness and acute episodes of care, the care system and intervention are designed to manage the illness in order to promote sustained periods of wellness and eliminate or minimize the need for acute care. Similarly, the addiction treatment system must adapt so as to support the process of sustained recovery. Through Recovery Centers, DMHAS intends to expand the continuum of care to include an array of services that support individuals in their recovery from addiction. Recognizing the need to support individuals in their pathway to recovery, a Recovery Center is a place where individuals who have completed or left trea tment, or who have never entered formal treatment, can find a nurturing and empowering environment in which they can learn new skills and develop a social network. A Recovery Center will help prevent relapse and provide support for sustained recovery with in the community. Services will be provided by peers who will also serve as positive role models. During 2018, there were 87,516 discharges from substance abuse treatment in New Jersey. Of these, 22,846 or 25%, quit or dropped out of treatment. While ALL clients can benefit from recovery support services, those clients who did not complete treatment may find recovery support beneficial and a gateway back into treatment and/or sustained recovery. It is clear that there are significant numbers of people who could benefit from ongoing recovery programs. While these figures are drawn from those who enter the formal treatment system, there is a group of people of unknown size who have never accessed formal treatment who could also benefit from recovery serv ices. This will also be an opportunity for those for whom access to treatment is not possible or delayed due to insufficient capacity within the system. The DMHAS Recovery Center s offer training, social, educational and recreational opportunities. There a re classes focused on wellness, nutrition and illness management, including classes on self -care, stress management, financial management, literacy education, job, and parenting skills. Housing assistance (e.g., finding apartments and roommates) is provide d, and telephone support is available to Recovery Center participants. It is expected that this peer -delivered service will result in improved social functioning, reduced substance abuse and an improved quality of life, including more social connectedness . DMHAS has expanded Recovery Centers through the SOR funding. Funding has been issued in 2019 through a Request for Proposals (RFP) to develop Community Peer Recovery Centers (CPRC) where individuals can access peer support, information about substance use disorder treatment, recovery support services, and information about other community resources in a supportive substance free environment. DMHAS has awarded three providers in the amount of $100,000 each which is for start -up small -scale Recovery Centers to provide peer -to-peer recovery support services to prevent recurrent of substance use and promote sustained recovery. Providers are required to provide peer -to-peer recovery support services that are responsive to community needs. All activities and se rvices are led and drive by \"peers\", individuals who have experienced addiction and recovery, either directly or indirectly as a family member or friend. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 52 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 221 of 456The overall goal of the CPRC is to provide a safe place for recovering individuals to gather in suppor t of one another and experience sober living in a community setting. The CPRC will be a place where those in recovery can have the opportunity to give back to their community thereby fostering senses of empowerment and independence. DMHAS will be issuing another RFP in early Summer 2019 using SOR supplemental grant funds for expansion of seven additional CPRCs. Recovery Case Management . There were no formal case management services in the addiction service system. Research indicates that substance- dependent individuals who have prompt access to a full continuum of services that address individual client needs and co -morbidities experience improved recovery outcomes. Kirk (2007) describes a client -centered service delivery model that promotes access to a b road array of services, reduces the frequency and duration of acute care episodes, and facilitates client stabilization in the \"recovery zone\". The term \"recovery zone\" refers to a state of sustained recovery characterized by long periods of abstinence, ga inful employment, stable housing, and supportive and rewarding social and spiritual connectedness. Recovery case management (RCM) interventions that support clients' entrance into and maintenance within the recovery zone not only improves the quality of li fe for substance - dependent individuals but reduces the cost of their care by promoting access to non- residential treatment and recovery support services which are less costly than acute residential care. A client's movement into the recovery zone varies de pending on individual needs; successful recovery case management depends upon a strength -based approach that recognizes client competencies. RCM seeks to encourage a client's mastery over their substance use disorder , thus increasing the likelihood of an individual's sustained engagement in the recovery zone. DMHAS proposes the inclusion of recovery case management within our current system of care to reduce service fragmentation, promote service continuity, and increase clients' capacity to manage their chronic health condition. With STR funding, DMHAS was able to create 10 Support Teams for Addiction Recovery (STAR). Additional SOR funding allowed the creation of two more STAR programs, and the SOR supplemental funding will allow the development of 9 more STAR programs. This will result in statewide coverage. Medication Assisted Treatment. NJSAMS data indicated while heroin plus other opiates were the primary drugs accounting for 50%, or 45,129, of New Jersey's treatment admissions during 2018, the use of either methadone (15%) or buprenorphine ( 7%), a total of just 22%, was in the treatment plan for these admissions , a difference of 28% . The number of people who entered either opioid maintenance - outpatient or - intensive outpatient was only 13% (11,091). This difference of 37% for a level of care that uses MAT, demonstrates a large gap between the number of people using heroin and other opiates admitted to treatment vs. the number receiving the most effective, evidence- based treatment available. Based on our data and experience with our Opioid Overdose Recovery Program the greatest treatment need is for ambulatory substance use disorder treatment programs that offer Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) in the forms of methadone, buprenorphine and Vivitrol. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM Page 53 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 222 of 456Increasing this capacity could significantly reduce the demand for Inpatient Withdrawal Management ( IWM) as well as other residential treatment services . Ambulatory Withdrawal Management . Currently there are 13 licensed providers in NJ that provide Ambulatory Withdrawal Management (AWM) . This is a service that would be of great benefit to individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) as an option to the more costly , and not always clinically indicated, IWM . Public Awareness Campaign. DMHAS, in partner ship with the Department Human Services (DHS), Office of Public Relations, is currently seeking a vendor to deliver a campaign to help eliminate stigma and discrimination around the use of MAT. Various forms of messaging will be utilized including social media targeted to different audiences. DMHAS believes this campaign will assist the public in understanding that MAT is a best practice and should be considered when seeking treatment for an OUD. Family Support Services . There were no formal family support service s in the NJ addiction treatment system. Also, it has been reported that the Addiction Hotline is receiving a significant number of calls from families. DMHAS is committed to helping parents and other family members struggling with their loved one's OUD. The STR grant now support s three regional Family Support Centers (FSC) each staffed by two full-time Family Support Coordinator s with lived experience trained in the Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training (CRAFT) model. CRAFT teaches families self -protection along with non- confrontational skills to help empower their loved one to seek recovery. The FSC also offer s families support, education, resources and advocacy in an environment that is safe and non- stigmatizing. It is expected that each FSC will serve 50 families. When parents and family members of young adults who use illicit substances, abuse prescription drugs and other opiates seek access to treatment or recovery resources, navigating the treatment world can be an overwhelming experience. Families are often frustrated and dealing with many emotions. At the same time , they are worried about their loved one's life, their safety, and suffer through each crisis. Many parents and family members feel isolated with no supports and often face stigmatization about their loved one with an OUD. They are trying to figure out what the next step will be, and how their decision affects their loved one . Narcan Reversals and Follow -up Treatment . One of the gaps identified through the SSA's data is the need to engage individuals who have undergone a naloxone reversal to enter treatment. The data clearly demonstrates that most individuals who experience a reversal do not enter treatment. Despite 16,082 Narcan administrations in New Jersey from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, NJSAMS data indicated that during that same period, there were only 1,897 admissions who reported a Narcan administration \"in the past 30 days.\" This difference of 14,185 demonstrates that: a) very few persons who undergo a Narcan reversal access treatment and b) closing this gap will require effort to reach out to such individuals and encourage them to enter substance use disorder treatment, ideally at programs providing MAT. As a result , DMHAS is developing strategies to reduce this gap. Using STR funding, brochures have been pri nted which will be given to individuals who refuse transport to the hospitals by EMS that provides a list of resources for follow -up help. The brochures are tailored by county. Using SOR funding, Opioid Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 54 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 223 of 456Overdose Response Teams (OORT) are being designed. Th ese teams will be part of those OORPs when there is a high number of individuals who refuse transport to the ED after being reversed with Narcan. The teams will reach out to these individuals within 48 hours of their reversal. Gaps Observed by the New Jer sey Behavioral Health Planning Council . The New Jersey Behavioral Health Planning Council (BHPC) previously developed a white paper expressing concerns with the wait to admission into residential withdrawal management. The SSA invested a significant amount of funding into residential withdrawal management in FY 17. Funds were added to the SAPTI fee -for-service initiative for this level of care and a new STORI treatment initiative was developed using STR funds which include d residential withdrawal management. In addition, ambulatory withdrawal management was added to this initiative once the rates were finalized. At the June 2019 BHPC meeting , new gaps identified were : 1) a key barrier to MAT for opioid SUD is transportation and homelessness and 2) services for older adults with opioid addictions. With regards to older adults, DMHAS has made five awards for programs to educate older adults on alternate strategies for opioid prescriptions using STR funds, another five awards using SOR funds , and released an RF P for 11 more older adult programs using SOR supplemental grant funds . 6.Addressing Needs and Gaps of Services of Special/Target Populations Pregnant Women and Women with Dependent Children. In 2014 as a SAMHSA Prescription Drug Abuse Policy Academy State, New Jersey was eligible to apply for a unique technical assistance opportunity through the SAMHSA supported National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare (NCSACW) to address the multi -faceted problems of Substance Exposed Infants (SEI) and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). The Department of Human Services, Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services ( DHS/DMHAS ) as the lead State agency partnered with the Department of Childre n and Families ( DCF ) and Department of Health (DOH) and submitted a successful application for In- Depth Technical Assistance (IDTA) (no funding attached). The IDTA goal was to develop uniform policies/guidelines that address the entire spectrum of NAS and SEI from pre -pregnancy, prevention, early intervention, assessment and treatment, postpartum and early childhood. The IDTA would also provide assistance to New Jersey to strengthen collaboration and linkages across multiple systems such as addictions treatment, child welfare, and medical communities to improve services for pregnant women with opioid and other substance use disorders and outcomes for their babies. The New Jersey IDTA Core Team included over 60 individuals representing multiple State Depart ments and Divisions, community stakeholders, treatment providers, and the medical community. The IDTA established three goals: (1) Increase perinatal SEI screening at multiple intervention points (Health system, SUD/MH system); (2) Leverage existing progr ams and policy mechanisms to collaboratively increase the rate at which women screening positive on the 4P's Plus get connected for a comprehensive assessment by establishing formal warm -handoffs and other safety net measures; (3) Leverage existing program s and policy mechanisms to Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 55 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 224 of 456collaboratively increase the rate at which women delivering SEIs and their babies and any other eligible children, receive early support services for which they are eligible. Three workgroups convened: (1) Data Workgroup looked at statewide data systems (Medicaid ICD codes and DOH) that capture prenatal screening, linkage to treatment services, follow -up for parenting women, prevalence of NAS and associated costs. During the initiative, the team analyzed 2013 and 2014 Medicaid da ta to establish prevalence and costs of treatment NAS. (2) Prenatal Screening, Early Identification of Infants & Referral to Service Workgroup focused on how to increase connections to appropriate treatment and supportive services such as Central Intake and Perinatal Cooperatives, by mapping out current screening and referral practices across the state using Pregnancy Risk Assessment (PRA) data; New Jersey implemented the 4Ps+ across the State and embedded the tool within the PRA. The workgroup found high utilization (over 80%) of 4Ps+ within doctors serving pregnant women on Medicaid. The mapping allowed the team to target low utilization areas to increase the prevalence of prenatal screening. (3) Labor, Delivery and Engagement (Infants) Workgroup developed a comprehensive survey with input from the medical community and perinatal cooperatives. The Hospital Birth Survey was disseminated statewide March 2017 to the labor and delivery hospitals. The survey sought to understand how pregnant women with SUD and substance -exposed infants are identified, treated, and triaged with partners at discharge, and if treatment for NAS was explored. The Hospital Birth Survey results is intended to guide Departments in establishing statewide guidelines for best pract ice; aid in the development of cross system models to ensure families get access to services; establish education needs on issues of SEI/NAS and identify high risk areas. Throughout the IDTA process the Core team reported to the State Opioid Workgroup. T he Opioid Workgroup was comprised of representatives from multiple State departments and their divisions. The Opioid Workgroup engaged the support and commitment of Department -level commissioners in directing the resources and expertise of their particula r department to address the issue of opioids and its attendant problems. In order to sustain the work completed in IDTA, the Opioid Workgroup recommended the establishment of a systemic approach to infant substance exposure, prevention and intervention. The Opioid Workgroup developed an interagency workgroup to promote improved outcomes for SEIs and their families . Although, this workgroup is no longer convened, a monthly Opioid Workgroup meeting is convened under the leadership of Governor Murphy's P olicy Office, that includes high level leadership representing different state departments including the Department of Human Services ( DMHAS and the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services), Department of Corrections, Department of Law and Publi c Safety, Department of Labor and Workforce Development, Department of Health and Department of Children and Families. The IDTA commenced in 2017, however, DMHAS as the IDTA lead state agency requested modified technical assistance from the NCSACW to support New Jersey to interpret the key findings from the Birthing Hospital Survey , and apply these findings to the Project ECHO (Extending Comm unity Health Outcomes ) program design. Robert Wood Johnson and the Nicholson Foundation, in partnership with the three Departments (Health, Human Service s, and Children and Families) and other stakeholders began planning to launch Project ECHO for SEIs. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 56 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 225 of 456The New Jersey Project ECHO is aimed at Statewide adoption of best practice clinical care and community -based intervent ions to support SEIs and their parents to support recovery, family formation, and child development through a multidisciplinary case -based learning platform. Project ECHO for SEI and parents focuses on prevention, birth, and the infant's first year of lif e. DCF is the lead State agency on Plans of Safe Care for SEI, mothers and their families and has developed protocols for integrating Plans of Safe Care into child protection services and child welfare and child welfare assessments. Child Welfare/Par ents with Dependent Children Programs . July 1, 2015, the treatment contracts for parents with substance use disorders via a Memorandum of Understanding between the SSA and DCF Division of Child Protection & Permanency (DCP&P) transitioned to DCF. DCF and DMHAS collaborate on multiple initiatives targeted to pregnant and parenting women with substance use disorders. This partnership focuses on a coordinated multisystem approach to enhance and integrate service delivery that will ultimately improve the outcomes for the women, their infants and families. This cross -system collaboration ensures that services are coordinated , and information is shared appropriately to facilitate better communication, maximize resources and address barriers. Currently, 12 of New Jersey's 21 counties have monthly DCP&P Child Welfare Substance Use Disorder Consortia meetings which are held at the local DCP&P offices. Child welfare staff, DMHAS, Division of Family Development, Substance Use Disorder Provider Agencies, Work First New Jersey, Substance Abuse Initiative (WFNJ SAI) providers, and Boards of Social Services meet each month and plan on how to better serve families, leading to more effective policies and practices to meet the needs of infants, children and families. The Consortia also addresses ASFA timelines and reunification for children in out of home placement. Through collaboration, multiple agencies working with the same family can improve communication to reduce the gaps in service delivery and improve coordination of services. The Consortia allow for cross systems collaboration with local treatment programs and other community partners who can provide the expertise needed to better serve families in the child welfare system. Women's Intensive Supportive Housing Program . Th e Women's Intensive Supportive Housing (WISH) program develops permanent supportive housing for pregnant and/or parenting women with a co -existing substance abuse disorder and mental illness who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and being discharged from a licensed long -term residential substance abuse treatment and/or halfway house facility. The WISH team provide s case management and supportive housing services fo r 10 women and their children. DMHAS outpatient treatment system accommodates the substance use disorder treatment needs of the project participants. In addition to WISH, DMHAS has provided additional subsidies to DCP&P to develop housing for parents with children in the child welfare system. Maternal Wraparound Pro gram. The Maternal Wraparound Program ( M-WRAP) is a statewide program that provides intensive case management and recovery support services for opioid dependent pregnant and postpartum women. Opioid dependent pregnant women are eligible for services thro ugh M-WRAP during pregnancy and up to one year after birth event. Intensive case Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 57 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 226 of 456management focuses on developing a single, coordinated care plan for pregnant/postpartum women, their infants and families. Intensive Case Managers work as liaisons to all r elevant entities involved with each woman. Recovery Support Specialists provide non- clinical assistance and recovery supports while maintaining follow -up with the women and their infants. Integrated Opioid Treatment Services and Substance Exposed Infants (IOT -SEI). In December 2017 the Department of Health (DOH) awarded funding through a Request for Applications (RFA) for the expansion of integrated opioid treatment services and substance exposed infants (IOT -SEI). DMHAS manages the IOT -SEI Initiative which provides an array of services for opioid dependent pregnant women, their infants and family ranging from substance use disorder treatment, prenatal and postpartum medical/obstetric services, care coordination, recovery -based living arrangements, wrap around services such as intensive case management and recovery supports. The overall goal is to improve outcomes for pregnant women with opioid use disorder, their infant and families. This initiative promotes maternal health, improve birth outcomes and reduce the risks and adverse consequences of prenatal substance exposure. Five agencies across the State are participating in this initiative. Tuberculosis (TB) Services. In New Jersey, all substance use disorder treatment facilities receiving contracts are required to conduct TB testing as part of the patients' admissions process. A provision of the guidelines require that patients with TB, who were not admitted for treatment because the funded capacity at that facility had been exceeded, would be refer red to another treatment provider for services. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 58 of 58 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 227 of 456Planning Steps Quality and Data Collection Readiness Narrative Question: Health surveillance is critical to SAMHSA's ability to develop new models of care to address substance abuse and mental illness. SAMHSA provides decision makers, researchers and the general public with enhanced information about the extent of substance abuse and mental illness, how systems of care are organized and financed, when and how to seek help, and effective models of care, including the outcomes of treatment engagement and recovery. SAMHSA also provides Congress and the nation reports about the use of block grant and other SAMHSA funding to impact outcomes in critical areas, and is moving toward measures for all programs consistent with SAMHSA's NBHQF . The effort is part of the congressionally mandated National Quality Strategy to assure health care funds - public and private - are used most effectively and efficiently to create better health, better care, and better value. The overarching goals of this effort are to ensure that services are evidence-based and effective or are appropriately tested as promising or emerging best practices; they are person/family-centered; care is coordinated across systems; services promote healthy living; and, they are safe, accessible, and affordable. SAMHSA is currently working to harmonize data collection efforts across discretionary programs and match relevant NBHQF and National Quality Strategy (NQS) measures that are already endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF) wherever possible. SAMHSA is also working to align these measures with other efforts within HHS and relevant health and social programs and to reflect a mix of outcomes, processes, and costs of services. Finally, consistent with the Affordable Care Act and other HHS priorities, these efforts will seek to understand the impact that disparities have on outcomes. For the FY 2016-2017 Block Grant Application, SAMHSA has begun a transition to a common substance abuse and mental health client-level data (CLD) system. SAMHSA proposes to build upon existing data systems, namely TEDS and the mental health CLD system developed as part of the Uniform Reporting System. The short-term goal is to coordinate these two systems in a way that focuses on essential data elements and minimizes data collection disruptions. The long-term goal is to develop a more efficient and robust program of data collection about behavioral health services that can be used to evaluate the impact of the block grant program on prevention and treatment services performance and to inform behavioral health services research and policy. This will include some level of direct reporting on client-level data from states on unique prevention and treatment services purchased under the MHBG and SABG and how these services contribute to overall outcomes. It should be noted that SAMHSA itself does not intend to collect or maintain any personal identifying information on individuals served with block grant funding. This effort will also include some facility-level data collection to understand the overall financing and service delivery process on client-level and systems-level outcomes as individuals receiving services become eligible for services that are covered under fee-for-service or capitation systems, which results in encounter reporting. SAMHSA will continue to work with its partners to look at current facility collection efforts and explore innovative strategies, including survey methods, to gather facility and client level data. The initial draft set of measures developed for the block grant programs can be found at http://www.samhsa.gov/data/quality-metrics/block- grant-measures . These measures are being discussed with states and other stakeholders. To help SAMHSA determine how best to move forward with our partners, each state must identify its current and future capacity to report these measures or measures like them, types of adjustments to current and future state-level data collection efforts necessary to submit the new streamlined performance measures, technical assistance needed to make those adjustments, and perceived or actual barriers to such data collection and reporting. The key to SAMHSA's success in accomplishing tasks associated with data collection for the block grant will be the collaboration with SAMHSA's centers and offices, the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD), the National Association of State Alcohol Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD), and other state and community partners. SAMHSA recognizes the significant implications of this undertaking for states and for local service providers, and anticipates that the development and implementation process will take several years and will evolve over time. For the FY 2016-2017 Block Grant Application reporting, achieving these goals will result in a more coordinated behavioral health data collection program that complements other existing systems (e.g., Medicaid administrative and billing data systems; and state mental health and substance abuse data systems), ensures consistency in the use of measures that are aligned across various agencies and reporting systems, and provides a more complete understanding of the delivery of mental health and substance abuse services. Both goals can only be achieved through continuous collaboration with and feedback from SAMHSA's state, provider, and practitioner partners. SAMHSA anticipates this movement is consistent with the current state authorities' movement toward system integration and will minimize challenges associated with changing operational logistics of data collection and reporting. SAMHSA understands modifications to data collection systems may be necessary to achieve these goals and will work with the states to minimize the impact of these changes. States must answer the questions below to help assess readiness for CLD collection described above: 1.Briefly describe the state's data collection and reporting system and what level of data is able to be reported currently (e.g., at the client, program, provider, and/or other levels). 2.Is the state's current data collection and reporting system specific to substance abuse and/or mental health services clients, or is it part of a larger data system? If the latter, please identify what other types of data are collected and for what populations (e.g., Medicaid, child welfare, Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 1 of 8 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 228 of 456etc.). 3.Is the state currently able to collect and report measures at the individual client level (that is, by client served, but not with client-identifying information)? 4.If not, what changes will the state need to make to be able to collect and report on these measures? Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. OMB 2 of 8 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 229 of 456The Single State Authority on Substance Abuse (SSA) Quality and Data Collection Readiness 1. Briefly describe the state's data collection and reporting system and what level of data is able to be reported currently (e.g., at the client, program, provider, and/or other levels) . The SSA has several key information systems, described below, that provide information on a variety of levels. Depending on the system , information is able to be reported at the client, program, provider, and encounter level . Information systems exist for treatment, prevention , fiscal /contract management, billing , staff licensure and other specialty programs . New Jersey Substance Abuse Monitoring System ( NJSAMS ) The client level data system, known as the New Jersey Substance Abuse Monitoring System (NJSAMS) was developed and implemented in 2005 by the SSA to be a real -time, web -based substance abuse treatment data collection and reporting system. The system is re quired to be used by all licensed substance abuse treatment providers in New Jersey, regardless of whether or not they contract with the SSA. It collects basic demographic, substance use, financial, clinical and service information on all clients enrolled and served in New Jersey's substance use disorder treatment system. Encounter data are collected and reported for services that may have different payers . The system consists of numerous modules and contains all the clinical assessments providers are requ ired to complete. There are 288 licensed providers reporting on NJSAMS, representing 439 sites with 2884 active users . There are also 190 Intoxicated Driver Resource Center (IDRC) affiliated providers representing 237 sites and 75 active users. In 2018 th ere were 89,629 admissions to treatment. NJSAMS was developed over time under the initial auspices of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT). The purpose was to develop the state's capacity to use web -based information technology for the colle ction and reporting of data necessary to meet Federal Performance Partnership Grant (PPG) and Government Reporting and Results Act ( GPRA ) reporting requirements. NJSAMS was developed in response to the need for: timelier reporting on substance use disord er treatment episodes, better monitoring of client outcomes, quality improvement, better client placement, and tracking of treatment through the continuum of care. The NJSAMS website is hosted by the Rutgers University Computer Center under a Memorandum o f Agreement with the SSA. It is a secure web -based system designed to collect confidential health information and is HIPAA and 42CFR compliant. A major IT accomplishment was the complete re -architecture of NJSAMS, which was originally written in classic ASP and included numerous webpages making data entry slow. Work began on this project in September 2011 and the new system was successfully launch ed mid -November 2013. NJSAMS was programmed in -house. The NJSAMS includes the latest Addiction Severity Index V.5, the Level of Care Index (LOCI -3), DSM -5, as well as additional modules that can collect further information on client care and needs. The system is capable of producing the Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 3 of 8 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 230 of 456CSAT National Outcome Measures (NOMs) and generates the data needed for Provider Performance Reports. Data from NJSAMS are used to fulfill Block Grant reporting requirements and are also submitted quarterly to the Treatment Episode Data System (TEDS). The system contains nearl y 1000 data elements and over 1 million records, dating back to 2006. The new system is based on Object Oriented Programming (OOP) specifications, used Microsoft best practices, programmed in C#, developed in a .NET framework and runs on SQL server 2012. A tiered programming design was utilized with a presentation layer for the user interface (UI), a business layer for the business logic and a data access layer for interaction with database. It has a new user friendly interface that utilizes accordion tech nology. New items have been added to reflect current system issues, e.g., chronic disease, Narcan reversals, etc., while old ones were retired. This new system is scalable, i.e., able to handle a growing amount of work in a capable manner, streamlined and fast. The new NJSAMS was migrated to a new faster web server, with additional RAM added. There was a dramatic improvement in performance and less maintenance is now required due to the new design. It is a relational database that has been normalized with no redundancy in data entry. NJSAMS provides encryption both in transit and at rest. Due to its flexible design, additional data elements or modules can be easily added to meet any new federal reporting requirements or other treatment system considerations . The system continues with new releases as additional functionality is added. In 2015 the system was modified for utilization by the Interim Management Entity (IME). Fiscal Intermediary MIS A Fiscal Agent Billing system contract was awarded to the C omputer Sciences Corporation (CSC) through an open competitive bid. This system went live July 1, 2010. The CSC system is a web -based billing system for all of the SSA's fee -for-service (FFS) initiatives: Drug Court, Mutual Agreement Program - State Parole Board (MAP -SPB), South Jersey Initiative ( SJI), Medication Assisted Treatment Initiative ( MATI ), Driving Under the Influence Initiative New Jersey Statewide Initiative ( Abuse Prevention & Treatment ( SAPT ), State Hospital Access to Rehabilitation and Education ( SHARE ) and State Targeted Opioid Response Initiative ( STORI ) and the Co -Occurring Network. The amount of funding dedicated to these initiatives was approximately $72 million for FY 2019 and $71 million is avail able for FY 2020. Many of these initiatives require the provider to first obtain prior authorization from the Interim Managing Entity (IME) in order to provide treatment services other than outpatient, and then submit a request via a web service to CSC for authorization approval. Providers then submit their claims through the CSC system for payment. CSC confirms all information prior to paying any bill and verifies all requests for services through the NJSAMS Prior -Authorization Module. CSC reimburses and/or notifies the agency of claim status within 10 working days of receipt of the bill for all clients . Detailed service data are input which includes the CPT code. In CY 2018, there were 22,393 FFS admissions out of 89,629 total admissions. CSC and the SSA have developed an automated interface with NJSAMS to link services data reported in NJSAMS which correspond to the claim for payment. Appr oximately 1 million claims are processed each year. All the CSC billing data tables, approximately 76, are transferred to NJSAMS on a nightly basis to the SSA's server. This allows the SSA capability to analyze Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 4 of 8 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 231 of 456detailed encounter data. The information is easily linked to NJSAMS data so service utilization patterns can be analyzed by client characteristics and levels of care. This link includes service provider fields, services paid elements (service code, units, dates of service, amount, etc.) and client i dentifier elements. Prevention Outcomes Management System ( POMS ) The web -based Prevention Outcomes Management System (POMS) collects process data on evidence -based substance abuse prevention services that are delivered in New Jersey. This system went l ive in August 2009 and has been enhanced since that time. All New Jersey substance abuse prevention providers that receive SSA contracts are required to use the system for data reporting. POMS includes two modules that collect county -based prevention coal ition and education data. The system supports download of 1 -6 reports per module, and has 113 password -registered agency users (representing 25 agencies and 88 grants), 5 administrators, and 2 system administrators. Contracted agency users report data in to POMS via: (1) Environmental Module, and (2) Curriculum -based Module. The Environmental Module, deployed in March 2016, includes 10 items. It collects priority -specific data on implementation of CSAP strategies and engagement with community sectors. It also measures progress on: (1) the use of environmental strategies, (2) the development and enforcement of policies (and laws/ordinances) to: (a) Reduce Underage Drinking, (b) Reduce use of Illegal Substances, (c) Reduce Prescription Misuse Across the Lifespan, and (d) Reduce use of New and Emerging Drugs. The Environmental Module also collects data on media campaigns, public service announcements, and information that is shared with lawmakers, schools, and businesses. Quarterly reports for the Environ mental Module include summary data for each item of the questionnaire. These reports are used for program monitoring and evaluation. The POMS Curriculum -based module, updated and re -deployed in February 2018, collects priority -specific and summary demographic data for individuals that are served by evidence - based prevention education programs. It allows users to track participant atten dance, retention, and program completion levels. Curriculum -based data entry includes: (1) type of service, (2) target audience, (3) priority, (4) curriculum/program name, (5) county of service, (6) date of service, (7) number of individuals/families in attendance, and (8) applicable CSAP strategy. Curriculum -based reports include participant demographic data by county, priority, strategy, and curriculum. These reports are used for program monitoring. Contract Information Ma nagement System ( CIMS ) The Contract Information Management System (CIMS) is a web -based, paperless contract processing system that substance use disorder treatment and prevention providers use to submit their contract actions. CIMS went live July 1, 2010 for renewal contracts which included the electronic submission of the Annex B (budget). On January 1, 2011 the system went live for the Annex A and Programmatic Requirements. The four main areas CIMS was designed to address are: Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 5 of 8 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 232 of 456 ensure compliance with DH S contracting policies provide more accountability for the utilization of state funds improve transparency and tracking of SSA contracting develop a more efficient process for submitting, reviewing and approving contract documents Numerous enhancements have been added to the system since January 2011, including the addition of the quarterly Reports of Expenditure, as well as other management reports. Clinician Roster Information System ( CRIS ) The Clinician Roster Information System (CRIS) supports th e collection, review, and maintenance of provider agency clinical and medical staff information to ensure that each approved agency site meets licensure requirements for counselor credentialing as required by SSA regulations. Participating agencies are res ponsible for entering and maintaining up -to-date staff information through an accessible web -based portal. The system also facilitates reporting on systems -wide adherence to licensure requirements. The system was piloted in December 2011 and deployed in J anuary 2012. All outpatient providers are required to use the system and residential providers were encouraged to begin using it prior to the adoption of the SSA's Residential Regulations which occurred in July 2013. The CRIS is used by the Addictions Contract Monitoring Unit to ensure that the appropriate credentialing ratios are being met per Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS ) licensing regulations for substance use disorder treatment agencies. Agencies enter staff data into CRIS, review and update each quarter and certify that data was reviewed. The CRIS system also facilitates reporting on system -wide adherence to licensure requirements. If these steps are not being taken , this will result in a citatio n from DMHAS. The system will also begin to be utilized more strategically by the DMHAS Workforce Coordinator to help better identify workforce training needs. Performance Incentive Payment System (PIPS) Incentivizing prov ider performance or paying for performance (P4P) is an approach being explored to achieve better health and or behavioral health outcomes for clients. PIPS is a new system designed to track the attainment of key outcomes for participants in the Prison Intensive Recovery Treatment and Support Program (PIRTS). Eligible Offenders being released from Department of Corrections ( DOC ) custody who are receiving FDA approved medication assisted treatment (MAT) for an opioid use disorder ( OUD ) and will continue to receive MAT after their release from prison, and those Eligible Offenders who choose not to receive medication assisted treatment while incarcerated , are participants in the PIRTS program. The overall goal of PIRTS is to help individuals with an OUD who are being released from prison access the Recovery Zone. The outcome information is linked to client demographic, encounter , and clinical information so that factors that impact the attainment of outcomes can be determined. Performance -based incentives will be paid as follows: Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 6 of 8 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 233 of 456 Retention . If client remains in treatment for 90 days, payment will be $200. Relapse Prevention . If client remains in the community for 5 months after completion of an episode of care, payment will be $300. Recidivism. If client remains in the community for 6 months after release from prison, payment will be $300. Overdose Prevention . If client do es not experience an overdose for 6 months after admission to the PIRTS Program, payment will be $500. Stable Housing . If a client is placed by PIRTS and remains in housing for 6 months payment will be $300. Employment. If a client is placed by PIRTS in employment and remains for 6 months, payment will be $300. In order to assess whether clients remain in treatment for 90 days, client data from PIPS can be matched with client data in NJSAMS to determine what level of care the client is in and how long t hey remained in treatment. Maternal Wrap Around System (MWRAPS) The Maternal Wrap Around System ( MWRAPS ) is a new system that has been developed to capture information and outcomes on women who are participating in the MWRAP program. The data system will also be adapted to accommodate information on the women participating in our Integrated Opioid Treatment - Substance Exposed Infants (IOT -SEI) program. The system is capturing data on: basic demographic information , treatment and substance use information , and birth and child outcomes . Since the data are client level, various analyses can be conducted to determine what client characteristics are related to the various outcomes. It will help us understand the impact of both the MWRAP and IOT -SEI programs on outcomes for the mother and child and allow us to t rack and analyze changes over time on key variables ( e.g., treatment engagement ). Opioid Overdose Recovery Program System (OORPS) A data collection system has been designed to collect detailed information on clients who are brought to the emergency department after being reversed with naloxone and served by the Opioid Overdose Recovery Program (OORP) . Detailed demographic an d clinical information is collected on patients, as well as the follow -up provided by the Recovery Specialists and Patient Navigators, and the outcome of the visit. 2. Is the state's current data collection and reporting system specific to substance abuse and/or mental health services clients, or is it part of a larger data system? If the latter, please identify what other types of data are collected and for what populatio ns (e.g., Medicaid, child welfare, etc.) The DMHAS IT systems are segregated , i.e., specific for reporting substance abuse and mental health services data for clients , as well as for programs and fiscal information . The majority of the Division's data collection systems are customized to serve the unique client , and administrative needs of the SSA. The SSA data systems are all within DMHAS and not part of a Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 7 of 8 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 234 of 456larger system . Clients provided with substance use disorder (SUD) services are documented within the data systems of the SSA (e.g., NJSAMS, CSC Fiscal Intermediary System ). There are new systems developed for collecting data on the SSA's specialty programs for individuals released from prison, reversed from overdo ses and pregnant women. These systems include the capability to monitor outcomes throughout the course of the episode, and not just at admission and discharge. There are several extra -Divisional datasets that contain information on the SUD population whic h is collected at the Department level (e.g ., the Department of Human Services' Unusual Incident Management and Reporting System [UIRMS ]), and inter -divisional level by the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services' NJ Medicaid Management Informat ion System (NJMMIS). Children's data are reported separately by the NJ Department of Children and Families, which is autonomous and administratively separate from the SSA and the NJ Department of Human Services. 3. Is the state currently able to collect and report on measures at the individual client level (that is, by client served, but not with client -identifying information) ? As a result of our IT systems, the SSA can report any of its data at the client level (demographic, clinical, financial, encoun ter, etc.). Currently it reports on all Treatment Episode Data System (TEDS) items, which includes the System Data Set (SDS), the Minimum Data Set (MDS) and the Supplemental Data Set (SuDS). The SSA has been reporting TEDS data through NJSAMS for many yea rs. The Fiscal Agent system allows the SSA to determine costs for episodes of care and by specific services for each client . Since we utilize algorithms to create client IDs, we are able to report on clients served without client -identifying information. 4. If not, what changes will the state need to make to be able to collect and report on these measures? The SSA does not need to make any changes to collect and report client level data. With the to tal re-design of the SSA client level reporting system , which was released in November 2013 , the system is scalable and additional items that may be needed in the future can be easily added. Most recently, new client eligibility criteria related to OUD were added as a result of the State Targeted Response (STR) grant DMHAS received from SAMHSA .

Objective: Increase number of pregnant women or women with children entering substance abuse treatment. Strategies to attain the objective: Annual provider meetings include licensed women's treatment providers who provide gender specific treatment and system partners. Attendees, the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) women's treatment coordinator, representatives from NJ Department of Children and Families (DCF), Division of Family Development (DFD), Work First New Jersey Substance Abuse Imitative (WFNJ-SAI) and other relevant stakeholders. Meeting address issues related to best practices such as retention, engagement, access and referrals, recovery supports, medication assisted treatment, systems collaboration, Substance Exposed Infants (SEI) and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) and training needs. Professional development - women's treatment provider contract requirements include service elements and language from the National Association of State Alcohol/Drug Abuse Directors (NASADAD) \"Guidance to States: Treatment Standards for Women with Substance Use Disorders\" document that emphasizes best practice. Contracted providers are required to address the full continuum of treatment services: family-centered treatment, evidence- based parenting programs, trauma-informed and trauma-responsive treatment using Seeking Safety, Strengthening Families, evidence-based parenting classes, recovery supports, etc. and assist women with housing supports by linking women to transitional, permanent and/or supportive or sober living homes such as an Oxford House. Contracted women's treatment providers new staff are required to complete National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare (NCSACW) online tutorials \"Understanding Child Welfare and the Dependency Court: A Guide for Substance Abuse Treatment Professionals\" and document completion of tutorials in their employee personnel files. Plans of Safe Care - women's treatment provider contract language requires providers to develop Plans of Safe Care for pregnant and postpartum women. Plans of Safe Care will address the needs of the mother, infant and family to ensure coordination of, access to, and engagement in services. For a pregnant woman, the Plan shall be developed prior to the birth event whenever possible and in collaboration with treatment providers, health care providers, early childhood service providers, and other members of the multidisciplinary team as appropriate. Documentation of the Plan shall be included in the woman's file. In Depth Technical Assistance (IDTA). In 2014 as a SAMHSA Prescription Drug Abuse Policy Academy State, New Jersey applied for a unique technical assistance opportunity through the SAMHSA supported National Center on Substance Abuse and Child Welfare (NCSACW) to address the multi-faceted problems of Substance Exposed Infants (SEI) and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). New Jersey Department of Human Services (DHS)/DMHAS as the lead State agency partnered with DCF and Department of Health (DOH) and submitted a successful application for IDTA (no funding attached). The IDTA goal was to develop uniform policies/guidelines that address the entire spectrum of NAS and SEI from pre-pregnancy, prevention, early intervention, assessment and treatment, postpartum and early childhood. The IDTA provided technical assistance to New Jersey to strengthen collaboration and linkages across multiple systems such as addictions treatment, child welfare, and medical communities to improve services for pregnant women with opioid and other substance use disorders and outcomes for their babies. The New Jersey IDTA Core Team included over 60 individuals representing multiple State Departments and Divisions, community stakeholders, treatment providers, and the medical community. The IDTA established three goals: (1) Increase perinatal SEI screening at multiple intervention points (Health system, substance use disorder (SUD)/ mental health (MH) system); (2) Leverage existing programs and policy mechanisms to collaboratively increase the rate at which women screening positive on the 4P's Plus get connected for a comprehensive assessment by establishing formal warm-handoffs and other safety net measures; (3) Leverage existing programs and policy mechanisms to collaboratively increase the rate at which women delivering SEIs and their babies and any other eligible children, receive early support services for which they are eligible. Three workgroups convened: (1) Data Workgroup looked at statewide data systems (Medicaid ICD codes and DOH) that capture prenatal screening, linkage to treatment services, follow-up for parenting women, prevalence of NAS and associated costs. During the initiative, the team analyzed 2013 and 2014 Medicaid data to establish prevalence and costs of treatment NAS. (2) Prenatal Screening, Early Identification of Infants & Referral to Service Workgroup focused on how to increase connections to appropriate treatment and supportive services such as Central Intake and Perinatal Cooperatives, by mapping out current screening and referral practices across the state using Pregnancy Risk Assessment (PRA) data; New Jersey Planning Tables Table 1 Priority Areas and Annual Performance Indicators Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 1 of 22 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 236 of 456implemented the 4Ps+ across the State and embedded the tool within the PRA. The workgroup found high utilization (over 80%) of 4Ps+ within doctors serving pregnant women on Medicaid. The mapping allowed the team to target low utilization areas to increase the prevalence of prenatal screening. (3) Labor, Delivery and Engagement (Infants) Workgroup developed a comprehensive survey with input from the medical community and perinatal cooperatives. The Hospital Birth Survey was disseminated statewide March 2017 to the labor and delivery hospitals. The survey sought to understand how pregnant women with SUD and substance-exposed infants are identified, treated, and triaged with partners at discharge, and if treatment for NAS was explored. The Hospital Birth Survey results was intended to guide Departments in establishing statewide guidelines for best practice; aid in the development of cross system models to ensure families get access to services; establish education needs on issues of SEI/NAS and identify high risk areas. The IDTA commenced in 2017, however DMHAS as the IDTA lead state agency, requested modified technical assistance from the NCSACW to support New Jersey to interpret the key findings from the Birthing Hospital Survey, and apply these findings to the Project ECHO program design. In late Fall of 2018, Robert Wood Johnson and the Nicholson Foundation, in partnership with the three Departments (Health, Human Services, and Children and Families) and other stakeholders began planning to launch Project ECHO (Extension for Community Outcomes) for SEIs. The New Jersey Project ECHO is aimed at Statewide adoption of best practice clinical care and community-based interventions to support SEIs and their parents to support recovery, family formation, and child development through a multidisciplinary case-based learning platform. Project ECHO for SEI and parents focuses on prevention, birth, and the infant's first year of life. DCF is the lead State agency on Plans of Safe Care for SEI, mothers and their families and has developed protocols for integrating Plans of Safe Care into child protection services and child welfare and child welfare assessments. Maternal Wrap Around Program (MWRAP) - MWRAP provides intensive case management and recovery support services for opioid dependent pregnant and postpartum women. Opioid dependent women are eligible for services during pregnancy and up to one year after the birth event. Intensive case management focuses on developing a single, coordinated care plan for pregnant/postpartum women, their infants and families. Intensive Case Managers work as liaisons to all relevant entities involved with each woman. The Recovery Support Specialists provide non-clinical assistance and recovery supports while maintaining follow-up with the women and their infants. The MWRAP goal is to alleviate barriers to services for pregnant opioid dependent women through comprehensive care coordination that is implemented within the five major timeframes when intervention in the life of the substance exposed infants (SEI) can reduce potential harm of prenatal substance exposure: pre-pregnancy, prenatal, birth, neonatal and early childhood. MWRAP is intended to promote maternal health, improve birth outcomes, and reduce the risks and adverse consequences of prenatal substance exposure. MWRAP is a statewide program located in seven regions with each region serving approximately 30 unduplicated opioid dependent pregnant women, their infants and families.

Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 2 of 22 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB PWID Goal of the priority area: To expand access to comprehensive treatment, including Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT), in combination with other treatment modalities, for individuals with an opioid use disorder, including persons who inject drugs (PWID), through mobile medication units and other innovative approaches. Objective: Increase the number of PWID entering treatment and number of heroin and other opiate dependent individuals entering treatment. Strategies to attain the objective: Referral to substance use disorder (SUD) treatment from statewide Harm Reduction Centers (HRCs) that are operational throughout New Jersey. Providing services in convenient locations, specifically utilizing mobile medication units, in order to reduce barriers and engage individuals in care as easily as possible. Promoting the use of medication assisted treatment (MAT) (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine, injectable naltrexone) for individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD). Educating providers, individuals with an OUD, family members and the public about the benefits of MAT through a planned statewide public awareness campaign as well as public presentations on this topic. Contracts to three regional providers to provide community education and trainings for individuals at risk for an OUD, their families, friends and loved ones to recognize an opioid overdose and to subsequently provide naloxone kits to individuals in attendance. Increase the number of naloxone trainings specifically for underserved populations, such as schools, jails, licensed SUD treatment providers, Offices of Emergency Management, Emergency Medical Services teams, fire departments, homeless shelters and community health clinics. Contracts awarded to implement an opioid overdose recovery program with recovery specialists and patient navigators in all 21 counties for individuals who present in emergency departments following an opioid overdose reversal with naloxone in order to link them to treatment or other recovery support services in their communities. Contracts awarded to 11 providers for the Support Team for Addiction Recovery (STAR) program to provide case management and wraparound services for individuals with an OUD. Goals include linking clients to needed services, housing, primary care and treatment including MAT. Maternal Wraparound Program (M-WRAP) provides intensive case management and recovery support services for opioid dependent pregnant and postpartum women. Opioid dependent pregnant women are eligible for M-WRAP services during pregnancy and up to one year after birth event. Intensive case management focuses on developing a single, coordinated care plan for pregnant/postpartum women, their infants and families. Intensive Case Managers provide care coordination and warm hand-offs to appropriate service providers when necessary. Recovery Support Specialists provide non-clinical assistance and recovery supports while maintaining follow-up with the women and their infants. The M-WRAP program covers all 21 counties of NJ and alleviates barriers through comprehensive care coordination using a multi-system approach with the goal to improve outcomes for pregnant/postpartum opioid dependent women and their children. In September 2016, DMHAS was awarded a five-year grant to \"Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Deaths (PDO)\" to implement the Opioid Overdose Prevention Network (OOPN) initiative which entails the development and implementation of a comprehensive prescription drug/ opioid overdose prevention program which includes Naloxone training and distribution. Plans are to train 3,000 individuals and distribute 2,500 naloxone kits annually. In September 2016, DMHAS was awarded a \"Strategic Prevention Framework for Prescription Drugs (SFP Rx)\" five-year grant from SAMHSA to implement the NJAssessRx initiative. NJAssessRx expands interagency sharing of the state's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program data and gives DMHAS the capability to use data analytics to identify prescribers, prescriber groups and patients at high risk for inappropriate prescribing and nonmedical use of opioid drugs. Informed by the data, DMHAS and its prevention partners will strategically target communities and populations needing services, education or other interventions. The target population is youth (ages 12-17) and adults (18 years of age and older) who are being prescribed opioid pain medications, controlled drugs, or human growth hormone (HGH), and are at risk for their nonmedical use. In May 2017, SAMHSA awarded $12,9995,621 through the State Targeted Response (STR) to New Jersey annually for two years. The program aims to address the opioid crisis by increasing access to treatment, reduce unmet treatment need and reduce opioid overdose related deaths through the provision of prevention, treatment and recovery activities for OUD. A major activity of the grant is to implement and expand access to clinically appropriate evidence-based practices (EBPs) for OUD treatment, particularly, the use of MAT. To address these objectives, a new State Targeted Opioid Response Initiative (STORI) fee-for-service (FFS) treatment initiative was developed within the existing addiction fee for service treatment network, which provides access to treatment for under-insured and uninsured clients. It includes a wide range of services, specifically including MAT. DMHAS was awarded a no-cost extension for the STR grant to continue funding the STORI FFS treatment for part of SFY 2020. In September 2018, SAMHSA awarded $21.5 million through the State Opioid Response (SOR) to New Jersey annually for two years to continue to address the opioid crisis. The key objectives of the SOR grant are to increase access to MAT, reduce unmet treatment need and reduce opioid related deaths. In March 2019, DMHAS received notification from SAMHSA that its plan for an additional $11.2 million was approved through the SOR Grant for the period through FFY 2020. DMHAS submitted a plan proposing to use the SOR supplemental award to fund additional treatment, recovery support, prevention and education/training efforts to address the opioid epidemic. As part of SOR funding, the Low Threshold Buprenorphine Induction program (Low Threshold) is designed to make Buprenorphine treatment easily accessible to individuals who access syringes at Harm Reduction Centers (HRCs) located at South Jersey AIDS Alliance (SJAA) in Atlantic City and the Visiting Nurse Association (VNA) of Central Jersey in Asbury Park. Through the Low Threshold program, individuals will be offered same day, immediate enrollment in Buprenorphine treatment and care management services. The program will offer services to individuals who seek this type of service in a Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 3 of 22 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 238 of 456safe and nonjudgmental environment, despite continued drug use or lapses in care. As part of SOR and state funding, DMHAS is collaborating with NJ's 21 counties to establish MAT programs or enhance existing MAT services for inmates with OUD at county correctional facilities. In addition, DMHAS is working with county correctional facilities to establish justice involved re- entry services for detainees where case managers at county jails will conduct intake assessments and establish pre-release plans for needed services in the community. An attempt to increase access to MAT, specifically buprenorphine, has been the development of statewide buprenorphine training courses utilized as an educational component for physicians, Advanced Practical Nurses (APNs) and Physician Assistants (PAs) to attain their Buprenorphine Waiver. The State plans to hold a total of 16 trainings through both Rutgers University (northern region) and Rowan University (southern region) in CY 2019 in an effort to train over 1,000 prescribers in CY 2019. Interim Services have been a requirement of provider contracts, but a new initiative allows DMHAS to pay for these services through a fee-for-service (FFS) mechanism. The Interim Services initiative provides funding to agencies to support individuals awaiting admission to treatment following a SUD assessment. Interim Services are an engagement level of service intended to link individuals to services they may not be able to access due to lack of provider capacity. This service is designed to be provided by agencies contracted for any licensed ASAM level of care. Interim services will be made available to any individual eligible for treatment within the public system who cannot be admitted for the assessed level of care within 72 hours. Prior to this initiative agencies enrolled in the Block Grant initiatives were required to provide this service. Once launched in October 2019, funding for Interim Services will be open to all contracted FFS providers.

Priority #: 3 Priority Area: Heroin/Opioid Users Priority Type: SAT Population(s): Other (Heroin/Opioid Users) Goal of the priority area: To ensure medication assisted treatment (MAT) is provided as an option to individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD) who are entering into substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Objective: Increase the number of heroin/other opiate admissions for whom MAT is planned. Strategies to attain the objective: Utilize a public awareness campaign focusing on reducing stigma/discrimination regarding MAT to assist in engaging individuals with an OUD, their families, friends, loved ones, providers and other community members so that they understand the use of MAT is a best practice in the treatment of an OUD. Buprenorphine Medical Support- This new initiative will focus on the challenges faced by licensed ambulatory SUD programs that require start-up funds to increase their capacity to offer MAT, specifically buprenorphine to their clients. Ambulatory SUD treatment programs will be expected to build capacity to offer MAT in compliance with all federal and New Jersey state regulations. Agencies will be required to receive referrals from other programs that offer MAT where clients stabilized on MAT. DMHAS will continue its Vivitrol Enhancement through its Fee-for-Service (FFS) Network. This enhancement allows providers to be reimbursed for the provision of Vivitrol as well as other ancillary services in FFS initiatives. Licensed SUD agencies can apply for the enhancement by submitting applications to DMHAS and are reviewed for approval on a quarterly basis. DMHAS is collaborating with NJ's 21 counties to establish MAT programs or enhance existing MAT services for inmates with OUD at county correctional facilities. In addition, DMHAS is working with county correctional facilities to establish justice involved re-entry services for detainees where case managers at county jails will conduct intake assessments and establish pre-release plans for needed services in the community, which include linking individuals to community MAT services. DMHAS will continue to distribute American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) booklets entitled \"Opioid Addiction Treatment: A Guide for Patients, Families and Friends\" which provide facts about treatment, including MAT as a best practice, and provides NJ-specific resources to accessing treatment and recovery services. DMHAS has a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Rutgers University, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School to develop a train-the-trainer program on MAT, the opioid epidemic (specific to New Jersey) and concepts of SUD (specific to OUD) for a minimum of 40 graduate students at Rutgers University. The goal of this project is to educate, support, and mentor graduate students to give free educational talks, through use of PowerPoint presentations, to the community.

Each BHH is a designated Care Management Organization (CMO) with enhanced care management teams that include medical expertise and health/wellness education for purposes of providing fully integrated and coordinated care for youth remaining in their home and who have chronic medical conditions. Each BHH employs Nurse Managers (1-40 ratio) and Health and Wellness coaches (1-65 ratio). Nurse Managers are required to hold a New Jersey Registered Nurse (RN) license or higher nursing credential. Health and Wellness Coaches are required to have a Bachelor's Degree and two years of experience in nutrition, health education or a related field. BHH services are a \"bridge\" that connects prevention, primary care, and specialty care. Medical and wellness staff are integrated into the existing CMO Child Family Team (CFT) structure responsible for care coordination and comprehensive treatment planning for youth and their families which includes planning for the holistic needs of the youth. The CFT structure and approach (CMO, FSO, Family, Youth and other designated service providers and supports) enhanced with BHH RN, Health/Wellness Coach staffing plans for the holistic needs of a youth with both behavioral health and medical needs (inclusive of substance use and developmental and intellectual challenges). Nurse Manager and Health/Wellness staff communicate with youth's medical providers (primary care specialty providers, urgent or emergent medical care) and connect the medical domain and planning with the existing CFT process. New Jersey is among the first states using Targeted Case Management (TCM) to deliver Behavioral Health Home services for youth only. The structure of the CMO is a strategic fit for the health home program. The BHH Core Team builds on the current CMO array of staff with the intent to provide a holistic approach to care for children. This expanded team will constitute the services of the BHH and will broaden the current CMO care coordination and care management functions to include the ability to identify, screen and coordinate both primary care and specialty medical care. During SFY 2018, 484 youth were enrolled in BHH services. To be eligible, youth must meet the criteria for CMO and have a qualifying medical condition which is inclusive of intellectual and developmental challenges as well as substance use.

Objective: Plan, implement, and evaluate at least 1 evidence-based program, the In-Home Recovery Program, to support youth and families with substance use disorders who are involved with the Department of Children and Families Division of Child Protection and Permanency. The In-Home Recovery Program is an innovative pilot program seeking to improve outcomes for parents who have a substance use disorder and are actively parenting a child under 36 months. Strategies to attain the objective: In order to further operationalize the DCF vision of ensuring New Jersey children and families are safe, healthy and connected, the Department of Children and Families has revised its Strategic Plan to best align the priorities of CSOC with the DCF vision and values. The Strategic Plan identifies building capacity to deliver evidence-based interventions and services as a priority. CSOC will support evidence-based practices in the continuum by increasing EBP capacity in both community-based and out of home services The Nicholson Foundation, in partnership with New Jersey Department of Children and Families (NJDCF), issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit proposals for a family-based recovery program from New Jersey-based mental health and substance use disorder treatment providers serving adults, families, and/or young children. The goals of the In-Home Recovery Program (the Program) are to improve outcomes for parents who have a substance use disorder and are actively parenting a child under 36 months old and to expand the service array for these families through implementation of a specific evidence-informed, in- home treatment program. Post-intervention changes on parental substance use and involvement with child protective services will be evaluated. The RFP process will result in one award for the implementation of two (2) Project sites within Ocean County, NJ managed by one agency. Each Project team will treat a caseload of twelve (12) families concurrently and serve a minimum of eighteen (18) families over the 18-month grant period, beginning on September 1, 2019, for a budget not to exceed $1,064,855. An important objective of the Program is to demonstrate the effectiveness of a trauma informed in-home treatment for families involved with the NJDCF Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCP&P) who have an index parent (client) with a substance use disorder and an index child (child) under the age of 36 months. Outcome measures will include parental substance use, child placement at discharge, and a client's repeat involvement with child protective services. Key model components include toxicology testing (for clinical purposes only); positive reinforcement in the form of gift cards/vouchers for positive behavioral change (negative toxicology screen); collaboration with DCF regarding the clients progress, success, or any concerns about functioning; collaboration with MAT providers; outreach to support client's participation; utilization of standardized measures to inform and guide treatment, and identify and track symptoms over the course of the intervention; and tools for obtaining family history and the fit between the client and the clients family system. Measures are divided into three domains: client, child, and parent-child relationship. Areas of focus in the three domains are as follows: a. client: depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and childhood trauma history; b. child: development, resilience, behaviors, and trauma exposure; and c. parent-child relationship: parenting stress, parental reflective capacity, attachment styles, and parenting attitudes.

FFT is a relationally focused, trauma informed, evidence-based treatment model for youth in resource care that increases the likelihood of successful adjustment for youth in their resource placements as well as positive permanency outcomes. This treatment model is targeted toward youth aged 12-18 who are demonstrating behaviors that place them at risk of disruption in their resource care placement and are in the legal custody of the DCP&P and have the intellectual capacity to benefit from the treatment intervention. The model uses the relationally focused techniques of Functional Family Therapy (FFT) in a comprehensive and systemic approach adapted to helping youth and families involved with DCP&P to overcome individual and relational trauma to promote placement stability, increase youths' lifelong connections and improve youths' permanency outcomes.

Too often, the child welfare system endeavors to serve these youth and families with inadequate resources and misdirected efforts. Consistent with the needs of many families served by the child welfare system, the challenges at hand are best served by intensive, \"whatever it takes\" treatment by well-trained and qualified professionals. As evidence-based practices, the licensing and program requirements for providers of MST and FFT, from start- up through on-going delivery of service, are stringent. The goal was to have national organizations ensure that local implementation maintains fidelity to the treatment model to ensure outcomes are consistent with other states. Awards were granted around June 2008. There are currently 5 CSOC- contracted agencies providing FFT/MST. During SFY XXXchildren, youth and young adult received FFT/MST services. ARC-GROW Model CSOC, through the Intensive In-Community (IIC) service line, in partnership with the Children's Center for Resilience and Trauma Recovery (CCRTR), and MRSS and CMO partners, offers access to and delivery of the ARC-GROW model. The ARC-GROW Model is an adaptation of the Attachment, Regulation, and Competency framework for intervention with youth and families who have experienced multiple and/or prolonged traumatic stress. The Attachment, Self-Regulation, and Competency (ARC) framework is a core-components treatment model, developed to provide a guiding framework for thoughtful clinical intervention with complexly traumatized youth from early childhood to adolescence and their caregiving systems. GROW is a caregiver skill building intervention designed to enhance resilient outcomes for families who are impacted by chronic adversity or stress (Kinniburgh et al. 2011). This parenting support program is delivered as a 12-session home visiting service by parent support workers or clinical staff providing safety and stabilization support.

Objective: SMHA continues to increase opportunities for community living among mental health consumers by developing additional housing units and maintaining levels of occupancy to satisfy the needs of consumers served in Community Support Services. Strategies to attain the objective: Community Support Services (CSS) is a mental health rehabilitation service that assists the consumer in achieving mental health rehabilitative and recovery goals as identified in an individualized rehabilitation plan (IRP). CSS promotes community inclusion, housing stability, wellness, recovery, and resiliency. Consumers are expected to be full partners in identifying and directing the types of support activities that would be most helpful to maximize successful community living. This includes use of community mental health treatment, medical care, self-help, employment and rehabilitation services, and other community resources, as needed and appropriate. The adoption of CSS enhances Supportive Housing. The SMHA will utilize a number of strategies to help attain the objective. 1. The Office of Olmstead, Compliance, Planning, and Evaluation works collaboratively with provider agencies, state hospital key personnel, DMHAS staff and other Divisions across the state to implement an overall paradigm of community integration. 2. Continued use of the Individual Needs for Discharge Assessment (INDA) facilitates the treatment and discharge planning processes. The INDA serves as both an assessment tool geared toward evaluating needs or barriers that the consumer may face upon discharge and a mechanism by which to assign state hospital consumers to prospective community service providers. The INDA will be continually used by the SMHA to facilitate transition into the community and anticipate and address any barriers that may hinder or preclude placement within the community. 3. Separation of Housing and Services in service delivery has enabled consumers to choose a housing provider and a different service provider. Consumers will no longer be restricted to the same agency. This separation will also enable the SMHA to track expenditures, utilization, outcomes, and demands for services. 4. The Bed Enrollment Data System (BEDS)/Vacancy Tracking System was developed to help DMHAS manage and track vacancies.

Utilization of a web-based system provides real-time access to vacancy information and helps facilitate assignments and avoid outdated spreadsheets. Analysis of the utilization of Supportive Housing vs. supervised settings (e.g. group homes and supervised apartments) allows for assessment of the Division's progress toward community integration. The system will also enable planning at both the individual consumer level for placement purposes and system-wide for purposes of enhancements in community resources. 5. Assignment Process - In May 2015, New Jersey DMHAS revised its Administrative Bulletin 5:11 directing engagements of consumers by community providers. Under this revision, assignments of consumers replaced the concept of referrals to community providers by hospital treatment teams, requiring providers to either accept the assigned consumer or communicate their needs to DMHAS for additional supports necessary to serving the assigned consumer. The goal of this new policy was the early familiarity of consumers and providers through mandatory provider participation in the discharge planning process and engagements such as recreational day trips; visits to prospective apartments for rent; discharge preparations; and overnight visits (upon request of the consumer and/or hospital treatment team). SMHA staff will monitor the continued development of new Supportive Housing opportunities. The BEDS data system will foster more timely and accurate tracking of residential resources, as well as facilitate their more efficient utilization (e.g., to reduce vacancy rates and increase community placements), and enable monitoring of compliance with Administrative Bulletin 5:11 (Residential Placement from Psychiatric Hospital). Indicator #: 1 Indicator: Consumers who remain in Community Support Services (CSS) during the fiscal year as a proportion of total consumers served in Community Support Services. Baseline Measurement: The total number of clients served in CSS in SFY 2018 were 4,762. 80.72% of the total consumers served in CSS remained in CSS during SFY 2018. The total number of clients served in CSS in SFY 2019 will be available by September 2019. At that time, the percentage for SFY 2019 will be calculated. First-year target/outcome measurement: The percentage of consumers who remain in Community Support Services during SFY 2020 will be no less than 85% of total consumers served in Community Support Services. Second-year target/outcome measurement: Data Source: The number of consumers served by Community Support Services is tracked by the SMHA's QCMR database starting SFY 2018. Description of Data: The QCMR Database collects quarterly, cumulative, program-specific data from each of the service providers contracted by DMHAS. The current QCMR for Community Support Services contains 50 data elements. The key data fields relevant for this performance indicator are \"Ending Active Caseload (Last Day of Quarter)\" and Number of terminations in the Quarter. Currently 39 agencies contracted by the SMHA to provide QCMR data for Community Support Services. Data issues/caveats that affect outcome measures:: The QCMR emphasizes aggregate program processes and units of service/persons served, rather than individual consumer outcomes. Proposals awarded under current and forthcoming RFPs for Community Support Services will be monitored through contract negotiations. Data will be maintained through the QCMR database.Annual Performance Indicators to measure goal success Priority #: 14 Priority Area: Olmstead Access to Service/Occupancy Rate MHS Population(s): SMI Goal of the priority area: Maintain housing stability in community settings and improve utilization of housing service slots for mental health consumers served in Community Support Services (CSS). Objective: SMHA continues to increase opportunities for community living among mental health consumers by developing additional housing units and maintaining levels of occupancy to satisfy the needs of consumers served in Community Support Services.The percentage of consumers who remain in Community Support Services during SFY 2021 will be no less than 87% of total consumers served in Community Support Services. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 18 of 22 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 253 of 456Strategies to attain the objective: Community Support Services (CSS) is a mental health rehabilitation service that assists the consumer in achieving mental health rehabilitative and recovery goals as identified in an individualized rehabilitation plan (IRP). CSS promotes community inclusion, housing stability, wellness, recovery and resiliency. Consumers are expected to be full partners in identifying and directing the types of support activities that would be most helpful to maximize successful meaningful community living. This includes use of community mental health treatment, medical care, self-help, employment and rehabilitation services, supported education, and other community resources, as needed and appropriate. The adoption of CSS enhances Supportive Housing. Indicator #: 1 Indicator: Improved Utilization of Housing Service Slots measured by occupancy rates of Community Support Services (CSS) housing units. Baseline Measurement: In SFY2019, the occupancy rate (of CSS housing units that are occupied and/or have a consumer assigned to them) was 95.9%. Conversely, the vacancy rate (state-funded CSS housing units that are vacant and/or have no consumers assigned to them) was 4.1%. First-year target/outcome measurement: In SFY 2020, the occupancy rate (i.e., occupied CSS housing units and those units with an assignment) is expected to be 97%. Second-year target/outcome measurement: Data Source: The 2019 baseline value was generated from newer and slightly improved Provider Weekly Reports. The denominator was the sum of capacity reported from 33 different CSS programs. The numerator was the number of needed assignments requested by those same organizations. Description of Data: For the 2020-2021 application, this priority indicator has been refined to focus on increased access to community-based housing among its largest segment\u2014those served by Community Support Services (CSS). Although DMHAS has developed data systems (e.g., the Bed Enrollment Data System/BEDS) that are well-suited for the tracking of group homes and supervised apartments, different reporting mechanisms are preferable for the tracking of CSS housing\u2014which is uniquely client-driven. Therefore, the data used for this indicator is from an analysis of Provider Weekly Reports, which are submitted to the SMHA on a weekly basis by each contracted CSS agency. Provider Weekly Vacancy Reports gather data from the community providers regarding their current census, current occupancy, and identify availability for state hospital assignments. These reports provide current information regarding active assignments, which includes any unforeseen post-assignment barriers, identifies any follow-up needed, and provides additional information used for tracking the progress of the assignment to allow for timely discharge and/or intervention. Prior to the development of this report, two of the three catchment areas implemented a similar tool. The new report has standardized the process in all three regions and across all providers. The Provider Weekly Vacancy Report provides information in order to validate the current BEDs Data System, as well as provide continuous updates to maintain its accuracy. This report is also used to develop and maintain the Hospital Vacancy Report, which is used for notifying state hospital treatment teams of bed vacancies and assignment opportunities. All DMHAS community providers were invited to participate in a webinar training on June 19, 2019. The Provider Weekly Vacancy Report went into effect on July 1st, 2019. The 2019 values were calculated by dividing the sum of the reported number of requested assignments, by the sum of the reported capacities at each program. The SMHA collected this data from 33 CSS providers at the end of SFY19. Data issues/caveats that affect outcome measures:: The reporting of occupancy strictly among CSS provider agencies necessitated the use of the Provider Weekly Reports (PWRs). The rollout of the standardized PWRs came late in SFY19, so there is a small number of providers who have yet to submit their data in the proscribed fashion. This performance indicator is expressed as a proportion, and the SMHA does not feel that the SFY19 occupancy rate of 95.9% would be materially different if/when all of the data was reported.Annual Performance Indicators to measure goal success Priority #: 15 Priority Area: First Episode Psychosis (FEP) Priority Type: MHS Population(s): SMIIn SFY 2021, the occupancy rate (i.e., occupied CSS housing units and those units with an assignment) is expected to be 97%. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 19 of 22 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 254 of 456Goal of the priority area: Early treatment and intervention of psychosis helps change the trajectory of psychotic disorders in young adults by improving symptoms, reducing the likelihood of long-term disability and leading to productive independent meaningful lives. Objective: Among consumers who received coordinated specialty care services for individuals with first episode psychosis, a majority will show improved symptoms and adhere to psychotic medication after receiving treatment for six months. Strategies to attain the objective: Objectives will be addressed through the implementation of a Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) model. CSC is an evidence-based recovery-oriented approach involving clients and family members as active participants. All services are highly coordinated with primary medical care. New Jersey's CSC services are provided for youth and adults between the ages of 15 to 35 years who have experienced psychotic symptoms for less than 2 years with or without treatment. Since November 2016, three teams in New Jersey have been funded to provide CSC services. They cover all 21 counties using extensive outreach efforts. The three provider agencies are Oaks Integrated Care for Southern region, Rutgers University Behavioral Health Center for Central region, and CarePlus NJ for Northern region. Each CSC team is comprised of six members, mostly masters level clinicians, who contribute to high levels of care. They take on the roles of Team Leader, Recovery Coach, Supported Employment and Education Specialist, Pharmacotherapist, Outreach and Referral Specialist, and Peer Support Specialist. The New Jersey CSC model emphasizes treatment through the following components: outreach, low-dosage medications, cognitive and behavioral skills training, Individualized Placement and Support (IPS), supported employment and supported education, peer support, case management, and family psychoeducation. In SFY 2019, the three CSC programs had over 277 referrals and served 215 clients in their programs. New Jersey plans to continue utilizing the 10% set- aside funding in the FY 2020-21 to support these three CSC teams in providing evidence-based services for individual with FEP. With increased demand for FEP services, the CSC programs have expanded from serving 35 clients to 70 clients per agency and increased clinical staff from 5.2 FTE to 6.8 FTE levels in FY 2019. Indicator #: 1 Indicator: Medication adherence among clients who need psychotropic medication prescribed for FEP treatment. Baseline Measurement: In SFY 2018, among clients who were taking or in need of antipsychotic medication for the treatment of their psychosis at intake, 78.4% adhere to their medication regimen. In SFY 2019, out of 215 clients being served, 190 were taking or in need of antipsychotic medication. Among them, 86.8% (165) adhered to their psychotropic medication regimens. First-year target/outcome measurement: In SFY 2020, it is anticipated that at least 88% of the client who are taking or in need of antipsychotic medication adhere to the medication regimen. Second-year target/outcome measurement: Data Source: The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) maintains a CSC clinical diagnostic database, which is used for tracking medication monitoring in all 3 agencies. Description of Data: The three CSC service providers submit the client level clinical diagnostic data quarterly to DMHAS. The CSC clinical diagnostic database tracks client referral and intake; functional status; program involvement; education and employment; medication and substance use; suicide ideation; hospitalization; and client discharge information. The DMHAS is in the process of creating a comprehensive client level data system that includes data elements from all DMHAS contracted community programs. The client level data system will include all CSC program elements currently collected through the CSC clinical diagnostic database and additional measures required by federal and state data reporting and evaluation. The client level data will provide a detailed description of the FEP population receiving CSC services in New Jersey and will help capture the treatment and recovery progress of CSC clients so that DMHAS can improve services for early serious mental illness (ESMI) population in New Jersey. Data issues/caveats that affect outcome measures:: Annual Performance Indicators to measure goal success In SFY 2021, it is anticipated that at least 90% of the client who are taking or in need of antipsychotic medication adhere to the medication regimen.

Priority #: 16 Priority Area: System wide assessment for delivering services to diverse populations Priority Type: MHS Population(s): SMI Goal of the priority area: System wide assessment for delivering services to diverse populations. Objective: All agencies are required to have a Cultural Competence Plan in place. The multicultural plans are required of both mental health and substance use agencies. Strategies to attain the objective: Since 1985, the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) has had the commitment to improve services to individuals from diverse backgrounds, including LGBTQ. The mechanism for addressing these system needs began with the 2015 reformation of DMHAS' multicultural activities into a Multicultural Services Advisory Committee (MSAC). The MSAC has developed a process for systems assessment that will begin by surveying all contracted agencies about their existing planning and service delivery to diverse populations. As the SMHA reviewed the results of these surveys, gaps in service and needs for technical assistance (TA) were identified. Beginning in early 2016, TA groups were held in the north and south to assist agencies in formulating multicultural plans. Those plans became a part of the SMHA's contracting process in FY 2017 and have been followed by the DMHAS Multicultural Training and Technical Assistance Center each year to ensure that the plans continue to grow. In addition, in FY 2018, DMHAS contracted with a diversity consultant to provide administrative and research-based assistance with this initiative. The diversity consultant was charged with securing scholarly presenters for trainings and workshops to further educate and engage providers with completing their Cultural Competence Plan. The diversity consultant's role expanded in FY 2019 to include qualitative and quantitative analysis of data in order to present a more robust picture of DMHAS' agency gaps and trends leading to greater concentration of creating and sustaining a culture of inclusion. The MSAC, with assistance from DMHAS and the diversity consultant, is developing a \"Center for Cultural Competency Excellence\" designation for agencies that meet exemplary criteria in addition to completing their Cultural Competency Plans. Each mental health community provider is required to develop a Cultural Competence Plan describing the integration of cultural and linguistic competence throughout the organization, including direct attention to issues of gender, age, and culture. An organizational self-assessment helps prioritize the steps needed to develop those congruent behaviors and improve culturally responsive services. The plan that results from that assessment, which has 47 items, should address all diverse groups that are served within the agency: for example, cultural, ethnic and linguistically diverse people, individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender people, older people; and outline strategies for recruiting, hiring, retaining, and promoting culturally competent, diverse staff members; the use of interpreters or bilingual staff members; staff training, professional development, and education; fostering community involvement; facilities design and operation; development of cultural and diversity appropriate program materials; how to incorporate diverse treatment approaches; and development and implementation of supporting policies and procedures, including reassessment processes. Indicator #: 1 Indicator: Proportion of agencies that have three areas identified from their self-assessment included in their Cultural Competence Plans. Baseline Measurement: The baseline variable is the number of provider agencies that complete their self- assessments and have a written Cultural Competence Plan containing at least three of the areas needed to enhance cultural competency. The establishment of a baseline is still in process and is expected to be completed in SFY 2020. The MSAC will complete the \"Center for Cultural Competency Excellence\" designation for agencies. First-year target/outcome measurement: Thirty (30) percent of all providers will have written Cultural Competence Plans which include at least three areas identified in their self-assessment. Agencies will apply for \"Center for Cultural Competency Excellence\" designation. Second-year target/outcome measurement: Annual Performance Indicators to measure goal success Fifty percent (50%) of all providers will have written Cultural Competence Plans which include at least three areas identified in their self-assessment.

Description of Data: The establishment of written organizational plans for addressing culture and diversity based upon agency self-assessment. The areas covered: Governance, Leadership, and Workforce; Communication and Language Assistance and Engagement, Continuous Improvement, and Accountability. Plans identify a minimum of at least three activities from these areas. Data issues/caveats that affect outcome measures:: Some agencies have been reluctant to initiate a multicultural plan due to staffing demands, cultural competency misinformation, and fiscal issues. The addition of the diversity consultant and \"Center for Cultural Competency Excellence\" agency designation may help in this regard.

Persons with mental illness and substance use disorders may benefit from strategies to control weight, encourage exercise, and properly treat such chronic health conditions as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.23 It has been acknowledged that there is a high rate of co-occurring M/SUD, with appropriate treatment required for both conditions.24 Currently, 50 states have organizationally consolidated their mental and substance use disorder authorities in one fashion or another with additional organizational changes under consideration. More broadly, SAMHSA and its federal partners understand that such factors as education, housing, and nutrition strongly affect the overall health and well-being of persons with mental illness and substance use disorders.25 SMHAs and SSAs may wish to develop and support partnerships and programs to help address social determinants of health and advance overall health equity.26 For instance, some organizations have established medical-legal partnerships to assist persons with mental and substance use disorders in meeting their housing, employment, and education needs.27 Health care professionals and persons who access M/SUD treatment services recognize the need for improved coordination of care and integration of physical and M/SUD with other health care in primary, specialty, emergency and rehabilitative care settings in the community. For instance, the National Alliance for Mental Illness has published materials for members to assist them in coordinating pediatric mental health and primary care.28 SAMHSA and its partners support integrated care for persons with mental illness and substance use disorders.29 The state should illustrate movement towards integrated systems of care for individuals and families with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders. The plan should describe attention to management, funding, payment strategies that foster co-occurring capability for services to individuals and families with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders. Strategies supported by SAMHSA to foster integration of physical and M/SUD include: developing models for inclusion of M/SUD treatment in primary care; supporting innovative payment and financing strategies and delivery system reforms such as ACOs, health homes, pay for performance, etc.; promoting workforce recruitment, retention and training efforts; improving understanding of financial sustainability and billing requirements; encouraging collaboration between M/SUD providers, prevention of teen pregnancy, youth violence, Medicaid programs, and primary care providers such as Federally Qualified Health Centers; and sharing with consumers information about the full range of health and wellness programs. Health information technology, including EHRs and telehealth are examples of important strategies to promote integrated care.30 Use of EHRs - in full compliance with applicable legal requirements - may allow providers to share information, coordinate care, and improve billing practices. Telehealth is another important tool that may allow M/SUD prevention, treatment, and recovery to be conveniently provided in a variety of settings, helping to expand access, improve efficiency, save time, and reduce costs. Development and use of models for coordinated, integrated care such as those found in health homes31 and ACOs32 may be important strategies used by SMHAs and SSAs to foster integrated care. Training and assisting M/SUD providers to redesign or implement new provider billing practices, build capacity for third-party contract negotiations, collaborate with health clinics and other organizations and provider networks, and coordinate benefits among multiple funding sources may be important ways to foster integrated care. SAMHSA encourages SMHAs and SSAs to communicate frequently with stakeholders, including policymakers at the state/jurisdictional and local levels, and State Mental Health Planning Council members and consumers, about efforts to foster health care coverage, access and integrate care to ensure beneficial outcomes. SMHAs and SSAs also may work with state Medicaid agencies, state insurance commissioners, and professional organizations to encourage development of innovative demonstration projects, alternative payment methodologies, and waivers/state plan amendments that test approaches to providing integrated care for persons with M/SUD and other vulnerable populations.33 Ensuring both Medicaid and private insurers provide required preventive benefits also may be an area for collaboration.34 One key population of concern is persons who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.35 Roughly, 30 percent of persons who are dually eligible have been diagnosed with a mental illness, more than three times the rate among those who are not dually eligible.36 SMHAs and SSAs also should collaborate with state Medicaid agencies and state insurance commissioners to develop policies to assist those individuals who experience health insurance coverage eligibility changes due to shifts in income and employment.37 Moreover, even with expanded health coverage available through the Marketplace and Medicaid and efforts to ensure parity in health care coverage, persons with M/SUD conditions still may experience challenges in some areas in obtaining care for a particular condition or in finding a provider.38 SMHAs and SSAs should remain cognizant that health disparities may affect access, health care coverage and integrated care of M/SUD conditions and work with Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 1 of 5 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 273 of 456partners to mitigate regional and local variations in services that detrimentally affect access to care and integration. SMHAs and SSAs should work with partners to ensure recruitment of diverse, well-trained staff and promote workforce development and ability to function in an integrated care environment.39 Psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, addiction counselors, preventionists, therapists, technicians, peer support specialists, and others will need to understand integrated care models, concepts, and practices. Parity is vital to ensuring persons with mental health conditions and substance use disorders receive continuous, coordinated, care. Increasing public awareness about MHPAEA could increase access to M/SUD services, provide financial benefits to individuals and families, and lead to reduced confusion and discrimination associated with mental illness and substance use disorders. Block grant recipients should continue to monitor federal parity regulations and guidance and collaborate with state Medicaid authorities, insurance regulators, insurers, employers, providers, consumers and policymakers to ensure effective parity implementation and comprehensive, consistent communication with stakeholders. The SSAs, SMHAs and their partners may wish to pursue strategies to provide information, education, and technical assistance on parity-related issues. Medicaid programs will be a key partner for recipients of MHBG and SABG funds and providers supported by these funds. The SSAs and SMHAs should collaborate with their states' Medicaid authority in ensuring parity within Medicaid programs. SAMHSA encourages states to take proactive steps to improve consumer knowledge about parity. As one plan of action, states can develop communication plans to provide and address key issues. Another key part of integration will be defining performance and outcome measures. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and partners have developed the National Quality Strategy, which includes information and resources to help promote health, good outcomes, and patient engagement. SAMHSA's National Behavioral Health Quality Framework includes core measures that may be used by providers and payers.40 SAMHSA recognizes that certain jurisdictions receiving block grant funds - including U.S. Territories, tribal entities and those jurisdictions that have signed a Compact of Free Association with the United States and are uniquely impacted by certain Medicaid provisions or are ineligible to participate in certain programs.41 However, these jurisdictions should collaborate with federal agencies and their governmental and non- governmental partners to expand access and coverage. Furthermore, the jurisdiction should ensure integration of prevention, treatment, and recovery support for persons with, or at risk of, mental and substance use disorders. 22 BG Druss et al.

Describe how the state integrates mental health and primary health care, including services for individuals with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders, in primary care settings or arrangements to provide primary and specialty care services in community -based mental and substance use disorders settings. Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) Through a Medicaid State Plan Amendment NJ has implemented Behavioral Health Homes to provide integrated care to individuals with serious mental illness. The service is available in Bergen, Mercer, Atlantic, and Monmouth Counties. The agencies certified to provide services in Mercer County include Oaks Integrated Services (Formerly Greater Trenton), Catholic Charities, and All Access for Mental Health. In Bergen county, CarePlus NJ and Vantage Health are certified to provide services with Comprehensive Behavioral Health Care. In Atlantic county, services are provided by: Helping Hand Behavioral Health, and Jewish Family Services. In Monmouth county, there are three providers, CPC Behavioral Health, Meridian and Stress Care. NJ has continued its SAMHSA demonstration grant to implement Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs), which began on July 1, 2017. This is done jointly with the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (DMAHS), our sister Division in the Department of Human Services (DHS). The CCBHCs serve children and adults and provide a comprehensive array of mental health and addiction services. including physical health screening and case management. There are seven CCBHCs in NJ. The Federal Demonstration was extended to September 13, 2019. The state is making plans for a short-term funding mechanism to continue the programs until the decision is made about an extension of the grant program or a more permanent state funding is established. DMAHS is also working with the federally qualified health care clinics (FQHCs) and other and primary care providers to allow them to provide Medicaid reimbursable behavioral health services. An Office-Based Addiction Treatment (OBAT) initiative will incorporate medication assisted treatment (MAT) for substance use disorders (SUDs) in a variety of primary care settings. The initiative provides enhanced Medicaid rates for MAT opioid use disorder in primary care, which includes payments for a navigator position to provide care management. The OBAT incorporates a systems level approach in that individuals with SUD can be referred for treatment to the levels of SUD treatment services needed, and Centers of Excellence are available to support OBAT providers in providing SUD services.

BHHs serve as a \"bridge\" that connects prevention, primary care, and specialty care, and is designed to avoid fragmented care that leads to unnecessary use of high-end services (i.e. emergency rooms and inpatient hospital stays.). The Behavioral Health Home initiative provides services to children with serious emotional disturbance with the goal of improving health outcomes; promoting better functional outcomes (such as increased school attendance); decreasing overall cost, and the cost associated with the use of acute medical and psychiatric services; improving child/family's satisfaction with care; and, improving the family's ability to manage chronic illness. To help address these goals, the current child family teams are to include medical expertise and health/wellness education for purposes of providing fully integrated and coordinated care for children who have chronic medical conditions. With a Nurse Care Manager and a Health and Wellness Coach on staff, each BHH Core Team builds on the current Care Management Organization (CMO) array of staff with the intent to provide a holistic approach to care for children. This expanded team constitutes the services of the BHH and will broaden the current CMO care coordination and care management functions to include the ability to identify, screen and coordinate both primary care and specialty medical care. 2. Describe how the state provide services and supports towards integrated systems of care for individuals and families with co- occurring mental and substance use disorders, including management, funding, payment strategies that foster co-occurring capability. Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) are designed to provide integrated substance use disorder and mental health services for those with co-occurring disorders. The CCBHC includes family supports services. The CCBHCs are required to treat all who seek services, without regard to income, private health insurance, or eligibility for Medicaid/NJ. The Department of Human Services (DHS) / Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) is also working with the Department of Health (DOH) to establish a single set of integrated regulations for primary care providers and behavioral health providers. The new regulations will remove barriers and address conflicting regulations so that services can be more fully integrated. Unifying the regulations will promote integration and co-location of behavioral health and primary care services. In recent years, reimbursement rates for mental health and substance use disorder treatment have increased to cover cost of services. More uniform payment methodologies for publicly funded mental health and substance use disorder services have been established. DMHAS has established a co-occurring network of substance use disorder providers in the fee-for-service system. Children's System of Care (CSOC) The Children's System of Care (CSOC) offers an array of substance use treatment services, including withdrawal management, outpatient, intensive outpatient, partial care, short-term residential and long-term residential. In addition, residential treatment services for youth with both substance use and significant behavioral health needs can be accessed through the Care Management Organization (CMO) in the defined service area. A parent/legal guardian may contact the CSOC Contracted System Administrator (CSA) to access any CSOC contracted service. Licensed clinicians employed by the CSA complete assessments over the phone, provide referrals and appropriate authorizations. If a youth meets clinical criteria for out of home co-occurring services, he/she will be opened to a Care Management Organization (CMO) from their county. The CMO Care Manager will help with paperwork, coordinate services and support families through the process. Families may also access services directly through one of the CSOC contracted substance use treatment providers. Providers complete an assessment and submit it to the CSA. These services may also be accessed through a CMO, MRSS, DCPP and/or juvenile courts if any of these entities are involved with the youth. Service consideration is based upon the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) criteria, also known as the ASAM patient placement criteria. These decisions are made by Licensed Clinical Alcohol and Drug Counselors (LCADCs) with appropriate specialized training. Youth/young adult age 13 -20.99 may access out of home substance use treatment services through the CSA and youth age 13-18 may access ambulatory substance use treatment services through the CSA. If a youth turns 19 while receiving ambulatory services or 21 in out of home substance use services CSA will continue to provide authorization until that episode of care is completed and then transition youth/young adult to the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) to access continued substance use services.

Is the SSA and SMHA involved in the implementation and enforcement of parity protections for mental and substance use disorder services? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 9. What are the issues or problems that your state is facing related to the implementation and enforcement of parity provisions? The state is working how best to implement the evaluation of Non-Qualitative Treatment Limits for Medicaid. Department of Human Services is also working with New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance on the implementation of this and other evaluations for compliance with parity for the private insurance market. 10. Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? The State has established an interdepartmental Work Group (including Departments/Divisions represented on Work Group) to address parity. This group applied and received a grant for participation in SAMHSA's Parity Academy and is actively involved in this technical assistance for parity. Mental health condition and substance use disorder parity laws - P.L. 2019, c. 58 was signed into law on April 11, 2019. The law requires health insurers to provide coverage for mental health conditions and substance use disorders under the same terms and conditions as provided for any other sickness and to meet the requirements of the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. Additionally, the law includes reporting requirements for insurance carriers and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. The following health insurers fall under the law: health service corporations, commercial insurers, health maintenance organizations, health benefits plans issued pursuant to the New Jersey Individual Health Coverage and Small Employer Health Benefits Programs, the State Health Benefits Program, and the School Employees' Health Benefits Program. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section Not at this time due the State's participation in the SAMHSA Parity 5 of 5 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 277 of 456Environmental Factors and Plan 2. Health Disparities - Requested Narrative Question In accordance with the HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities42, Healthy People, 202043, National Stakeholder Strategy for Achieving Health Equity44, and other HHS and federal policy recommendations, SAMHSA expects block grant dollars to support equity in access, services provided, and M/SUD outcomes among individuals of all cultures, sexual/gender minorities, orientation and ethnicities. Accordingly, grantees should collect and use data to: (1) identify subpopulations (i.e., racial, ethnic, limited English speaking, tribal, sexual/gender minority groups, etc.) vulnerable to health disparities and (2) implement strategies to decrease the disparities in access, service use, and outcomes both within those subpopulations and in comparison to the general population. One strategy for addressing health disparities is use of the recently revised National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (CLAS)45. The Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, which the HHS Secretary released in April 2011, outlines goals and actions that HHS agencies, including SAMHSA, will take to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic minorities. Agencies are required to assess the impact of their policies and programs on health disparities. The HHS Secretary's top priority in the Action Plan is to \"assess and heighten the impact of all HHS policies, programs, processes, and resource decisions to reduce health disparities. HHS leadership will assure that program grantees, as applicable, will be required to submit health disparity impact statements as part of their grant applications. Such statements can inform future HHS investments and policy goals, and in some instances, could be used to score grant applications if underlying program authority permits.\"46 Collecting appropriate data is a critical part of efforts to reduce health disparities and promote equity. In October 2011, HHS issued final standards on the collection of race, ethnicity, primary language, and disability status47. This guidance conforms to the existing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directive on racial/ethnic categories with the expansion of intra-group, detailed data for the Latino and the Asian-American/Pacific Islander populations48. In addition, SAMHSA and all other HHS agencies have updated their limited English proficiency plans and, accordingly, will expect block grant dollars to support a reduction in disparities related to access, service use, and outcomes that are associated with limited English proficiency. These three departmental initiatives, along with SAMHSA's and HHS's attention to special service needs and disparities within tribal populations, LGBTQ populations, and women and girls, provide the foundation for addressing health disparities in the service delivery system. States provide M/SUD services to these individuals with state block grant dollars. While the block grant generally requires the use of evidence-based and promising practices, it is important to note that many of these practices have not been normed on various diverse racial and ethnic populations. States should strive to implement evidence-based and promising practices in a manner that meets the needs of the populations they serve. In the block grant application, states define the populations they intend to serve. Within these populations of focus are subpopulations that may have disparate access to, use of, or outcomes from provided services. These disparities may be the result of differences in insurance coverage, language, beliefs, norms, values, and/or socioeconomic factors specific to that subpopulation. For instance, lack of Spanish primary care services may contribute to a heightened risk for metabolic disorders among Latino adults with SMI; and American Indian/Alaska Native youth may have an increased incidence of underage binge drinking due to coping patterns related to historical trauma within the American Indian/Alaska Native community. While these factors might not be pervasive among the general population served by the block grant, they may be predominant among subpopulations or groups vulnerable to disparities. To address and ultimately reduce disparities, it is important for states to have a detailed understanding of who is and is not being served within the community, including in what languages, in order to implement appropriate outreach and engagement strategies for diverse populations. The types of services provided, retention in services, and outcomes are critical measures of quality and outcomes of care for diverse groups. For states to address the potentially disparate impact of their block grant funded efforts, they will address access, use, and outcomes for subpopulations. 42 http://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/HHS/HHS_Plan_complete.pdf 43 http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx 44 https://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/NSS/NSS_07_Section3.pdf 45 http://www.ThinkCulturalHealth.hhs.gov Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 Jersey Page 1 of 4 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 278 of 456Please respond to the following items: 1.

Does the state have a budget item allocated to identifying and remediating disparities in M/SUD care? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 7. Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) has had a long-standing commitment to issues of culture and diversity, originally forming a Multicultural Advisory Committee in 1981. Since that time, the role and membership of this group has changed to meet the evolving needs of the system. In June 2015, the Multicultural Services Group (MSG) was formed to devise strategies that are appropriate to the lifestyles, special needs and strengths of New Jersey's diverse minority and cultural groups receiving services in the behavioral health system of care. The MSG strives to address the needs for ongoing plans within all contracted agencies in the system as it improves the quality of care for: minority, cultural, linguistic, deaf and hard of hearing and aging population. In Fiscal Year 2012, DMHAS awarded two agencies to serve as Cultural Competence Training Centers. The Centers provide training and technical assistance specializing in the support of cultural and ethnic diversity and the dynamics of differences among contracted agencies of the DMHAS. Cultural Competence Training Centers play an important role in the on-going development of clinician and agency cultural competence skills by designing curriculum, training, technical assistance and tools to increase agency capacity to provide culturally competent behavioral health care. In Fiscal Year 2017, the DMHAS awarded an agency to provide a Multicultural and Diversity Statewide Consultant to create increased sensitivity on issues relating to culture and diversity within the mental health and addictions systems of care. This individual works in collaboration with the Cultural Competence Training Centers to facilitate training curriculum and delivery, assist in service bridging in collaboration with the DMHAS and develop technical assistance packages for use throughout the system of care. The SSA funds the North Jersey Community Research Initiative to continue and expand their existing programs for high-risk LGBTQ youth of color by adapting a prevention model developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, early intervention services, social marketing, and structured recreational activities. A CSAP-sponsored evaluation of the program determined that the program was effective in reducing rates of substance use among participants and that participants were highly satisfied with the services that were provided. In August 2018, New Jersey was one of three states awarded a grant from the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) through its Moving on Maternal Depression (MOMD) initiative. The 18-month grant exclusively provides technical assistance, which is administered in the form of monthly calls with CLASP and other participating states; site visits with CLASP; and a conference with 47 https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/hhs-implementation-guidance-data-collection-standards-race-ethnicity-sex-primary-language-and-disability-status 48 https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Revisions-to-the-Standards-for-the-Classification-of-Federal-Data-on-Race-and-Ethnicity- October30-1997.pdf Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 Page 2 of 4 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 279 of 456other states on promising practices toward serving populations with maternal depression. New Jersey's efforts under this initiative come from a collaborative which is co-lead by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DHS-DMHAS) and the Department of Health (DOH), and inclusive of the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (DHS-Medicaid) the Department of Children and Families (DCF), and three maternal health consortia consisting of the Partnership for Maternal Child Health, Central Jersey Family Health Consortia, and South Jersey Perinatal Cooperative. The MOMD initiative, has as its focus three individual goals for improving its ability to serve mothers with maternal depression. Each of these goals is the focus of its own subcommittee of core team members, which meets monthly to discuss progress, share insights, and discuss any questions or concerns arising from their efforts. The core team subsequently reports on these meetings to CLASP on monthly calls and receives feedback and consultation where necessary. Since receiving the award for technical assistance from CLASP, New Jersey has also joined a Policy Academy focused on maternal depression, and the 2019 Population Health Summit hosted by the state's Department of Health will also highlight the issue of maternal depression. As a result, the goals developed by New Jersey to improve their ability to serve those affected by maternal depression have garnered attention and support from agencies both within the state and throughout the country. These goals are defined as follows: 1. Enhanced data capacity and data sharing across all offices invested in treating maternal depression: Progress toward this goal will begin with a data inventory across all of the pertinent DMHAS, DOH-MCH, MEDICAID, and DCF data systems, exploring existing capabilities for studying maternal depression among all four agencies, and examining these systems for opportunities to improve research in this area as well as communicate among the offices in order to achieve a comprehensive understanding of maternal depression at all levels. It is expected that the data inventory will be complete within six months, followed by a shift in focus to the planning for improved communication across each office's individual data systems. Once the initial data inventory is completed, the primary focus of the subcommittee can begin, and the remaining 12 months of the technical assistance award will be dedicated to enhancing existing systems in the form of common fields, options, and terminologies as well as working toward real-time linkages between individual division systems. The efforts and success of this MOMD subcommittee will enable a comprehensive examination of the problem of maternal depression from the angle of any New Jersey state division responsible for addressing it. 2. Increased access to services for those with maternal depression: Simultaneous with the efforts of the subcommittee described above, each office within the MOMD collaborative will begin immediately examining its existing data systems and initiatives for strategies to improve access to treatment for maternal depression. This subcommittee be tasked with 1.) establishing a data-driven analysis of service utilization and any disparities across demographics and special populations, to the end of developing quantitative methods for examining access to maternal depression treatment by anyone in need; and 2.)examining current practices and initiatives geared toward treating maternal depression and developing improvement strategies focused on closing any gaps in the access to such services. The efforts of this subcommittee will continue throughout the 18-month duration of the award, taking full advantage of the technical assistance afforded by CLASP, and will yield a well-rounded evaluation of existing resources and enhancements to New Jersey's maternal depression services capacity. The final six months of the CLASP MOMD award will be spent by this subcommittee on the collaborative establishment of outcomes designed to ensure improvement and sustainability of access to services by anyone in New Jersey in need of treatment for maternal depression. 3. Reduced disparities across races, ethnicities, socioeconomic status, and citizenship status in the delivery of necessary services to mothers with maternal depression: As mentioned on page 5 of New Jersey's MOMD RFP application, postpartum depression is higher among Medicaid/uninsured populations and non-Hispanic blacks. Moreover, Hispanic mothers are more likely than non- Hispanic mothers to lack health insurance which would facilitate the pursuit of medical treatment. The subcommittee dedicated to this goal will spend the full 18-months of the CLASP award researching best and promising practices related to addressing racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic barriers to receiving treatment for maternal depression, and developing strategies for tailoring the implementation of these practices to New Jersey's populations. Efforts of this subcommittee will include, but not be limited to conferences with other states on best and promising practices in bridging service gaps; consultation as needed from subject- matter experts such as the Office of Multicultural Services and the Office of Legal affairs; continuous consultation with the data- driven subcommittees from Goals 1 and 2 on quantitative evidence of successes and barriers related to accessing treatment; and collaboration with the policy and practice-based subcommittee from Goal 2 on ensuring that any service enhancements include a specialized focus on alleviating disparities within these specific indicators. As with Goal 2, the final six months of the technical assistance award will be spent developing outcomes to ensure sustained growth and improvements in accessing services to the black and Hispanic populations, lower-income mothers, and undocumented immigrants. Children's System of Care (CSOC) Within the NJ children's system of care access and/or enrollment in services, types of services received, and outcomes by race, ethnicity, gender and age are tracked by the Contracted Systems Administrator (CSA) management information system. Within the NJ children's system of care language needs of disparity-vulnerable subpopulations are identified, addressed and tracked by the Children's System of Care (CSOC) CSA, PerformCare. Needs assessments are also conducted on the local level by the Care Management Organizations (CMO) and governing bodies within each county.

CSOC does not utilize Block Grant funds to measure, track or address to these disparities. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) could use assistance in engaging contacted and licensed mental health providers with developing and completing cultural competency plans. Although all of the DMHAS initiatives in the area of cultural competency provide training, technical assistance, and strategic and practical recommendations in developing cultural competency plans, the field is slow to make changes.

Innovation in Purchasing Decisions - Requested Narrative Question While there are different ways to define value-based purchasing, its purpose is to identify services, payment arrangements, incentives, and players that can be included in directed strategies using purchasing practices that are aimed at improving the value of health care services. In short, health care value is a function of both cost and quality: Health Care Value = Quality \u00f7 Cost, ( V = Q \u00f7 C ) SAMHSA anticipates that the movement toward value based purchasing will continue as delivery system reforms continue to shape states systems. The identification and replication of such value-based strategies and structures will be important to the development of M/SUD systems and services. There is increased interest in having a better understanding of the evidence that supports the delivery of medical and specialty care including M/SUD services. Over the past several years, SAMHSA has collaborated with CMS, HRSA, SMAs, state M/SUD authorities, legislators, and others regarding the evidence of various mental and substance misuse prevention, treatment, and recovery support services. States and other purchasers are requesting information on evidence-based practices or other procedures that result in better health outcomes for individuals and the general population. While the emphasis on evidence-based practices will continue, there is a need to develop and create new interventions and technologies and in turn, to establish the evidence. SAMHSA supports states' use of the block grants for this purpose. The NQF and the IOM recommend that evidence play a critical role in designing health benefits for individuals enrolled in commercial insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare. To respond to these inquiries and recommendations, SAMHSA has undertaken several activities. SAMHSA's Evidence Based Practices Resource Center assesses the research evaluating an intervention's impact on outcomes and provides information on available resources to facilitate the effective dissemination and implementation of the program. SAMHSA's Evidence-Based Practices Resource Center provides the information & tools needed to incorporate evidence-based practices into communities or clinical settings. SAMHSA reviewed and analyzed the current evidence for a wide range of interventions for individuals with mental illness and substance use disorders, including youth and adults with chronic addiction disorders, adults with SMI, and children and youth with SED. The evidence builds on the evidence and consensus standards that have been developed in many national reports over the last decade or more. These include reports by the Surgeon General,49 The New Freedom Commission on Mental Health,50 the IOM,51 NQF,and the Interdepartmental Serious Mental Illness Coordinating Committee (ISMICC).52. The activity included a systematic assessment of the current research findings for the effectiveness of the services using a strict set of evidentiary standards. This series of assessments was published in \"Psychiatry Online.\"53 SAMHSA and other federal partners, the HHS' Administration for Children and Families, Office for Civil Rights, and CMS, have used this information to sponsor technical expert panels that provide specific recommendations to the M/SUD field regarding what the evidence indicates works and for whom, to identify specific strategies for embedding these practices in provider organizations, and to recommend additional service research. In addition to evidence-based practices, there are also many promising practices in various stages of development. Anecdotal evidence and program data indicate effectiveness for these services. As these practices continue to be evaluated, the evidence is collected to establish their efficacy and to advance the knowledge of the field. SAMHSA's Treatment Improvement Protocol Series (TIPS)54 are best practice guidelines for the SUD treatment. SAMHSA draws on the experience and knowledge of clinical, research, and administrative experts to produce the TIPS, which are distributed to a growing number of facilities and individuals across the country. The audience for the TIPS is expanding beyond public and private SUD treatment facilities as alcohol and other drug disorders are increasingly recognized as a major health problem. SAMHSA's Evidence-Based Practice Knowledge Informing Transformation (KIT)55 was developed to help move the latest information available on effective M/SUD practices into community-based service delivery. States, communities, administrators, practitioners, consumers of mental health care, and their family members can use KIT to design and implement M/SUD practices that work. KIT covers getting started, building the program, training frontline staff, and evaluating the program. The KITs contain information sheets, introductory videos, practice demonstration videos, and training manuals. Each KIT outlines the essential components of the evidence-based practice and provides suggestions collected from those who have successfully implemented them.

Is information used regarding evidence-based or promising practices in your purchasing or policy decisions? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 2. Which value based purchasing strategies do you use in your state (check all that apply): a) gfedc Leadership support, including investment of human and financial resources. b) gfedc Use of available and credible data to identify better quality and monitored the impact of quality improvement interventions. c) gfedcb Use of financial and non-financial incentives for providers or consumers. d) gfedc Provider involvement in planning value-based purchasing. e) gfedcb Use of accurate and reliable measures of quality in payment arrangements. f) gfedcb Quality measures focus on consumer outcomes rather than care processes. g) gfedc Involvement in CMS or commercial insurance value based purchasing programs (health homes, ACO, all payer/global payments, pay for performance (P4P)). h) gfedc The state has an evaluation plan to assess the impact of its purchasing decisions. 3. Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? During spring of 2016, the SSA developed a summary rating scale (1 = far below average to 4 = far above average) for each provider of treatment services. The scale used the State Outcomes Measures plus some additional outcomes. The purpose of the scale was to promote value-based purchasing by county governments when spending state dollars to purchase treatment services for their residents. Counties used these ratings to challenge potential or existing vendors to accept quality improvement strategies that are incorporated into their service contracts. This process will be revisited in FY 2020. The SSA has developed a Performance Incentive Payment System (PIPS). It will be paying incentives to its Prison Intensive Recovery Treatment Supports (PIRTS) provider for outcomes achieved by clients upon release from prison. These include: retention in treatment for at least 90 days, no relapse within 5 months, no overdose within 6 months, no recidivism to jail/prison within 6 months, stable housing for 6 months, and full-time employment for 6 months. The first three quarters of incentive payments (July 2018 to March 2019) are expected to be made in fall 2019 after verification. As part of its Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHC) project, the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) will provide Quality Bonus Payments (QBPs) since it is utilizing the Prospective Payment System 2 (PPS 2) methodology. The first set of QBPs are ready to be made and need to be reviewed. QBPs are based on HEDIS measures. New Jersey's Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) program is based upon the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) model in the treatment of First Episode Psychosis and the principles of Coordinated Specialty Care. CSC is a recovery model promoting shared decision making and personalized treatment planning. Services offered under CSC include psychotherapy, medication management, case management, supported employment and education, family education and support, cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and peer and recovery supports. In September 2018, the SMHA developed a tool to monitor fidelity to the model and began site reviews of the agencies in October 2018. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. SAMHSA is interested in whether and how states are using evidence in their purchasing decisions, educating policymakers, or supporting providers to offer high quality services. In addition, SAMHSA is concerned with what additional information is needed by SMHAs and SSAs in their efforts to continue to shape their and other purchasers' decisions regarding M/SUD services. 49 United States Public Health Service Office of the Surgeon General (1999).

Does the state have policies for addressing early serious mental illness (ESMI)? nmlkj Yes nmlkji No 2. Has the state implemented any evidence-based practices (EBPs) for those with ESMI? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No If yes, please list the EBPs and provide a description of the programs that the state currently funds to implement evidence- based practices for those with ESMI. The State has not directly implemented evidence-based practices for ESMI. However, through the MHBG 10 percent set- aside, the state has implemented the Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) programs for the treatment of First Episode Psychosis. For the FY 2020, the SMHA will continue to implement the Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) programs for the treatment of First Episode Psychosis. Coordinated Specialty Care is a collaborative, recovery-oriented approach, involving the individual, treatment members, and, when appropriate, family/relatives as active participants. All services are highly coordinated with primary medical care and focus on optimizing the individual's overall mental and physical health. Three New Jersey agencies are providing CSC services in all 21 counties. They are Oaks Integrated Care, Rutgers UBHC, and Care Plus NJ Inc. CSC services are provided to those between the ages of 15-35 years old with psychotic symptoms for less than 2 years with or without treatment. Services are provided in home, community, and clinic settings that include Environmental Factors and Plan 4. Evidence-Based Practices for Early Interventions to Address Early Serious Mental Illness (ESMI) - 10 percent set aside - Required MHBG Narrative Question Much of the mental health treatment and recovery service efforts are focused on the later stages of illness, intervening only when things have reached the level of a crisis. While this kind of treatment is critical, it is also costly in terms of increased financial burdens for public mental health systems, lost economic productivity, and the toll taken on individuals and families. There are growing concerns among consumers and family members that the mental health system needs to do more when people first experience these conditions to prevent long-term adverse consequences. Early intervention* is critical to treating mental illness before it can cause tragic results like serious impairment, unemployment, homelessness, poverty, and suicide. The duration of untreated mental illness, defined as the time interval between the onset of a mental disorder and when an individual gets into treatment, has been a predictor of outcomes across different mental illnesses. Evidence indicates that a prolonged duration of untreated mental illness may be viewed as a negative prognostic factor for those who are diagnosed with mental illness. Earlier treatment and interventions not only reduce acute symptoms, but may also improve long-term prognosis. SAMHSA's working definition of an Early Serious Mental Illness is \"An early serious mental illness or ESMI is a condition that affects an individual regardless of their age and that is a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder of sufficient duration to meet diagnostic criteria specified within DSM-5 (APA, 2013). For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, the individual has not achieved or is at risk for not achieving the expected level of interpersonal, academic or occupational functioning. This definition is not intended to include conditions that are attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance use disorder, are attributable to an intellectual/developmental disorder or are attributable to another medical condition. The term ESMI is intended for the initial period of onset.\" States may implement models that have demonstrated efficacy, including the range of services and principles identified by National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) via its Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) initiative. Utilizing these principles, regardless of the amount of investment, and by leveraging funds through inclusion of services reimbursed by Medicaid or private insurance, states should move their system to address the needs of individuals with a first episode of psychosis (FEP). RAISE was a set of NIMH sponsored studies beginning in 2008, focusing on the early identification and provision of evidence-based treatments to persons experiencing FEP. The NIMH RAISE studies, as well as similar early intervention programs tested worldwide, consist of multiple evidence-based treatment components used in tandem as part of a Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) model, and have been shown to improve symptoms, reduce relapse, and lead to better outcomes. State shall expend not less than 10 percent of the MHBG amount the State receives for carrying out this section for each fiscal year to support evidence-based programs that address the needs of individuals with early serious mental illness, including psychotic disorders, regardless of the age of the individual at onset. In lieu of expending 10 percent of the amount the State receives under this section for a fiscal year as required a state may elect to expend not less than 20 percent of such amount by the end of such succeeding fiscal year. * MHBG funds cannot be used for primary prevention activities. States cannot use MHBG funds for prodromal symptoms (specific group of symptoms that may precede the onset and diagnosis of a mental illness) and/or those who are not diagnosed with a SMI.

The CSC team members include: a Team Leader, a Recovery Coach, a Supported Employment and Education Specialist, a Pharmacotherapist/Prescriber, an Outreach and Referral Specialist, and a Peer Support Specialist. Evidence Based Practice methods used to treat clients are recommended by the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) Manuals and include: Individual Placement and Support Person-Centered Therapy Motivational Interviewing Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) Cognitive remediation Trauma treatment Peer wellness coaching Trauma-informed care Individual Resiliency Training (IRT) Psychoeducation Supported Education & Employment 3. How does the state promote the use of evidence-based practices for individuals with ESMI and provide comprehensive individualized treatment or integrated mental and physical health services? Through the Coordinated Specialty Care program, the state promotes the use of EBPs to provide treatment for individuals with FEP. Comprehensive and individualized treatment is specifically provided through the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) where shared decision making with the individual and CSC providers are practiced. The IPS model is used to provide a strong foundation to help the individual achieve recovery. 4. Does the state coordinate across public and private sector entities to coordinate treatment and recovery supports for those with ESMI? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 5. Does the state collect data specifically related to ESMI? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 6. Does the state provide trainings to increase capacity of providers to deliver interventions related to ESMI? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 7. Please provide an updated description of the state's chosen EBPs for the 10 percent set-aside for ESMI. Several Evidence Based Practice methods are used by the three CSC providers. These methods are: Individual Placement and Support - Provides supported employment and education services for individuals with FEP while focusing on the strengths of the individual and their recovery. Person-Centered Therapy- Evidence based therapy used as non-directive method for individuals to reach fulfillment of their personal potentials through sociability and peer support. Motivational Interviewing- A treatment that addresses ambivalence to change though a conversational approach designed to help people build confidence on the way to recovery. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - A psychotherapy method used to help clients change their unhelpful thinking and behavior to positive thinking which can lead to enduring improvement in their mood and functioning. Cognitive Remediation- Cognitive remediation is a behavioral treatment that uses drill and practice, compensatory and adaptive strategies to facilitate improvement in targeted cognitive areas in individuals with FEP. Peer Wellness Coaching- Service provision to provide motivational and supportive counseling from peers to show the individual that recovery can be achieved. Trauma-Informed Care (TIC) - A therapeutic approach to care that helps the individual prevent violence and coercion while working together for change to bring the individual closer to recovery. Individual Resiliency Training (IRT)- a psychosocial treatment for individuals recovering from an initial episode of psychosis that is part of the larger team-based NAVIGATE program across 6 domains: illness self-management; substance use; residual and/or emerging symptoms; trauma and PTSD; health; and functional difficulties. NAVIGATE is a comprehensive program designed to provide early and effective treatment to individuals who have experienced a first episode of psychosis. Psychoeducation- Face-to-face contacts with a client and/or a family member with the primary purpose of providing information related to a psychiatric condition, wellness, skill building, and/or recovery options. Supported Employment and Education- Coaching that will give the client guidance as to receiving education though attaining their GED, H.S diploma or post-secondary education and employment training though goal-oriented practices. 8. Please describe the planned activities for FFY 2020 and FFY 2021 for your state's ESMI programs including psychosis? In FY 2020-2021, the focus will continue to be providing services for people with FEP. The state has expanded CSC service teams to accommodate a caseload from 35 to 70 clients. The three service providers will continue to provide CSC services to treat FEP population in all 21 counties in New Jersey. CSC services will be provided to those between the ages of 15-35 years old with Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey Page 2 of 3 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 286 of 456psychotic symptoms for less than 2 years with or without treatment. Services will be provided in home, community, and clinic settings that include evidence-based pharmacological treatment, supported employment and education services, individual and group psychotherapy, care management, family therapy, and recovery support. Services are provided by certified professionals with 24-hour accessibility. In SFY 2019, the three CSC programs had a total 277 referrals and treated a total of 215 clients. 9. Please explain the state's provision for collecting and reporting data, demonstrating the impact of the 10 percent set-aside for ESMI. The SMHA is utilizing several data collection tools to determine the efficacy of the CSC program to treat FEP. The providers submit the data to SMHA quarterly. The Quarterly Contract Monitoring forms (QCMR) tracks aggregate client data with regard to client caseload and client movement in and out of the program in a contract quarter. Client insurance and service provisions within the CSC program are also detailed along with quarterly staffing information. Client Clinical Evaluation data tracks client clinical outcomes from Intake to discharge over 3-month intervals. Clinical scores from the MIRECC Version of the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale are used to track mental health progress and functionality of clients in the CSC program. Other data fields include client psychotropic medication adherence and psychiatric hospitalization before and after clients receiving CSC services. Client Clinical Demographic data is designed to track essential client demographic data such as age, race/ethnicity, gender, county of residence, referral source, client primary health and hospitalization, insurance information, primary language, discharge information, and CSC re-admission. The state is currently in the process of adding additional data fields that would track client employment, education status, and substance use. Quarterly Progress Reports is designed to track client referral progress and any problems the service agencies experience so that the SMHA is aware of how the quality of service is affected. 10. Please list the diagnostic categories identified for your state's ESMI programs. Client diagnostic criteria for Coordinated Specialty Care in New Jersey are: Diagnosis: schizophrenia, schizoaffective and schizophreniform disorders, delusional disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified (NOS) Duration of psychotic symptoms greater than 1 week and less than 2 years Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. FY2019 Technical Assistance-- The state has procured technical assistance from SAMHSA though OnTrack NY in FY 2018 and 2019. The SMHA also disseminates training information received from SAMHSA related to the implementation of CSC. The SMHA continued its efforts to procure technical assistance opportunities for the New Jersey providers that serve the ESMI population. Two important trainings are highlighted in SFY 2019. A two-day training workshop on assessing and diagnosing clinical high risk and early psychosis in youth using the Structured Interview of Psychosis-risk Syndromes (SIPS) and Scale of Prodromal Syndromes (SOPS) screening tools was provided by Dr. Barbara Walsh from the Yale University School of Medicine on August 1-2, 2019 on the campus of the Rutgers University UBHC. The SIPS screening tool is a validated and most used diagnostic instrument of clinical high risk throughout the world. A group of New Jersey mental health service providers that include the members of the three CSC service providers (Oaks Integrated Care; Rutgers UBHC; Careplus NJ) and staff administrators from the DMHAS attended the training workshop and became certified users of the SIPS screening tool. A second full-day training with Dr. Walsh has been scheduled to take place on September 9, 2019 at Rutgers University UBHC. The focus of this training is on serving clinical high risk youth with SMI/SED. The members of New Jersey FEP-CSC teams as well as providers who serve the prodromal psychosis population will attend the training. This training will be funded by MHBG Technical Assistance funds SMHA received in SFY 2019. FY2020 Technical Assistance-- The SMHA is pursuing TA opportunities to address topics such as Medicaid and third party payer funding opportunities such as a bundled rate; FEP stepped care models; suicide prevention in the FEP population; and substance use disorders in the FEP population. The FEP would like the opportunity to receive TA from a state or states that has been able to expand their FEP programs to meet the statewide need, inclusive of expansion of FEP services and the implementation of stepped care models in the continuum of care. 3 of 3 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 287 of 4561.

The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) endorses person-centered planning for mental health consumers in its Vision Statement: At any point of entry the service system will provide access to appropriate and effective person-centered, culturally-competent services delivered by a welcoming and well trained workforce. Furthermore, person-centered planning is recognized in the DMHAS statement about its Values: Staff with the Division and its partner agencies value consumers' dignity and believe that services should be person-centered and person-directed. DMHAS has endorsed consumer empowerment and decision-making in the delivery of treatment and support services. It supports the hiring of peer specialists and ensures that they have a prominent role in assisting consumers. The Division currently supports 34 consumer-run Wellness/Self-Help Centers statewide, as well as many initiatives to train and support peer specialists (these are described elsewhere). DMHAS initiatives also encourage the engagement of caregivers. DMHAS empowers family members of those with a mental illness in its ongoing programs of Intensive Family Support Services (IFSS) that are situated statewide. Family members work with professionals to acquire the knowledge, skills and supports they need to improve functioning and gain a sense of control. In the last year, DMHAS used a TTI grant for training in Recovery-Oriented Cognitive Therapy (CT-R) at four behavior Health Homes; the initiative implemented a \"Train the Trainer\" approach through a collaboration between the Aaron T. Beck Center, the New Jersey Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) and Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care (UBHC). The trainees included peer specialist members of the Behavioral Health Home Team. This project demonstrated that training peers in CT-R in Behavioral Health Home (BHH) settings improves the effectiveness of peer support specialists and empowers them in assisting consumers' recovery. In cooperation with Rutgers Behavioral Healthcare, it has supported development of various tools to promote and facilitate consumer autonomy. These include a toolkit addresses use of tobacco called, Learning About Healthy Living, which has been used by several other states. A toolkit completed last year, Your Wellness Counts, which is a self-care/consumer-directed manual that teaches about healthy lifestyle choices and wellness goal setting. DMHAS also developed a 'Shared Decision Making around Medication' tool that guides consumers to prepare for medication appointments and create a record for future use. The tools are also posted on the DMHAS website for access and use. DMHAS continues to support consumers' development of Psychiatric Advance Directives (PADs) to express their wishes about their mental health care and other assistance during a personal mental health crisis. This year, DMHAS implemented an electronic registry of PADs, so that providers and consumers can retrieve PADs during episodes of crisis care. Early this year, the PAD Registry went live at http://www.state.nj.us/humanservices/dmhas/resources/mental/pad/. Both providers and peers were invited to meet at a training provided by DMHAS and were provided with information not only on how to \"upload documents\" in to the Registry, but were also provided with informational supplements on the laws regarding PADs; elements to include in a PAD; and the actual technical demonstration for the upload as well as the accessing of the Registry by the provider. Peers were also provided with regional trainings on what constitutes a legally acceptable PAD, how to assist someone in Environmental Factors and Plan 5. Person Centered Planning (PCP) - Required MHBG Narrative Question States must engage adults with a serious mental illness or children with a serious emotional disturbance and their caregivers where appropriate in making health care decisions, including activities that enhance communication among individuals, families, caregivers, and treatment providers. Person-centered planning is a process through which individuals develop their plan of service. The PCP may include a representative who the person has freely chosen, and/or who is authorized to make personal or health decisions for the person. The PCP team may include family members, legal guardians, friends, caregivers and others that the person or his/her representative wishes to include. The PCP should involve the person receiving services and supports to the maximum extent possible, even if the person has a legal representative. The PCP approach identifies the person?s strengths, goals, preferences, needs and desired outcome. The role of state and agency workers (for example, options counselors, support brokers, social workers, peer support workers, and others) in the PCP process is to enable and assist people to identify and access a unique mix of paid and unpaid services to meet their needs and provide support during planning. The person?s goals and preferences in areas such as recreation, transportation, friendships, therapies, home, employment, education, family relationships, and treatments are part of a written plan that is consistent with the person?s needs and desires.

Persons with PADs also receive wallet cards with information to access their PADs once they have completed the process. The Division staff are planning to work with their community partners to continue to raise awareness about the self-empowering nature of having a PAD in the Registry, and offering support in instances where individuals need some guidance or technical assistance uploading their document to the Registry. DMHAS also supports training to the provider community about how to engage consumers and promote their decision-making about their recovery. Illness Management and Recovery (IMR) training and follow up consultation and technical assistance is conducted by Rutgers-UBHC with the support of DMHAS. Before DMHAS transferred to the Department of Human Services (DHS), it held a Statewide Wellness Committee meeting with representatives of each of the four state hospitals to promote person centered planning, and assist with wellness initiatives and programs. Individuals with lived experience were active participants on the committee. 4. Describe the person-centered planning process in your state. Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) A person centered planning process is integrated in a number of services offered to consumers in New Jersey. These include Illness Management and Recovery (IMR), Supported Employment (SE), Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) and Community Support Services (CSS). Each of these services engages the individual in soliciting their wants, needs and desires as well as the skills and supports available to them. The consumers' goals are typically tied to a role and environment that they would like to attain or successfully remain in. The SMHA has incorporated IMR into the foundation of principles and practices central to a recovery- oriented, person-centered system of community mental health services; decrease symptoms, reduce relapses and hospitalizations and make progress towards personal goals through recovery. IMR is incorporated into the partial care systems and it is supported by the regulations. It is incorporated into the supportive housing now CSS systems. SE begins with a discussion of consumers' preferred field of work, occupation and or job. The consumer's employment background is reviewed to determine transferable skills and then individualized job development is initiated based upon the consumer's choice. While SE begins with paid support, natural supports provided by family, co-workers, friends or others are identified. CSC uses person-centered planning in the engagement process to provide a vision of recovery and hope that communicates the program's person-centered focus, as opposed to an illness-focused approach. PCP is first introduced to CSC clients in the shared decision-making model that incorporates suggestive advice from CSC therapists based on Evidence Based Practice methods. All of the eleven core EBP treatment methods address PCP in client care though engaging the client in weekly sessions to improve their quality of life while reducing symptomology. All of the CSC service modalities use PCP that include: Supported Employment and Education, Peer Support, Medication Monitoring, and Client Therapy. CSS is a mental health rehabilitation services and support process designed to assist the consumer in achieving rehabilitative and recovery goals as identified in an individualized rehabilitation plan; including achieving and maintaining valued life roles in the social, employment, educational, and housing domains; and assisting the consumer in restoring or developing his or her level of functioning to that which allows the consumer to achieve community integration, and to remain in an independent living setting of his or her choosing. Children's System of Care (CSOC) The goal of the Department of Children and Families' (DCF) Children's System of Care (CSOC) is to enable the youth to remain at home, in school, and within their community. Therefore, through an organized system of care approach, CSOC is committed to providing services that are: A. Clinically appropriate and accessible; B. Individualized, reflecting a continuum of services and/ or supports, both formal and informal, based on the unique strengths of each youth and his or her family/ caregivers; C. Provided in the least restrictive, most natural setting appropriate to meet the needs of the youth and his or her family/ caregivers; D. Family-guided, with families engaged as active participants at all levels of planning, organization, and service delivery; E. Community-based, coordinated, and integrated with the focus of having services, decision-making responsibility, and management resting at the community level; F. Culturally competent, with agencies, programs, services, and supports that are reflective of and responsive to the cultural, racial, and ethnic differences of the populations they serve; G. Protective of the rights of youth and their family/caregivers; and H. Collaborative across child-serving systems, involving; child protection, juvenile justice, and other system partners who are responsible for providing services and supports to the target populations. The NJ Children's System of Care is founded on the following Core Values and Principles: Family Driven and Youth Guided- Families are engaged as active participants at all levels of planning, organization, and service Printed: 11/19/2020 11:03 AM - New Jersey Page 2 of 4 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 289 of 456delivery. Culturally and Linguistically Competent - learning and incorporating the youth and family's culture, values, preferences, and interests into the planning process, including the identified language of the family. Community Based - identifying and utilizing supports that are least restrictive, accessible, and sustainable to maintain and strengthen the family's existing community relationships. Child Family Team (CFT)-Wraparound Approach The Wraparound approach depends on collaboration among a team of family members, professionals, and significant community residents identified by the family and organized by the care manager to design and oversee implementation of the Individual Service Plan (ISP). The ISP connects the assessed strengths and needs of the youth with plan elements including family vision, goals, strategies, and supports and services. The CFT is an ongoing coordinated process that includes participation from the youth, the youth's family, the CMO care manager, and any other individual identified by the youth and family to help support the family towards a sustainable plan of care. The CFT meets, at minimum, every 90 days or as needed. Through the CFT process, strengths and needs, progress and barriers to care, and services to be implemented are identified. Once identified, a request is added to the youth's treatment (care) plan, which is reviewed by Contracted System Administrator's (CSA) licensed clinical staff - Care Coordinators - against established clinical criteria and in the context of the youth's assessment and comprehensive plan. Clinical Criteria for services is located at: http://www.performcarenj.org/provider/clinical-criteria.aspx. The Care Coordination staff requests additional information from the CMO when there is question about the youth meeting clinical criteria. Clinically appropriate services are authorized. CFT members include, but are not limited to, the following individuals: Child/Youth/Young Adult Family Support Partner Parent(s)/Legal Guardian Care Management Organization Natural supports as identified and selected by youth and family Treating Providers (in-home, out-of-home, etc.) Educational Professionals Physical Health Providers (pediatrician, specialist) Probation Officer (if applicable) Child Protection & Permanency (CP&P) (if applicable) Family Support Organizations Family Support Organizations are operated by 15 agencies under contract with CSOC to: ensure that service plans developed for families are child-centered and family-focused; provide support to families through peer counseling, family training and workshops; advocate for families at the local level with other system partners; and cultivate and empower youth development consistent with the wellness and recovery model. The FSOs offer support to families of youth with behavioral health needs, substance use needs, and intellectual and developmental challenges. Family Support Partners within the FSOs are assigned to each family of youth enrolled in CMOs to offer and provide individual family peer-to-peer support. Additionally, the FSOs offer community-based supports to all youth and families in their service area. They provide community outreach and education on peer support and CSOC, family and youth support groups, youth partnership structure and activities, and telephonic support for families. The FSO NJ Alliance is contracted to provide training and technical assistance to FSOs. Contracted System Administrator (CSA) The Contracted System Administrator (CSA) was designed to provide the State with overall healthcare system management to assure 24-hour access to appropriate and coordinated services and provide child-specific and systemic data analysis on all children under the jurisdiction of CSOC. The CSA creates a common single point of entry for youth and families. The CSA registers all youth requesting services and authorizes services in a single electronic record. The CSA tracks and coordinates care for all New Jersey youth enrolled in CSOC. CSOC retains all regulatory and policy-making authority. The CSA is not a pre-paid health plan; instead it functions as and is inclusive of the activities of a non-risk Administrative Services Organization (ASO). As such, there are key functions that remain the responsibility of CSOC, including, but not limited to, network development, provider contracting, and provider outcome standards. As a partner to CSOC, the CSA provides administrative support and is encouraged to offer recommendations for improvements to the delivery of services which may be implemented with the approval of CSOC. The CSA performs a broad range of administrative service functions including, but not limited to, the following: Providing a Call Center with 24-hour/7-day intake and Customer Service capability; Providing a web-based application/interface with the CSA's Management Information System (MIS); Managing care, which includes utilization management, outlier management (including authorization of services), and care coordination; if youth are involved with a Care Management Organization, PerformCare reviews service requests based on the youth's comprehensive plan of care which is developed by the Child Family Team (CFT).

Onsite visits are made to each SAPT Block Grant recipient a minimum of one time per calendar year. More frequent reviews are conducted on an as needed basis for agencies recommended by the Contract Coordination meeting as needing additional technical assistance or monitoring because of violations, other deficiencies, or special grant requirements. The Contract Coordination meeting includes representatives from the Monitoring, Prevention, Fiscal and Treatment program units within DMHAS. Site visits may be anywhere from 1 to 5 days in duration depending on the size and scope of the program.

Program Integrity - Required Narrative Question SAMHSA has placed a strong emphasis on ensuring that block grant funds are expended in a manner consistent with the statutory and regulatory framework. This requires that SAMHSA and the states have a strong approach to assuring program integrity. Currently, the primary goals of SAMHSA program integrity efforts are to promote the proper expenditure of block grant funds, improve block grant program compliance nationally, and demonstrate the effective use of block grant funds. While some states have indicated an interest in using block grant funds for individual co-pays deductibles and other types of co-insurance for M/SUD services, SAMHSA reminds states of restrictions on the use of block grant funds outlined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300x-5 and 300x-31, including cash payments to intended recipients of health services and providing financial assistance to any entity other than a public or nonprofit private entity. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300x-55(g), SAMHSA periodically conducts site visits to MHBG and SABG grantees to evaluate program and fiscal management. States will need to develop specific policies and procedures for assuring compliance with the funding requirements. Since MHBG funds can only be used for authorized services made available to adults with SMI and children with SED and SABG funds can only be used for individuals with or at risk for SUD. SAMHSA guidance on the use of block grant funding for co-pays, deductibles, and premiums can be found at: http://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/grants/guidance-for-block-grant-funds-for-cost-sharing-assistance-for-private-health- insurance.pdf . States are encouraged to review the guidance and request any needed technical assistance to assure the appropriate use of such funds. The MHBG and SABG resources are to be used to support, not supplant, services that will be covered through the private and public insurance. In addition, SAMHSA will work with CMS and states to identify strategies for sharing data, protocols, and information to assist our program integrity efforts. Data collection, analysis, and reporting will help to ensure that MHBG and SABG funds are allocated to support evidence-based, culturally competent programs, substance use disorder prevention, treatment and recovery programs, and activities for adults with SMI and children with SED. States traditionally have employed a variety of strategies to procure and pay for M/SUD services funded by the MHBG and SABG. State systems for procurement, contract management, financial reporting, and audit vary significantly. These strategies may include: (1) appropriately directing complaints and appeals requests to ensure that QHPs and Medicaid programs are including essential health benefits (EHBs) as per the state benchmark plan; (2) ensuring that individuals are aware of the covered M/SUD benefits; (3) ensuring that consumers of M/SUD services have full confidence in the confidentiality of their medical information; and (4) monitoring the use of M/SUD benefits in light of utilization review, medical necessity, etc. Consequently, states may have to become more proactive in ensuring that state-funded providers are enrolled in the Medicaid program and have the ability to determine if clients are enrolled or eligible to enroll in Medicaid. Additionally, compliance review and audit protocols may need to be revised to provide for increased tests of client eligibility and enrollment. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:03 AM - New Jersey Page 1 of 2 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 292 of 456addresses at a minimum five core areas of performance: Facility, Staff, Treatment Records, Quality Assurance, Specialized Services, and Other contract requirements. Site visit report is sent to the subrecipient and subrecipient is to reply with a plan of correction (PoC) for areas found to be in noncompliance. Sub-recipients are notified in writing of the acceptance or non- acceptance of the plan of correction and the monitoring staff continues to follow up until an acceptable plan of correction is submitted. Agencies who continue to submit an unacceptable plan of correction are referred to the Contract Monitoring Meeting for further action. The DMHAS fiscal office has prepared a Policy and Procedure Manual that: covers disclosures to sub-recipients of federal award information; addresses the SABG fiscal compliance requirements, develops fiscal controls to maintain sufficient documentation for expenditures reported to SAMHSA, and develops appropriate internal controls for reporting expenditures. This manual was recently submitted to the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) Project Officer for review by the appropriate fiscal staff at SAMHSA. The following activities are done for program integrity of the MHBG. Letters are sent to provider agencies, on a state fiscal year basis, notifying them of their MHBG award amount, the CFDA number, and the restrictions on the use of the funds. These agencies are also monitored by the DMHAS Office of Community Services (OCS). One of the responsibilities of the OCS is to ensure that the services provided by contracted programs meet contractual expectations, and that appropriate action is taken to address performance issues. For licensed programs, the Office of Licensing validates that standards are met to achieve and maintain licensure, which include standards for quality and life safety. The OCS, however, has a role in the review of staff qualifications, particularly if a waiver is sought, access to services, and also in monitoring the implementation of Evidence Based Practices. Additionally, the OCS receives and responds to complaints and concerns from constituents, which often address issues of compliance with standards, safety considerations and access to services. By monitoring access to services, the OCS ensures that the target population is prioritized to receive contracted services. The OCS uses Quarterly Contract Monitoring Reports (QCMR's) to compare actual volume of service to contracted volume of service. When discrepancies are noted, follow-up occurs to identify the reasons for the discrepancies, and to require corrective action as needed. If a Corrective Action Plan is required of a provider agency, the regional office monitors the implementation of the plan until such time as either satisfactory improvement is achieved, or alternatively, contract modifications are made. The OCS may provide technical assistance to providers to help them to achieve the desired service outcomes and may engage other DMHAS staff to render technical assistance. It may be necessary to reduce or terminate a contract if the expected level of service is not achieved. Technical assistance is provided through in-person trainings and webinars, specifically when implementing new initiatives or programming throughout the State and includes Medicaid and non-Medicaid services and providers. The Medical Assistance Customer Service Centers conducts site reviews for Medicaid behavioral health providers that include chart reviews, program monitoring and regulatory compliance. Technical assistance is provided if warranted. Serious and extreme violations of a requirement are reported to the Office of Licensing or other governing authority, and if appropriate, the Medicaid Fraud Division for additional follow up with the agency. Site visit report is sent to the provider with a plan of correction (PoC) for areas found to be in noncompliance.

Environmental Factors and Plan 7. Tribes - Requested Narrative Question The federal government has a unique obligation to help improve the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives through the various health and human services programs administered by HHS. Treaties, federal legislation, regulations, executive orders, and Presidential memoranda support and define the relationship of the federal government with federally recognized tribes, which is derived from the political and legal relationship that Indian tribes have with the federal government and is not based upon race. SAMHSA is required by the 2009 Memorandum on Tribal Consultation56 to submit plans on how it will engage in regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of federal policies that have tribal implications. Improving the health and well-being of tribal nations is contingent upon understanding their specific needs. Tribal consultation is an essential tool in achieving that understanding. Consultation is an enhanced form of communication, which emphasizes trust, respect, and shared responsibility. It is an open and free exchange of information and opinion among parties, which leads to mutual understanding and comprehension. Consultation is integral to a deliberative process that results in effective collaboration and informed decision-making with the ultimate goal of reaching consensus on issues. In the context of the block grant funds awarded to tribes, SAMHSA views consultation as a government-to-government interaction and should be distinguished from input provided by individual tribal members or services provided for tribal members whether on or off tribal lands. Therefore, the interaction should be attended by elected officials of the tribe or their designees and by the highest possible state officials. As states administer health and human services programs that are supported with federal funding, it is imperative that they consult with tribes to ensure the programs meet the needs of the tribes in the state. In addition to general stakeholder consultation, states should establish, implement, and document a process for consultation with the federally recognized tribal governments located within or governing tribal lands within their borders to solicit their input during the block grant planning process. Evidence that these actions have been performed by the state should be reflected throughout the state?s plan. Additionally, it is important to note that approximately 70 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives do not live on tribal lands. The SMHAs, SSAs and tribes should collaborate to ensure access and culturally competent care for all American Indians and Alaska Natives in the states. States shall not require any tribe to waive its sovereign immunity in order to receive funds or for services to be provided for tribal members on tribal lands. If a state does not have any federally recognized tribal governments or tribal lands within its borders, the state should make a declarative statement to that effect. 56 https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/Presidential%20Memorandum%20Tribal%20Consultation%20%282009%29.pdf OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Footnotes: New Jersey does not have any federally recognized tribal governments or tribal lands within its borders.

Primary Prevention - Required SABG Narrative Question SABG statute requires states to spend not less than 20 percent of their SABG allotment on primary prevention strategies directed at individuals not identified to be in need of treatment. While primary prevention set-aside funds must be used to fund strategies that have a positive impact on the prevention of substance use, it is important to note that many evidence-based substance use disorder prevention strategies also have a positive impact on other health and social outcomes such as education, juvenile justice involvement, violence prevention, and mental health. The SABG statute requires states to develop a comprehensive primary prevention program that includes activities and services provided in a variety of settings. The program must target both the general population and sub-groups that are at high risk for substance misuse. The program must include, but is not limited to, the following strategies: 1.Information Dissemination providing awareness and knowledge of the nature, extent, and effects of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, abuse, and addiction on individuals families and communities; 2.Education aimed at affecting critical life and social skills, such as decision making, refusal skills, critical analysis, and systematic judgment abilities; 3.Alternative programs that provide for the participation of target populations in activities that exclude alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use; 4.Problem Identification and referral that aims at identification of those who have indulged in illegal/age inappropriate use of tobacco or alcohol, and those individuals who have indulged in first use of illicit drugs, in order to assess if the behavior can be reversed by education to prevent further use; 5.Community-based Process that include organizing, planning, and enhancing effectiveness of program, policy, and practice implementation, interagency collaboration, coalition building, and networking; and 6.Environmental Strategies that establish or change written and unwritten community standards, codes, and attitudes, thereby influencing incidence and prevalence of the abuse of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs used in the general population. In implementing the comprehensive primary prevention program, states should use a variety of strategies that target populations with different levels of risk, including the IOM classified universal, selective, and indicated strategies.

The program must include, but is not limited to, the following strategies: 1.Information Dissemination providing awareness and knowledge of the nature, extent, and effects of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, abuse, and addiction on individuals families and communities; 2.Education aimed at affecting critical life and social skills, such as decision making, refusal skills, critical analysis, and systematic judgment abilities; 3.Alternative programs that provide for the participation of target populations in activities that exclude alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use; 4.Problem Identification and referral that aims at identification of those who have indulged in illegal/age inappropriate use of tobacco or alcohol, and those individuals who have indulged in first use of illicit drugs, in order to assess if the behavior can be reversed by education to prevent further use; 5.Community-based Process that include organizing, planning, and enhancing effectiveness of program, policy, and practice implementation, interagency collaboration, coalition building, and networking; and 6.Environmental Strategies that establish or change written and unwritten community standards, codes, and attitudes, thereby influencing incidence and prevalence of the abuse of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs used in the general population. In implementing the comprehensive primary prevention program, states should use a variety of strategies that target populations with different levels of risk, including the IOM classified universal, selective, and indicated strategies.

The fundamental goal of NJPFS , however, is to address the prevention priorities identified by DMHAS' Prevention Strategic Planning Committe e. These priorities are consistent with those specified by CSAP for the federal PFS initiative . Two sets of evaluation goals have been developed for this evaluation. The first set of PFS evaluation goals for NJPFS involves our efforts to d etermine whether the interventions implemented by New Jersey's 17 regional prevention coalitions had an influence on the following: 1) Onset and reduction in the progression of underage drinking; 2) Reduction in the harmful consequences of underage drinking; 3) Reduction in the use of illegal substances , with a special focus on the use of opioids among young adults 18 -25 year s of age; 4) Reduction in the harmful consequences stemming from the use of illegal substances, with a special focus on the use of opioids among young adults 18-25 years of age; 5) Reduction in the prescription medication misuse across the lifespan; 6) Reduction in the harmful consequences of prescription medication misuse across the lifespan; and, 7) Reduction in the use of new and emerging drugs of abuse across the lifespan . The second set of evaluation goals involves our work to examine the influence of NJPFS on the structure and functioning of the 17 regional coalitions as well as the state prevention system. Specifically, our goals are to determine whether the NJPFS had an influence on the following: 1) Strengthening the prevention capacity and infrastructure at the state and community levels; and 2) Leveraging, redirecting, and aligning statewide funding streams and resources for prevention. Evaluation Questions Our evaluation questions were developed to correspond directly with the two sets of evaluation goals. These questions ask about the ways in which regional coalitions implemented the SPF model and the influence of their interventions on targeted outcomes representing intervening variables , use and consequences . In addition, these questions ask about the ways in which the broader NJPFS initiative influence d the prevention systems at the state and local levels. Specifically, the evaluation questions are as follows: 1) What was the process through which regional coalitions implemented the Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) model? a) Did coalitions implement the SPF model with a high degree of fidelity? Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 10 of 16 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 304 of 456New Jersey - 2 2) What was the process through which the NJPFS initiative was implemented? a) Was the NJPFS initiative implemented as planned? b) What deviations in NJPFS implementation occurred ? c) What were the effects of those deviations on performance? 3) What were the effects of the interventions implemented by regional prevention coalitions on the targeted intervening variables? 4) What were the effects of the interventions implemented by regional prevention coalitions on the following outcomes? a) Onset and reduction in the progression of underage drinking; b) Reduction in the harmful consequences of undera ge drinking; c) Reduction in the use of illegal substances, with a special focus on the use of opioids among young adults 18 -25 years of age; d) Reduction in the harmful consequences stemming from the use of illegal substances, with a special focus on the use o f opioids among young adults 18-25 years of age; e) Reduction in the prescription medication misuse across the lifespan; f) Reduction in the harmful consequences of prescription medication misuse across the lifespan; and, g) Reduction in the use of new and emerging drugs of abuse across the lifespan. Required Performance Measures Our evaluation of the NJPFS initiative will utilize information from the existing DMHAS prevention information data collection system known as the Prevention Outcomes Management System (POMS) . Data from POMS will be included in our reports so that SAMHSA can monitor the performance of NJPFS. POMS is critical to New Jersey's statewide prevention infrastructure and the planned evaluation because it provides an effective state and comm unity -level data collection system that includes both process and outcome s data. All subrecipients of the NJPFS initiative, which include regional coalitions and providers of training and technical assistance (T/TA), will be mandated by DMHAS to use POMS. As part of the Strategic Prevention Enhancement (SPE) grant DMHAS received in 2011, several modifications were made to POMS. One crucial modification involved integrat ion of key items from the Community Level Instrument (CLI) into POMS. The CLI, an importa nt component of the SPF -SIG Cross -Site Evaluation, ha d several strengths, including detailed data elements designed to capture information about sub -recipients' progress through the SPF model. In addition, the CLI was designed to collect information about the specific prevention interventions and strategies implemented by subrecipients. Elements from the CLI have been incorporated into POMS, and additional modifications will be made to track the provision of T/TA. The SPE grant allowed us to conduct an inv entory of all substance abuse prevention initiatives. This was the first inventory of all prevention initiatives ever conducted in New Jersey. The NJPFS initiative will allow us to replicate this inventory. Incorporating data from POMS and our new preventi on inventory into our evaluation plan will allow us to report several measures of performance, including the following: 1) Number of T/TA a ctivities provided through NJPFS to regional coalitions to support communities ; 2) Reach (numbers served) of T/TA activities provided through NJPFS; Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 11 of 16 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 305 of 456New Jersey - 3 3) Percentage of communities targeted by regional coalitions that have increased the number or percentage of evidence -based programs, policies, and/or practices (EBPPPs) ; 4) Percentage of communities targeted by regional coalitions that report an increase in prevention activities supported by leveraging of resources ; and, 5) Percentage of regional coalitions that submit data to the POMS data system . POMS will be particularly use ful for our evaluation since it follow s the national model for the SPF SIG evaluation. Another vital modification to POMS included a new Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) Module that tracks prevention providers' development of plans and progress in addr essing the priorities that are specified by the State for particular funding awards. In addition, POMS now has an Environmental Module. Based on the CLI, the module collects information on activities related to policy enactment, enforcement and communicati on. These new modules will allow us to report several measures of performance, including the following: 1) Number of active partners supporting the local PFS initiative ; 2) Number of people reached by Institute of Medicine (IOM) prevention category (universal, selected, indicated) ; 3) Number of people reached by demographic category ; 4) Number of EBPPPs implemented by subrecipient communities ; and, 5) Number of prevention activities at the subrecipient community level that are supported by leveraging of fun ding streams Another c omponent to be added to POMS, with support of this new funding, is a new Outcomes Module. It will incorporate the CSAP and PFS required national outcomes measures (NOMS ), such as 30 -day use, binge drinking, drug and/or alcohol -related crime, drug and/or alcohol -related car crashes and injuries, perceived risk/harm, and other targeted outcomes. This new Outcomes Module will allow us to report the following measures of performance: 1) Past-30-day alcohol use 2) Past-30-day prescription drug mi suse 3) Binge drinking 4) Alcohol - and drug -related car crashes 5) Alcohol - and drug -related crime 6) Perception of parental of alcohol use 7) Perceived risk or harm or alcohol use 8) Alcohol and prescription drug -related emergency room visits It is important to note that, at this time, we are specifying these NOMS in our evaluation plan only for the grantee. The regional coalitions have not yet developed their strategic plans to describe the nature of their particular intervention activities that will be conducted und er the auspices of the NJPFS initiative . Measurement Our evaluation will use multiple methods , measures, and designs to assess process and outcome variables at state, coalition and community levels of analysis. As stated previously, our evaluation quest ions ask about the ways in which regional coalitions implemented the SPF model and the influence of their interventions on targeted outcomes representing intervening variables, use and consequences. In addition, these questions ask about the ways in which the broader NJPFS initiative influenced the prevention systems at the state and local levels.

Data from w eb-based, self-report survey s, key informant interviews, participant observations, and analyses of documents (e.g., meeting minutes) , along with data from the POMS , will be used to complete assessments of coalitions' fidelity to the SPF model and whether the NJPFS i nitiative was implemented as planned. A quantitative self -report survey will be administered online to all coalition members and qualitative, structured telephone interviews will be conducted with 2 -3 coalition members and key DMHAS personnel. Participants in interviews will be drawn from a purposeful, nonrandom sampling strategy, which involved two levels of participants. The first group will involve state -level individuals, comprised of staff members within DMHAS and active members of the SEOW. The second group will involve individuals at the community level, consisting of participants within each of the regional coalitions. Together, these data will be used to assess coalitions' fidelity of implementation (FOI) to the SPF model . We will rely on the SPF FO I instrument develo ped by RMC Research , along with the SPF FOI User's Guide and Fidelity Assessment Rubric , to assess FOI in this evaluation. These surveys, interviews, and FOI assessment will be conducted annually. To address our outcomes -related questions, variables at the state and community level s of analysis will be analyzed using interrupted time -series methodology to assess changes in outcomes in the targeted areas over time. Regarding outcome measure s, below are the grantee - level measures that we have identified to date. Because regional coalitions have not yet developed their strategic plans to describe the nature of their particular intervention activities that will be conducted under the auspices of the NJPFS initiative , we are not identifying specific measures for coalitions at this time.

Specifically, a case study design will be used to assess fidelity of implementation ( FOI) to the SPF model at both the coalition and grantee/state levels. To assess coalitions' FOI to the SPF model, we will use the SPF FOI instrument develo ped by RMC Research. This instrument , along with the SPF FOI User's Guide and Fidelity Assessment Rubric , was developed to measure FOI to the SPF model , and it has specific criteria that can be sued by evaluators to assess the extent to which subrecipients' epidemiological workgroups use data to identify subpopulations vulnerable to disparities . Our evaluation team will use this instrument to ass ess whether regional coalitions used data to identify subpopulations vulnerable to disparities . Data from POMS will be used to determine the extent which coalitions implement ed strategies to decrease the differences in access, service use, and outcomes among subpopulations. Our evaluation also will measure access to culturally and linguistically a ppropriate services . Specifically, we will apply a modified version of a self -assessment tool developed by Michigan's Bureau of Substance Abuse and Addictive Services to assess the extent to which regional coalitions are implementing the SPF model and prev ention strategies in ways that are culturally and linguistically appropriate . This self -assessment was designed to ensure that coalitions' members and staff were selected to bring diverse points of view and perspectives to the design and implementation of culturally -relevant practices. It also will assess whether cultural competence is permeated throughout the SPF process and whether c ultural competence is considered as something more than racial and ethnic diversity.

Together, these qualitative and quantitative data will be used to complete the SPF FOI instrument . Qualitative data be gathered to descri be implementation of the SPF model and the process through which the NJPFS initiative was implemented will be analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Our evaluation team will conduct the key informant interviews by telephone, using the structured schedu le of questions. Recorded notes from the interviews will be entered into Atlas.ti version 6.1.17, qualitative data software, for analysis. One coder will assign in -vivo codes (line by line) to the transcripts of each of the interview questions separately. All codes will then be grouped into categories to explore patterns or themes. Themes will be identified and quantified within the data patterns . The first step in the analysis of quantitative data from our self -report survey of coalition members will consist of data cleaning and verifying the accuracy of data entry and missing data. Frequency distributions will be tabulated for all variables and will be examined for normality in conjunction with ske wness in the case of numerical variables. If there are extreme deviations, appropriate non -linear transformations (e.g., log) will be applied to the data. This is an initial, yet crucial, step to ensure the integrity of our data. To test the validity of o ur quantitative measures in the self -report survey , we will conduct a series of confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) of the individual -level survey data. CFA will be performed to examine the underlying measurement models for survey scales. Although factor analysis represents a broad category of approaches and procedures for determining the latent structure of observed variables and assessing construct validity of an instrument , CFA will be used to impose substantively motivated constraints on the models and t o perform statistical tests that will determine if the sample data obtained are consistent with the imposed constraints of the models. Prior to performing the CFA, exploratory data analysis will be conducted to inspect the univariate skewness and kurtosis values of the measured variables. In addition, the Kolmogorov - Smirnov test of normality will be performed to determine whether data are normally distributed. Mardia's coefficient of multivariate kurtosis provided by AMOS will also be examined to determine whether the assumption of multivariate normality is tenable. Based on these results, a decision will be made whether to use the frequently applied ML method of estimation or the asymptotically distribution -free (ADF) estimation procedure. The ML procedure requires the observed variables to be normally distributed whereas the ADF estimation does not. Researchers have suggested the use of ADF when the nature of the data could not justify the application of the ML. The overall fit of the data to the examined m odels will be initially based on the chi - square statistic. However, we recognize that the chi -square statistic is very sensitive to departures from normality. In an attempt to overcome this problem, our interpretation of model fit will be based on evaluat ing several fit indexes, parameter estimates, and residual error terms. We also will analyze longitudinal data from our quantitative survey of coalition members to examine changes in coalitions' structure, functioning, and fidelity to the SPF model over t ime. We will perform these analyses with structural equation modeling (SEM) procedures on observed variables using AMOS 21. These analyses will b e conducted to determine if significant overall changes in the variables occurred over time, if significant var iability existed in individual change trajectories, and if relationships existed between baseline values and changes over time. Regarding expected sample sizes, we anticipate approximately 400 responses to our quantitative self -report survey that will be administered online to all coalition members . In addition, we anticipate approximately 50 individuals to participate in our key informant Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 15 of 16 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 309 of 456New Jersey - 7 interviews.

These data will be used to test the effects of the interventions implemented by regional prevention coalitions on the targeted intervening variables . It is important to recognize that the analyses presented here apply only to outcomes at the state level of analysis because regional coalitions have not yet developed their strategic plans to describe the nature of their particular intervention activities that will be conducted under the auspices of the NJPFS initiat ive. Although these analyses do not include a control or comparison group, they do allow for baseline and post -intervention comparisons, as well as procedures to measure change over time. Participation in PFS National Cross -Site Evaluation Our evaluation team will work closely with the national cross -site evaluators to provide data and other support as needed for this project. The evaluation team will comply with all requirements of the cross -site evaluation . Our evaluation also will integrate the cross -site evaluation instruments at the grantee and coalitions levels . We will ensure all data collection for the Grantee -Level Instrument and Community -Level Instrument . Reporting Plan The evaluation team will provide annual reports to the DMHAS' State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup (SEOW). The DMHAS epidemiologist , along with the SEOW Manager , will then develop electronic and hard copy data products for dissemination to policy maker s, state agencies and local communities. Products will include Powerpoint projects to be presented locally to community organizations, county and state departments, and non-profit groups . Data fact sheets will be published and disseminated on a n annual schedule.

Describe available services and resources in order to enable individuals with mental illness, including those with co-occuring mental and substance use disorders to function outside of inpatient or residential institutions to the maximum extent of their capabilities. SMHA funds four levels of service along the mental health continuum of care with Community Mental Health Block Grant, and other federal or state funds. They are: Prevention and Early Intervention Services, Acute Care Services, Intermediate and Rehabilitative Services, and Recovery Support including Consumer Operated Services. In addition, the SMHA partially funds four County Psychiatric Hospitals. The SMHA also engages in Olmstead Initiatives. The Department of Health has oversight for the four State Psychiatric Hospitals. (1) Prevention and Early Intervention. The following are the SMHA's specific prevention initiatives: Executive Order #58 established the Governor's Council on Mental Health Stigma. Each year the Council presents Ambassador Awards to those who champion the mission to raise mental health awareness to combat stigma. Due to the restructuring of the Governor's Council which is still in progress, the Ambassador Awards, did not occur in 2019. However, in the coming months, the Council will reconvene with renewed energy and enthusiasm and plan for their initiatives in Fiscal Year 2020. First Episode Psychosis. New Jersey has utilized the MHBG 10% set-aside funds for providing service to individuals with first episode psychosis (FEP) since FY 2017 and will continue to provide the service in FY 2020-2021. NJ PROMISE Program for Serving Youth and Young Adults at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P) In FY 2019, the New Jersey Children's System of Care (CSOC) was awarded a SAMHSA grant for establishing community programs for outreach and intervention with youth and young adults at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P). DMHAS and CSOC co-lead the project. The project title is NJ PROMISE - Prevention, Resilience, Optimism, Mastery, Insight, Support, and Education. The NJ PROMISE program serves youths and young adults not more than 25 years of age who experience the prodromal symptoms of psychosis. This program provides evidence-based interventions to prevent and/or delay the onset of psychosis. Moving on Maternal Depression (MOMD) Initiative: In August 2018, New Jersey received an award from the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) through its Moving on Maternal Depression (MOMD) initiative. The 18-month grant provides technical assistance on promising practices toward serving populations with maternal depression. This initiative built a collaborative that focuses on improving the ability to serve mothers with maternal depression in New Jersey. The state agencies in the collaborate are the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Department of Health, the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, the Department of Children and Families, and three maternal health consortia. Suicide Prevention. The SMHA funds the NJ Suicide Prevention Hopeline which accepts calls 24/7 from individuals seeking information or assistance for themselves or others at risk of suicide. If the caller is assessed as at risk for suicide, there is a warm transfer of the caller to the screener center. In addition, SMHA has scheduled to implement a statewide Zero Suicide approach in collaboration with the Zero Suicide Institute in fall of 2019. (2) Acute Care Services. The SMHA funds and regulates a variety of acute mental health care programs for individuals with acute mental health needs and for those experiencing psychiatric crises. They include Designated Screening Centers (DSC), Affiliated Emergency Services (AES), Early Intervention Support Services (EISS), Involuntary Outpatient Commitment (IOC), Intensive Outpatient Treatment and Support Services (IOTSS), and Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (outreach to persons who are homeless) and Short Term Care Facility (STCF) beds.

Describe your state's case management services Consumers are linked to Integrated Case Management Services (ICMS) upon discharge from a state hospital, county hospital or Short Term Care Facility (STCF) for 12 months post-discharge from the inpatient setting. ICMS services work collaboratively with the consumer, their family/significant others (as appropriate) and other collateral contacts to assesses the individual's strengths and needs, develop a service plan based on this assessment, refer and link individuals to needed services and monitor their engagement in services. ICMS services are available for a minimum of 12 months and can be extended beyond 12 months pursuant to the individual's specific needs. In addition, PACT, PATH, and FEP programs also provide case management services. PACT is an evidence-based model of service delivery in which a multi-disciplinary, mobile, treatment team provides a comprehensive array of mental health and rehabilitative services to a targeted group of individuals with SMI. The program is designed to meet the needs of consumers, who are at high risk for hospitalization, are high service users and who have not been able to benefit from traditional mental health programs. In order to meet the unique needs of this targeted population, PACT teams offer highly individualized services, employ a low staff to consumer ratio, conduct the majority of their contacts in natural community settings (e.g. consumer's residence) and are available to help individuals address psychiatric crises 24 hours a day. Service intensity is flexible and regularly adjusted to consumer needs. All New Jersey PATH programs provide outreach, screening and assessment, case management and referral services for community mental health and substance abuse treatment services, financial benefits, primary health services, job training/vocational and educational services and relevant housing services including; emergency housing, transitional housing and permanent housing services. The New Jersey's CSC programs for individuals with FEP emphasize a team approach with the following components: outreach, low-dosage medications, cognitive and behavioral skills training, Individualized Placement and Support, Supported Employment and Supported Education, case management, and family psycho-education. Each CSC team is comprised of six team members of mostly masters' level trained clinicians. They include a team leader, a recovery coach, a supported employment and education specialist, a pharmacotherapist, an outreach and referral specialist; and a peer support specialist. 4. Describe activities intended to reduce hospitalizations and hospital stays. The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) is in the process of revising Administrative Bulletin 5:11 in an effort to reduce hospital lengths of stay. Under this bulletin, consumers in state psychiatric hospitals are assigned to community service providers whom have the option of either accepting the consumer or requesting additional supports from DMHAS. In addition to community providers, state psychiatric hospitals have the option within their discharge planning process of requesting additional supports for the consumer in their potentially new living situations outside the institutions. Such requests and other efforts Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 2 of 10 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 312 of 456toward successful discharge are to be documented within the Individual Needs for Discharge Assessment (INDA). Assignments are based on hospital treatment team recommendations as well as consumer choice, and the assigned provider is expected to participate in every treatment team meeting from the consumer's first to his/her last while in the hospital. The early involvement of community providers in the treatment planning process fosters familiarity between provider and consumer, allowing for immediate planning on the part of the provider to prepare to meet the individualized needs of each consumer upon discharge into their care. This preparation is critical to ensuring that the consumer is provided with necessary community supports and thereby maximizing his/her chances of sustained integration within the community. As part of its Home to Recovery II Plan, DMHAS is focusing its efforts on enhancing the community-based resources available to its consumers. One such enhancement is the implementation of Community Support Services (CSS). A Medicaid-billable rehabilitative service, CSS offers education to consumers in the community on navigating daily activities, rather than performing these activities on their behalf. The goal of these services is to nurture independence and self-reliance on the part of the consumer, empowering them to thrive as functional and competent members of a community outside of an institutional setting. DMHAS has sharpened its focus on consumer employment as another key element to optimal community integration. To that effect, the Division has enhanced its Supported Employment services to include an in-reach pilot within the three regional state hospitals. Implemented in July 2015, this pilot program targets individuals who are ready for discharge and examines their interest in competitive employment outside the hospital. This in-reach is supplemental to the Division's existing Supported Employment services, which are available in each of New Jersey's 21 counties. Supported Employment services include assistance accessing benefits counseling; identification of occupational skills and interests; and the development and implementation of a job search plan based on the consumer's strengths, interests, needs, and abilities. The ultimate goal for consumers receiving Supported Employment services is to obtain meaningful and competitive employment as a means of further ensuring sustained integration within the community. Another area of focus for DMHAS's Home to Recovery II Plan is the examination of outcomes geared toward monitoring sustainability of the Division's community integration efforts. These outcomes include the completion of Medicaid applications within 30 days of determining the necessary level of care for consumers in state psychiatric hospitals; an increase in Peer Support Specialists across state psychiatric hospitals; expansion of the Behavioral Health Home initiative integrating primary and behavioral health care for mental health services consumers; enhanced utilization of Supportive Housing in the form of sustained tenure in Supportive Housing placements, expansion of Supportive Housing opportunities, and an increase in discharges to Supportive Housing as well as in the percentage of consumers served by Supportive Housing as compared to state psychiatric hospitals; and finally a decrease in hospitalizations in the form of lower census counts (for CEPP consumers and the total hospital population); fewer admissions to state hospitals; a reduction in length of stay on CEPP status and within the hospital overall; and a decrease in CEPP consumers as a proportion of the total hospital census. There are the activities that SMHA would like to highlight: 1. The partnership with Vital Statistics continues. In October 2014, DMHAS established a partnership with Vital Statistics in the New Jersey Department of Health to allow DMHAS staff to routinely retrieve birth certificates prepared by Vital Statistics for New Jersey born consumers that were previously unable to produce them. This process has greatly improved the discharge process by helping to remove a significant barrier to discharge. In SFY2017, 471 birth certificates were obtained by way of this collaboration. The number of birth certificates obtained in SFY 2018 and SFY 2019 were 438 and 401 respectively. 2. The Bed Enrollment Data System (BEDS) was developed to help DMHAS manage and track vacancies. Utilization of a web-based system provides real-time access to vacancy information and helps facilitate assignments. 3. Enhancements to the Individual Needs for Discharge Assessment (INDA) were made. DMHAS has recently implemented INDA- specific canned reports, which provide hospital staff and central office users with immediate access to information contained within the assessment, including but not limited to provider assignments, attendance at treatment team meetings, functional needs of each hospital's census, and consumers refusing to be discharged. This information will be used at all levels of the Division and drive efforts geared toward quality improvement and planning for the allocation of resources and the implementation of new initiatives. 4. Continued utilization of the Intensive Case Review Committee (ICRC) is employed. All consumers in the state hospital are reviewed by ICRC once every four weeks to ensure that consumer assignments have been made in preparation for discharge in a timely manner, barriers to discharge are addressed, systemic issues are addressed, and compliance with length of stay targets are maintained. The purpose of these meeting is to develop strategies for resolution of barriers and systems issues. 5. Utilization of Hospital Project Teams continues. Project Team meetings are higher-level meetings that occur immediately after ICRC and are typically chaired by the hospital CEO/DCEO or Medical Director. Policy and systems issues, as well as any issue that may involve collaboration with another Division or state Department, are discussed at these meetings and elevated to Olmstead leadership to address. In addition to policy and systems reviews, Project Team meetings also discuss newly-designated CEPP consumers to ensure that a discharge plan is in place. On an as-needed basis, teams also hear brief case presentations in the event that Olmstead resources are needed. Finally, Olmstead staff will also use these meetings to update the hospital leadership on any new administrative bulletins, requests for proposals, updates or changes to the vacancy tracking system, and/or trends Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 3 of 10 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 313 of 456identified in the data. 6. Hospital Diversion Initiative continues. The Olmstead Office has partnered with Centralized Admissions within the state psychiatric hospitals on a process for redirecting would-be hospitalizations to less restrictive community settings. Regional Olmstead staff assist Centralized Admissions in securing additional supports needed for applicable consumers as a means of addressing their individualized circumstances and needs in the most integrated setting possible within their required level of care. This collaboration allows for reduced hospital census as well as enhanced community integration as mental health consumers are diverted from state or county hospitals and continue to live independently in the community.

Column C requires that the state indicate the expected incidence rate of individuals with SMI/SED who may require services in the state's M/SUD system. MHBG Estimate of statewide prevalence and incidence rates of individuals with SMI/SED Target Population (A) Statewide prevalence (B) Statewide incidence (C) 1.Adults with SMI 375,227 2.Children with SED 122,296 Describe the process by which your state calculates prevalence and incidence rates and provide an explanation as to how this information is used for planning purposes. If your state does not calculate these rates, but obtains them from another source, please describe. If your state does not use prevalence and incidence rates for planning purposes, indicate how system planning occurs in their absence. New Jersey currently uses the federal definition of SED and SMI: Children with SED refers to persons from birth to age 18 and adults with SMI refers to persons age 18 and over; who (1) currently meet or at any time during the past year has met criteria for a mental disorder - including within developmental and cultural contexts - as specified within a recognized diagnostic classification system (e.g., most recent editions of DSM, ICD, etc.), and (2) display functional impairment, as determined by a standardized measure that impedes progress towards recovery and substantially interferes with or limits the person's role or functioning in family, school, employment, relationships, or community activities. Prevalence: According to the Federal methodology proposed for estimating the prevalence of SMI, the proportion of adults within the state with a SMI is 5.4% (Federal Register, Volume 64, No. 121, p. 33890). According to figures released by the United States Census Bureau, the 2018 adult population of New Jersey was 6,948,646. The size of the New Jersey child population was 1,528,702. Using the SAMHSA's SMI prevalence rate among persons 18 and older (5.4%) the estimated number of adults with SMI in New Jersey in 2018 was 375,227. Using the SAMHSA's SED prevalence rate (8.0%), the estimated number of children with SED in New Jersey in 2018 was 122,296. New Jersey has not established a methodology to estimate statewide incidence rate of individuals with SMI/SED.

Describe your state's targeted services to rural population. The SMHA defines a county as \"rural\" if, according to U.S. Census figures, 25% or more of its population lived in rural areas. Using this definition, New Jersey does not have any rural counties. Since there are no federally recognized rural areas in New Jersey, the Office of Rural Health Policy's Rural-Urban Community Area (RUCA) definition was utilized. Community-based services for rural populations were enhanced and expanded by Block grant funding and other federal grants. In December, 2016 New Jersey was selected as one of eight states from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) to participate in a two-year Certified Community Behavioral Health Center (CCBHC) demonstration program. The program was funded as part of a comprehensive effort to bring behavioral health care in parity with physical health care and to improve community behavioral health services overall as part of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA, \u00a7 223). New Jersey selected seven CCBHCs in six counties, including six CCBHCs in five metropolitan counties plus AtlantiCare in Hammonton, a rural underserved pocket of Atlantic County. The CCBHCs offer services within an integrative, holistic framework, thereby closing a treatment gap that frequently results in inadequate service provision for individuals with co-existing social, physical and behavioral health care needs. New Jersey's CCBHCs offer 24-hour crisis care, treatment for co-occurring substance use disorder and mental illness, ambulatory and medical withdrawal management, evidence-based outpatient counseling, case management, and family support services. CCBHC populations of focus include individuals with serious mental illness (SMI), those with severe substance use disorders (SUD), children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance (SED), former or current military personnel experiencing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and youth and adults with physical health risk factors and/or mental health diagnoses such as anxiety and depressive disorders other than Major Depressive Disorder who are not already covered in the target population. During CCBHC Demonstration Year 1 which covered the period July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018, NJ's seven CCBHCs cumulatively enrolled 17,851 consumers. Nineteen percent of the patient population were children and adolescents aged 0 to 17, three- quarters (73.3%) of patients were aged 18 to 64, and 8% were seniors aged 65 years and older. Between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018, AtlantiCare enrolled 554 consumers. 91.0 percent of AtlantiCare CCBHC patients were aged 18 to 64 and 9% were seniors aged 65 years and older. By gender, three-fifths of patients were female. By race, 71.3% of consumers were white and 10% were black/African American, although race information was missing for 17% of consumers. Sixteen percent of consumers were of Hispanic ethnicity. Broken down by diagnostic subgroup, half (48.5%) of AtlantiCare CCBHC consumers had a primary diagnosis of Severe Mental Illness, two-fifths (37.7%) were members of the General population, and 14% had a primary diagnosis of Substance Use Disorder. Thirty-six percent of consumers were commercially insured, 12% had primary Medicare insurance, and 37% had Medicaid insurance as their primary insurer. An additional 6% of clients were dually Medicare/Medicaid insured for a total of 43.8% of AtlantiCare CCBHC consumers who had primary Medicaid insurance or were dually Medicare/Medicaid insured. The CCBHC Demonstration Program is scheduled to end on September 13, 2019. The state is currently reviewing plans for sustainability. b. Describe your state's targeted services to the homeless population. SMHA operates Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program using a combination of federal and state funds. The target population is homeless adults or those at risk of homelessness who have a serious mental illness, including those with co-occurring substance use disorders who are not currently engaged in and are resistant to mental health and other community support services. All New Jersey PATH programs provide outreach, screening and assessment, case management and referral services for community mental health and substance abuse treatment services, financial benefits, primary health services, job training/vocational and educational services and relevant housing services including; emergency housing, transitional housing and permanent housing services. A limited number of PATH programs also provide some of the following services directly; security deposits and payment of back rent, mental health assessment and treatment, representative payee services and staff training. Recovery, community integration and housing stability are the long-term goals of the program, achieved through client-centered treatment planning. The SMHA contracts with 25 non-profit agencies to operate PATH programs within the state's 21 counties. A small number of PATH programs use PATH funding to directly provide psychiatric assessment and outpatient mental health services. Many PATH providers are Community Mental Health Centers and link their consumers to mental health in their agency outpatient or partial care programs. All PATH programs link individuals to behavioral health and co-occurring services within their communities. Narratve Question Criterion 4: Targeted Services to Rural and Homeless Populations and to Older Adults Provides outreach to and services for individuals who experience homelessness; community-based services to individuals in rural areas; and community-based services to older adults. Criterion 4 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 7 of 10 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 317 of 456In SFY 2018, the PATH programs in New Jersey provided outreach to 4,284 individuals and served a total of 2,417 persons. 1,108 program participants were linked to mental health services, 289 to substance use treatment services, 410 to primary health/dental care, 623 to financial services, 467 to temporary housing/shelter, 527 to long term housing and 198 were linked to employment or vocational and educational services. Services provided under the CCBHC initiative are available to all who meet programmatic criteria without regard for race, ethnicity, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, or place of residence. Policies such as \"no wrong door\" allows any consumer access to CCBHC services regardless of insurance or pay status, place of residence, or lack of a permanent address. An average of three percent of CCBHC consumers at each CCBHC provider reported being homeless or living in a shelter during Demonstration Year 1. The two CCBHCs located in Trenton, Oaks Integrated and Catholic Charities, served the highest homeless populations at 10 percent and five percent, respectively. In 2019, SMHA has created approximately 50 At-Risk Tenant Based Rental Subsidies for individuals with mental illness intended to promote: housing stability; engagement with mental health services and primary healthcare; community inclusion and wellness and recovery. c. Describe your state's targeted services to the older adult population. Statewide Clinical Outreach Program for the Elderly (S-COPE) provides a multidisciplinary treatment team approach to address the statewide crisis needs of older adults with SMI. In 2011, DMHAS saw a need to develop specialized services to assist screening centers and nursing homes to respond to an increasing number of older adults with behavioral problems. In 2012, DMHAS awarded a contract for the development of a program to provide specialized clinical consultation, assessment, treatment and intervention to older adults who were at risk for presentation to ERs for psychiatric hospitalization. Trinitas Regional Medical Center in Elizabeth, New Jersey was the recipient and has been administering this Statewide Clinical Outreach Program for the Elderly (S-COPE), which is fully funded by DMHAS and has been in operation since April 2012. S-COPE provides crisis intervention and stabilization, consultation, and training for the management of mental health and behavioral health issues in older adults (55+) residing in nursing homes and State-funded residential care facilities. S-COPE functions as a multidisciplinary team consisting of a geriatric psychiatrist (consultant), a gero-psychologist, geriatric advanced practice nurse, and masters level clinicians. Outcomes are carefully monitored and reported to DMHAS on a monthly basis. The S-COPE program is available 24 hours/7 day a week to offer face-to-face clinical consultative services. S-COPE staff also provide training and technical assistance to screeners, administrators, clinical staff, direct care staff and support staff, primarily in nursing facilities to improve staff's ability to assess, provide treatment, manage behavioral disturbances and stabilize crises for this population. The multidisciplinary clinical team advocates for acute care treatment of older adults who need psychiatric hospitalization and advocates within the facility for management of behavioral issues for individuals who would not benefit from inpatient psychiatric stays. Prior to S-COPE's inception, individuals with dementia were more likely to be referred to mental health crisis screening centers and emergency rooms, and many were subsequently being admitted to inpatient psychiatric facilities, including state psychiatric hospitals. In 2018, there were 921 referrals to S-COPE and 189 were diverted from screening centers. There were 1,532 face to face visits conducted and 2,770 phone consultations. S-COPE continues to provide support in maintaining clients in facilities by closely working with nursing staff. With S-COPE involvement, at least 12 individuals have been diverted from state hospitals. S-COPE equips staff by sharing best practices and offering trainings. All trainings, assessments, and treatments offered are consistent with promising practices and/or evidence-based practices. Trainings are delivered by S-COPE interdisciplinary team members consisting of Master level clinicians, Advanced Practice Nurse, Psychiatrist, Psychologist, and/or Licensed Clinical Social Workers. Trainings are conducted on-site at facilities, via ECHO on ZOOM platform, and at regional locations. In 2018, there were 177 trainings completed to over 2,300 people. There were 75 trainings completed in northern region, 47 trainings in the central region, and 55 trainings completed in the southern region. Trainings are open to all professionals including, but not limited to, Social Workers, Nurses, Psychiatrist, CNAs, and other professionals. In 2018, S-COPE exceeded the training contracted goals and it continues to find innovative ways to deliver evidence based trainings. S-COPE ensures that the program is culturally and linguistically competent, accessible, and responsive to agencies, consumers and families. The older adult mental health service system in New Jersey does not discriminate with regard to diverse racial, ethnic and sexual /gender minorities.

The DMHAS is dedicated to community--based mental health services and is advancing community supports for individuals no longer in need of hospital based psychiatric treatment and those at risk of hospitalization. The DMHAS coordinates with community based providers to administer behavioral health services, including prevention and early intervention, screening services, outpatient counseling, partial and day treatment services, case management, residential and supported housing, family support, self\u2014help centers and supported employment. In SFY 2019, State appropriations for mental health community providers were $352 million. A significant source of the increase has been the State's investment in the Olmstead - Home to Recovery Initiative, which has primarily provided funding for supportive housing placements for clients discharged from state hospitals, as well as for clients at risk of hospitalization. Additionally, DMHAS is now over two years into the transition of moving select community based mental health services from cost-reimbursement contracts to fee-for-service contracts, also known as the Mental Health Fee-for-Service Program (MH-FFS Program). This transition, which began January 1, 2017, represented an historic transformation for the New Jersey public mental health system. The State has transitioned providers and clients to Fee for Service reimbursement, and away from fixed cost or overall cost reimbursement contracts. Concurrent with this, reimbursement rates were enhanced for many services and additional state funding (roughly $20 million) was appropriated for this purpose. DMHAS believes that the combination of more attractive Medicaid rates and the transition to a direct Fee for Service reimbursement approach for non-Medicaid services (with enhanced rates), will lead to greater access for clients and a more transparent, accountable and efficient behavioral health service delivery system. As part of its remaining cost reimbursement contract base, DMHAS continues to fund training and technical assistance that many community providers are able to access. The total contracted amount for SFY 2019 was approximately $5.2 million. In addition, State staff are continuously organizing conferences, meetings and webinars that providers attend on many subjects of interest to them in their daily operations. Notably, in SFY 2019, and continuing into SFY 2020, State staff have been holding weekly webinars/information sessions to help providers adjust to the new Fee for Service billing system for non-Medicaid services. Goals While New Jersey currently has cost-based contracts and Fee for Service arrangements with approximately 117 unduplicated agencies that provide eligible Block Grant services, to facilitate reporting, administration and minimize the audit burden on our providers, DMHAS has allocated the available Block Grant funding to a selected group of approximately 26 provider agencies. This group of agencies and the amounts allocated to each have been revised over the years to reflect changes in Block Grant requirements, funding and service levels, changes in the agencies' service programs due to mergers, name changes, and other reasons. In order to ensure that we are in compliance with the requirement to expend such funds only for services to adults with SMI and children with SED, DMHAS first reviews data on consumers served by each of the selected agencies' contracts to identify the percentage of total consumers receiving services who are either adults with SMI or children with SED. Based on these results, we calculate the portion of each agency's total contract ceiling that represents Block Grant eligible costs. The result of this calculation yields a total pool of eligible costs, just for the above noted selected group of agencies, of about $94 million for state fiscal year 2020. Consequently, the Block Grant funding for contracted services is then allocated to each of the agencies in the selected group, based on the relative percentage of their eligible costs to the total eligible costs of all agencies in the group. Narratve Question Criterion 5: Management Systems States describe their financial resources, staffing, and training for mental health services providers necessary for the plan; provides for training of providers of emergency health services regarding SMI and SED; and how the state intends to expend this grant for the fiscal years involved.

The grants monitoring program at the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) includes Program Management Officers (PMO) and a supervisor who monitor SAPT Block Grant recipients. Onsite visits are made to each SAPT Block Grant recipient a minimum of one time per calendar year. More frequent reviews may be conducted on an as needed basis for agencies identified by the Department of Health, Certificate of Need and Licensing (CN&L) and or as needing additional technical assistance or monitoring because of violations, other deficiencies, or special grant requirements. Site visits may be anywhere from one to five days in duration depending on the size and scope of the program. Once onsite, the PMO will meet with agency staff as a group and/or on an individual basis depending upon the need. The PMO will randomly select a representative sample of client records from the active client list (roster) which will be subject to individual chart reviews. The reviewer conducts chart reviews for the selected sample and completes an Annual Site Monitoring Report. The Annual Site Monitoring Report addresses at a minimum five core areas of performance: Facility, Staff, Treatment Records, Quality Assurance, Specialized Services, and Other contract requirements. Facility questions pertain to the facility's interior and exterior appearances, facility accessibility, and the proper posting of licenses and certificates. Staff questions pertain to personnel policies, staff meetings and training, and staff certification, licensure, and supervision. Treatment questions pertain to the counselors' procedures and the availability and provision of medical and clinical services. Records questions pertain to the client roster and the maintenance of client files. Quality Assurance questions pertain to the agency's Quality Assurance plan and quality of care. Specialized Services questions pertain to child care, transportation and gender specific treatment. Other questions pertain to management and administrative matters. At the conclusion of the site review, the reviewers conduct an exit conference with sub- recipient representatives. A copy of the Annual Site Monitoring Report is reviewed by the supervisor for approval. Serious and extreme violations of a requirement are reported up and violations reported to the CN&L for additional follow up with the agency. Site visit report is sent to the sub-recipient and sub-recipient is to reply with a plan of correction (PoC) for areas found to be in noncompliance. Sub- recipients are notified in writing of the acceptance or non-acceptance of the plan of correction and the monitoring staff continues to follow up until an acceptable plan of correction is submitted.Narratve Question Criterion 3: Pregnant Women and Women with Dependent Children (PWWDC) Criterion 3 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 3 of 10 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 323 of 456Persons Who Inject Drugs (PWID) 1.

DMHAS would benefit from an exchange with other states to see how they have incorporated these areas in their QI Plans.Environmental Factors and Plan 11. Quality Improvement Plan- Requested Narrative Question In previous block grant applications, SAMHSA asked states to base their administrative operations and service delivery on principles of Continuous Quality Improvement/Total Quality Management (CQI/TQM). These CQI processes should identify and track critical outcomes and performance measures, based on valid and reliable data, consistent with the NBHQF, which will describe the health and functioning of the mental health and addiction systems. The CQI processes should continuously measure the effectiveness of services and supports and ensure that they continue to reflect this evidence of effectiveness. The state's CQI process should also track programmatic improvements using stakeholder input, including the general population and individuals in treatment and recovery and their families. In addition, the CQI plan should include a description of the process for responding to emergencies, critical incidents, complaints, and grievances.

Foster DMHAS Mission DMHAS, in partnership with consumers, family members, providers and other stakeholders, promotes wellness and recovery for individuals managing a mental illness, substance use disorder or co -occurring disorder through a continuum of prevention, early intervention, treatment and recovery services delivered by a culturally competent and well trained workforce. DMHAS Vision DMHAS envisions an integrated mental health and substance abuse service system that provides a continuum of prevention, treatment and recovery supports to residents of New Jersey who have, or are at risk of, mental health, addictions or co -occurring disor ders. At any point of entry the service system will provide prompt and easy access to appropriate and effective person -centered, culturally -competent services delivered by a welcoming and well trained work force. Consumers will be given the tools to ac hieve wellness and recovery, a sense of personal responsibility and a meaningful role in the community. DMHAS Values DMHAS' work is driven by its values. Staff with the Division and its partner agencies value: consumers' dignity and believe that services should be person -centered and person - directed; the strength of consumers, their families and friends because it serves as a foundation for recovery; the commitment of its partner agencies to professionalism, d iversity, hope and positive outcomes; evidence -based practices that show consumer -informed and peer -led services improve and enhance the prevention and treatment continuum; and the public trust and believe that it is essential to provide effective and effi cient services.

This commitment is incorpo rated into all aspects of the Division's activities : Strategic Planning, Resource Allocation and Performance Improvement Activities . The Quality Improvement Plan describes the approaches, processes and mechanisms used to ensure New Jersey's mental health and addiction system is meeting its goals. We do this based upon the principles of continuous quality assurance/performance improvement. Many of our approaches to improved service delivery are data -driven; meaning, we rely on valid and reliable data to id entify and track critical outcomes and performance measures to ensure their effectiveness. Continuous quality improvement is not something performed by an individual or a group of individuals ----it is a part of our everyday activities. Senior Leaders have committed to excellence in performance and quality improvement through Strategic Planning activities. Division -wide priorities have stakeholder input with continuous communication regarding our status. In addition to Division -wide priority setting by Sen ior Leadership, units also set priorities to initiate their own improvement activities based on documented need within their work unit. The Quality Improvement Plan for the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services focuses on those indicators that systematically measure the achievement towards the Division's Mission, Vision, Values, Strategic Plan and special initiatives. The following criteri a are used to base priority for measurement: High risk High -volume Problem prone Sentinel events Processes related to consumer needs, expectations, and satisfaction Strategic goals Special Initiatives Resource availability, The Operating Budget Regulatory Compliance Staff and Staffing Issues DMHAS has processes which are tracked at the s tate psychiatric hospit al level and several clinical initiatives which are being done in collaboration with the state psychiatric hospitals and the community. Each state psychiatric hospital has a Quality Improvement Plan and all community agencies licensed by DHS are required t o have a Quality Improvement Plan. PURPOSE The purpose of the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services' Quality Improvement Plan is to continuously improve New Jersey's system of behavioral health that will lead to Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 3 of 20 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 333 of 456DMH AS Quality Improvement Plan Page 3 improved quality of services and outcomes for individuals, families and communities . A key component of this is the collection of data that will inform policy and measure program impact. This plan demonstrates the Division's activities to assess and improve key processes and outcomes to enhance provider efficiency and effectiveness in achieving service objectives. In addition, the plan is utilized to enhance the Division's operational practice s that ultimately affect services delivered to mental health and substance abuse consumers. Components of the plan include: 1. Determination of priorities for improving systems, processes, and consumer safety and satisfaction. 2. Identification of a framework for improving and sustaining performance of Division -wide systems and processes through a planned systematic approach of plan, design, measurement, analyzes and improvement of services provided. 3. Support of the concept that, through collaborati on, systems will be more effective, staff will have greater skills, and patient outcome components will be improved. 4. Ensure that the best possible care and services are provided within available resources, while being consistent with the mission, visi on, values, goals and objectives, and plans of the organization. GOAL The primary goal of the Quality Improvement Program is to continually and systematically plan, design, measure and assess and improve the performance of key functions and processes involved with the delivery of services and supports to adult behavioral health consumers and patients . The Quality Improvement Plan provides a framework and motivation for improvement of consumer health outcomes and customer satisfaction by design of effecti ve, organization -wide processes followed by measurement, assessment, and improvement of those processes. To achieve this goal, the Quality Improvement Plan strives to: Assess the needs of consumers, patients and other key stakeholders; Incorporate quality planning throughout the state psychiatric hospitals and provider agencies and; Provide a systematic mechanism for state hospitals, provider agencies, individuals, Division Offices, committees and workgroups to function collaboratively in their efforts toward performance improvement OBJECTIVES To establish data systems that will allow scientific measurement of the improvement processes, outcomes of the actions taken and reporting this information by aggregate or individual analysis Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 4 of 20 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 334 of 456DMH AS Quality Improvement Plan Page 4 To continue to provide staff education regarding the principles and tools of Continuous Quality Improvement To provide criteria for identifying and prioritizing improvement To involve all services , staff and stakeholders in improvement activities To synthe size information obtained from performance outcome data when determining priorities for improving systems/ processes To provide the framework for planning, directing, coordinating and improving consumer care and consumer safety for psychiatric and addiction services for Inpatient, Outpatient, and Partial Programs and behavioral/rehabilitation services for Residential programs. To support the design of new processes, assist in the implementation, determine criteria for assessment of effectiveness THE QUALITY MODEL The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services utilizes various techniques to determine what should be measured and how it should be measured. In addition, data is regularly assessed and decisions made regarding improvement activities. This process includes the PDC(S)A cycle: Plan, Do, Check/Study, Act which is described below pictorially and in a narrative. Plan-Do-Check/Study -Act Process 1. Plan - Recognize an opportunity and plan a change. 2. Do - Test the change. Carry out a small -scale study. 3. Check/Study - Review the test, analyze the results and identify what you've learned (how do they compare with the predictions). 4.

By doing so, this ensures consistency with Federal efforts. The scope of the Quality Improvement Plan covers all aspe cts of the organization which provide services and supports. In addition to quantitative data, the Division tracks qualitative data including programmatic improvements us ing stakeholder input, inclusive of individuals in treatment and recovery and their families. The Division engages stakeholders through its frequent meetings with various stakeholders and inclusion of stakeholders in its strategic planning activities and attending stakeholders' meetings and conferences such as the COMHCO (Coalition of Men tal Health Consumer Organizations) conference. Such meetings include the Behavioral Health Plan ning Council (includes family members, consumers , providers, and representatives from the Division and other Departments ), Quarterly Stakeholder meeting, Quarter ly Addictions Medical Directors meetings, Citizens Advisory Council, and the Addictions Professional Advisory Committee (meets every other month). Specific monitoring activities are listed below and will be described in more detail in this section. The P erformance Measures that were selected to be monitored will be listed at the end of the applicable section.

There are four specific objectives that are the current focus: Goal #5: Strengthen , develop, implement, and monitor effective suicide prevention programs that promote wellness and prevent suicide and related behaviors. Goal #7: Provide training to community and clinical service providers on the prevention of suicide an d related behaviors. Goal #8: Promote suicide prevention as a core component of health care services. Goal #9: Promote and implement effective clinical and professional practices for assessing and treating those id entified as being at risk for suicide and suicidal behaviors. Performance Measures : Reduce the Number of Suicide Attempts in NJ Reduce the Number of Suicides in NJ ADDICTIONS TREATMENT AND SERVICES Addictions treatment and services performance measures relate to prevention of adverse outcomes. Performance Measures : Reduce the number of opioid -related deaths Reduce the number of opioid overdoses Reduce the percentage of addictions' consumers who smoke Increase the number of people on medication assisted treatment CONTRACTED AGENCY PERFORMANCE Contract monitoring/utilization review occurs both in addictions and mental health programs. Addictions Contracted addictions agencies have one formal contract site visit each calendar year. More frequent reviews are conducted on as needed basis for agencies identified as needing additional technical assistance or monitoring in response to identified deficiencies, technical assistance needs, or s pecial contract requirements. The Annual Site Visit Monitoring Review Form addresses a minimum of five issues: Facility, Staff, Treatment or Service Records, Quality Assurance, Specialized Services, and Other Contract -Specific requirements. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 8 of 20 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 338 of 456DMH AS Quality Improvement Plan Page 8 Provider Performance Reports (Substance Abuse) Provider Performance Reports are made available to all addiction treatment provider agencies. These reports were first produced in 2006 and are issued twice a year for the fiscal and calendar year . The reports were emailed to over 300 providers; however, in 2014 the y were programmed to be generated automatically by the SSA's IT system, NJSAMS. Providers can download their reports upon sign -in. The provider report includes: 1) statewide admission and discharge treatment data and agency specific treatment data for key variables, 2) admission and discharge data by level of care for each specific agency, and 3) State Outcomes Measures (S OMs) for each level of care an agency provides in comp arison to statewide averages and peers. In order for agencies to compare their performance relative to other agencies, percentile scores are computed for each outcome measure. They compare 1) the change in performance between discharge and admission and 2) the level of performance at discharge. Statewide outcome data are also presented so an agency can compare its performance to the state. The outcomes in these reports include: abstinence from alcohol, abstinence from drugs, employment, enrollment in school/job training, criminal justice involvement, homelessness, and retention in substance abuse treatment. A measure on the percentage of clients successfully completing their treatment plan is also included. In addition, c ounty aggregate performance reports are produced that provide Local Advisory Councils on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (LACADAs) and the County Alcohol and Drug Directors with profiles of the strengths and weaknesses of local systems of care. Statewide performance reports ar e also produced for the fiscal and calendar year and are posted on the DMHAS website. These performance reports are one strategy that DMHAS has adopted in its continuous quality improvement efforts to help improve services to clients. The SOMs are one w ay to monitor client outcomes, help direct system improvements and achieve better accountability. These reports are also used by the provider to inform their continuous quality improvement efforts. Mental Health Agencies are required to submit data quart erly (called Quarterly Contract Monitoring Reports - QCMRs) to the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services. This data is critical to assess agency performance with their respective contracts. Agencies that do not meet the service utilization level for which they are contracted are closely monitored to determine patterns of underutilization. Regional staff oversees the implementation of the contracts to ensure that service commitments are met and that agencies are compliant with DHS/DMHAS program standards, state & federal statutes, as well as other applicable rules and regulations, policies, procedures and protocols.

By conducting triennial reviews with the Department of Human Services' Mental Health Licensing Unit. In addition, the Fiscal Office reviews variance reports (both dollar and percent) to identify any variances not explained by the accom panying narrative provided by the agency. Variances that exceed 10% +/ - are assessed to determine if the impact is noteworthy given the overall size of the contract provider. If so, these variances are brought to the attention of the regional offices for their input and potential follow -up with the provider. Systems Review Committee Dataset(s) The Systems Review Committee (SRC) Datasets are a series of linked MS -Excel documents submitted to the SMHA on monthly basis from 32 Short Term Care Facilities (STC F) and 23 Designated Screening Centers (DSC) . The Systems Review Committee was created by legislative mandate1 in 2010 which requires the division (among other tasks) to: monitor the acute care system, conduct utilization management, identify gaps, and conduct data analysis. For analytical and administrative purposes, DSC dataset is handled separately from the STCF dataset, although both share great similarities in reporting protocol, functionality, and purpose (hence, we refer to both sets of informatio n collectively as the SRC dataset). T he SRC data is compiled monthly by providers on a one -page monthly MS -Excel spreadsheet that is submitted electronically to the SMHA. The SRC dataset provides program/agency -specific data that is the aggregate of eac h program's consumers served within a given month. Due to the large number of data points (>50) found on each datasheet, the comprehensiveness of the data, and the geographic coverage of the information , this dataset provided the Division and stakeholde rs with a range of valuable information on a regular basis. In addition to being the \"go to\" resource for monitoring the acute care system across the state and within each county's System Review Committee, the SRC is also used regularly ad-hoc reporting on a regular basis. Provider Performance Reports (Mental Health) Provider Performance Reports (PPRs) for mental health agencies are designed to be 'data dashboard s' that display how key variables of a given agency compare to statewide and regional measures of central tendency. Currently mental health PPRs have been developed for a small number of program elements, specifically Supportive Housing and Designated Scre ening. For each program element, the PPR contains approximately 20 data elements and calculations drawn from different datasets including the QCMR, the SRC, the Annex A and the Annex B. These data elements are organized into the domains of \"Volume\", \"Qual ity\" and \"Cost\". By having a single dashboard that pulls data from several distinct data sources, the reader can gain a quick and comprehensive summary of how a given provider's program element compares to statewide 1 (a) Printed: 11/19/2020 Page 10 of 20 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 340 of 456DMH AS Quality Improvement Plan Page 10 measures of central tendency, each regi on of the state (i.e., North, Central, South), and how that agency compares to others. The SMHA is in the process of acquiring additional human resources needed to expand provider performance reporting. CRITICAL INCIDENTS The addictions' community may c all the Department of Human Services, Office of Licensing - Special Operations/Addiction Services to report incidents and these are entered into the Department of Human Services' (DHS) Unusual Incident Reporting Management System (UIRMS) . The unit which is responsible for this resides with the Department of Human Services. Incidents and data are reviewed at this level for addictions' community incidents and jointly with DHS and DMHAS . Community mental health agencies directly report incidents to the Divisio n's Unusual Incident Coordinators for their respective county. These incidents are entered into the DHS' Unusual Incident Reporting Management System. Aggregate data reports are shared with the community agencies. Specific demographic and other detailed i nformation related to deaths is kept in an Access database for trending and analysis purposes. All incidents require an investigative follow -up report. Some incidents are also referred to other DHS units for further investigation; these include allegation s of abuse, neglect, exploitation, operational issues and other incidents as deemed by the Department of Human Services. SENTINEL and ADVERSE CLINICAL EVENTS All state psychiatric hospitals are required to conduct root cause analyses for any hospital sentinel event that falls under The Patient Safety Act or The Joint Commission sentinel event policy. The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services' Patient Safety Act Oversight Committee reviews each root cause analysis. Patient Safety Act events are reported within 24 hours of the event. Root Cause Analysis is received by the Division within 45 days. Root Cause Analyses are assessed for thoroughness and credibility . MORTALITY The Division collects data related to deaths which occur with mental health consumers, both in the state psychiatric hospital system and community. Cause of death and demographic information is obtained for each death reported. The Division plans on instituting prevention to decrease the incidents of early death in our con sumers. This includes suicide risk assessment training and suicide prevention as well as interventions related to physical health such as smoking cessation and metabolic syndrome tracking and monitoring.

DRCCs can be deployed for any crisis or emergency as determined by the Dis aster and Terrorism Coordinator or at the request of the DMHAS Assistant Commissioner or the DHS Commissioner. In addition, t he Disaster and Terrorism Branch is home to a multi -disciplinary Training and Technical Assistance Group (TTAG) which has the capac ity to provide on -demand training for mental health professionals in the wake of disaster to further increase the state's capacity to address the psycho social needs of the community. Assistant Division Director for Community Services, the DMHAS Assistant Commissioner and the Commissioner for the Department of Human Services are available 24/7 should the need arise to contact them and they are individually handled as the situation warrants. All DMHAS Executive Staff are available via cell phone in the case an emergency warrants contacting them. For community emergencies involving consumers receiving methadone treatment, there is a system called Guest and Emergency Medication System (GEMS), which will allow consumers to receive their medication at any availa ble methadone clinic in New Jersey. In addition, there is a Disaster Coordinator in this Office who assists methadone clinics with the activation of their COOP Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) and provides support using GEMS, if needed. COMPLAINTS AND GRIEVANCES Community Addictions Agencies For purposes of this section, term complaints and grievances is used interchangeably. The addictions' community may call the Department of Human Services, Office of Licensing -Special Operations/Addiction Services to report any complaints or grievances and these are handled through the DHS Office of Program Integrity and Accountability Unit (OPIA). Mental Health Agencies Mental health community complaints and grievances which come into the Division are referred to the Regional Offices to work with the providers and consumer to resolve these issues. The complaint and grievance procedures are outlined below. Each consumer is made aware of the existence of a complaint procedure a nd second, non - emergency contact s. Un der all circumstances, consumers not accepted for services are informed immediately of the State -wide advocacy services available to them. Agency Directors designate a staff person to function as Agency Ombudsperson on as needed basis. The responsibilities of the Agency Ombudsperson: Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 12 of 20 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 342 of 456DMH AS Quality Improvement Plan Page 12 To receive consumer complaints; To act an advocate for consumers who make complaints; and To attempt to negotiate resolutions of issues raised by consumers (complaints shall be investigated and negotiated within five working da ys) /grievance processes. Submit a written report of findings, resolutions and/or recommendations to the Agency Director and to the consumer within seven working days of the complaint. If the complaint has been resolved to the consumer's satisfaction, the grievance process shall end at this point. Most complaints and grievances are resolved at the treatment provider/agency level. The consumer may request review by the Agency Director. The Director shall make the final Agency -level decision regarding the complaint, in a due process manner, as quickly as possible. If the complaint has still not been resolved to the consumer's satisfaction, the consumer may request a review by the County Mental Health Board. The County Mental Health Board, through its Administrator, shall receive and review complaints r eferred from Agency Directors within five working days. The County Mental Health Board shall make its findings and recommendations known to the Agency Director and consumer within seven working days of the complaints. If the consumer is not satisfied wit h the recommendation of the Board, or the Agency's response to these recommendations, the consumer may request review by the Division. Consumers may request a review by the Division directly, and in confidence, at any time. However, consumers are encoura ged by the Division to seek an Agency -level review first and will be asked to justify the omission of an Agency or a County -level review. The Division will advise the Agency and the County Mental Health Board of all complaints received directly, unless the consumer, on notice, refuses to consent to such a disclosure. The Division may convene a Professional Review Committee, when needed, consisting of an interdisciplinary team appropriate to the subject of the complaint. The designees shall receive and rev iew complaints referred by consumers within five working days and shall submit a written report of its findings and recommendations to the Assistant Commissioner within two more days. The Assistant Commissioner shall review this report and submit recomme ndations to the Agency Director and the consumer within seven working days. The Division shall determine if any formal State remediation/funding compliance action is necessary based on the Agency's response to these recommendations.

As expressed in the Division of Mental Health and Addictions Services' Transformation Statement, each participant in the mental health system -- patients, primary support persons, hospital staff, and community providers -- is empowered and holds distinct and valuable knowledge and experience. One way of obtaining input from patients is through an Inpatient Consumer Survey developed by National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD)/ Research Institute, Inc. (NRI). Survey Domains Clients Perception of Outcomes Clients Perception of Dignity Clients Perception of Rights Clients Perception of Participation Clients Perception of Environment Clients Perception of Empowerment Dissemination of Surveys The survey is disseminated to 100% of the patients just prior to discharged or mailed to them with a self -addressed stamped en velope after discharge as well as to all patients remaining in the hospital at their annual review. Patients are assisted with completion of the 27 question survey only if they ask for assistance. Completion of the survey is voluntary and anonymous. Surve y Results Survey data is used for performance improvement. Quarterly reports are received from NRI and each hospital reviews and assessed the aggregate data in each domain and takes corrective action to improve performance. Mental Health Community Consum er satisfaction with the services provided by DMHAS contracted mental health agencies is measured via the Annual Consumer Perception of Care Surveys which provides consumers with an avenue in which to report their reactions to the services that they are re ceiving, and a mechanism through which DMHAS may evaluate itself and its contracted providers. The DMHAS Annual Consumer Perception of Mental Health Care Survey provides the Division with a consistent set of measures by which it may look at the degree to which consumers feel well-served by contracted providers, and to the extent that consumers are s atisfied with the Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 14 of 20 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 344 of 456DMH AS Quality Improvement Plan Page 14 overall level of care furnished by the Division. Due to the standardized nature of the survey format, DMHAS may look back longitudinally at these results to observe change through time. The DMHAS Annual Consumer Perception of Care Survey is a self -reporting tool consisting of no fewer than 62 items on various topics shaped to convey consumer's reflections of their current mental health service, treatment, assessments of their primary health and basic demographic information. The core of th e survey instrument is the Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program's (MHSIP) Adult Survey2--used it in its entirety (48 questions), supplemented by ten questions related to primary health, from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) su rvey3 . These tools are recommended for use by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD ) Research Institute , Inc. (NRI). The consumer survey dataset yielded by the survey instrument provides perspective in addressing: *What are some of the basic demographics of the consumers of mental health services? *Is there a difference between agencies with relation to reported satisfaction? *Does satisfaction differ between domains of responses? *What is the overall response of co nsumers to our mental health services? *What are the average responses from consumers about mental health service? Survey Domains These MHSIP questions are aggregated into eight analytical 'domains. These domains are General Satisfaction; Access to Services; Quality & Appropriateness of Services; Participation in Treatment Planning; Outcomes (effectiveness of services received) , Functioning Outcomes (overall social skills and symptom reduction) , Social Connectedness and Legal Challenges (response to clinical justice programs in NJ) . Dissemination of Surveys Each year prospective respondents are randomly selected (among their cohorts enrolled in the same program element, administered by the same provider) to be given the optional and anonymous survey questionnaire. Survey Results The Annual Consumer Survey yields helpful data for the URS Data Tables and the National Outcome Measures. These results are reported to the NJ Behavioral Health Planning Council for comment, review and discussion. In addi tion, a wealth of additional inferences are gleaned from the Consumer Survey data \u2014 depending on Division imperatives and available research resources.

Since 2011, the Annual Consumer Perception of Care Survey of Mental Health Services has been distributed to a stratified random sample of consumers in all non -acute, community -based settings. (Prior to 2011, this survey was distributed annual to the entire population of consumers receiving services from one specific program element.) Going into its fifth year of data collection on this cross -program basis, the SMHA is excited that this dataset can be now looked at from a historical perspective, allowing to SMHA to look at how consumer attitudes on program elements, providers and the system -at-large have changed over time. HOSPITAL CORE MEASURE DATA SET (HBIPS) Specific to state psychiatric hospitals, the Division collects data from the hospitals on Core Measures f or the NRI Behavioral Healthcare Performance Measurement System (BHPMS) which are sent to NRI and then to The Joint Commission and then some of the measurement dat a is sent to The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). These core measure sets fulfill the ORYX reporting requirements for The Joint Commission. HBIPS core meas ures that describe fiv e areas from the initial admission screening process, four con tent areas from the continuing care plan and antipsychotic medications post -discharge. These measures include: HBIPS 1: Screening for Violence Risk to self or others , Substance Use, Psychological Trauma History, and Strengths HBIPS 2: Hours of Physical Re straint Use HBIPS 3: Hours of Seclusion Use HBIPS 4: Patients Discharge on Multiple Antipsychotic Medications HBIPS 5: Patients Discharged on Multiple Antipsychotic Medications with Appropriate Justification HBIPS 6: Post Discharge Continuum of Care Plan C reated HBIPS 7: Post Discharge Continuum of Care Plan Transmitted to Next Level of Care Provider upon Discharge The hospitals also collect data regarding Comfort Care to indicate if the patient is on comfort measures only as this population is excluded fro m the data collection.

Senior Leaders have an opportunity at this time to discuss opportunities for improvement. For data which is outside of our expected performance standards and an action plan is devised and im plemented by the data or process owner and measurement continuously occurs. If the action plan has resulted in improvement then action plan continues and becomes part of regular processes. If the action plan does not result in improvement, the action plan is reviewed to ascertain if it was implemented as designed or if there needs to be a d ifferent action plan developed. The DMHAS Quality Improvement Plan is, itself, continuously being evaluated and revised as necessary, but at least every two state fiscal years. The evaluation summarizes the goals and objectives of the Division's Quality Improvement Plan, the quality improvement activities conducted during the past year, including the targeted process, systems and outcomes, the performance indicators utili zed, the findings of the measurement, data aggregation, assessment and analysis processes, and the quality improvement initiatives taken in response to the findings. Based upon the evaluation, actions are developed to improve the effective of the Plan.

Environmental Factors and Plan 12. Trauma - Requested Narrative Question Trauma 57 is a widespread, harmful, and costly public health problem. It occurs because of violence, abuse, neglect, loss, disaster, war and other emotionally harmful and/or life threatening experiences. Trauma has no boundaries with regard to age, gender, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, geography, or sexual orientation. It is an almost universal experience of people with mental and substance use difficulties. The need to address trauma is increasingly viewed as an important component of effective M/SUD service delivery. Additionally, it has become evident that addressing trauma requires a multi-pronged, multi-agency public health approach inclusive of public education and awareness, prevention and early identification, and effective trauma-specific assessment and treatment. To maximize the impact of these efforts, they need to be provided in an organizational or community context that is trauma-informed. Individuals with experiences of trauma are found in multiple service sectors, not just in M/SUD services. People in the juvenile and criminal justice system have high rates of mental illness and substance use disorders and personal histories of trauma. Children and families in the child welfare system similarly experience high rates of trauma and associated M/SUD problems. Many patients in primary, specialty, emergency and rehabilitative health care similarly have significant trauma histories, which has an impact on their health and their responsiveness to health interventions. Schools are now recognizing that the impact of exposure to trauma and violence among their students makes it difficult to learn and meet academic goals. Communities and neighborhoods experience trauma and violence. For some these are rare events and for others these are daily events that children and families are forced to live with. These children and families remain especially vulnerable to trauma- related problems, often are in resource poor areas, and rarely seek or receive M/SUD care. States should work with these communities to identify interventions that best meet the needs of these residents. In addition, the public institutions and service systems that are intended to provide services and supports for individuals are often re- traumatizing, making it necessary to rethink doing ?business as usual.? These public institutions and service settings are increasingly adopting a trauma-informed approach. A trauma-informed approach is distinct from trauma-specific assessments and treatments. Rather, trauma- informed refers to creating an organizational culture or climate that realizes the widespread impact of trauma, recognizes the signs and symptoms of trauma in clients and staff, responds by integrating knowledge about trauma into policies and procedures, and seeks to actively resist re-traumatizing clients and staff. This approach is guided by key principles that promote safety, trustworthiness and transparency, peer support, empowerment, collaboration, and sensitivity to cultural and gender issues. A trauma-informed approach may incorporate trauma- specific screening, assessment, treatment, and recovery practices or refer individuals to these appropriate services. It is suggested that states refer to SAMHSA's guidance for implementing the trauma-informed approach discussed in the Concept of Trauma58 paper. 57 Definition of Trauma: Individual trauma results from an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting adverse effects on the individual's functioning and mental, physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well-being. 1 of 7 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 351 of 456Printed: 11/19/2020 New Jersey Page 2 of 7 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 352 of 45612. Trauma -requested 5) Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight. Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services ( DMHAS ) The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services ( DMHAS ) contract language for licensed substance use disorder treatment providers receiving women's set aside block grant funds requires the providers to be trauma informed with trauma specific services. All women must be screened for trauma with one of the DMHA S recommended evidence based screening tools, and providers are required to use the \"Seeking Safety\" curriculum. The DMHAS Monitoring Unit conducts annual site visits to the women's set aside providers. The monitoring review form has a module for speciali zed services that lists all requirements for gender specific treatment including \"Seeking Safety\" curriculum. DMHAS recognizes the national statistics that indicate that 43% -81% of adults in psychiatric hospitals and up to 2/3 of individuals in substance abuse treatment have experienced trauma. As DMHAS embarked on becoming Trauma -Informed, we identified work groups comprised of providers, administrators, and individuals with lived experience to advise us as we adapt the materials from the Nation al level to needs in New Jersey. DMHAS includes trauma awareness as a governing principle in address ing policy making, service system design and implementation, workforce development, and professional practice. We advocate for all of our agencies to adopt similar practices using the five values of Trauma -Informed Care ( TIC) as developed through the efforts at a national level: 1. Safety, meaning: \"Do no harm.\" Trauma sensitive and compassionate care is given from initial contact. 2. Trustworthiness, meaning: The system provides care with the least amount of risk for re-traumatization. 3. Choice, meaning: Individuals have input into decisions made in treatment, and that input is taken seriously. 4. Collaboration, meaning: Recognize that trauma -related symptoms and behaviors originate from adaptation to traumatic experiences 5. Empowerment, meaning: Promoting resilience; providing opportunities and understanding that all of us are competent and capable to grow and heal. Department of Children and Families/ Children's System of Care ( DCF/CSOC ) The mission of the Department of Children and Families (DCF) is intentionally broad: In partnership with NJ's communities , DCF will ensure the safety, well -being and success of NJ's children and families. DCF has the largest workforce directly interacting with children and families who are amongst our most vulnerable and have experienced the most complex trauma - related challenges. There is a growing awareness across disciplines about the need for systems working with t raumatized children to be trauma - informed. Likewise, there is a call for child Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey Page 3 of 7 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 353 of 456protection systems to be trauma -informed. As such, the primary goal of the DCF is to improve outcomes for children and families and to position all who interface with and support the work of the Children's System of Care ( CSOC ) to understand, prevent and mitigate the impact of trauma that children, youth and young adults and their families experience. In 2015, DCF was awarded a $12 million grant by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to expand mental health services for children with complex behavioral health challenges. Entitled Promising Path to Success , the project was funded to run four years, from September 2015 to September 2019, to help CSOC achieve the following goals: Reduce the percentage of youth in the system of care who require multiple episodes of out-of-home treatment; Reduce the percentage of youth who re-enter treatment after discharge from an initial treatment episode; Reduce the average length of stay for youth in out -of-home treatment from 11.5 to 9 months; and Analyze and understand the impact of each type of system investment to make future resour ce allocation decisions. The project's main components include two trauma -informed interventions, Six Core Strategies for Reducing Seclusion and Restraint Use (an evidenced -based practice) and The Nurtured Heart Approa ch. These interventions have been introduced system -wide through CSOC's training partner, Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care ( UBHC ), to approximately 146 out -of-home treatment programs as well as all of CSOC's other System Partners ( Care Management Organization [ CMO ], Family Support Organization [ FSO], Mobile Response and Stabilization Services [ MRSS ], and County Interagency Coordinating Council [ CIACC ]). Another key component of the project is a return on investment (ROI) study being conducted by Rutgers University's Center for State Health Policy. The ROI study will enable CSOC to determine the relative success of the project in achieving its identified goals and help DCF make future decisions concerning resource allocation. The milestones CSOC was able to reach in the project's third full year include the following: Hosted two Nurtured Heart Certified Trainers' Institutes that certified 117 new trainers. Hosted one Six Core Strategies two-day training for over 300 partners around the state. Provided Nurtured Heart training to over 5400 individuals in year 3 with a total of 16,536 individuals trained since the grant's inception. Groups that received this training include NJ CSOC funded programs and system partners as well as other entities ou tside the original scope of the grant, such as Juvenile Detention Centers, Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCP &P), Office of Education (OOE), ARC NJ, and County Interagency Coordinating Council ( CIACC ) Education Partnerships. NJ CSOC's first y outh ambassador was hired and is providing a youth voice and perspective to the grant's goals and training initiatives. Although the grant is scheduled to end on September 30, 2019, a no cost extension is being requested to ensure Phase 5 providers receiv e the same coaching support provided to Phase 1 -4 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey Page 4 of 7 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 354 of 456participants.

It has become a powerful way of awakening the inherent greatness in all children while facilitating parenting and classroom success. The essence of the Approach is a set of core methodologies originally developed for working with the most difficult children. It has a proven impact on every child, including those who are challenged behaviorally, socially and academically. The Nurtured Heart Approach has been shown to create transformative changes in children diagnosed with ADHD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Reactive Attachment Disorder and other behavioral, emotional and anxiety related symptoms - almost always without the need for long -term mental health treatment. Even children experiencing social cognitive challenges, like Autism Spectrum Disorder and Asperger Syndrome greatly benefit from the Approach, reducing the need for traditional mental health and medical interventions. Traditional approaches often fall short of promoting the Inner Wealth essential for children to build successful relationships. This method has helped thousands of families, educators, and child advocates channel a child's intensity in beautifully creative and constructive ways - helping children achieve new emotional portfolios of confidence and enduring levels of competency.\" http://childrenssuccessfoundation.com/about -nurtured -heart -approach/ Printed: 11/19/2020 5 of 7 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 355 of 456 CSOC continues to support the need for high quality, timely and focused assessments as a part of the continuum of care available to children, youth and young adults and their families in New Jersey. Biopsychosocial assessments provide critical information from the child, youth or young adult and his or her immediate supports about strengths, needs, preferences, and vulnerabilities and as such, are fundamental to ensuring youth and their famil ies become engaged in the most appropriate type, intensity, and frequency of care. Biopsychosocial assessments are conducted solely by independently licensed clinicians who have been certified by CSOC as possessing the capacity to complete the Information Management Decision Support Needs Assessment, which has been revised to incorporate a trauma -specific module. CSOC strives to provide children, youth and young adults and their families with the right services, at the right time, for the right amount of time. Through the children's system of care, children, youth and young adults can access an array of evidence based mental and behavioral health treatments, including trauma focused therapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT ) and Trauma Focused -Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( TF-CBT ). In addition, DCF's Office of Child and Family Health has a full-time clinical team that includes a pediatrician, a child/adolescent psychiatrist, and a neuropsychologist. CSOC provides services to children, youth and young adults and their families up to age 21.The following evidence -based trauma - specific interventions are provided within the NJ children's system of care: Trauma Focused -Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) , Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) , Post Traumatic Stress Management (PTSM) Training and Psychological First Aid (PFA) with Ethnocultural, Gender, and Developmental Specificity ; Advanced PTSM: Response Protocols to Suicide; and, Classroom Based Psychosocial Intervention and Traum atic Incident Intervention (TII) Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM Jersey Page 6 of 7 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 356 of 456The following trauma -specific workshops are available through the Traumatic Loss Coalitions for Youth program sponsored by CSOC: After a Suicide - Guidelines for Schools An Introduction to Evidence Based and Best Practice Suicide Prevention Programs for Schools Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) For educators, law enforcement, mental health professionals, clergy, medical professionals, administrators, volunteers, and anyone else who might be interested in adding suicide intervention to their list of skills Creating Safe and Respectful Environments Crisis Planning for Vulnerable School Populations Depression in Children and Adolescents Enhancing Your School's Crisis Plan Helping a Grieving Child Managing Trauma and Loss in Schools For Administrators and Crisis Teams Preventing Youth Suicide: Awareness Training For Teachers, Parents, and Non-Mental Health Personnel People Skills Responding to Grief and Loss School Crisis - an Administrator's Guide to Management and Recovery Schools and Mental Health -Bridging the Gap in Treating the Whole Child School Safety is Every Adult's Responsibility Stress, Burnout and Vicarious Trauma Suicide Assessment Training for Clinicians and Counselors Supporting Adolescents As They Transition from High School Trauma and Youth Understanding Trauma and Loss in Youth Using the School I&RS Team to Support Students with Mental Illness Working with Resistant Teens Working with Youth with Mental Health Disorders Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey Page 7 of 7 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 357 of 456Please respond to the following items 1. Does the state (SMHA and SSA) have a plan for coordinating with the criminal and juvenile justice systems on diversion of individuals with mental and/or substance use disorders from incarceration to community treatment, and for those incarcerated, a plan for re-entry into the community that includes connecting to M/SUD services? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 2. Does the state have a plan for working with law enforcement to deploy emerging strategies (e.g. civil citations, mobile crisis intervention, M/SUD provider ride-along, CIT, linkage with treatment services, etc.) to reduce the number of individuals with mental and/or substance use problems in jails and emergency rooms? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 3. Does the state provide cross-trainings for M/SUD providers and criminal/juvenile justice personnel to increase capacity for working with individuals with M/SUD issues involved in the justice system? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 4. Does the state have an inter-agency coordinating committee or advisory board that addresses criminal and juvenile justice issues and that includes the SMHA, SSA, and other governmental and non-governmental entities to address M/SUD and other essential domains such as employment, education, and finances? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 5. Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? The SMHA is involved in very active collaborations with the Judiciary, Office of the Attorney General, local law enforcement, State Parole Board and Department of Corrections, and funds 15 JIS services and several other criminal justice initiatives. JIS is provided to a diverse mix of consumers, male and female as well as individuals of Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Asian and Asian Indian backgrounds and from many different countries. The SMHA funds a CIT Center of Excellence through the Mental Health Association of Southwest New Jersey. The Center facilitated the development of new county CIT efforts. Presently sixteen of twenty-one counties as well as the NJSP provide training to law enforcement, dispatcher and mental health staff in CIT. These counties offer the training to other counties and municipalities as well as their own. As of May 2019, 276 of 565 municipalities have at least one certified CIT officer. As of February 2019, 4,643 law enforcement and mental health provider staffs have been trained. Juvenile Justice Highlights Reducing the number of Juvenile Justice commitments Environmental Factors and Plan 13. Criminal and Juvenile Justice - Requested Narrative Question More than half of all prison and jail inmates meet criteria for having mental health problems, six in ten meet criteria for a substance use problem, and more than one-third meet criteria for having co-occurring mental and substance use problems. Youth in the juvenile justice system often display a variety of high-risk characteristics that include inadequate family support, school failure, negative peer associations, and insufficient use of community-based services. Most adjudicated youth released from secure detention do not have community follow-up or supervision; therefore, risk factors remain unaddressed.59 Successful diversion of adults and youth from incarceration or re-entering the community from detention is often dependent on engaging in appropriate M/SUD treatment. Some states have implemented such efforts as mental health, veteran and drug courts, Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) and re-entry programs to help reduce arrests, imprisonment and recidivism.60 A diversion program places youth in an alternative program, rather than processing them in the juvenile justice system. States should place an emphasis on screening, assessment, and services provided prior to adjudication and/or sentencing to divert persons with M/SUD from correctional settings. States should also examine specific barriers such as a lack of identification needed for enrollment Medicaid and/or the Health Insurance Marketplace; loss of eligibility for Medicaid resulting from incarceration; and care coordination for individuals with chronic health conditions, housing instability, and employment challenges. Secure custody rates decline when community agencies are present to advocate for alternatives to detention. The MHBG and SABG may be especially valuable in supporting care coordination to promote pre-adjudication or pre-sentencing diversion, providing care during gaps in enrollment after incarceration, and supporting other efforts related to enrollment. 59 Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency: : Identifying High-Risk Youth: Prevalence and Patterns of Adolescent Drug Victims, Judges, and Juvenile Court Reform Through Restorative Justice.

There has been a significant decrease in the number of detention center admissions resulting in the reduction of the number of county detention centers from seventeen to seven in the past few years (Union County detention center closed in February 2019). In 2004 there were approximately 200 youth, statewide, in detention awaiting residential treatment post disposition. The term disposition is utilized in Juvenile Court versus the term sentence when the outcome of charges yields the Court determination that a youth needs out of home treatment through CSOC not incarceration; and the youth remain in Detention while waiting for admission to a treatment bed. In 2019, there are typically about three youth awaiting residential treatment post disposition. The average waiting time to be admitted to a residential program is approximately 52 days (an increase from 40 days last year) across all levels of intensity for behavioral health. The waiting time increased this year due to increased demand for two co- occurring residential programs and specialty programs for girls. For youth in detention centers in need of out of home treatment, there are detention alternative beds that can be accessed on an emergent basis. DAP/YAP - (Detention Alternative Program/Youth Advocate Program) CSOC funds Community Re-Integration Services through YAP (Youth Advocate Program) to maintain youth in their community who, without this program, would enter out of home treatment due to juvenile justice involvement. The program provides services both individually and in groups, along with a mentor, life skills groups and employment skills. The program is located in the three counties (Middlesex, Camden and Essex) with the highest rate of court ordered out of home referrals. Additionally, this program has enabled DCP&P to successfully maintain youth in resource homes after their arrest. Medicaid Currently, youth in juvenile detention facilities are eligible for Medicaid or New Jersey FamilyCare (S-CHIP) only after adjudication and referral to a non-secure setting. Protocol for Court-Ordered Assessment of Children with Emotional and Behavioral Health Needs (14 Day Plan Protocol) between DCF/Children's System of Care and the New Jersey Judiciary, Family Division. In the course of proceedings involving juvenile delinquency matters or family crisis petitions, the court may learn that the child involved exhibits behavior suggesting a need for emotional, behavioral, or mental health services. When this becomes apparent at any point in court proceedings, the court may order DCF to submit a service plan to the court within 14 days (14 Day Plan) that assesses the needs of the child and the family and details how those needs may be met. This protocol exists Biopsychosocial Assessments The Juvenile Justice Commission requires, in the Manual of Standards, that all youth entering Detention receive the MAYSI (Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument) within 24-48 hours of admission. CSOC has implemented an easily accessed clinical assessment process for any youth in a county juvenile detention center that may score on the MAYSI regarding possible mental health concerns or need for substance use treatment. This assessment is also utilized to expedite out of home treatment. When a court-involved youth held in a county juvenile detention facility is ordered by a Family Court judge to be assessed for an out-of-home treatment facility in lieu of incarceration, the youth should be transitioned from the juvenile detention center as quickly as possible. issues. The biopsychosocial evaluation, which has a turn-around time of five business days, can be requested by the Social Services staff at the detention center. To accomplish this, CSOC developed a tracking system for children in county detention centers for whom a congregate care treatment program is being considered. The contracted system administrator's (CSA) management information system was also modified to incorporate information about legal status for system-involved children. The information in the CSA management information system identifies children for whom proactive treatment is initiated. CSOC is represented on the New Jersey Council for Juvenile Justice Improvement. Diversion and the Reentry processes are discussed by the Access to Treatment and Racial Disparities sub-committees of the Council. Formal recommendations are presented to the full Council by the individual sub-committees. DCF has established cooperative relationships with the Juvenile Justice Commission (JJC). In December 2004, the Department with the JJC signed a Memorandum of Understanding that outlines a distinct process by which youth in the JJC can be referred directly to what is now known as the Children's System of Care for services that will be implemented upon the youth's release from a JJC facility. Representation from both DCP&P and CSOC participate in the JJC and Annie E. Casey Foundation driven JDAI (Juvenile Detention Alternative Initiative) in order to collaborate on developing alternatives to detention and to reduce the number of youth going into detention. Both systems participate in each other's planning process and in case review process. The Juvenile Justice Commission is responsible for operating state services and sanctions for juveniles and for developing a statewide plan for the effective provision of juvenile justice services and sanctions at the state, county and local levels. To emphasize New Jersey's commitment to provide coordinated quality services and appropriate sanctions for youthful offenders while ensuring the public's safety, the JJC established the State/Community Partnership Grant Program. These Partnership Grants provide funding to teach county for services to reduce detention overcrowding, to provide treatment for sex offenders, to increase disposition options, and to provide aftercare to youth and their families.

Included are: those who appear to have developmental disabilities; those who need placement by DCF/DCP&P due to court orders for diversion or aftercare, special presenting problems, and/or homelessness; and those who are being referred or are accepted by DCF/CSOC. The Office of Special Needs oversees the SCRC, in terms of intra- and inter-agency planning. It is chaired by the Special Needs Assistant. Members include representatives from DCP&P, Office of Adolescent Services, Children's System of Care, the JJC Juvenile Parole and Transitional Services (JP & TS) Pre-Release Teams, Regional Court Liaisons/designees, the JJC Child Study Teams, JJC community residential homes, and the New Jersey Training School at Jamesburg (NJTS), Juvenile Medium Security Facility (JMSF), and the Juvenile Female Secure Care and Intake Facility (Hayes Unit) Social Services Departments. Meetings are held twice a month, for northern and southern regional cases respectively. Referrals are primarily made from the Reception and Program Review committees, from the Reception and Assessment Center (RAC) the New Jersey Training School (NJTS), and Juvenile Female Secure Care and Intake Facility. However, youth may be referred by any source identifying a special need for advocacy and planning, including the Institutional Classification Committees, JP & TS staff, court liaisons and supervisors and program staff. In addition to this population of JJC/DCP&P involved juveniles, DCF maintains an existing Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with JJC. This MOU stipulates that DCP&P has the responsibility to plan for any homeless juvenile pending discharge from JJC. The Special Needs Review Committee will identify those juveniles and make referrals to DCP&P via State Centralized Screening (SCR) when appropriate for homeless juveniles not known to DCP&P or those juveniles whose DCP&P cases are closed. In cases where a juvenile with an open DCP&P case is pending discharge and known to be homeless, it is expected that the DCP&P worker is already engaged in permanency plans. When juveniles in a JJC facility have permanency and treatment needs that require the intervention of DCF, the JJC Special Needs Review Committee will work with CSOC and DCP&P to make appropriate referrals prior to time of discharge. In circumstances where CSOC is unable to access a timely treatment plan in accordance with mandatory release dates, DCP&P will be expected to effectuate the most appropriate contingency plan until such time that a more feasible plan is developed. Care Management Organization (CMO) involvement is inclusive in this agreement when appropriate. CSOC developed two out of home Detention Alternative Programs (DAP) with a total of 14 beds. The priority population is youth in DCF DCP&P custody awaiting DCF placement once their charges have been disposed. The CSOC liaison also refers youth in detention centers with mental health needs. CSOC implemented a \"Protocol for Supervision of Juvenile Probationers Court-ordered to Attend and Complete a DCSOC Specialty Services Program.\" This protocol was approved in 2012 by the following: NJ Juvenile Probation Managers; NJ Conference of Chief Probation Officers; CSOC Representative for Specialty Programs; NJ Juvenile Committee of Family Presiding Judges; and, the NJ Conference of Family Presiding Judges. Subsequent protocols were developed that address communication and collaboration for youth in either a residential treatment program or a substance use treatment program.

With the State Targeted Response (STR) award from SAMHSA, the SSA developed a fee-for-service initiative known as the State Targeted Opioid Response Initiative (STORI). The initiative includes the use of methadone, buprenorphine and Vivitrol for which providers can bill, if they are an Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) or outpatient provider that has been approved as a provider for the Vivitrol Enhancement Network. As of May 1, 2019, State Opioid Response (SOR) no-cost extension grant funds were used to continue this initiative through part of SFY 2020. The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS), with SAMHSA funding, plans to hold an Opioid Summit on September 20, 2019 which will focus on addressing Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) and discrimination/stigma. The goal is to include medical professionals, clinicians and criminal justice professionals at this event. DMHAS mandates trainings on medication assisted treatment for licensed substance use disorder treatment providers, incorporates language requiring acceptance of clients on all forms of medication assisted treatment into contract requirements as well as all applications for new funding. DMHAS has a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Rutgers University and Rowan University to coordinate buprenorphine DATA waiver training in CY 2019 for eligible statewide practitioners (i.e. physicians, APNs). The goal is to have a minimum of 1,000 prescribers trained and receive their Buprenorphine Waiver, in an effort to have more individuals with the ability to prescribe Environmental Factors and Plan 14. Medication Assisted Treatment - Requested (SABG only) Narrative Question There is a voluminous literature on the efficacy of medication-assisted treatment (MAT); the use of FDA approved medication; counseling; behavioral therapy; and social support services, in the treatment of substance use disorders. However, many treatment programs in the U.S. offer only abstinence-based treatment for these conditions. The evidence base for MAT for SUDs is described in SAMHSA TIPs 40[1], 43[2], 45[3], and 49[4]. SAMHSA strongly encourages that the states require treatment facilities providing clinical care to those with substance use disorders demonstrate that they both have the capacity and staff expertise to use MAT or have collaborative relationships with other providers that can provide the appropriate MAT services clinically needed. Individuals with substance use disorders who have a disorder for which there is an FDA-approved medication treatment should have access to those treatments based upon each individual patient's needs. In addition, SAMHSA also encourages states to require the use of MAT for substance use disorders for opioid use, alcohol use, and tobacco use disorders where clinically appropriate. SAMHSA is asking for input from states to inform SAMHSA's activities.

Through use of State Opioid Response (SOR) grant funds, a Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued in February 2019 for the development of a Low Threshold Buprenorphine Induction program. This program is designed to make buprenorphine easily accessible to participants who utilize services at Harm Reduction Centers (HRC), also commonly known as Syringe Access Programs (SAP). The program is scheduled to commence in Spring 2019. DMHAS issued a Request for Letters of Intent in 2019 to all 19 county correctional facilities for plans to establish MAT programs or enhance existing MAT services for inmates with an OUD. Funding will be made available to promote clinical stability and effective recovery processes for inmates prior to release from incarceration. DMHAS, in partnership with the Department Human Services (DHS), Office of Public Relations, has awarded a contract to a vendor to deliver a campaign to help eliminate stigma and discrimination around the use of MAT. Various forms of messaging will be utilized including social media targeted to different audiences. DMHAS, in partnership with the Department of Human Services (DHS) and other State Departments held a Naloxone Distribution Day on June 18, 2019, in which participating pharmacies in NJ distributed free naloxone throughout the State. There were 16,251 kits distributed. *Appropriate use is defined as use of medication for the treatment of a substance use disorder, combining psychological treatments with approved medications, use of peer supports in the recovery process, safeguards against misuse and/or diversion of controlled substances used in treatment of substance use disorders, and advocacy with state payers.

Crisis Services - Requested Narrative Question In the on-going development of efforts to build an robust system of evidence-based care for persons diagnosed with SMI, SED and SUD and their families via a coordinated continuum of treatments, services and supports, growing attention is being paid across the country to how states and local communities identify and effectively respond to, prevent, manage and help individuals, families, and communities recover from M/SUD crises. SAMHSA has recently released a publication, Crisis Services Effectiveness, Cost Effectiveness and Funding Strategies that states may find helpful.61 SAMHSA has taken a leadership role in deepening the understanding of what it means to be in crisis and how to respond to a crisis experienced by people with M/SUD conditions and their families. According to SAMHSA's publication, Practice Guidelines: Core Elements for Responding to Mental Health Crises62, \"Adults, children, and older adults with an SMI or emotional disorder often lead lives characterized by recurrent, significant crises. These crises are not the inevitable consequences of mental disability, but rather represent the combined impact of a host of additional factors, including lack of access to essential services and supports, poverty, unstable housing, coexisting substance use, other health problems, discrimination, and victimization.\" A crisis response system will have the capacity to prevent, recognize, respond, de-escalate, and follow-up from crises across a continuum, from crisis planning, to early stages of support and respite, to crisis stabilization and intervention, to post-crisis follow-up and support for the individual and their family. SAMHSA expects that states will build on the emerging and growing body of evidence for effective community- based crisis-prevention and response systems. Given the multi-system involvement of many individuals with M/SUD issues, the crisis system approach provides the infrastructure to improve care coordination and outcomes, manage costs, and better invest resources. The following are an array of services and supports used to address crisis response. 61http://store.samhsa.gov/product/Crisis-Services-Effective-Cost-Effectiveness-and-Funding-Strategies/SMA14-4848 62Practice Guidelines: Core Elements for Responding to Mental Health Crises.

Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? During SFY 2018, the state's 23 Designated Screening service programs provided 91,542 episodes of emergency mental health care to screening centers. The state's 12 Affiliated Emergency Service Programs delivered 28,954 episodes of crisis care. The Early Intervention Support Service (EISS) programs (offering urgent mental health care) delivered 13,505 episodes of care during SFY 2018, with episodes generally ranging from one contact with immediate referral to four-six weeks of short term out-based crisis stabilization. DMHAS continues to support consumers' development of Psychiatric Advance Directives (PADs) to express their wishes about their mental health care and other assistance during a personal mental health crisis. In SFY 2019, DMHAS implemented an electronic registry of PADs, so that providers and consumers can retrieve PADs during episodes of crisis care. Early 2019, the PAD Registry went live at http://www.state.nj.us/humanservices/dmhas/resources/mental/pad/. Both providers and peers were invited to meet at a training provided by DMHAS and were provided with information not only on how to \"upload documents\" in to the Registry, but were also provided with informational supplements on the laws surrounding PADs; what should be included in a PAD; and the actual technical demo for the upload as well as the accessing of the Registry by the provider. Peers were also provided with regional trainings on what constitutes a legally acceptable PAD, how to assist someone in preparing/writing their own PAD, and how the self-help/community wellness centers can assist their members with uploading their documents in to the Registry. Persons with PADs also receive wallet cards with information as to how to access their PADs once they have completed the process. The Division staff are planning to work with their community partners to continue to raise awareness about the self-empowering nature of having a PAD in the Registry, and offering support in instances where individuals need some guidance or technical assistance downloading their document in to the Registry.

Mobile Response and Stabilization Services (MRSS) provides rapid response to youth and families experiencing family-defined crisis, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year, that focuses on crisis intervention and stabilization that is intensive, therapeutic and rehabilitative. Traumatic Loss Coalitions for Youth (TLC) - Rutgers UBHC Suicide Prevention. Suicide is the third leading cause of death for New Jersey's youth. CSOC is dedicated to the prevention of youth suicide. New Jersey's primary youth suicide prevention program is the Traumatic Loss Coalitions for Youth funded by CSOC. The Traumatic Loss Coalitions for Youth Program at Rutgers-University Behavioral HealthCare is an interactive, statewide network that offers collaboration and support to professionals working with school-age youth. This is accomplished through county, regional and statewide conferences, training, consultation, onsite traumatic loss response, and technical assistance. Since its inception, the TLC has trained thousands of individuals throughout the state with the purpose of saving lives and promoting post trauma healing and resiliency for the youth of New Jersey. The TLC website can be accessed at http://ubhc.rutgers.edu/tlc/ Functional Family Therapy for Foster Care (FFT-FC). CSOC in partnership with the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (CP&P) and a local provider offer access to and service delivery of Functional Family Therapy - Foster Care (FFT-FC) through the CSOC Mobile Response and Stabilization Service and Intensive In-Community service lines. FFT is a relationally focused, trauma informed, evidence-based treatment model for youth in resource care that increases the likelihood of successful adjustment for youth in their resource placements as well as positive permanency outcomes.

Children's Crisis Intervention Services (CCIS). Psychiatric inpatient hospital services, located in community hospitals, provide acute inpatient treatment, stabilization, assessment and short-term intensive treatment. The units are licensed by the Department of Health, following yearly designation by CSOC. The Children's Crisis Intervention Service (CCIS) designation process ensures that CCIS units, established to meet the intent of the 1987 Children's Regional Plan, are following both the intent and spirit of the plan and comply with the Certificate of Need criteria for CCIS units (N.J.A.C. 8:33) and Hospital Licensing Standards (N.J.A.C. 8:43G). Nine CCIS units are located around the state and provide services to all 21 counties. There are currently 164 beds. They are funded through Medicaid and private insurance. Seven of the nine CCIS' receive additional support through a mental health subsidy ($15, 056 annual per bed) from the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services. Youth receive educational services in the acute care setting as clinically appropriate. Therapeutic services include the child's family as an integral element in planning for a return home or to a lower intensity of service.

Does the state support recovery through any of the following: Environmental Factors and Plan 16. Recovery - Required Narrative Question The implementation of recovery supports and services are imperative for providing comprehensive, quality M/SUD care. The expansion in access to and coverage for health care compels SAMHSA to promote the availability, quality, and financing of vital services and support systems that facilitate recovery for individuals. Recovery encompasses the spectrum of individual needs related to those with mental disorders and/or substance use disorders. Recovery is supported through the key components of: health (access to quality health and M/SUD treatment); home (housing with needed supports), purpose (education, employment, and other pursuits); and community (peer, family, and other social supports). The principles of recovery guide the approach to person-centered care that is inclusive of shared decision-making. The continuum of care for these conditions includes psychiatric and psychosocial interventions to address acute episodes or recurrence of symptoms associated with an individual's mental or substance use disorder. Because mental and substance use disorders are chronic conditions, systems and services are necessary to facilitate the initiation, stabilization, and management of long-term recovery. SAMHSA has developed the following working definition of recovery from mental and/or substance use disorders: Recovery is a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life to the greatest extent possible, and strive to reach their full potential. In addition, SAMHSA identified 10 guiding principles of recovery: Recovery emerges from hope; Recovery is person-driven; Recovery occurs via many pathways; Recovery is holistic; Recovery is supported by peers and allies; Recovery is supported through relationship and social networks; Recovery is culturally-based and influenced; Recovery is supported by addressing trauma; Recovery involves individuals, families, community strengths, and responsibility; Recovery is based on respect. Please see SAMHSA's Working Definition of Recovery from Mental Disorders and Substance Use Disorders. States are strongly encouraged to consider ways to incorporate recovery support services, including peer-delivered services, into their continuum of care. Technical assistance and training on a variety of such services are available through the SAMHSA supported Technical Assistance and Training Centers in each region. SAMHSA strongly encourages states to take proactive steps to implement recovery support services. To accomplish this goal and support the wide-scale adoption of recovery supports in the areas of health, home, purpose, and community, SAMHSA has launched Bringing Recovery Supports to Scale Technical Assistance Center Strategy (BRSS TACS). BRSS TACS assists states and others to promote adoption of recovery-oriented supports, services, and systems for people in recovery from substance use and/or mental disorders. Because recovery is based on the involvement of consumers/peers/people in recovery, their family members and caregivers, SMHAs and SSAs can engage these individuals, families, and caregivers in developing recovery-oriented systems and services. States should also support existing and create resources for new consumer, family, and youth networks; recovery community organizations and peer-run organizations; and advocacy organizations to ensure a recovery orientation and expand support networks and recovery services. States are strongly encouraged to engage individuals and families in developing, implementing and monitoring the state M/SUD treatment system.

Provide a description of recovery and recovery support services for adults with SMI and children with SED in your state. See attached. 4. Provide a description of recovery and recovery support services for individuals with substance use disorders in your state. The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) supports the role of peers through several new and existing recovery support initiatives. These programs assist individuals with opioid use disorders or those who are at risk of an opioid overdose through supportive services, case management, education, resources, and advocacy for families and individuals. The Opioid Overdose Recovery Program (OORP), which is now in all 21 counties, provides support services to individuals reversed from opioid overdoes treated at hospital emergency departments. Peers working in OORP programs meet with individuals at bedside where they share their stories of hope and recovery. These peers are instrumental in engaging individuals in the emergency department and beyond and letting them know that they are not alone and that recovery is available to them in whatever pathway they choose. Support Teams for Addiction Recovery (STAR) program provide case management and recovery support services for individuals with opioid use disorders (OUD). The STAR initiative is comprised of one team, each consisting of a program supervisor, two case managers and two recovery specialists. The team is to maintain a caseload of 40 individuals. STAR case managers work with individuals to assist with issues that often occur concurrently with an OUD, such as homelessness, incarceration, legal issues, employment, education, transportation, need for social services, health care, child welfare involvement, child care, health insurance, documentation, etc. The STAR recovery specialists provide non-clinical assistance and recovery supports services. The overall goal of STAR is to help maintain individuals with an OUD in the Recovery Zone for as long as possible, help to reduce the risk of recurring episodes of opioid related problems, and prevent future overdose. The STR grant funded the STAR program in 10 counties. The SOR grant and SOR supplemental grant funds have expanded program to the remaining 11 counties, making the program statewide. Maternal Wrap Around Services (M-WRAP) combines intensive case management and peer recovery support series for opioid dependent women during pregnancy and up to one year after giving birth. Intensive case management focused on developing a single, coordinated care plan for pregnant/postpartum women, their children and families. DMHAS funds two comprehensive centers and three smaller scale recovery centers (Community Peer Recovery Centers [CPRC]) for persons in recovery from substance use disorders. Recovery centers are a place that those in recovery can find help, fellowship, and a safe haven. Peer workers provide mentoring, coaching, care coordination, social and recreation activities, life skills, vocational training, support groups, wellness classes, workshops and other assistance. DMHAS will issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) in early Summer 2019 using State Opioid Response (SOR) grant funds to fund seven additional CPRCs. Providers are required to provide peer-to-peer recovery support services that are responsive to community needs. All activities and services are led and drive by \"peers\", individuals who have experienced addiction and recovery, either directly or indirectly as a family member or friend. The overall goal of the CPRC is to provide a safe place for recovering individuals to gather in support of one another and experience sober living in a community setting. The CPRC will be a place where those in recovery can have the opportunity to give back to their community thereby fostering senses of empowerment and independence. Two public colleges and universities receive funds to support students in recovery. Recovery support and housing agreements are in place with Rutgers University, New Brunswick and Newark campuses and The College of New Jersey. Recovery supports include screening and intervention services for at risk students; self-help, mentoring, peer and academic support; crisis management and relapse prevention; community education; and alcohol-free/alternative programming and community service opportunities. Capital agreements are in process with The College of New Jersey, and Ramapo College of New Jersey to either develop designated recovery housing and/or enhance existing recovery communities on campus. An additional five programs will be added. Telephone Recovery Support (TRS) is a confidential peer-to-peer check-in type service. Peers provide weekly telephone recovery support calls to people seeking recovery from opioid addiction. Staff help provide information about local recovery supports, including information about local resources such as self-help meetings, food pantries, and sober living, if needed. To date, 618 individuals have been served by TRS. The Prison Intensive Recovery Treatment Support (PIRTS) program is a collaboration with the NJ Department of Corrections (DOC) providing peer services that expands pre- and post- release recovery support services to individuals within DOC with an opioid use disorder and facilitates continuity of care and treatment that includes comprehensive medical, substance use treatment and social services.

This program was developed through a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care and in close collaboration with DOC. A key feature of this program is that the provider will begin working with offenders six months prior to release. DMHAS supports the advancement and professionalism of peers by increasing and enhancing its peer workforce. All peers working in DMHAS initiatives attend a 3-day Ethics training, where they learn about themselves, others, cultural diversity, motivation interviewing, outreach, and engagement techniques. In addition, peers attend the 5-day Connecticut Community for Addiction Recovery (CCAR) which leads to peer certification. DMHAS supports two pathways to peer certification. The International Reciprocity and Credentialing Consortium (IC&RC) NJ affiliate, the Addiction Professionals Certification Board, grants the Certified Peer Recovery Specialist (CPRS) and NAADAC, the Association for Addiction Professionals grants the National Certified Peer Recovery Support Specialist (NCPRS). Over 150 peers have receiving training through the Division's Addiction and Training Workforce Development initiative and half have obtained certification as recovery support specialists. 5. Does the state have any activities that it would like to highlight? The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) has worked with the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (DMAHS) to develop a bundled rate for Opioid Overdose Recovery Program (OORP) services so it is now Medicaid reimbursable. DMAHS has also developed an individual rate for addiction peers. DMAHS is working now on developing a reimbursable rate for substance use disorder (SUD) case management services for its new supportive housing program.

Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services ( DMHAS) Consumer -Operated Services in New Jersey Consumer -operated Services continue to expand the availability of resources, as well as having a strong commitment from the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) toward building a recovery -based system -of-care. DMHAS strongly emphasizes the participation of the mental health, addiction and co-occurring consumer population and the families of those consume rs into the development of its programs; the planning procedures for those programs; the careful monitoring of such programs; as well as consumer and family inclusion into the evaluation process for nearly all programs provided. 33 Community Wellness Centers, Self -help Centers and/or Recovery Centers There are 33 Centers throughout the 21 counties of the state that are funded by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services and these centers are all consumer -run c ommunity -based or State hospital on -grounds centers that strive to provide support services to individuals experiencing mental health and/or substance use issues, with available resources and structure to foster their personal recovery and wellness. The Center members are supported through self-help, socialization, peer support, employment and education opportunities, and recovery -based activities. Some Community Wellness/Self -help Centers/ Recovery Centers are leaders in delivering support se rvices to t he members. Many of the Wellness Centers that were originally conceived and set up to provide mental health support to the surrounding communities are seeing considerable changes in their membership structure and most are now servicing not only individuals with mental health challenges, but also welcoming more members who need co - occurring support services, as well as servicing many behavioral health consumers who are homeless, have criminal justice involvement and more people with language barriers, partic ularly Spanish speaking members. This shift in membership demands, has had a huge impact on the availability/use of financial resources and has caused a lot of adjustment necessities and an increase in training needs of Wellness Center peer staff and a nee d to have long -term center members understand and accept the demands that are resulting in changes to the structure of the services that are provided/needed. Wellness Centers/Self -help Centers continue to have access to the Recovery Library by Pat Deegan, which is an evidence -based practice that provides an opportunity to an array of online supports, group ideas, videos, and interactive exercises that focus on issues relevant to recovery, including addiction issues, wellness issues, parenting, advocacy, relationship building and developing natural supports in ones' community of choice. This year, DMHAS reallocated some of its' already existing funding dollars under the auspice of Consumer -operated Services and created a competitive opportunity for Wellness Centers/Self -help Centers to apply for additional \"Wellness Dollars.\" Through an application process in which the managers had to explain how they would use these particular funds to address the memberships Printed: 11/19/2020 11:03 AM - New Jersey Page 4 of 22 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 370 of 456 needs surrounding specific dimensions from SAMH SA's Eight Dimensions of Wellness, and how that additional funding would assist to enhance services in dimensions that were important to the members of each Center. Journey to Wellness (JTW) Self -help Center in Toms River, NJ and Brighter Days Wellness Center in Jackson, NJ are both in Ocean County and the leadership staff has been active in working collaboratively in their respective communities. They have worked with the Ocean County Department of Human Services, local police departments, county social service agencies, and the NJ Department of Community Affairs. Those Self -help Center/Wellness Center managers have been at the forefront of what has resulted in a tremendous legal shift and helped to change individual rights for Residential Health Care ( RHC) residents throughout NJ. Advocates/Managers from these two centers have directly assisted in developing new State legislature that provides Due Process to the RHC/Boarding Home residents in New Jersey, particularly around new State regulated evictio n procedures. These residents can also now have community visitors at their homes between 8 AM and 8 PM, 7 days a week. The RHC/Boarding Home residents have the liberty to access Wellness Center transportation services and participate in activities at th eir local Wellness Centers/Self -help Centers if they choose to take advantage of that new opportunity. This type of resource was previously unavailable to many RHC/BH residents and when they weren't in a program, they had limited options to their ability to engage in consumer -based services. Many people at these homes had little family support and were not engaged in outside activities at night or on the weekends. DMHAS Wellness Centers/Self -help Centers are now able to offer their many services to the r esidents, many who previously were restricted from attending, by the RHC/BH management/leadership. The Wellness Centers/Self - help Centers state -wide assist these residents with socialization skill development, offer them a supportive environment in which t hey can focus on developing their recovery skills, provide assistance to empower them with ways to make positive changes in their lives, while helping them understand how to manage their behavioral health needs. Wellness C enter staff are helping these RHC/ boarding home residents learn computer skills so that they can find phone numbers that they need and locate addresses for agencies that they wish to contact. Many centers have also been doing some groups specifically for the Boarding Homes residents, such as: Budgeting their money and assisting them to develop independent living skills. Journey to Wellness offers d iverse, innovative, and purposeful groups to all of their members, that are delivered by a well -trained peer staff, who either have their CRSP credential or CPRS credential, many of which hold dual certifications, holding both credentials. Groups offer a v ariety of evidence -based strategies and coping skills to obtain and retain your personal wellness and recovery. Examples of the groups are: IMR, WRAP, Creative Expressions, Your Wellness Counts, Yoga, Mindfulness & Meditation, Anger Management, and Weeken d Wellness.

NJ Connect for Recovery Workshops provide a safe, nonjudgmental place for family members of the Center members who have co -occurring or addiction difficulties to get immediate support, counseling and assistance from professional staff on substance use issues. There is a NARCAN training at the close of the workshop and a NARCAN kit is provided to the attendees who complete the 13 -week program. Brighter Days has also become a \"Quit Center\" for smoking cessation and will work with p rofessional representatives from Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. As for the Wellness Dollars, Brighter Days is going to be doing a raised garden this year with a variety of vegetables. The members will be looking at different ways to incorporate these fresh home -grown vegetables into everyday meals to make them healthier. They have also planned a Sunflower Garden around the property. Hudson County Integrated Services (HCIS) Wellness Center is a heavily attended urban -based center in the hear t of Jersey City.

Homeless members are n ow able to utilize social media to reconnect and then stay in contact with their family members. Many of the Center's membership has lost contact with their families over the years, due to the lack of resources to contact them. The Camden WC has made e xtensive efforts to visit other centers and agencies for resources and training. Recently the center members visited the Rite Center in Burlington County and saw the Mental Health Players perform. This center has received donations that allowed members t o attend the Camden Salvation Army KROC (Ray and Joan Kroc) Center, which provides the community with Play Care, a Fitness Center, a pool, group fitness rooms, and a gym.

The NJ Suicide Prevention Hopeline is funded by the New Jersey Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services and is operated by Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care. Since its inception in May of 2013, call volume has steadily risen from Fiscal Year 2014's total of 19,876 incoming calls to Fiscal Year 2018's total incoming call volume of 42,827. Fiscal Year 2019 is expected to total nearly 48,000 incoming calls. The Hopeline employs one full time peer support specialist and two part -time peer support specialists. Peer support specia lists are fully integrated into the Hopeline's call answering system and their expertise and experience in wellness and recovery are utilized to engage callers, help build rapport, and elicit motivation from callers with high degrees of ambivalence towards or distrust in the system of care. Wellness Respite Services -Receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can often be a disempowering experience wherein one's autonomy is usurped by a mental health system imbedded in settings that foster dependency and segregation . Hospitalization can contribute to this sense of disempowerment, and often leads to a decrease in social and vocational functioning, loss of housing and jobs, dependence on professional staff, loss of contact with natural supports, and, potentially, incre ase in trauma and stigmatization. Yet, hospitalization is often the only resource available to individuals experiencing a psychiatric crisis (Burns -Lynch, Murphy, Gill, & Brice, 2015). Thus, Wellness Respite Services were created as a community based alter native to hospitalization which offers comprehensive and individualized mental health services. There are a total of 4 Peer -operated Respite Center's currently available in NJ. Three of the Respite programs run by CSPNJ and there is another Respite -crisis program in Ocean County, NJ, run by Legacy Treatment Services. All Respite centers are doing extremely well. Historically, the Middlesex County Respite has had the highest occupancy rates out of all the CSPNJ respites. More recently, respites have had high occupancy rates. For the month of March, the (CSPNJ) Middlesex County Respite had a 94% occupancy rate, (CSPNJ) Passaic County had a 97% occupancy rate and the newest Respite in Essex County had a 103% occupancy rate. An occupancy rate in the 100's t ook years for the Middlesex County Respite to reach whereas, the Essex County Respite reached this rate in its six month s of operation. This is a testament, not only to the tremendous need in this area, but also to the marketing plan that the Respite teams have carried forward. Contributing to the increased occupancy rates at all CSPNJ Respite programs is evidence that the marketing plan is working. The Respite staff created and advanced a strategic marketing plan in which each staff person has a target g roup and is required to reach out to 2 contacts per week. This includes sending the contact an overview of Respite services along with their respective brochure Printed: 11/19/2020 11:03 AM - New Jersey Page 12 of 22 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 378 of 456 and flyer. Examples of target groups include Intensive Outpatient Programs, Supportive Housing programs and agencies, private therapists, primary care physicians, and partial care programs, etc. Additionally, Respite supervisory staff attend local county PAC (provider advisory committees) and SRC (systems review committee) meetings in order to netw ork with local providers and exchange information and resources. Additional meetings and committees include the CIT (Crisis Intervention Team) training planning committee, the Behavioral Health Justice Involved Task Force and the Campaign to End Stigma in Middlesex County Committee. Also, in particular, the Middlesex County Respite, celebrated its 5-year anniversary last month and has had over 700 guest stays since its opening in April 2014. Recently, the Middlesex County Respite program manager, has attend ed several events on the topic of opioid overdose prevention in an attempt to further the substance use services provided at the Respite. In fact, Respite staff from all of the Respite houses have recently become NARCAN trained as a response to the opioid epidemic. Lastly, the Middlesex Respite staff also continue to maintain a strong working relationship with the Community Wellness Center in Middlesex County, combining their marketing efforts and strategies. Moreover, the Passaic County Respite's occupan cy rates have seen a steady increase since July of 2018 wherein a new Program Manager, was hired. This key leadership change has had a positive impact on team morale as well as guest occupancy rates. In fact, Haledon Respite reached its highest occupancy r ate to date; 99% in December 2018. To date, the Passaic County Respite has served over 530 guests since its opening in July 2014. Highlights for the Passaic County Respite include the ability to offer services in Spanish. The leadership team at Haledon is bi-lingual which ensures that there are staff in 7 days a week that speak and write in both Spanish and English. This has opened a door to many individuals that previously was not available. Additionally, it should be highlighted that the Essex County Res pite is in a unique situation in that the Essex County Respite is a part of CSPNJ's Essex County Integrated Services Wellness Center. The Respite in Essex County is located within the Better Life building that houses the Better Life Community Wellness Cent er. All guests at the Respite are linked to the Better Life Community Wellness center wherein guests report enjoying the center's support groups, daily activities, meals, and working with the center's resource specialist who can provide linkages to housing resources. The Essex County Respite offers, in addition to daily support from staff, a weekly substance abuse group and weekly art group . The respite team and guests are currently working collaboratively with the Better Life Wellness Center staff and me mbership to create a Better Life garden for all members and guests to enjoy over the summer. During the first quarter of 2019, the three CSPNJ respites had their licensing inspections. The respites were found to be very clean, orderly, and tranquil. Overa ll, the reviewers appeared to be impressed with the services offered at those Respite programs. Furthermore, the Better Life Community Wellness Center will provide support services for 12 - 14 individuals living in housin g units on the second floor of the Better Life (housing subsidies are managed by the Newark Public Housing). Most of the supports will be provided by peers and the residents will be encouraged to take advantage of the Engagement Center, which is totally peer - operated, on the first floo r for support and resources to help them in their wellness and recovery as well as making important linkages to their local community.

The Legacy Respite is peer -operated, with clinical staff providing over -sight. Crosswinds recently adapted their recreation room to now become a wellness room. In the wellness room they have incorporated SMART TV to stream in videos among other information for purposes of enhancing daily psycho -education groups. It has yoga mats and the floor is outlined with mesh tile that offers space to run yoga groups. The room is equipped for meditation services with meditation cushions and a chair. Materials have been purchased to run CD's and DVD's through the SMART TV for purposes of running yoga and meditation groups. There were items purchased to enhance the respite ambience with essential oil diffuser and running water. Crosswinds has a garden on the grounds for consumers to utilize as a th erapeutic intervention and provide home grown food for menu preparation. Crosswinds staff help link consumers to community -based programs, such as: Wellness Centers, re-entry programs, medication management and counseling, and in particular housing place ments. Roughly 90% of consumers admitted to the Crosswinds respite are experiencing some form of acute mental health issue that is concurrent and often attached to their housing circumstances. The Legacy's Crosswinds P eer Respite has an 85% success rate l inking homeless consumers to stable housing upon discharge . Legacy Treatment Services Psychiatric Screening Services implemented employing peers on its emergency Psychiatric Crisis Screening unit in 2005 , Legacy Treatment Services Behavioral Health Advocates have proven to be an essential part of the screening process. Behavioral Health Advocates provide support to those on the unit from a shared perspective of having a diagnosis themselves and their personal learned insights on what is needed to liv e life based on the principles of wellness and recovery. It is this shared mutuality that enables advocate staff to connect to those on the crisis unit in ways that a clinician can't. Screening and Crisis Intervention Program ( SCIP ) advocates primary rol e is to be to consumers the example that moving on from crisis is possible and that living life in wellness and recovery is an attainable goal, this happens by having advocate staff scheduled 24 hours a day 7 days a week. SCIP advocate staff further suppo rt consumers on the unit by assisting them with coming up with a Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) based post crisis plan which allows a consumer to gain insight on specific action steps that are needed to be in place while they embark on their wellness and recovery journey. Legacy Treatment Services Screening Program distinguishes itself as one of the few crisis screening programs in New Jersey that has peer staff. Since 2005, the consumer -driven CHOICES team has been providing tobacco education to mental health and/or co -occurring consumers receiving services across the state of New Jersey. The services are delivered by a team of peer providers who do not use tobacco and are highly educated about the consequences of tobacco use and evidence -based t reatments for tobacco use disorder. The team travels throughout the state to provide onsite tobacco educational presentations and feedback sessions to consumers at outpatient mental health programs, conferences, health fairs, & other events. The team als o provides these sessions for Community Wellness Centers, and work collaboratively with center directors to provide engaging activities for consumers who are coming into the centers.

The services are highly sought after by community providers and CHOICES has presented at statewide events like the annual COMHCO conference, for the past 10 years. Staff also participate in the M HANJ Consumer Connections training two to three times per year, to provide tobacco education for mental health consumers working toward becoming certified peer specialists. This is a vitally important session for the individuals attending the Consumer C onnections program, as many of them are smokers themselves, and find the information learned inspiring in their own quest to become tobacco free, as well as the work they will be doing with their peers. CHOICES peer counselors, called Consumer Tobacco Advocates (CTAs) are paid, part -time positions and there is a part time Program Director who provides supervision and oversight to the team. CHOICES also disseminates a program newsletter twice yearly which is posted to their website. The CHOICES newsletter is almost entirely made up of contributions from mental health consumers who share their stories. These contributions include personal smoking and quit smoking stories, poetry, artwork, and puzzles. Co nsumers who have contributed to the newsletter find it extremely validating to see their work in print. Each issue of this newsletter reaches between 3,000 -4,000 consumers annually. Additionally, the CHOICES program has received national attention and has been presented with awards in Innovative Programming by Mental Health America in 2007, the Silver Achievement Award in 2009 from American Psychiatric Association, the Community Innovations Award presented by Healthy People 2020 in 2011, as well as the 2016 Excellence in Wellness Award, presented by SAMHSA's Programs to Achieve Wellness. The CHOICES team was also invited to present at the 2018 CDC - Interagency Committee on Smoking and Health, and met with U.S. Surgeon General, Jerome Adams, who was ver y supportive of the CHOICES message. Additionally, CHOICES was invited to Washington DC in June 2018 to participate in the stakeholder meeting \"Smoke Free at Home\" hosted by Mental Health America and the American Lung Association to discuss approaches to addressing the smoking ban instituted at public housing facilities nationwide, which took effect on July 31, 2018. CHOICES has been featured in radio, video, webinars, and print campaigns presented by the Truth Initiative, the National Council for Behavior al Health, the Legacy Foundation, Mental Health Weekly, among others. Since 2005, the CHOICES team has completed nearly 1,600 presentations for over 49,000 consumers, and has delivered individual personalized feedback sessions for over 12,000 consumers to help them to discover resources available to help address their tobacco use. Financial Services In 2002, Collaborative Support Programs of New Jersey, Inc. (CSPNJ) and Community Enterprises Corporation (CEC) broadened its mission to address the finan cial issues of living in the community, the situational poverty and resulting disempowerment faced by many very low income persons, especially people with psychiatric disabilities and people with special needs. In response, CSPNJ and CEC developed a Financ ial Services Program and now offer many financial products and services aimed at promoting financial literacy, responsibility for money management, and development of long -term savings skills and habits leading to asset building opportunities.

CSPNJ's economic development mission today is \"to promote self -determination, self -sufficiency, community integration and personal responsibility by offering products and services that increase a person's wealth through financial education, personal assets and employment. This is done through a wellness and recovery approach\". CSPNJ endorses the belief that individuals, including people living with psychiatric disabilities and/or s pecial needs, have a right to housing and economic opportunities to maintain and improve their quality of life. With these rights come responsibilities to learn, to grow, and to fulfill a valued role in society by managing money, paying taxes and filing th eir tax return, building assets with savings, maintaining a good credit rating, and becoming financially fit and independent. Financial education and access to economic opportunities will change people's attitudes toward money, allowing them to improve th eir standard of living and to get out of poverty. They believe that quality products and services provided to these individuals will contribute to personal wellness and recovery, community integration, financial stability, security, independence and overal l financial health. Consumer Connections (Mental Health Association of NJ) Consumer Connections continues to be NJ's prime trainer of consumers seeking to work as recovery peers in the NJ behavioral health system, as the sole provider of the Certified Recovery Support Practitioner (CRSP) Medicaid approved certification. The program added the capacity to provide the new addiction peer certification the Certified Peer Recovery Specialists (CPRS) to mental health peers to expand the capacity to service th e growing co -occurring population in NJ. In February 2019 Consumer Connections sponsored its first statewide Peer Career Fair, attracting over 30 behavioral health providers, and over 100 peer job seekers - this will become an annual event. Collaboration with the growing addiction peer movement in the areas of self -care and sharpening peer to peer communication training will be a major goal for the future to help build a stronger peer workforce. Certified Recovery Support Practitioner (CRSP) The CRSP rem ains one of the most comprehensive peer training programs in the nation with 126 required hours of training and 500 hours of supervised peer work experience. This certification provides NJ's mental health community with a uniquely qualified and stable pe er workforce, and services as the cornerstone to build a larger and stronger peer workforce to engage the most chronic and those with the complexities of co -occurring disorders.

COMHCO also offers a supporting membership for non -consumers who have no voting rights. There are 21 Board of Trustee Members, one representing each county in the state. Each trustee al so serves as a County Liaison who is res ponsible for not only distributing information to county consu mers and agencies from membership and com mittee meetings, but who is also responsible for completing the chain of local connection by reporting back to the COMHCO board with any local i ssues and concerns. The Community Wellness Centers are an integral part of the organization which provides a valuable source of communication and integration into the local support structure for the local Mental Health Community. Monthly me mbership meetings, quarterly trustee meetings, and several standing committees make up an effective info rmation network to en sure that all consumer views are represented. COMHCO has strong working relationships with other organizations and agencies that provide support, in formation and advocacy on behalf of Mental Health Consumers throughout the state. The trustees and member s also represent the consu mer perspective on boards, councils and advisory co mmittees such as the NJ State Behavioral Health Advisory Board & Council, CSPNJ, Mental Health Association of NJ, Disability Rights New Jersey Inc., PAIMI Council, State Cons umer Advisory Council, NAMI -NJ, and county mental health boards. The Annual COMHCO New Jersey Consumer C onference has an average attendance of 230 people with the lived experience of mental illness. It provides an opportunity for Consumers to make connectio ns with support groups from their local communities, as well as providing 12 workshops on various topics like receiving benefits, healthy living, and returning to work and school that can strengthen an individual's abilities as they develop and sustain the ir Recovery. COMHCO maintains an email Alert list which provides consu mers, Community Wellness C enters and ind ividuals with meeting announce ments and info rmation on state and federal issues concerning Mental Health Recovery. In addition to advocacy alerts that generate support for issues of local, state, and national importance, the COMHCO email alert list ensures that the Consumer Voice is able to impact legislative issues in a timely manner. GROW is an intern ational community mental health movement organized and led by people recovering from mental illness. This 12-step program assists those individuals who want to take responsi bility for their health issues by providing them with a group method to assist them in making positive choices while receiving support from a caring and sharing community. The weekly GROW groups meet for two hours followed by a half hour period of socialization; also education and discussion groups meet monthly. All members have the opportunity to participate in a month ly social activity held on the weekend. GROW workers conduct workshops on specific features of the program and training courses for group organizers and recorders.

The Retreat last year provided service to over 450 individuals, primarily members of both CSP-sponsored and non-CSP wellness centers and residents from CSP Support Services, The Wildwood Learning Retreat offers various events including trainings, networking, mini-conferences, meetings and recreational activities with an increasing e mphasis on Welln ess. The Wildwood Learning Retreat site is a relaxed at mosphere that allows consu mers to meet and discuss issues, receive technical assistance, and learn techniques in handling operational challenges associated with managing wellness centers. Other popular trainings have focused on alternative therapies, such as Reiki and meditation that complement other treatment choices. The Wildwood Learning Retreat has also been a source of opportunity for individuals providing community service through the Cape May County Probation Department and the Community Work Experience Program (CWEP). We also assist individuals experiencing budgetary challenges with washing of personal laundry and provide laundry detergent with donations received from Acme Market and Community Food Bank of Southern Jersey. This allows staff the opportunity to teach individuals about p roper loading of the washer, using proper amounts of soap and bleach, separating linens from darks. There have also been many discussions on WRAP, Diabetes self -management, Pain management issues, maintaining a budget, benefits of physical activity, respectful and fiscally responsible use of resources, and sharing of resources with other groups who share use of the retreat. There are a total of 13 trainings scheduled for the summer season with 10 participants at each training. We continue to outreach to Rutgers for NARCAN trainings which have enabled attendees to save the life of a loved one, a friend, or even a stranger. The Recovery Network Project provides oppor tunities for i n d i v i d u a l s w i t h a l i v e d e x p e r i e n c e to reach out to state institutions to educate both individuals dealing with mental health issues or dual issues and staff about recovery and wellness prin ciples and resou rces. This project was initially funded through Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA). The Recovery Network Project offers on -site weekly groups at three of the four State Hospitals: Trenton Psychiatr ic Hospital, Ancora Psychiatric Hospital and Ann Klein Forensic Center (AKFC) by staff from the hospital on -grounds centers. Currently the fourth State Hosp ital, Greystone Psychiatric Hospital holds its' groups at their On -Grounds Center, as space is an issue within the hospital building itself. The content of the group presentations provides the consumer with a clear message of hope and present an array of self-help, wellness, and recovery resources. The purpose is to share experiences and introduce resources so that persons with a mental illness currently living at the state hospit als can access recovery and wellness resources in their present environment and when they return to the community. In addition to these weekly groups they also provide a Peer-to-Peer project at Ann Klein Forensic. The weekly group has been more challenging in Fiscal year 2019 due to the rehab department at AKF C being down for about two and a half months. This Project has Peer Educat ors meeting with individuals who are unable to participate in programming outside of their unit. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:03 AM - New Jersey Page 19 of 22 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 385 of 456 The groups are delivered by people who have entered a recovery journey and therefore can provide proof that recovery is possible. Presenters themselves, share their process of accepting their mental health diagnosis and the ways they have learned to move forward into a full life keeping their diagn osis in perspective. Pre senters share their stories, highlighting what has worked for them and what might help consu mers who are currently in the state hospitals helping them look into themselves to find their own personal strengths and talents so that they can learn to manage their illness and move toward a path of recovery and wellness. The project is designed to empower consu mers to affect changes in their own reco very so they move back into the community and maintain a strong connection to a greater array of natural community supports and self-help resources. Group materials emphasize how consumers can assume personal responsibility for recovery and improve their quality of life and successful integration into the community. Life Coaching Life Coaching is a support offered by CSPNJ that assists peer staff, peer facilitator volunteers from Wellness Center and at times Wellness Center members throughout the agency helping them deal with a number of stresses connected to or returning to work. The Life Coach assists staff who are either referred by supervisors or self -referred. The Life Coach assists \" coaches \" in being better able to handle job stress and life stress leading to better job performance and tenure. The sessions are time limited but the Coach is always available for consul tation and support. Over time the goals of coaching have expanded to include assisting individuals with quitting smoking, getting more exercise, improving sleep habits and building career skills. The Coach also assists individuals with issues concerning h ealth related and/or job related problems including time management, personality conflicts, and staying focused. We feel that Life Coaching has proved effective for most who participate as the turnover in peer positions is significantly lower than that o f other staff both at CSPNJ and throughout the mental health community. Peer staff also has reported being highly satisfied with their jobs in staff surveys with concerns surrounding salaries. Most referrals continue to come through the Community Outreac h Department. Coaching continues to be offered to Peer Managers and Mentors of the Community Wellness Centers and the On -the-Grounds hospital centers although peers throughout the agency have used coaching services during the past year. Proud To Be Well is a peer health engagement service to strengthen the capacity of the CSPNJ peer workforce (Peer Mentors, Center Managers, Regional Coordinators) to serve individuals through the Community Wellness Centers (CWCs). The purpose of Proud to be Well Peer Health Engagement Services is to improve access to health and wellness support to adults with serious mental illness served by CSPNJ CWCs statewide. Participants include persons with or at risk of co-occurring substance and medical challenges who face gap s in terms of access to accessible health care services for long term and acute health care conditions. The Centers trained peer health engagement services staff will market and outreach to local communities raising awareness for individuals not attending a Center to participate in the program and receive services. Proud to be Well will address the health disparities and wellness needs by building the capacity of the statewide peer workforce by training over 60 leaders over 3 years in using a Peer Health a nd Wellness Toolkit Printed: 11/19/2020 11:03 AM - New Jersey Page 20 of 22 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 386 of 456 who will serve over 1,500 over the 3 -year project period. By training and developing an ongoing technical support and learning collaborative model the peer workforce can strengthen their health and wellness competencies including healt h literacy and engagement, so they will be able to offer targeted individuals support and also create a center environment built on principles of health literacy and health engagement. Hearing Voices Network For the past 5 years CSPNJ has sponsored He aring Voices Network (HVN) Groups. These groups are held at Community Wellness Centers and made up of people who are voice hearers, see visions, or experience other phenomena. HVN is committed to helping people who hear voices. Psychiatry traditionally refers to hearing voices as \"auditory hallucinations\" but research shows there are many explanations for hearing voices. The aims of the network are: To raise awareness of voice hearing, visions and tactile sensations and other sensory experiences, to g ive people who have these experiences an opportunity to talk freely about this together, to support anyone with these experiences seeking to understand, learn and grow from them in their own way. The Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) program purpose is to train peers in the use of an acupressure technique to assist people to reduce anxiety. The practice often referred to as \"tapping\" has become part of the practice of psychotherapists and used by individuals to reduce the intensity of panic attacks and anticipatory as well as generalized anxiety. This technique has been introduced to Support Services, Respite and Wellness Center staff. Quarterly trainings will be held for Centers and support staff to keep the Emotional Freedom Techniques fre sh. Children's System of Care ( CSOC) The Department of Children and Families ' (DCF) Children's System of Care (CSOC) was developed through the joint efforts of families, providers, advocates, and other stakeholders across the state. It is based on basic principles designed to create a children's service delivery system that: increases access to services and supports. empowers parents and guardians in seeking care and positively impacting the system to improve it. assures the ability of families to share their ideas, concerns, needs, and suggestions. enhances the integrity and quality of family and community life. Through an organized system of care, CSOC is committed to providing emotional and behavioral health care services that are: 1. clinically appropriate and accessible, without regard to income, private health insurance or eligibility for Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare or other health benefits programs; 2. individualized, reflecting a continuum of services and/or supports, both formal and informal, based on the unique strengths of each youth and their family; 3. provided in the least restrictive, most natural setting appropriate to meet the needs of the youth and their family; 4. family -driven, with families engaged as active participants at all levels of planni ng, Printed: 11/19/2020 11:03 AM - New Jersey Page 21 of 22 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 387 of 456 organization, and service delivery; 5. community -based, coordinated, and integrated at the community level with the focus of services as well as management and decision -making responsibility resting at the community level; 6. culturally competent, with agenc ies, programs, services, and supports that are responsive to the cultural, racial, and ethnic differences of the populations they serve; and 7. protective of the rights of youth and their families. CSOC views youth and their families as full partners in the development of their individualized service plans and in assessing progress toward their own outcomes. CSOC is committed to providing services based on the needs of the child, youth or young adult and their family in community -based, family -centered enviro nment. CSOC services are coordinated through one entity and are based on a single, strength -based Individual Service Plan (ISP) developed with the family for the child, young adult and their family. Within the children's system of care Family Support Organizations (FSO) are system partners within the NJ Children's System of Care. FSOs are nonprofit, county -based organizations run by families of children with emotional and behavioral challenges. FSOs w ork collaboratively with the Care Management Organizations, Mobile Response and Stabilization Services, the Contracted System Administrator, state agencies and provider organizations to ensure that the system is open and responsive to the needs of families and youth. The FSO provides peer support, education, advocacy and system feedback to families. They ensure that the key values of the Children's System of Care are upheld. FSOs are directly funded through CSOC. Meetings between CSOC management and FSO Exe cutive Directors are held on a monthly basis. CSOC staff serves as the liaison to the FSOs. Additional information regarding Family Support Organizations can be accessed here: http://nj.gov/dcf/fa milies/support/support/ . Located within each county, Children's Inter -Agency Coordinating Councils (CIACCs) were created by statute to serve as the mechanism in each county to develop and maintain a responsive, accessible, and integrated system of care fo r children with emotional and behavioral challenges and their families, through the involvement of parents, consumers, youth and child serving agencies as partners. The CIACCs provide a forum where the system of services for children with emotional and be havioral challenges is developed, reviewed, revised and/or redirected, through collaborative decision -making process with DCF to promote optimal services provided in the least - restrictive, but most appropriate setting possible. Based on needs assessments t hat have been conducted within the county as well as CSOC/CIACC data reports, each CIACC determines how CSOC community development funds should be allocated within that county.

Does the state's Olmstead plan include : Housing services provided. nmlkji Yes nmlkj No Home and community based services. nmlkji Yes nmlkj No Peer support services. nmlkji Yes nmlkj No Employment services. nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 2. Does the state have a plan to transition individuals from hospital to community settings? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 3. What efforts are occurring in the state or being planned to address the ADA community integration mandate required by the Olmstead Decision of 1999? The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) is in the process of revising Administrative Bulletin 5:11 in an effort to reduce hospital length of stay. Under this bulletin, consumers in state psychiatric hospitals are assigned to community service providers whom have the option of either accepting the consumer or requesting additional supports from DMHAS. In addition to community providers, state psychiatric hospitals have the option within their discharge planning process of requesting additional supports for the consumer in their potentially new living situations outside the institutions. Such requests and other efforts toward successful discharge are to be documented within the Individual Needs for Discharge Assessment (INDA). Assignments are based on hospital treatment team recommendations as well as consumer choice, and the assigned provider is expected to participate in every treatment team meeting from the consumer's first to his/her last while in the hospital. The early involvement of community providers in the treatment planning process fosters familiarity between provider and consumer, allowing for immediate planning on the part of the provider to prepare to meet the individualized needs of each consumer upon discharge into their care. This preparation is critical to ensuring that the consumer is provided with necessary community supports and thereby maximizing his/her chances of sustained integration within the community. On June 21, 2018, Governor Murphy announced plans to return the DMHAS back to the Department of Human Services, reversing a decision made by Governor Christie in 2017. By restoring DMHAS at the Department of Human Services where Medicaid and social services are housed, Governor Murphy's plan would ensure that mental health programs and substance use disorder services are delivered to New Jersey residents in the most effective and efficient manner possible. The four state psychiatric hospitals would remain in DOH. DOH would create an integrated licensing system for mental health, substance abuse and primary care and continue to improve the quality of care in the state psychiatric hospitals. Governor Murphy's plan took effect on August 20, 2018. Environmental Factors and Plan 17. Community Living and the Implementation of Olmstead - Requested Narrative Question The integration mandate in Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) , provide legal requirements that are consistent with SAMHSA's mission to reduce the impact of M/SUD on America's communities. Being an active member of a community is an important part of recovery for persons with M/SUD conditions. Title II of the ADA and the regulations promulgated for its enforcement require that states provide services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the individual and prohibit needless institutionalization and segregation in work, living, and other settings. In response to the 10th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision, the Coordinating Council on Community Living was created at HHS. SAMHSA has been a key member of the council and has funded a number of technical assistance opportunities to promote integrated services for people with M/SUD needs, including a policy academy to share effective practices with states. Community living has been a priority across the federal government with recent changes to section 811 and other housing programs operated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD and HHS collaborate to support housing opportunities for persons with disabilities, including persons with behavioral illnesses. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) cooperate on enforcement and compliance measures. DOJ and OCR have expressed concern about some aspects of state mental health systems including use of traditional institutions and other settings that have institutional characteristics to serve persons whose needs could be better met in community settings. More recently, there has been litigation regarding certain evidenced-based supported employment services such as sheltered workshops. States should ensure block grant funds are allocated to support prevention, treatment, and recovery services in community settings whenever feasible and remain committed, as SAMHSA is, to ensuring services are implemented in accordance with Olmstead and Title II of the ADA. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 1 of 3 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 389 of 456As part of its Home to Recovery II Plan, DMHAS is focusing its efforts on enhancing the community-based resources available to its consumers. One such enhancement is the implementation of Community Support Services (CSS). A rehabilitative service billable by Medicaid, CSS offers education to consumers in the community on navigating daily activities, rather than performing these activities on their behalf. The goal of these services is to nurture independence and self-reliance on the part of the consumer, empowering them to thrive as functional and competent members of a community outside of an institutional setting. DMHAS has sharpened its focus on consumer employment as another key element to optimal community integration. To that effect, the Division has enhanced its Supported Employment services to include an in-reach pilot within the three regional state hospitals. Implemented in July 2015, this pilot program targets individuals who are ready for discharge and examines their interest in competitive employment outside the hospital. This in-reach is supplemental to the Division's existing Supported Employment services, which are available in each of New Jersey's 21 counties. Supported Employment services include assistance accessing benefits counseling; identification of occupational skills and interests; and the development and implementation of a job search plan based on the consumer's strengths, interests, needs, and abilities. The ultimate goal for consumers receiving Supported Employment services is to obtain meaningful and competitive employment as a means of further ensuring sustained integration within the community. Another area of focus for DMHAS's Home to Recovery II Plan is the examination of outcomes geared toward monitoring sustainability of the Division's community integration efforts. These outcomes include the completion of Medicaid applications within 30 days of determining the necessary level of care for consumers in state psychiatric hospitals; an increase in Peer Support Specialists across state psychiatric hospitals; expansion of the Behavioral Health Home initiative integrating primary and behavioral health care for mental health services consumers; enhanced utilization of Supportive Housing in the form of sustained tenure in Supportive Housing placements, expansion of Supportive Housing opportunities, and an increase in discharges to Supportive Housing as well as in the percentage of consumers served by Supportive Housing as compared to state psychiatric hospitals; and finally a decrease in hospitalizations in the form of lower census counts (for CEPP consumers and the total hospital population); fewer admissions to state hospitals; a reduction in length of stay on CEPP status and within the hospital overall; and a decrease in CEPP consumers as a proportion of the total hospital census. Here are some Highlights: 1. Partnership with Vital Statistics. In October 2014, DMHAS issued Administrative Bulletin 4:27 in response to delays in hospital discharges resulting from missing patient identification documents. With the collaborative efforts between DMHAS and Vital Statistics, and subsequent development of the AB 4:27, a new process was implemented whereby DMHAS staff routinely retrieve birth certificates prepared by Vital Statistics for New Jersey born consumers that were previously unable to produce them for discharge planning. This process has greatly improved the discharge process by helping to remove a significant barrier to discharge. In SFY2017, 471 birth certificates were obtained by way of this collaboration. The number of birth certificates obtained in SFY 2018 and SFY 2019 were 438 and 401 respectively. 2. Validation of Vacancy Tracking Systems. The Bed Enrollment Data System (BEDS) was developed to help DMHAS manage and track vacancies. The Olmstead and Housing Offices within DMHAS are currently collaborating on reconciling the subsidy list maintained by the Housing Office with the vacancies tracked by BEDS. Utilization of a web-based system provides real-time access to vacancy information and helps facilitate assignments and avoid outdated spreadsheets. Analysis of the utilization of independent (e.g. Community Support Services) vs. supervised settings (e.g. group homes and supervised apartments) allows for assessment of the Division's progress toward community integration. The system also enables planning at both the individual consumer level for placement purposes and system-wide for purposes of enhancements in community resources. In addition to Community Support Services and residential (i.e. group home and supervised apartment) living arrangements, DMHAS is in the process of adding short-term care facility (STCF) placements to BEDS. This will allow for analysis and quality improvement measures geared toward improved wait times in STCF beds prior to discharge to long-term housing. 3. Enhancements to Community Capacity: From 2010 through 2014, DMHAS was charged with the creation of 695 beds expressly for the community placement of consumers on CEPP status in the regional state hospitals and 370 beds to be created for consumers who are already in the community and at high-risk for hospitalization and/or homelessness. This equates to a total of 1,065 placements to be created over the five-year period covered by the settlement. The SMHA has met and exceeded this goal, creating 1,436 new placements. Of these, 941 were set aside for the discharge of CEPP consumers from state hospitals (exceeding the settlement target of 695 by 246 or 35%), and 495 were reserved for consumers at risk of hospitalization (exceeding the target of 370 by 125 or 33.78%). In total, the SMHA exceeded its targets for placement creation by 34.83%, which amounts to 371 placements above its required deliverable. The Division continued creating Supportive Housing placements for these targeted populations, reaching a total of 1,808 new placements by the end of SFY 2016, with 1,274 reserved for CEPP discharges and 534 set aside for consumers at risk of hospitalization. 4. Enhancements to the Individual Needs for Discharge Assessment (INDA). DMHAS has recently implemented INDA-specific canned reports, which provide hospital staff and central office users with immediate access to information contained within the assessment, including but not limited to provider assignments, attendance at treatment team meetings, functional needs of each hospital's census, and consumers refusing to be discharged. This information will be used at all levels of the Division and drive efforts geared toward quality improvement and planning for the allocation of resources and the implementation of new initiatives.

Continued utilization of the Intensive Case Review Committee (ICRC). All consumers in the state hospital are reviewed by ICRC once every four weeks to ensure that consumer assignments have been made in preparation for discharge in a timely manner, barriers to discharge are addressed, systemic issues are addressed, and compliance with length of stay targets are maintained. The purpose of these meeting is to develop strategies for resolution of barriers and systems issues. 6. Continued Utilization of Hospital Project Teams. Project Team meetings are higher-level meetings that occur immediately after ICRC and are typically chaired by the hospital CEO/DCEO or Medical Director. Policy and systems issues as well as any issue that may involve collaboration with another Division or state Department, are discussed at these meetings and elevated to Olmstead leadership to address. In addition to policy and systems reviews, Project Team meetings also discuss newly-designated CEPP consumers to ensure that a discharge plan is in place. On an as-needed basis, teams also hear brief case presentations in the event that Olmstead resources are needed. Finally, Olmstead staff will also use these meetings to update the hospital leadership on any new administrative bulletins, requests for proposals, updates or changes to the vacancy tracking system, and/or trends identified in the data. 7. Hospital Diversion Initiative. The Olmstead Office has partnered with Centralized Admissions within the state psychiatric hospitals on a process for redirecting would-be hospitalizations to less restrictive community settings. Regional Olmstead staff assist Centralized Admissions in securing additional supports needed for applicable consumers as a means of addressing their individualized circumstances and needs in the most integrated setting possible within their required level of care. This collaboration allows for reduced hospital census as well as enhanced community integration as mental health consumers otherwise on track for admission to state or county hospitals are able to continue to live independently.

Children and Adolescents M/SUD Services - Required MHBG, Requested SABG Narrative Question MHBG funds are intended to support programs and activities for children and adolescents with SED, and SABG funds are available for prevention, treatment, and recovery services for youth and young adults with substance use disorders. Each year, an estimated 20 percent of children in the U.S. have a diagnosable mental health condition and one in 10 suffers from a serious emotional disturbance that contributes to substantial impairment in their functioning at home, at school, or in the community.63. Most mental disorders have their roots in childhood, with about 50 percent of affected adults manifesting such disorders by age 14, and 75 percent by age 24.64. For youth between the ages of 10 and 24, suicide is the third leading cause of death and for children between 12 and 17, the second leading cause of death.65. It is also important to note that 11 percent of high school students have a diagnosable substance use disorder involving nicotine, alcohol, or illicit drugs, and nine out of 10 adults who meet clinical criteria for a substance use disorder started smoking, drinking, or using illicit drugs before the age of 18. Of people who started using before the age of 18, one in four will develop an addiction compared to one in twenty-five who started using substances after age 21.66. Mental and substance use disorders in children and adolescents are complex, typically involving multiple challenges. These children and youth are frequently involved in more than one specialized system, including mental health, substance abuse, primary health, education, childcare, child welfare, or juvenile justice. This multi-system involvement often results in fragmented and inadequate care, leaving families overwhelmed and children's needs unmet. For youth and young adults who are transitioning into adult responsibilities, negotiating between the child- and adult-serving systems becomes even harder. To address the need for additional coordination, SAMHSA is encouraging states to designate a point person for children to assist schools in assuring identified children are connected with available mental health and/or substance abuse screening, treatment and recovery support services. Since 1993, SAMHSA has funded the Children's Mental Health Initiative (CMHI) to build the system of care approach in states and communities around the country. This has been an ongoing program with 173 grants awarded to states and communities, and every state has received at least one CMHI grant. Since then SAMHSA has awarded planning and implementation grants to states for adolescent and transition age youth SUD treatment and infrastructure development. This work has included a focus on financing, workforce development and implementing evidence- based treatments. For the past 25 years, the system of care approach has been the major framework for improving delivery systems, services, and outcomes for children, youth, and young adults with mental and/or SUD and co-occurring M/SUD and their families. This approach is comprised of a spectrum of effective, community-based services and supports that are organized into a coordinated network. This approach helps build meaningful partnerships across systems and addresses cultural and linguistic needs while improving the child, youth and young adult functioning in home, school, and community. The system of care approach provides individualized services, is family driven; youth guided and culturally competent; and builds on the strengths of the child, youth or young adult and their family to promote recovery and resilience. Services are delivered in the least restrictive environment possible, use evidence-based practices, and create effective cross-system collaboration including integrated management of service delivery and costs.67. According to data from the 2015 Report to Congress68 on systems of care, services: 1. reach many children and youth typically underserved by the mental health system; 2. improve emotional and behavioral outcomes for children and youth; 3. enhance family outcomes, such as decreased caregiver stress; 4. decrease suicidal ideation and gestures; 5. expand the availability of effective supports and services; and 6. save money by reducing costs in high cost services such as residential settings, inpatient hospitals, and juvenile justice settings. SAMHSA expects that states will build on the well-documented, effective system of care approach to serving children and youth with serious M/SUD needs. Given the multi- system involvement of these children and youth, the system of care approach provides the infrastructure to improve care coordination and outcomes, manage costs, and better invest resources. The array of services and supports in the system of care approach includes: non-residential services (e.g., wraparound service planning, intensive case management, outpatient therapy, intensive home-based services, SUD intensive outpatient services, continuing care, and mobile crisis response); supportive services, (e.g., peer youth support, family peer support, respite services, mental health consultation, and supported education and employment); and Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 1 of 24 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 392 of 456Please respond to the following items: 1.

Children and Adolescents MSUD Services When the Department of Children and Families (DCF), the state's first Cabinet -level department focused solely on child and family well -being, was created in July 2006, the Children's System of Care (CSOC) was established as one of the three main Divisions of the new Department. DCF is the single state agency providing services to children, youth and young adults with emotional and behavioral health care challenges and their families through CSOC. The goal of DCF's CSOC is to enable the youth to remain at home, in school, and within their community. Therefore, through an organized system of care approach, CSOC is committed to providing services that are: A. Clinically appropriate and accessible; B. Individualized, reflecting a continuum of services and/ or suppo rts, both formal and informal, based on the unique strengths of each youth and his or her family/ caregivers; C. Provided in the least restrictive, most natural setting appropriate to meet the needs of the youth and his or her family/ caregivers; D. Family -guide d, with families engaged as active participants at all levels of planning, organization, and service delivery; E. Community -based, coordinated, and integrated with the focus of having services, decision -making responsibility, and management resting at the com munity level; F. Culturally competent, with agencies, programs, services, and supports that are reflective of and responsive to the cultural, racial, and ethnic differences of the populations they serve; G. Protective of the rights of youth and their family/care givers; and H. Collaborative across child -serving systems, involving; child protection, juvenile justice, and other system partners who are responsible for providing services and supports to the target populations. The NJ Children's System of Care is founded on the following Core Values and Principles: Family Driven and Youth Guided - Families are engaged as active participants at all levels of planning, organization, and service delivery. Culturally and Linguistically Competent - learning and incorporating the youth and family's culture, values, preferences, and interests into the planning process, including the identified language of the family. Community Based - identifying and utilizing supports that are least restrictive, accessible, and sustainable to m aintain and strengthen the family's existing community relationships. In the years since 2006, the mission of CSOC has expanded. On January 1, 2013 CSOC began coordinating services for youth with developmental disabilities and their families. Coordination of services for youth with substance use challenges and their families began on July 1, 2013.

Our vision is that all NJ residents are (or become) safe , healthy and conne cted. Our values are what we hold to be true of our work for the department. It is the core of our operations and interactions. It is the professional compass that guides us. Collaboration is about our willingness and intention to work in teams, in comfo rtable and uncomfortable ways . Equity means making sure we do what is needed to support each person we serve to be safe, healthy and connected. Evidence means using evidence -based, or promising practices, data and outcomes as our basis for advancing - or ending - certain programs and services. Family means all that we do should be in the interest of family and should be determined, as much as possible, by listening to their needs and providing appropriate supports. Integrity means that we're honest, rel iable and respectful in all that we do. DCF has also embraced five core approaches or practices that we will embed in all our work. Race equity - DCF is committed to integrating policies that advance racial equity in the work that we do. Healing Centered Practice - DCF will strengthen practice models, customer service, physical spaces and services that we purchase, so that they promote healing . Protective Factors Framework - DCF will structure practice models and purchased services to assess for a nd to promote the 5 protective factors: parental resilience, social connections, concrete support in times of need, knowledge of parenting and child development, and social and emotional competence for children . Family Voice - DCF's new Office of Family Vo ice will provide us with staff and families with lived experience to ensure that we're attentive to their ideas and input. Collaborative Safety - DCF will incorporate safety science into child and family services so that we do not merely respond to adverse events, but learn from them in such a way that we can reliably prevent future adverse events from happening DCF's strategic focus represents an effort to identify the major areas in need of attention to maintain service excellence while simultaneously ac hieving significant transformation of the systems Four (4) major Departmental priorities have been identified: Primary prevention of maltreatment and maltreatment related fatalities.

DCF anticipate s framing the recommendations of the advisory group within these three priorities: o Promote integrated health and behavioral health o Build capacity to deliver evidence -based interventions and services o Enhance CSOC capacity to ensure equitable access Description of the current Children's System of Care and Program Summaries Currently CSOC serves over 59,000 youth per year through a complemen t of needs -driven supports and services within a system of care approach: family driven, youth -guided, strengths - based, individualized care. The primary goals of CSOC are to ensure youth receive quality care in the most appropriate, community -based settin g whenever possible to maintain connections to family and communities for sustainable relationships and planning. CSOC also has a continuum of out -of-home treatment settings of varying degrees of intensity of service accessible based on youths' individual needs. CSOC employs the use of the system of care approach and collaborates with many system partners throughout the State to leverage expertise of the local communities. There are state administrative and management staff, and services are provided by p rivate agencies - primarily not -for-profit agencies. There is generally one CSOC staff member assigned to manage each of the key services available through CSOC (i.e. CMO, MRSS, IIC/BA, FSO). Services are primarily funded through Medicaid state plan amendments (Title XIX and Title XXI) Mental Health Rehabilitation Services Behavioral Assistance (01 -04); Mental Health Rehabilitative Services Intensive In -Community (01 -06); Reimbursement for M ental Health Rehabilitation Services Children's Mobile Response (01 -10); Reimbursement for Mental Health Rehabilitation Services Residential Care Facilities, Children's Group Home, and Community Psychiatric Residences for Youth and Other Programs for Chil dren Licensed/Certified by New Jersey Government Agencies (02 -8, 02 -09 and 02 -14) and; Behavioral Health Homes (16 -0002) and; 2.

Medical necessity is authorized by PerformCare, the Contracted System Administrator (CSA)/Administrative Services Organization (ASO) which provides the administrative services to our system of care. Care Management Organization (CMO) - CMOs are county -based, nonprofit organizations that combine face -to-face care management and comprehensive service planning for high and moderate need youth and their families into a single, integrated system of care. Youth are enrolled with a CMO when independent CSOC CSA review of clinical and need based information about the youth meets the threshold of c linical criteria and the youth and family can benefit from services. CMOs facilitate the Child/Family Team (CFT) meetings and implement Individual Service Plans (ISP) for each youth and their family. The CMO provides a single point of accountability for th e organization, the delivery of services and the supports needed to maintain stability for each youth. Child Family Team (CFT) - The CFT/ Wraparound approach depends on collaboration among a team of family members, professionals, and significant community residents identified by the family and organized by the care manager to design and oversee implementation of the Individual Service Plan. The ISP connects the assessed strengths and needs of the youth with plan elements including family vision, goals, strategies, and supports and services. The CFT is an ongoing coordinated process that includes participation from the youth, the youth's fami ly, the CMO care manager, and any other individual identified by the youth and family to help support the family towards a sustainable plan of care. The CFT meets, at minimum, every 90 days or as needed. Through the CFT process, strengths and needs, prog ress and barriers to care, and services to be implemented are identified. Once identified, a request is added to the youth's treatment (care) plan, which is reviewed by CSA's licensed clinical staff - Care Coordinators - against established clinical crite ria and in the context of the youth's assessment and comprehensive plan. Clinical Criteria for services is located at: http://www.performcarenj.org/provider/clinical -criteria.asp x. The Care Coordination staff requests additional information from the CMO when there is question about the youth meeting clinical criteria. Clinically appropriate services are authorized.

BHH services a re a \"bridge\" that connects prevention, primary care, and specialty care. Medical and wellness staff are integrated into the existing CMO CFT structure responsible for care coordination and comprehensive treatment planning for youth and their families whi ch includes planning for the holistic needs of the youth. The CFT structure and approach (CMO, FSO, Family, Youth and other designated service providers and supports) enhanced with BHH RN, Health/Wellness Coach staffing plans for the holistic needs of a y outh with both behavioral health and medical needs (inclusive of substance use and developmental and intellectual challenges). Nurse Manager and Health/Wellness staff communicate with youth's medical providers (primary care specialty providers, urgent or emergent medical care) and connect the medical domain and planning with the existing CFT process. New Jersey is among the first states using Targeted Case Management (TCM) to deliver BHH for youth only. NJ's BHHs are operational in Bergen, Mercer, Cape/Atlantic, and Monmouth counties. During SFY 2018, 484 youth were enrolled in BHH services. To be eligible, youth must meet the criteria for CMO and have a qualifying medical condition which is inclusive of intellectual and developmental challenges as well as substance use. Family Support Organizations (FSOs) - FSOs are operated by 15 agencies under contract with CSOC to: ensure that service plans developed for families are child -centered and family -focused; provide support to families through peer co unseling, family training and workshops; advocate for families at the local level with other system partners; and cultivate and empower youth development consistent with the wellness and recovery model. The FSOs offer support to families of youth with beh avioral health needs, substance use needs, and intellectual and developmental challenges. Family Support Partners within the FSOs are assigned to each family of youth enrolled in CMOs to offer and provide individual family peer -to-peer support. Additiona lly, the FSOs offer community -based supports to all youth and families in their service area. They provide community outreach and education on peer support and CSOC, family and youth support groups, youth partnership structure and activities, and telephon ic support for families. FSO NJ Alliance is contracted to provide training and technical assistance to FSOs. Mobile Response and Stabilization Services (MRSS) - MRSS provides rapid response to youth and families experiencing family -defined crisis, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year, that focuses on crisis intervention and stabilization that is intensive, therapeutic and rehabilitative. MRSS approach is engagement focused, strengths based, collaborative with youth and families, culturally sensitive and based on individual needs. The purpose of MRSS is to provide crisis intervention, assessment, and planning services designed to stabilize escalating behaviors and/or emotional challenges, maintain children and youth in their home environment and community, and avoid unnecessary psychiatric hospitalization, out of home care and legal involvement. Features of the MRSS program include: Face to Face, on site, one -hour response time from initial service request.

Up to an eight -week stabilization service which includes fam ily support and collaboration, crisis plan oversight, management of service providers within a developed stabilization network, and progress monitoring. Services managed and monitored are implemented based on youth and family need and include formal servi ces such as Intensive In - Community and Behavioral Assistance services, partial care, outpatient, in addition to community supports and informal resources. Mobile Response is required to connect with families, service providers and supports minimally once a week to ensure families are connected with providers, to assess progress and ensure the plan is being implemented or make changes when necessary, including evaluation of a need for higher intensity of support or intervention. Standard Crisis Assessment T ool is employed and reflects youth risk behaviors, emotional/behavioral challenges, life domain functioning, and caregiver needs and strengths. 97% of children/youth served remain in their current living arrangement. Intensive In -Community/Behavioral Assistance (IIC/BA) services - Intensive In - Community/Behavioral Assistance (IIC/BA) services are short term, intensive, community -based therapeutic interventions, rather than clinic or office -based, that are needs -driven, youth and family guided, and acce ssible. IIC/BA are aimed at engaging youth and families in a therapeutic process to reduce and stabilize challenging behavioral and emotional patterns and symptoms, introducing \"replacement\" skills, and developing parent skills for sustaining positive chan ge and connecting to continued therapeutic supports when the need presents. This line of service is only authorized to youth involved with CMO or MRSS. CMO and MRSS request the service on behalf of the youth and family/CFT through their treatment plans. Services are provided to youth and families with moderate to high need; often the youth's immediate living situation is in jeopardy due to his/her behavior in combination with family needs. IIC/BA clinical criteria is located at: http://www.performcarenj.org/provider/clinical have two components: IIC Bio -Psychosocial and Strengths and Needs Assessments are conducted and submitted to the CSA for review by licensed behavioral health clinicians within 10 days of request. The assessment describes present challenges, strengths, identified goals, youth and family perspective and recommended intervention stra tegies. Assessments are provided in a youth's current living situation, including resource homes and detention centers. Assessments provide necessary information for a level of care determination. IIC Treatment Services are clinical interventions provid ed by licensed or licensed - supervised master's level clinicians working within the scope of their licensing board in the youth and families' natural environment. Time limited and goal -oriented, these services aim to reduce acute symptomatology, enhance st rengths, and transition youth and families to more traditional, i.e. clinic/office -based, services as soon as possible.

They are never stand -alone. BA services are delivered by a license -supervised individual w ho holds a bachelor's degree at minimum and has 1 -year experience working with the population served. The BA is the agent of the IIC plan of care. The BA service provides direct youth and parent training, support, and intervention to maximize the potenti al of positive and sustainable change. Evidence -Based Practices - The Children's System of Care is dedicated to providing behavioral health services that are based on the best evidence available and to improving outcomes and the quality of life for children, youth and young adults receiving services through the Division. With the introduction of Multisystemic Therapy and Family Functional Therapy, New Jersey embrac es the nationwide trend to use research evidence to inform policy and program choices. The following independent organizations have verified MST as an evidence -based treatment: Blueprints for Healthy Youth Development ; Office of the Surgeon General ; SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence -based Programs and Practices (NREPP). FFT is based on scientific trials and methodology. The following independent organizations have verified FFT as an evidence -based treatment: Blueprints for Healthy Youth Development ; SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence -based Programs and Practices (NREPP). Licensed clinical staff at CSOC, as well as staff at Rutger's -UBHC, CSOC's Training and Technical Assistance Program, disseminate information from evidence -based, promising practices, and best practices. Licensed clinical staff at the CSA review and authorize the services as part of a child, youth or young adult's Individualized Service Plan (ISP). The CSA tracks utilization and outcome measurements of programs implementing \"evidence -based\" practices as part of their service delivery model. In accordance with the DCF Strategic Plan CSOC has prioritized building capacity to deliver additional evidence -based interventions and services. Functional Family Therapy for Foster Care (FFT -FC) - CSOC in partnership with the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCP&P) and a local provider offer access to and service delivery of Functional Family Therapy - Foster Care (FFT -FC) through the CSOC Mobile Response and Stabilization Service and Intensive In -Community service lines. FFT is a relationally focused, trauma informed, evidence -based treatment model for youth in resource care that increases the likelihood of successful adjustment for youth in the ir resource placements as well as positive permanency outcomes. This treatment model is targeted toward youth aged 12 -18 who are demonstrating behaviors that place them at risk of disruption in their resource care placement and are in the legal custody of the DCP&P and have the intellectual capacity to benefit from the treatment intervention. The model uses the relationally focused techniques of Functional Family Therapy (FFT) in a comprehensive and systemic approach adapted to helping youth and families in volved with DCP&P to overcome individual and relational trauma to promote placement stability, increase youths' lifelong connections and improve youths' permanency outcomes.

The gra nt requires all system partners, including CSOC, to examine institutionalized practices and policies that could be trauma -inducing to achieve better outcomes for youth and families through improved system collaboration, policy creation, and the enhancement of youth and family voice. The. six core strategies are: Leadership Toward Organizational Change Use of Data to Inform Practice Workforce Development Use of S/R Prevention Tools Consumer Roles in Inpatient Settings Debriefing Techniques Additional information on The Six Core Strategies for Reducing Seclusion and Restraint Use can be located via the following link: http://www.nasmhpd.org/docs/NCTIC/Conso lidated_Six_Core_Strategies_Document.pdf Wraparound - CSOCs care management services utilize the wraparound process. Wraparound is an evidence -based structured approach to service planning and care coordination for individuals with complex needs (most often children, youth and their families). Wrap Around is built on key system of care values: family and youth driven, team based, collaborative, individualized, and outcomes -based. Wraparound adheres to specified procedures: engagement, individualized care planning, identifying strengths, leveraging natural supports, and monitoring progress. Care Management Organizations (CMOs) organize and coordinate community -based services and informal resources through face- to-face care management at the local level for individual children and families with multi -service needs and multi -system involvement.

The ARC -GROW Model is an adap tation of the Attachment, Regulation, and Competency framework for intervention with youth and families who have experienced multiple and/or prolonged traumatic stress. The Attachment, Self -Regulation, and Competency (ARC) framework is a core - components tr eatment model, developed to provide a guiding framework for thoughtful clinical intervention with complexly traumatized youth from early childhood to adolescence and their caregiving systems. GROW is a caregiver skill building intervention designed to enhance resilient outcomes for families who are impacted by chronic adversity or stress (Kinniburgh et al. 2011).

CSOC currently provides authorizations and utilization management for partial hospitalization services for youth younger than 18 years old . Outpatient substance use and mental health services covered under NJ Family Care are currently paid through fee for service for the child and youth population. Outpatient - Outpatient treatment services provide behavioral health care to youth and families in a licensed community agency. Outpatient services are designed to support, enhance and encourage the emotional development of life skills to preserve or improve individual s' functioning, strengths and resources. Interventions may include individual, group and family therapy; and referral. Interventions are provided on maintenance, assessment and testing; outreach services; and referral. Interventions are provided on a lo ng-term basis when necessary. Partial Care/Partial Hospitalization - Partial Care/ Partial Hospitalization programs are highly structured, intensive (minimum 2 hours, 3 to 6 times per week) behavioral health services for youth with serious emotional chall enges. Multi -disciplinary behavioral health interventions include rehabilitation programming such as activities for daily living, recreation, socialization, and community reintegration. Programs are typically located in, but not necessarily limited to, a community -based mental health or hospital setting (N.J.A.C. 10:37 -12). Partial Care services assist in stabilizing youth with acute needs, either following or in lieu of hospitalization or other out of home treatment. County Interagency Coordinating Coun cil (CIACC) - The CIACC serves as the county mechanism to advise DCF/CSOC on the development and maintenance of a responsive, accessible, and integrated system of care for youth with behavioral and emotional health needs, substance use, and/or intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families. Through enhanced coordination of systems partners, the CIACC also identifies service and resource gaps and priorities for resource development. Functions of the CIACCs include: Evaluating the local county policies and policies to understand and minimize the impact of local barriers to serving youth with behavioral and emotional health needs substance use and/or intellectual and developmental disabilities in their community. Identifying local strategies and mechanisms to promote the integration and coordination of county, State, or other resources serving youth with behavioral and emotional health needs, substance use and abuse, and /or intellectual and development disabilities. Assessing local systems needs using information received from DCF, the Contracted System Administrator (CSA), any child -serving agency identified by DCF, and other bodies to make recommendations regarding service and resource development priorities. Identifying and informing DCF/CSOC regarding gaps and barriers to local service effectiveness.

In collaboration with the Department of Education, DCF initiated the creation of an \"Educational Partnership\" in every county in NJ. These partnerships use the County Inter -Agency Coordinating Councils to build a better working partnership between the DCF system of care and the local education system in each county. This initiative has m any goals, but one simple goal is to have at least one person in every school in NJ formally trained on the DCF service delivery system. This will help to facilitate a more preventative response to behavioral health challenges. Efforts to achieve this go al continue. DCF believes bringing systems together through the Educational Partnership will improve coordination in the service delivery process. Out-of-Home Treatment Services - Funding for CSOC OOH care encompasses a full continuum of services for b ehavioral health, intellectual/developmental disabilities, substance use, and co - occurring treatment needs. OOH treatment intervention must be directly related to the goals and objectives established by the Child/Family Team (CFT) process in coordination w ith the multidisciplinary Joint Care Review (JCR)/treatment plan. The OOH provider submits the JCR to the CSA for utilization review and for clinical determination of continued stay in out of home treatment. Family/guardian/caregiver involvement is essenti al, and, unless contraindicated, should occur consistently and on a regular basis (or as determined in the JCR/treatment plan). The recommended length of stay for OOH intervention is typically nine to twelve months. One single episode of OOH care is opti mal. Clinical criteria for the OOH continuum of services is available at http://www.performcarenj.org/provider/clinical -criteria.aspx . CSOC data have demonstrated a gradual decl ine in OOH utilization over the past several years, which is attributed to the success of maintaining more youth at home with community supports. Based on the analysis of utilization data, youth with high needs are requiring OOH intervention, whereas yout h with low needs are more likely serviced in the community. Due to this decrease in utilization, as well as reduced lengths of stay, several OOH programs closed during FY 2018, resulting in a net loss of 132 beds. The Specialized Residential Treatment Unit (SRTU) provides administrative programmatic oversight of these programs and thus conducted a needs analysis to identify the types of OOH programs where additional capacity is needed. This analysis determi ned that only a small number of programs require replacement (SPEC -10 beds for girls, PCH -10 beds, RTC for older youth - 10 beds).

PCH (Psychiatric Community Home) - A community residential facility that provides intensive therapeutic services for youth who have had inpatient psychiatric care and/or children who may be at risk of hospitalization or re -hospitalization. SPEC (Specialty Bed Program) - Programs th at provide intensive residential services for children who are presenting with very specific high -risk behaviors including fire setting, assaultive behavior, sex offending behavior predatory or non -predatory, and children who have experienced significant t rauma from physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. RTC (Residential Treatment Center) - Programs that provide 24 hours per day care and treatment for youth unable to function appropriately in their own homes, schools and communities, and who are also unable to be served appropriately in smaller, less restrictive community -based settings. GH (Group Home) - Group home services provide up to 24 hours per day care and treatment to youth whose needs cannot be met appropriately in their own homes or in resource car e, but who do not need the structure and intensiveness of a more restrictive setting. TH (Treatment Homes) - Programs that provide care and supervision by specially trained parent/caregivers in a family -like setting for typically one or two children with b ehavioral health needs who require a moderately high level of therapeutic intervention. CSAP -CW (Stabilization and Assessment Services for Child Welfare) - Short -term, highly structured, and nurturing environments with professional competencies to stabiliz e children engaged with or at risk of involvement with child welfare who are homeless and/or present with complex behavioral health challenges on an emergent basis, and who do not meet the need for an acute hospital setting. The intent is to stabilize cris es in a soothing and trauma aware milieu while diagnostic assessments, services, and supports that meet the children's needs are conducted. The goal of this intervention is to identify and secure an appropriate living situation for the children (in home/ou t of home). Programs were developed in 2017 -2018 specific to young children ages 5 -12 involved with DCP&P. Children's Crisis Intervention Services - Psychiatric inpatient hospital services, located in community hospitals, provide acute inpatient treatment , stabilization, assessment and short -term intensive treatment.

Nine CCI S units are located around the state and provide services to all 21 counties. There are currently 164 beds. They are funded through Medicaid and private insurance. Seven of the nine CCIS' receive additional support through a mental health subsidy ($15, 056 annual per bed) from the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services. Substance Use (SU) Treatment - The Children's System of Care offers an array of substance use treatment services for youth and young adult, including four withdrawal management beds, contracted outpatient/intensive outpatient services through 10 providers statewide, partial care services through one provider, short term out of home treatment through one provider with 22 beds, and long term out of home treatment through two provi ders - one with 36 beds and the other with 64 beds). In addition, residential treatment services for youth with co -occurring substance use needs and significant behavioral health needs can be accessed through the CMO from five providers with a total of 54 beds. The South Jersey Initiative provides fee for service funding to 11 providers for outpatient and intensive outpatient substance use services for the eight southern counties. One agency, with a capacity of three beds, provides short term out of home treatment. Outpatient and Intensive Outpatient services are authorized based on individual clinical need and are not monitored on a slot -based method. This allows the providers to serve more youth and avoid waiting lists. The contracted providers manage their annual funding for these services. A parent/legal guardian may contact the CSA to access any CSOC contracted service. The CSA licensed clinicians complete the CSOC standardized substance use assessment via phone, determine appropriate levels of care , provide referrals, and authorize services. If a youth meets clinical criteria for out of home co -occurring services, he/she will be opened with a CMO from their service area. The CMO Care Manager will assist in coordinating treatment services for youth and families, including meet and greets with treatment providers, educating families about services for their youth during and after treatment process, as well as providing support and encourage family involvement throughout this process. Families may al so access services directly through one of the CSOC contracted substance use treatment providers. The provider will complete a substance use assessment and submit it to the CSA for review by licensed clinicians for intensity of service determination and a uthorization for treatment. The ASAM Criteria (developed by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM)) are used to determine admission to level of care and readiness for discharge/transfer to another level of care. These decisions are made by Licen sed Clinical Alcohol and Drug Counselors (LCADCs) with appropriate specialized training employed by the CSA.

South Jersey Initiative (SJI) - The South Jersey Initiative is a h istorical funding stream that was designated as a result of advocacy to increase substance use treatment resources for youth and young adults in Southern NJ. To receive SJI funding, the youth must meet ASAM criteria for services and must be from one of th e following eight counties: Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cumberland, Gloucester, Cape May, Ocean, and Salem. SJI funding is the payer of last resort. Authorization for outpatient/intensive outpatient substance use treatment services, under the SJI funding , is the same process for accessing contracted funding. Intensity of service determination is based on ASAM criteria Supports and Services for Youth with Developmental Disabilities DD Eligibility - As of January 1, 2013, CSOC assumed responsibility for determining eligibility for developmental disability services for children under age 18. This eligibility process for children, which was formerly completed by the Division of Developmental Disabilitie s, is required under New Jersey law to access publicly available developmental disability services. The CMOs and MRSS work with family members to make application for eligibility determinations. Although a family must submit the DD eligibility applicati on, CMO and MRSS assist families with whom they are working in obtaining and compiling documentation needed to submit the eligibility application. DDD continues to determine eligibility for individuals aged 18 and over, and the Children's System of Care pr ovides services to those youth.

During SFY 2018, 14,422 DD eligible youth were active with CSOC. Intensive in Community - IIH Clinical/Therapeutic Supports Intensive in community - Habilitation (IIH) clinical supports are intensive community -based, family -centered services delivered face -to-face as a defined set of interventions by a clinically licensed practitioner. The purpose of IIH services is to improve or stabilize the youth's level of functioning within the home and community to prevent, decrease or eliminate behaviors or conditions that may lead to or that may place the youth at increased clinical risk, or that may impact on the ability of the youth to function in their home, school or community. The clinical and therapeutic services to be delivered are those necessary to improve the individual's independence and inclusion in their community. These services are flexible, m ulti-purpose, in - home/community, clinical supports for youth and their parents/caregivers/guardians. These services are flexible both as to where and when they are provided based on the family's needs.

The Contracted System Administrator (CSA) - The Contracted System Administrator (CSA) was designed to provide the State with overall healthcare system management to assure 24 -hour access to appropriate and coordinated services and provide child -specific and systemic data analysis on all children und er the jurisdiction of CSOC. The CSA creates a common single point of entry for youth and families. The CSA functions as and is inclusive of the activities of a non -risk Administrative Services Organization (ASO). The CSA registers all youth requesting s ervices , authorizes services in a single electronic record , and tracks and coordinates care for all New Jersey youth enrolled in CSOC. CSOC retains all regulatory and policy -making authority. As such, there are key functions that remain the responsibility of CSOC, including, but not limited to, network development, provider contracting, and provider outcome standards. As a partner to CSOC, the CSA provides administrative support and is encouraged to offer recommendations for improvements to the delivery o f services which may be implemented with the approval of CSOC. To support these administrative services, the CSA provides an MIS called CYBER ( Child and Youth Behavioral Electronic Record) that is backed by strong, clinical guidance and fosters flexibility, system integration, comprehensive information management, and production of management reports that support business decisions. Traumatic Loss Coalitions for Youth (TLC) - UBHC S uicide Prevention Suicide is the third leading cause of death for New Jersey's youth. CSOC is dedicated to the prevention of youth suicide. New Jersey's primary youth suicide prevention program is the Traumatic Loss Coalitions for Youth funded by CSOC. The Traumatic Loss Coalitions for Youth Program at Rutgers -University Behavioral HealthCare is an interactive, statewide network that offers collaboration and support to professionals working with school -age youth. This is accomplished through county, regio nal and statewide conferences, training, consultation, onsite traumatic loss response, and technical assistance.

Crisis Text Line is a free 24/7 support that connects anyone experiencing a self -defined crisis with a trained counselor. It can be accessed from anywhere in the United States. When texts are received, they are screened by an algorithm for severity, and texts that indicate im minent risk are placed at the top of the queue for faster response. Crisis counselors are trained to bring texters from \"a hot moment to a cool calm\" using empathic listening techniques. They collaboratively problem -solve to help the texter come up with a plan to stay safe. Calls are anonymous and confidential, unless referral to emergency services is necessary . DCF has a Memorandum of Understanding with the Crisis Text Line for sharing frequency data. For cell phone plans with AT&T, T -Mobile, Sprint or Verizon, texts are completely free and will not show up on the phone bill. For plans with another carrier, normal text rates will apply and will appear on the phone bill as 741741. Additional information about Crisis Text Line can be found at crisistextlin e.org. Community Programs for Outreach and Intervention with Youth and Young Adults at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR -P) On September 30, 2018, SAMHSA awarded a 4 -year grant to the Children's System of Care to address youth and young adults at clin ical high risk for psychosis. CSOC worked in partnership with DMHAS to develop the program, which will provide outreach and intervention for youth and young adults up to age 25, who may be experiencing prodromal symptoms of psychosis. The NJ CSOC/DMHA S partnership is well positioned to add services for youth and young adults at clinical high risk for psychosis to the already robust care continuum available throughout the state, as the program will utilize established behavioral health agencies who are currently providing treatment services for persons experiencing first episode psychosis (FEP). NJ PROMISE anticipates providing intervention to approximately 150 youth and young adults across three regions annually, and more than 600 youth and young adult s over the four -year grant period. Through extensive outreach, coordinated care, the use of evidence -based, evidence informed, best, and promising practices as well as the expertise of a team of professionals, participants and their families will have the tools necessary to lead productive lives in their homes and communities. The project's measurable goals are to: Reduce the percentage of youth/ young adults at clinical high risk for psychosis who become hospitalized. Reduce the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms that youth/ young adults at clinical high risk for psychosis experience. Increase the percentage of youth and young adults at clinical high risk for psychosis who adopt their collaboratively developed treatment plan, including all recommended medi cation.

NJ FamilyCare Comprehensive Waiver (1115 Medicaid Comprehensive Waiver ) In 2012, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved New Jersey's 1115 Comprehensive Waiver for a five -year period with the goal of changing New Jersey's health care delivery to ensure a broader community base and person -centered continuum of care. Key changes for CSOC under the waiver authority included: Federal participation on behavioral health services for youth with severe emotional disturbance (SED); Targeted home and community -based services (HCBS) for populations of youth; In-home and community supports for children and youth with SED and/or intellectual and developmental disabilities(I/DD) and; Authority to provide and receive federal participation for services to youth with Autism under the Autism pilot. In 2017 , CMS granted New Jersey a five -year extension on the 1115 waiver (renamed NJ FamilyCare Comprehensive Demonstration) to include: Additional in -home supports for an expanded population of youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities; Needed servi ces including HCBS supports for an expanded population of youth with severe emotional disabilities; and Needed services and HCBS for an expanded population of youth with co -occurring developmental/ mental health disabilities. Children's Support Services Program (CSSP) SED The Children's Support Services Program SED provides behavioral health, home and community - based services for youth under age 21 who have a serious emotional disturbance (SED) which places them at risk for hospitalization, out of home tr eatment, or at hospital level of care. For youth not eligible for Medicaid, this provides federal support for behavioral health services under the State Plan amendment, and home and community -based services that are authorized through the children's Admin istrative Service Organization (PerformCare , also known in New Jersey as the Contracted System Administrator, CSA ). The program also allows for Medicaid eligibility based on SED determination for youth who have a plan of care through CMO, irrespective of p arental income. It also adds new services that have been found to be critical for the success of youth.

Expanding community -based care management, in -home, and day treatment programs for children In 2000, NJ served approximately 7,000 childr en, youth and young adults in community -based care management, in -home services and supports and day treatment programs In 2010 NJ served 35,000 children, youth, and young adults in community -based care management, in -home services and supports, and day tr eatment programs, a 500% increase in a ten -year period In 2018, NJ served approximately 56,000 children, youth and young adults in community -based care management, in -home services and supports, and day treatment programs, a 700% increase in an eighteen -year period As of January 2019, 22% of the youth receiving care management are Developmental Disability (DD) eligible As of January 2019, 23% of the youth receiving care management are involved with child welfare 4. Reducing the number of juvenile justice commitments: The system of care is fully accessible to youth involved with the juvenile justice system and helps keep youth out of detention centers. There has been a significant decrease in the number of detention center admissions resulting in the reduction of the number of county detention centers from seventeen to seven in the past few years (Union County detention center closed in February 2019). In 2004 there were approximately 200 youth, statewide, in detenti on awaiting residential treatment post disposition.1 Today, it is rare to have even one youth awaiting residential treatment post disposition.

The waiting time increased this year due to increased demand for two co -occurring residential programs and specialty programs for girls. For youth in detention centers in need of out of h ome treatment, there are detention alternative beds that can be accessed on an emergent basis. 5. Creating a proactive safety net for youth: In 2003 40% of newly enrolled children were under 14 years of age; today that percentage has grown to over 50% This change in age distribution among youth served indicates that the system of care is effectively reaching youth at a younger age and thus able to engage youth and families to offer earlier intervention to address the child and family's needs. 6. Red ucing the number of children in out of home (OOH) treatment settings: In FY 2007, there were almost 4,000 children in behavioral health OOH treatment settings. In the intervening 5 years, the numbers of children in OOH decreased substantially. Between F Y 2012 and FY 2018, the number of youth in all OOH placement settings (behavioral health (BH), substance use (SU) and Intellectual and Developmental Disability (IDD) continued to decrease. Year Children in OOH treatment settings services to youth in crisis: Mobile Response maintains youth in crisis in their homes or current living situation, reducing disruptions for youth and their families and providing them with support and access to services during times of behavioral health instability. As of December 2018, over 97% of youth receiving Mobile Response services remained in the home or current living situation during the Mobil e Response intervention. 8. The Children's System of Care continues to improve and continues to be the national leader and model for systems of care. NJ CSOC is frequently called upon by other states and Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 23 of 24 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 414 of 456jurisdictions to offer strengths, lessons learned and insights on how best to develop a system of care in communities and serve youth and families. NJ CSOC has been of interest to other states seeking to implement FFA (Family First Act) strategies related to prevention of child welfare involveme nt through development of community -based treatment, decreased use of congregate care, and creation of a structure that supports clinically appropriate out of home treatment. 9. In October 2015, Children's System of Care was awarded a SAMHSA system of care expansion grant, to implement trauma -informed care and provide workforce development to our system partners. The grant, which is called Promising Path to Success, utilizes the evidence - based practices of Six Core Strategies and the Nurtured Heart Appr oach to reduce restraint and seclusion, while additionally striving toward the goal of limiting out of home treatment to one episode of six to nine months in duration. The grant requires all system partners, including CSOC, to examine institutionalized pra ctices and policies that could be trauma -inducing to achieve better outcomes for youth and families through improved system collaboration, policy creation, and the enhancement of youth and family voice. SAMHSA representatives conducted a project site visit in December 2017. SAMHSA provided New Jersey with an exemplary exit report that recommended having enhanced youth voice within CSOC and the importance of supporting our Children's Inter Agency Coordinated Councils at the local level. In response to the re port, the Children's System of Care recruited and hired its first Statewide Youth Ambassador, with lived experience from DCP&P as well as CSOC, in January of 2018. This Youth Ambassador has brought youth voice more prominently at the State Level into polic ies, program development and operations. Although youth voice was previously represented in the System of Care, having a Youth Ambassador employed by CSOC amplifies youth voice at the State level in a meaningful way and is true to the system of care approa ch.

Have you updated your state's suicide prevention plan in the last 2 years? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 2. Describe activities intended to reduce incidents of suicide in your state. Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder providers contracted and/or licensed by the Department of Human Services are required to report Unusual Incidents regarding individuals they serve. State Psychiatric Hospitals are also required to report Unusual Incident Reporting Management System (UIRMS) data regarding individuals they serve. According to the UIRMS data that the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) received, there were 324 suicide attempts and 48 deaths by suicide reported in calendar year 2018. DMHAS requires providers to intensely analyze each of these events to assess opportunities for improvement in their systems and processes. All reports of the providers involving deaths by suicide are reviewed by the DMHAS Mortality Review Committee for patterns and trends among agencies. Many of DMHAS consumers, who died by suicide, did not have an evidence-based suicide risk screening or assessment completed; consumers were often not appropriately linked to treatment; and often risk factors were overlooked. If indicated, members of the Mortality Review Committee, make recommendations for improvement, and follow-up on actions taken. The Suicide Prevention Committee within DMHAS also continues to monitor and analyze data from the NJ Violence Death Reporting System (VDRS), Department of Health -New Jersey's detailed and timely surveillance system of all violent fatalities\u2014as well as existing NJ data from other systems that capture non-fatal suicide attempts of individuals who received treatment through Emergency Department visits and inpatient hospitalizations. During Suicide Prevention Week in September in 2017 and 2018, New Jersey Department of Human Services (DHS) in conjunction with Department of Health and other State Departments offered a Suicide Prevention Conference that attracted nearly 300 attendees from all walks of life. A variety of topics, one of them regarding Zero Suicide, were addressed. Several break-out sessions were tailored to specific interests, addressing different areas of concern. There was broad media coverage and the conferences were well received. This year's Suicide Prevention Conference is planned for September 10, 2019 with an increased focus on reaching primary care physicians. In spring 2019, DMHAS created a position for a Suicide Prevention Coordinator within the Medical Director's Office at DMHAS. One full-time employee (Suicide Prevention Program Specialist), who started work on April 1, 2019 is principally involved with general suicide-related matters and specifically tasked with the organization and implementation of a statewide Zero Suicide approach. Funding in the amount of $500,000 for this purpose is included in the FY 2020 DHS budget. Screening and Screening Outreach Programs are located within each of New Jersey's 21 counties. These programs are available to individuals in emotional crisis who require immediate attention and cannot wait for a regular appointment. Screening and screening services are typically located in a general hospital and available 24-hours a day, seven-days a week. An individual may walk in without an appointment, or be brought to the screening center by a parent, friend, spouse, law enforcement officials, mental health worker, or any other concerned individual. If the person in crisis is unable or unwilling to come to the Center, a screening outreach team may be sent to the person.

The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK (8255)) provides free and confidential emotional support to people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The SMHA continues to fund the NJ Suicide Prevention Hopeline, operated by Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care, which is Environmental Factors and Plan 19. Suicide Prevention - Required for MHBG Narrative Question Suicide is a major public health concern, it is the 10th leading cause of death overall, with over 40,000 people dying by suicide each year in the United States. The causes of suicide are complex and determined by multiple combinations of factors, such as mental illness, substance abuse, painful losses, exposure to violence, and social isolation. Mental illness and substance abuse are possible factors in 90 percent of the deaths from suicide, and alcohol use is a factor in approximately one-third of all suicides. Therefore, SAMHSA urges M/SUD agencies to lead in ways that are suitable to this growing area of concern. SAMHSA is committed to supporting states and territories in providing services to individuals with SMI/SED who are at risk for suicide using MHBG funds to address these risk factors and prevent suicide. SAMHSA encourages the M/SUD agencies play a leadership role on suicide prevention efforts, including shaping, implementing, monitoring, care, and recovery support services among individuals with SMI/SED.

Calls are received from anyone of any age and are answered by a peer, a trained volunteer, or a clinical staff member. If a caller is assessed as being at serious risk of suicide, the caller can be \"warm-transferred\" to the appropriate local Psychiatric Emergency Service or other entity (i.e. DCF sponsored 2nd Floor Youth Crisis Line) that can provide emergency or other necessary services for that individual. In calendar year 2017 the Hopeline received a total of 26,619 incoming calls. This is an average of 2,218 calls per month. In the year 2018, the Hopeline received a total of 47,254 inbound calls, with a monthly average number of 3,938. Due to this enormous increase in call volume, DMHAS added funding for an additional 0.5 FTE position.

Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) Strategic Prevention Framework-Partnerships for Success The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) was awarded a second Strategic Prevention Framework- Partnerships for Success (SPF-PFS) grant in 2018 from SAMHSA (its first SPF-PFS grant was awarded in 2013). In this project, DHMAS will partner with the Department of Children and Families' (DHS) Children's System of Care (CSOC). DMHAS prevention coalitions will provide training on the basics of substance abuse prevention, and use of the SPF, with the CSOC's Children's Inter-Agency Coordinating Councils (CIACC) in each county. The CIACCs provide a forum where the system of services for children with special social and emotional needs can be developed, reviewed, revised and/or redirected through a collaborative decision-making process with the New Jersey Department of Children and Families (DCF) to promote optimal services provided in the least restrictive, but most appropriate setting possible. DMHAS will utilize current SPF-PFS funds for various prevention infrastructure developments and enhancements. State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup DMHAS was awarded a Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant (SPF-SIG) by SAMHSA in October 2006 to prevent the onset and reduce the progression of substance abuse, including childhood and underage drinking. In addition, it was intended to build prevention capacity and infrastructure at the state and community levels. A key component of this grant is the use of a data-driven strategic approach and conducting a statewide needs assessment through collection and analysis of epidemiological and community readiness data. Environmental Factors and Plan 20. Support of State Partners - Required for MHBG Narrative Question The success of a state's MHBG and SABG programs will rely heavily on the strategic partnership that SMHAs and SSAs have or will develop with other health, social services, and education providers, as well as other state, local, and tribal governmental entities. Examples of partnerships may include: The SMA agreeing to consult with the SMHA or the SSA in the development and/or oversight of health homes for individuals with chronic health conditions or consultation on the benefits available to any Medicaid populations; The state justice system authorities working with the state, local, and tribal judicial systems to develop policies and programs that address the needs of individuals with M/SUD who come in contact with the criminal and juvenile justice systems, promote strategies for appropriate diversion and alternatives to incarceration, provide screening and treatment, and implement transition services for those individuals reentering the community, including efforts focused on enrollment; The state education agency examining current regulations, policies, programs, and key data-points in local and tribal school districts to ensure that children are safe, supported in their social/emotional development, exposed to initiatives that target risk and protective factors for mental and substance use disorders, and, for those youth with or at-risk of emotional behavioral and SUDs, to ensure that they have the services and supports needed to succeed in school and improve their graduation rates and reduce out-of-district placements; The state child welfare/human services department, in response to state child and family services reviews, working with local and tribal child welfare agencies to address the trauma and mental and substance use disorders in children, youth, and family members that often put children and youth at-risk for maltreatment and subsequent out-of-home placement and involvement with the foster care system, including specific service issues, such as the appropriate use of psychotropic medication for children and youth involved in child welfare; The state public housing agencies which can be critical for the implementation of Olmstead; The state public health authority that provides epidemiology data and/or provides or leads prevention services and activities; and The state's office of homeland security/emergency management agency and other partners actively collaborate with the SMHA/SSA in planning for emergencies that may result in M/SUD needs and/or impact persons with M/SUD conditions and their families and caregivers, providers of M/SUD services, and the state's ability to provide M/SUD services to meet all phases of an emergency (mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery) and including appropriate engagement of volunteers with expertise and interest in M/SUD.

The SEOW continues to meet monthly to discuss ways to prevent the onset and reduce the progression of substance abuse disease in New Jersey. The SSA continues to actively recruit for new members of the SEOW. This past year has seen the addition of members from the NY/NJ High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA), the Department of Health's (DOH) Division of Family Health, DOH Division of HIV, STD, and TB Services (DHSTS), Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMAVA), the NJ Poison Information and Education System (NJPIES), the New Jersey Hospital Association Behavioral Health Group, NJ Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (NJHMFA), Office of Managed Health Care Behavioral Health Unit, Office of the Secretary of Higher Education (OSHE), representatives from the NJ State Police's Regional Operations Intelligence Center (ROIC), and representation from the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program which became operational in September 2011. Moving on Maternal Depression (MOMD) Initiative In August 2018, New Jersey was one of three states that received an award from the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) through its Moving on Maternal Depression (MOMD) initiative. The 18-month initiative provides technical assistance, which is administered in the form of monthly calls with CLASP and other participating states; site visits with CLASP; and a conference with other states on promising practices toward serving populations with maternal depression. New Jersey's efforts under this initiative come from a collaborative which is co-lead by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DHS-DMHAS) and the Department of Health (DOH), and includes the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (DHS-Medicaid), the Department of Children and Families (DCF), and three maternal health consortia consisting of the Partnership for Maternal Child Health, Central Jersey Family Health Consortia, and South Jersey Perinatal Cooperative. The collaborative, known as the MOMD Core Team, has, as its focus, three individual goals for improving its ability to serve mothers with maternal depression. Each of these goals is the focus of its own subcommittee of core team members, which meets monthly to discuss progress, share insights, and discuss any questions or concerns arising from their efforts. The core team subsequently reports on these meetings to CLASP on monthly calls and receives feedback and consultation where necessary. The three goals comprising New Jersey's MOMD initiative consist of: 1) Enhanced Data Capacity related to examination of maternal depression in New Jersey; 2) Increased Access to Services related to maternal depression; and 3) Reduced Racial, Ethnic, and Socioeconomic Disparities in utilization of maternal depression services. National Academy for State Health Policy Maternal and Child Health Policy Innovations Program Policy Academy As a result of a collaborative application between DHS-Medicaid and DMHAS, New Jersey was selected for participation in a policy academy through the Maternal and Child Health Policy Innovation Program (MCH PIP), funded by the federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration (MCHB, HRSA). Through this program, the National Academy for State Health Policy (NASHP) will work with states and other state stakeholders, to support and advance innovative state-level policy initiatives that improve access to quality health care for the maternal child health population. As part of MCH PIP, NASHP is conducting a two-year policy academy for up to eight state teams comprised of representatives from state Medicaid agencies, public health agencies, mental health/substance use agencies, and other state stakeholders (e.g., child welfare agencies, provider groups, Medicaid managed care plans, etc.). Participating state teams will identify, promote, and advance innovative state-level policy initiatives in order improve access to care for Medicaid-eligible pregnant and parenting women with or at risk of substance use disorder (SUD) and/or mental health conditions through health care delivery system transformation. The Policy Academy will emphasize policy strategies that promote integration of care and systems; align with state initiatives to transform how care is provided and paid for (e.g., Medicaid managed care, accountable care organizations (ACOs), value-based payment, etc.); and ultimately, improve health outcomes for pregnant and parenting women. Children's System of Care (CSOC) Strategic Prevention Framework-Partnerships for Success - NJ SOAR (Substance use, Outreach, Advocacy, Resources) In September 2018, the Department of Human Services, Division of Mental Health and Addictions Services (DMHAS), in partnership with the Department of Children and Families' (DCF) Children's System of Care (CSOC), was awarded a five-year substance use prevention grant from SAMHSA. The grant award is for $2,260,000 annually. NJ SOAR provides a statewide Strategic Plan Framework initiative to address underage drinking, marijuana use, and prescription medication/opioid misuse for youth ages 9 to 20. Through the grant, CSOC and DMHAS will partner to implement prevention strategies that include outreach, education and training services to communities and families throughout NJ. Leveraging the expertise of the established DMHAS County Prevention Coalitions throughout the State, Youth Prevention Specialists (YPS) within the coalitions will train their local CIACCs on effective prevention strategies. The CIACC membership will then infuse the prevention activities into their work. NJ SOAR seeks to 1) Decrease youth underage drinking, marijuana use and misuse of prescription drugs/opioids by youth ages 9 to 20 throughout NJ, 2) Increase knowledge on the effects of underage drinking, marijuana use, and misuse of prescription medications/opioids among youth, families and youth-serving systems throughout NJ, and 3) Enhance the CSOC prevention Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 2 of 26 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 420 of 456infrastructure to ensure that statewide prevention efforts reach youth. Project goals are to strengthen and enhance the work of 21 County Prevention Coalitions, expand prevention data infrastructure and information systems capacity, and continue work in developing a unified statewide prevention planning and service delivery system that directly reaches youth-serving entities. CSOC and DMHAS will partner to implement prevention strategies that include outreach, education and training services to communities and families throughout NJ. Youth and young adults will benefit from early outreach and preventions strategies, to prevent the onset and reduce the progression of substance use and its related problems. Community Programs for Outreach and Intervention with Youth and Young Adults at Clinical High Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P) On September 30, 2018, SAMHSA awarded a four-year grant to the Children's System of Care to address youth and young adults at clinical high risk for psychosis. CSOC worked in partnership with DMHAS to develop the program, which will provide outreach and intervention for youth and young adults up to age 25, who may be experiencing prodromal symptoms of psychosis. The NJ CSOC/DMHAS partnership is well positioned to add services for youth and young adults at clinical high risk for psychosis to the already robust care continuum available throughout the state, as the program will utilize established behavioral health agencies who are currently providing treatment services for persons experiencing first episode psychosis (FEP). NJ PROMISE anticipates providing intervention to approximately 150 youth and young adults across three regions annually, and more than 600 youth and young adults over the four-year grant period. Through extensive outreach, coordinated care, the use of evidence- based, evidence informed, best, and promising practices as well as the expertise of a team of professionals, participants and their families will have the tools necessary to lead productive lives in their homes and communities. 3.

Partnershi p with othe r State and Count y Agencie s in Menta l Healt h Justic e Involve d Services Justice Involved Services (JIS) The SMHA has been funding JIS since 2000. The services work to divert from incarceration individuals whose legal involvement may have resulted from untreated mental illness or co - occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders. It is a short -term case management program designed to help consumers to successfully link to mental health or co -occurring and other services in order to stabilize and enter valued community roles reducing their incidence and length of incarce ration. The program provides access to community -based mental health and substance abuse treatment services as well as critical social services. Through case management, clients receive treatment and psychiatric rehabilitation services, housing, employme nt, medications and health services. The SMHA is involved in very active collaborations with the Judiciary, Office of the Attorney General, local law enforcement, State Parole Board and Department of Corrections, and funds 15 JIS services and several othe r criminal justice initiatives. JIS is provided to a diverse mix of consumers, male and female as well as individuals of Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Asian and Asian Indian backgrounds and from many different countries. Pre-booking Diversion Pre-booking diversion typically involves a police -based intervention to avoid arrest for non - criminal, non -violent offenses. The SMHA's acute care screening services are a form of pre - booking diversion in that police are able to bring consumers to screenin g for mental health crisis or pre -crisis services. Crisis Intervention Team s (CIT) are local initiatives designed to improve the way law enforcement and the community respond to people experiencing mental health crises; they are trained to identify and de -escalate situations involving consumers. CIT is built upon strong partnerships between law enforcement, mental health provider agencies and individuals and families affected by mental illness. Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) DMHAS funds a Crisis Interventi on Team (CIT) Center of Excellence through the Mental Health Association of Southwest New Jersey. The Center facilitated the development of new county CIT efforts. Presently 16 of 21 counties as well as the NJ State Police ( NJSP ) provide training to law e nforcement, dispatcher and mental health staff in CIT. These counties offer the training to other counties and municipalities as well as their own. As of May 2019 , 276 of 565 municipalities have at least one certified CIT officer. As of February 2019, 4,64 3 law enforcement and mental health provider staffs have been trained; 3,413 officers and 1,013 mental health staff. Post-booking Diversion Post booking diversion involves an intervention by a mental health staff person so that consumers are released fro m detention earlier than they otherwise would be; released on their own recognizance or released from jail with mental health intervention and treatment Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 5 of 26 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 423 of 456 conditions or helping to avoid detention altogether. Superior Court One form of post booking diversio n that has been formally accomplished in NJ is through Prosecutor Diversion Programs. Prosecutor Offices identify a defendant who has a serious mental illness which is confirmed by the Mental Health JIS pro fessional associated with the program. The JIS pro gram arranges for mental health and related services. These become a condition of a plea bargain or dismissal of the indictment if the defendant successfully complete s treatment and any conditions set by the Prosecutor. The Union County Prosecutor's Offi ce created and piloted this program, with DMHAS funds; however, the funds do not include treatment dollars. In 2014, the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) expanded the program by awarding two-year grants to Essex and Ocean counties for a prosecutor -led mental health diversion program on indictable offenses The grants had limited treatment dollars. In FY 2016, the OAG awarded three additional Prosecutor -Led Diversion programs: Warren, Hunterdon and Gloucester. The funding was only for two years, with the Prosecutor's Offices continuing as they were able after the funding expired. The SMHA continues to assist with services through local community mental health providers. There were no new grants awarded since 2016. Atlantic County was awarded funds from t he Office of the Attorney for a special Veterans Prosecutor D iversion Program. In conjunction with division funds, this program targeted Veterans whose charges are related to their behavioral health issues. The program coordinates with the VA Healthcare S ystems and the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMAVA) to obtain needed services. With the Atlantic Veterans initiative, there are now seven funded prosecutor -led diversion programs or one third of the state. Necessary treatment and support services will continue to be a challenge. In 2017, legislation was signed that made the Prosecutor -Led Diversion Program for Veterans statewide, although no appropriation was made. There have been few referrals to this program as reported by the OA G as of January 1, 2019 . Municipal Court Liaison (MCL) DMHAS funds a Municipal Court Liaison (MCL) Program which works directly with the Jersey City Municipal Courts; a case manager/municipal court liaison is stationed at the Municipal Court and provides individual consultations to the judges and attorneys, upon request. This often results in diversion to treatment which the liaison facilitates. DMHAS also funds a similar program for Atlantic City. The city of Newark a plea court which arranges f or needed services post plea. Asbury Park has been funding a social worker who provides similar liaison services for many years. The DMHAS, working with the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) has and continues to expand the availability of the MCL to include two to three municipalities within Passaic, Essex, Ocean, Monmouth, Mercer, Camden, Gloucester and Cumberland counties. The JIS programs will be providing the case management. The effort is ongoing with additional municipalities expected to be included as DMHAS resources are identified.

Children's System of Care ( CSOC ) Juvenile Justice Reducing the number of Juvenile Justice commitments The Children's System of Care (CSOC) is fully accessible to youth involved with the juvenile justice system and the services coordinated by care managers help to keep youth out of detention centers. There has been a significant decrease in the number of detention center admissions resulting in the reduction of the number of county detention center s from seventeen to seven in the past few years (Union County detention center closed in February 2019). In 2004, there were approximately 200 youth, statewide, in detention awaiting residential treatment post disposition.1 In 2019, there are typically about three youth awaiting residential treatment post disposition. The average waiting time to be admitted to a residential program is approximately 52 days (an increase from 40 days last year) across all levels of intensity for behavioral health. The waiting time increased this year due to increased demand for two co -occurring residential programs and specialty programs for girls. For youth in detention centers in need of out of home treatment, there are detention alternativ e beds that can be accessed on an emergent basis. Detention Alternative Program/Youth Advocate Program (DAP/YAP ) CSOC funds Community Re -Integration Services through YAP (Youth Advocate Program) to maintain youth in their community who, without this progr am, would enter out of home treatment due to juvenile justice involvement. The program provides services both individually and in groups, along with a mentor, life skills groups and employment skills. The program is located in the three counties (Middlesex , Camden and Essex) with the highest rate of court ordered out of home referrals. Additionally, this program has enabled DCP&P to successfully maintain youth in resource homes after their arrest. Medicaid/NJ FamilyCare Currently, youth in juvenile detention facilities are eligible for Medicaid or New Jersey FamilyCare (S-CHIP) only after adjudication and referra l to a non-secur e setting. 1 The term disposition is utilized in Juvenile Court versus the term sentence when the outcome of charges yields the Court determination that a youth needs out of home treatment through CSOC not incarceration; and the youth remain in Detention while waiting for admission to a treat ment bed.

Biopsychosocial Assessments The Juvenile Justice Commission requires, in the Manual of Standards, that all youth enterin g Detentio n receiv e the MAYS I h Screenin g ) withi n 24-48 hours of admission . CSOC has implemented an easily accessed clinical assessment process for any youth in a county juvenile detentio n cente r that may score on the MAYS I regardin g possibl e menta l healt h concerns or need for substance use treatment. This assessment is also utilized to expedite out of home treatment. Whe n a court -involve d youth held in a count y juvenil e detentio n facilit y is ordere d by a Famil y Cour t judge to be assessed for an out-of-home treatmen t facility in lieu of incarceration , the youth should be transitione d from the juvenil e detentio n cente r as quickl y as possible . The biopsychosocial evaluation , whic h has a turn-aroun d time of five busines s days , can be requeste d by the Socia l Service s staff at the detentio n center . To accomplis h this, CSO C develope d a trackin g syste m for childre n in count y detentio n center s for whom a congregat e care treatment program is being considered . The contracted system administrator's (CSA) management information system was also modified to incorporate information about legal statu s for system -involve d children .

In essence, DCF wants children and youth to enjoy a normal childhood and adolescence regardless of their involvement in the child welfare system. DCF formed the Task Force on Helping Youth Thrive in Placement (HYTIP) to study and recommend ways these children can remain connected to their friends, schools, neighborhoods, and communities. Its interim report offered recommendation for change in several areas, and DCF responded by updating its regulations so children and youth can enjoy contact with fam ily and friends and recreation, education, and employment opportunities within their home community. DCF continues to review and strengthen its practice culture, regulations, and contracting process to help children and youth enjoy a normal and fulfilling childhood and adolescence.

Family Success Centers A Family Success Center is a neighborhood gathering place, where any resident can go to for support, information, and services. The Centers provide family support services, encouragement and cross -generational relationships. They promote social connections that empower families and enhance the lives of children and adults alike. The Centers are guided by a Parent/Community led Advisory Board. Family Success Centers encourage families to take a leadership role, identify and build u pon their own unique strengths and talents. A Family Success Center is not a community center or your traditional social services agency; it is a gateway to the Family Success Movement which embraces families and individuals in their quest to meet life goa ls they have set for themselves. New Jersey now has one of the country's only statewide systems of publicly -supported Family Success Centers. We have at least one Family Success Center in every County. Family Success Centers help enrich the lives of chi ldren by empowering parents and neighborhoods with tools to strengthen their families and communities. Family Success Centers aim to keep families safe by addressing the impact of poverty and family violence, which can help prevent families from falling in to crisis. These supports and services are available to the community, families, youth and children at no cost.

How was the Council involved in the development and review of the state plan and report? Please attach supporting documentation (meeting minutes, letters of support, etc.) using the upload option at the bottom of this page. a) What mechanism does the state use to plan and implement substance misuse prevention, SUD treatment and recovery services? Substance abuse services are planned based on a needs assessment process completed by the State. State funding is allocated to counties based on a funding formula. Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant funding is allocated to third party contracts and fee-for-service contracts for prevention, early intervention, treatment and recovery services based on the needs assessment. As needs emerge, new Requests Proposals are drafted for contracts, which may be renewed annually, as needed. b) Has the Council successfully integrated substance misuse prevention and treatment or co- occurring disorder issues, concerns, and activities into its work? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 2. Is the membership representative of the service area population (e.g. ethnic, cultural, linguistic, rural, suburban, urban, older adults, families of young children)? nmlkj Yes nmlkji No 3. Please describe the duties and responsibilities of the Council, including how it gathers meaningful input from people in recovery, families, and other important stakeholders, and how it has advocated for individuals with SMI or SED. The functions of the NJ Behavioral Health Planning include: (1) to advise and review New Jersey's Federal Community Mental Health Services Block Grant and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant plans each year before submission and to make recommendations for improving the plans to the Assistant Commissioner of the New Jersey Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (the Division), (2) to serve as an advocate for consumers concerning State policy, legislation, and regulations affecting behavioral health, (3) to monitor, review, and evaluate the allocation and adequacy of behavioral health services in New Jersey, (4) to advise the Department of Human Services (DHS) and the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (as well as the NJ Department of Children and Families' Children's System of Care (CSOC)) concerning the need for, and quality of, services and programs for persons with behavioral health disorders in the state, (5) to advise the Assistant Commissioner concerning proposed and adopted plans affecting behavioral health services provided or coordinated by the Division and the implementation thereof, (6) as appropriate, to assist in the development of strategic plans for behavioral health services in the State and advocate for the adoption of such plans to other state departments or branches of government, and (7) to exchange information and develop, evaluate, and communicate ideas about mental health, substance abuse and co-occurring planning and services. In accomplishing these purposes the Council makes use of the State Planning Council Liaison and her staff (whom are all employees of the SMHA's Office of Olmstead, Compliance, Planning and Evaluation). The State Planning Council Liaison serves the council (and the public) by providing: logistical support for meetings, (including minutes & communications), networking to other state resources, support with navigating state bureaucracy and technical assistance in its advocacy efforts.Environmental Factors and Plan 21. State Planning/Advisory Council and Input on the Mental Health/Substance Abuse Block Grant Application- Required for MHBG Narrative Question Each state is required to establish and maintain a state Mental Health Planning/Advisory Council to carry out the statutory functions as described in 42 U.S. C. 300x-3 for adults with SMI and children with SED. To meet the needs of states that are integrating services supported by MHBG and SABG, SAMHSA is recommending that states expand their Mental Health Advisory Council to include substance misuse prevention, SUD treatment, and recovery representation, referred to here as an Advisory/Planning Council (PC).SAMHSA encourages states to expand their required Council's comprehensive approach by designing and implementing regularly scheduled collaborations with an existing substance misuse prevention, SUD treatment, and recovery advisory council to ensure that the council reviews issues and services for persons with, or at risk, for substance misuse and SUDs. To assist with implementing a PC, SAMHSA has created Best Practices for State Behavioral Health Planning Councils: The Road to Planning Council Integration.69 Planning Councils are required by statute to review state plans and implementation reports; and submit any recommended modifications to the state. Planning councils monitor, review, and evaluate, not less than once each year, the allocation and adequacy of mental health services within the state. They also serve as an advocate for individuals with M/SUD problems. SAMHSA requests that any recommendations for modifications to the application or comments to the implementation report that were received from the Planning Council be submitted to SAMHSA, regardless of whether the state has accepted the recommendations. The documentation, preferably a letter signed by the Chair of the Planning Council, should state that the Planning Council reviewed the application and implementation report and should be transmitted as attachments by the state. 69https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/manual-planning-council-best-practices-2014.pdf Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 1 of 5 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey - OMB Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 445 of 456The Planning Council gathers input from people in recovery, families and other important stakeholders largely through its open, public, monthly meetings. Guests routinely join the meetings (both in-person and over the phone via a publicly-accessible conference call line) to ask questions or become more informed about behavioral health services in the State. The Planning Council advocates for individuals with SMI and SED in various ways, from presenting personal insights to presenters during the general meeting, to writing letters for/against programs. The Planning Council also has an Advocacy Subcommittee which focus on topics of interest. At its core, the Planning Council is a tight, yet far-flung network of consumers, family members and advocates for behavioral health. The SMHA/SSA consistently reaches out to the Council to connect with consumers/family members on a range of issues. In the past year Council members have been invited by the SMHA to: serve as facilitators on its Statewide Suicide Prevention Awareness Conference (Spring 2018), to join the Governor's State Advisory panel on the DMHAS transition from deficit-based contracting, to Fee-for-Service (FFS) contracting, and to share with SAMHSA share their personal stories of recovery from SMI/SUD (June 21, 2018). The SMHA relies heavily on the members of the Planning Council for candid, open perspectives on lived experiences of behavioral health consumers, and their family members. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. Additionally, please complete the Advisory Council Members and Advisory Council Composition by Member Type forms.70 70There are strict state Council membership guidelines. States must demonstrate: (1) the involvement of people in recovery and their family members; (2) the ratio of parents of children with SED to other Council members is sufficient to provide adequate representation of that constituency in deliberations on the Council; and (3) no less than 50 percent of the members of the Council are individuals who are not state employees or providers of mental health services.

State Planning/Advisory Council and Input on the Mental Health/Substance Abuse Block Grant Application - Required for MHBG 1. How was the Council involved in the development and review of the state plan and report? Attach supporting documentation (e.g. meeting minutes, letters of support, etc...) The New Jersey Behavioral Health Planning Council (BHPC) / NJ Mental Health Citize ns Advisory Board (CAB) is a full partner in the development and review of the MHBG and SABG. In SFY 2019 alone, the NJ Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS), which is both the Single State Authority (SSA) for substance abuse treatment and the State Mental Health Authority (SMHA)) hosted eight separate public presentations at the meetings of the NJ Behavioral Health Planning Council on the MHBG, SABG and related topics (See below, Section III., 22.1 for detailed descriptions, and the atta ched files). Whenever possible, the SMHA/SSA reviews all its submissions (e.g., Implementation Reports and block grant applications) with the Council, prior to submission. These discussions are held in open, public meetings that are accessible both in -person and via conference call . These meetings are announced via announcements published in four major newspapers as well as on the on the state website (https://www.state.nj. us/humanservices/dmhas/home/councils/bhpc.html ). 2. Is the membership representative of the service area population (e.g. ethnic, cultural, linguistic, rural, suburban, urban, older adults, families of young children)? Yes? No? Although the BHPC is a diverse body, composed of volunteer members who represent many portions of the state, and its diverse demography, the SMHA/SAA continues to work to expand its membership to more fully include members from all parts of the state and additional ethnic, cultural and linguistic subgroups. At the July 11, 2018 meeting of the Council, the Membership Subcommittee solicited the Council members and general public for increased membership from families with young children with SED. Members of the Council indicated that soliciting voluntary participation of family members of young children with SED is especially difficult due to the fact that such families (already burdened with the standard time constraints such as work) have the added limitation of increased child care obligations directly related to their children's SED diagnoses. The SMHA/SSA (though its state partner, the NJ Department of Children and Families) can only promote and encourage participation in the Council among fa milies who have young children with SED. The efforts of the SMHA/SSA to recruit such families is listed immediately below. At its September 12, 2018 meeting, the BHPC Membership Su bcommittee reminded the Council that at least 51% of the Council must be c omposed of consumers and family members. Printed: 11/19/2020 11:04 AM - New Jersey Page 3 of 5 Printed: 11/19/2020 11:05 AM - New Jersey 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 447 of 456At the December 12, 2018 meeting of the Planning Council, the Membership Subcommittee shared its need to increase membership among family members of children with SED. In addition, it was shared that NJ Departmen t of Children and Families' (DCF), Division of the Children's System of Care (CSOC) will be reaching out to the Family Support Organizations (FSOs), Care Management Organizations (CMOs), and county - based Children's Interagency Coordinating Council (CIACCs) to actively solicit membership to the Council among families with young children with SED. Outreach will be conducte d via both mailings to families receiving services from CSOC, as well as through face -to-face interactions between CSOC staff and prospecti ve families. At the January 9, 2019 meeting of the Planning Council, the SMHA presented the BHPC with a review of the BHPC's Membership Subcommittee's efforts to soli cit membership among families with young children with Serious Emotional Di sturbances (SE D) and to solicit additional membership from consumers representing diverse and underrepresenting ethnic, linguistic, and cultural groups (e.g., distribution of an updated membership solicitation letter from the DMHAS Assistant Commissioner, dated 1/9/19). At the February 13, 2019 meeting of the BHPC the Children's System of Care reported to the Council its efforts in increasing the number of family members on the Council who have children with SED, through renewed outreach to its contracted system adminis trator.
