Now, add the touch of prioritization to it and strike a minimum of 3 tasks out of it. 2. Journal Another roadblock in meditating is your anticipatory or rumination thoughts. While your mind is busy wandering it loses its track and couldn't really meditate. The best way to acknowledge these thoughts and regain your focus is to [write them down in a journal](https://www.calmsage.com/journaling-for-mental-health/).

Just Inhale and Exhale Breathing is found to be an [effective way to clear your mind](https://www.calmsage.com/ways-to-detox-your-mind/) and meditate. Focus on your breathing pattern at this very moment. Is it rapid, erratic, and shallow (till your chest)? Or is it slow, regular, and deep (till your diaphragm)? If you chose the former option then you might be stressed and need relaxation but, if you chose the latter one then you are relaxed.

The same applies to the digital world. On the one hand, it is a great gift of technology and on the other hand, it is one of the biggest distractions that we have.

You may begin by keeping your digital screens aside first for 2 minutes and progress with each week. Also, don't forget to put your phone on silent. 5.
