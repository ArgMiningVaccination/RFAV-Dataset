This party is responsible to all aspects of the product, including quality and compliance with the conditions of marketing authorization. The authorized holder must be subjected to legislation in the country that issued the marketing authorization, which normally means being physically located in that country1 Combination Vaccine: Vaccine with more than one antigen, combined in a single injection, e.g. DPT vaccine combining diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus antigens2 Diluent: A liquid used to mix with a lyophilised (powder) vaccine in order to reconstitute the lyophilised vaccine and provide the final vaccine for administration3 Lot: A defined quantity of starting material, packaging material, or product processed in a single/ series of processes so that it is expected to be homogeneous. It may sometimes be necessary to divide a lot into a number of sub -lots, which are later accumulated to form a final homogeneous lot. In continuous manufacture, the lot must correspond to a defined fraction of the production, characterised by its intended homogeneity. The lot size can be defined either as a fixed quantity or as the amount produced in a fixed time interval4 Lot release: The process of NRA/ NCL evaluation of an individual lot of a licensed vaccine before giving approval for its releasing onto the market4 Monovalent Vaccine: A monovalent vaccine contains a single strain of a single antigen, e.g. Measles vaccine2 Non-Compliance: Failure or refusal to comply with a standard or a set of limits4 NRA/ NCL: The National Regulatory Authority/ National Control Laboratory taking the responsibility for regulatory oversight of a product for the critical regulatory functions defined by WHO, including independent lot release. Usually it is the country of manufacture unless specific Guidance Document for Lot Release of Biological Products Manufactured in Malaysia Bahagian Regulatori Farmasi Negara (NPRA) April 2021 5 agreements exist within defined territories such as in European Union where the 'country' of manufacture is the European Union and the activity of the responsible NRA/ NCL is designated from among the Member States4 Plasma: The liquid po rtion remaining after separation of the cellular elements from blood collected in a receptacle containing an anticoagulant, or separated by continuous filtration or centrifugation of anticoagulated blood in an apheresis procedure5 Plasma Derived Medicin al Products (PDMP): Any therapeutic product derived from human blood or plasma and produced by a manufacturing process that pools multiple units1 Polyvalent Vaccine: A polyvalent vaccine contains two or more strains/serotypes of the same antigen, e.g. Polio Vaccine2 Reference Country: The reference country for Malaysia is listed as per the latest version of Drug Registration Guidance Document by National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA)1 Storage Temperature: The temperature ranges for storage as stated by the manufacturer on the primary container label and the package insert and within the approved regulatory specification for the product3 Temperature Excursion: An excursion event during which a product is exposed to temperatures outside the range prescribed for storage and/or transport. Temperature ranges for storage and transport may be the same or different; they are determined by the product manufacturer based on stability data3 Vaccine: A vaccine contains an active component (the antige n). A vaccine is an immunogen, the administration of which is intended to stimulate the immune system to result in the prevention, amelioration or therapy of any disease or infection1 Guidance Document for Lot Release of Biological Products Manufactured in Malaysia Bahagian Regulatori Farmasi Negara (NPRA) April 2021 6 CONTENT Preface 2 Acronyms 3 Glossary 4 1.

GENERAL OVERVIEW As outlined in WHO guideline4, National Regulatory Authority (NRA)/National Control Laboratory (NCL) are strongly advised to oversee the quality of biological products locally produced. The recommended quality assessment of the biological products includes: a) Independent testing of biological products b) Review of manufacturers' summary protocol. When the quality of the product is proven to be consistent throughout lot release testing, NRA/NCL may consider conducting either full or selected lot release testing. This decision is made based on the nature of the product and the established experience. 2. IMPLEMENTATION OF LOT RELEASE FOR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED IN MALAYSIA NPRA will implement the Lot Release for Biological Products manufactured in Malaysia in 3 phases as elaborated in Table 1 below: Table 1: The implementation plan Phase Description Lot Release Requirement 1 1. Facility and expertise to conduct tests are not fully established in NPRA 2. Applicable to biological products during disaster, registered through fast -track conditional registration For each lot of biological product submitted for Lot Release, NPRA shall: 1. Review the lot summary protocol 2. Review the finished product test reports 3. Conduct physical tests on the finished product as follows: a) Physical appearance b) Solubility c) Particulate co ntamination (visible particles) 2 Facility and expertise to conduct tests are fully established in NPRA For each lot of biological product submitted for Lot Release, NPRA shall: 1. Review the lot summary protocol 2. Conduct physical tests on the finished product as follows: Guidance Document for Lot Release of Biological Products Manufactured in Malaysia Bahagian Regulatori Farmasi Negara (NPRA) April 2021 8 a) Physical appearance b) Solubility c) Particulate contamination (visible particles) 3. Conduct other tests deemed necessary in accordance with recommendations by the World Health Organisation (WHO) or EU Official Control Authority Batch Release (OCABR) , whichever is more stringent 3 Confirmation of the quality of the product through consistent test results for chosen parameters obtained from phase 2 For each lot of biological product submitted for Lot Release, NPRA shall: 1. Review the lot summary protocol 2. Conduct selected lot release tests from phase 2, based on a risk -based approach. Local manufacturers in Malaysia play important roles in assisting NPRA for the implementation of lot release for locally produced biological products. As outlined in WHO guideline4, manufacturers are responsible to: a) Collaborate with NPRA to develop product summary protocol template, by using relevant WHO product summary protocol template as an example b) Assist NPRA in the technical transfer of test method. The method transfer between manufacturer from country of origin/ local manufacturer and NPRA should be done at an earlier stage of product registration to ensure reproducible test method for lot release c) Provide refer ence standards, reagents, test kits or other necessary items in appropriate condition for testing d) Submit samples in an appropriate condition, including packaging and label, upon NPRA's request 3. GENERAL PROCEDURES OF LOT RELEASE FOR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS MA NUFACTURED IN MALAYSIA 3.1 Scope The scope of this guideline includes the following registered biological products for human use: a) Vaccine (for prophylaxis and treatment) Guidance Document for Lot Release of Biological Products Manufactured in Malaysia Bahagian Regulatori Farmasi Negara (NPRA) April 2021 9 b) Plasma derived medicinal product (also known as plasma product) 3.2 General Procedures i. Product Registration Holder (PRH) submits application form (refer to Appendix 1) and documents via email to NPRA ( vaccinecqc@npra.gov.my ).

Please refer to Section 9 of the guideline for further details on fees. iii. Paym ent shall be made to NPRA before NPRA starts: a. Evaluation of lot summary protocol b. Evaluation of test report (only applicable to Phase 1) c. Conducting lot release testing iv. PRH submits sample for testing to NPRA laboratory v. NPRA officers evaluate lot summary protocol, test report (only applicable to Phase 1) and conduct lot release testing. vi. NPRA will issue lot release certificates if all the requirements have been fulfilled. Please refer to Section 8 of the guideline for further details on timeline. vii. Failure to comply with Lot Release requirements will lead to issuance of Notification of Non -Compliance (NNC) and the product will be rejected. viii. In the event of non -compliance, it is the sole responsibility of the PRH to ensure proper and safe disposal of the product . A copy of disposal documentation shall be sent to NPRA within 120 days following issuance of NNC.
