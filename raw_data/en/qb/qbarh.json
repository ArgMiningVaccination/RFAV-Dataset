Welcome | 5 Office of the President As Illinois Valley Community College's tenth president, it is an honor to welcome you on behalf of our board of trustees, faculty, staff, and administration. For 98 years, IVCC has ear ned the reputation of being a high -quality teaching and learning institution. IVCC was founded as LaSalle -Peru -Oglesby Junior College in 1924 and was located at LaSalle -Peru Township High School for more than 40 years. In 1947, the Truman Commission on Higher Education recommended \"junior\" colleges become \"community\" colleges to ser ve the needs of the communities they serve. In 1967, Illinois Valley Community College opened as a comprehensive Community College offering something for everyone: adult education, developmental education, vocational and technical training leading to emplo yment, baccalaureate education for students planning to transfer to a university, workforce development, and continuing education. Throughout its storied history, IVCC has provided tremendous value at an affordable price. Holding to that tradition, we have not raised tuition the past five years. If your goal is to earn an associate degree and possibly a bachelor's degree, or a certificate leading to immediate employment, or if you are interested in taking courses only for pleasure, IVCC has a place for you. Our faculty and staff welcome the opportunity to help you achieve your goals. Take advantage of the wonderful opportunities we offer and begin your educational journey with us today. We will exceed your expectations. Sincerely, Dr. Jerry Corcoran Presiden t Welcome 6| Illinois Valley Community College College Catalog Our Mission Illinois Valley Community College provides a high -quality, accessible, and affordable education that inspires individuals and our community to thrive. Our Vision Illinois Valley Community College is the preferred gateway to advance individual and community success. Our Mission and Vision IVCC History | 7 Illinois Valley Community College has served the educational needs of its north -central Illinois district for 98 years. The second oldest public community college in the state, IVCC predecessor La Salle -Peru -Oglesby Junior College was established April 24, 1924, by action of the LaSalle -Peru Board of Education, District 120 and originally located on the third floor of LaSalle -Peru Township High School in LaSalle. The college's first day of classes was S ept. 15, 1924, when it welcomed 32 freshmen, seven faculty and two administrators. LPO's mission was to \"...lay the foundations for successful careers in vocational, social, and political fields.\" Tuition and fees totaled $16 per semester for the first ten years of its existence to enable students to bypass four costly semesters at a university. LPO's first Director, Dr. Thomas J. McCormack, a Princeton University graduate, was recognized as one of the nation's outstanding educators. The college continues t o honor his memory by nominating top students as \"McCormack Scholars.\" Francis Dolan and R. Earl Trobaugh joined the LPO teaching staff in 1932 and later served as Presidents. In 1950, the community raised enough money to send LPO's football team to the G old Dust Bowl in Vallejo, Cal. Though the team lost to California's Santa Rosa Junior College, the invitation was the athletic highlight of LPO's first 25 years. On July 1, 1966, the college name was officially changed to Illinois Valley Community College . With the new name came a new location as the campus moved across the river to Oglesby. On Oct. 21, 1967, District 513 voted 10 -1 (20,527 \"yes\" to 2,189 \"no\") in favor of an $8.25 million referendum to finance the beginning of IVCC. On Sept. 9, 1968, the first college classes convened in 12 temporary buildings on a scenic bluff overlooking La Salle - Peru and the Illinois River. While students attended the temporary buildings, a new $20 million permanent campus was being built nearby. It was officially dedi cated in October 1972. In May 1974, Dr. Alfred E. Wisgoski, an LPO alumnus, was named IVCC's seventh President, a position he held for 21 years. Dr. Wisgoski was committed to a comprehensive community college with an open -door policy. Under Dr. Wisgoski's leadership, new partnerships were built to better serve district business and industry. These partnerships and new technical programs prompted IBM to identify IVCC as a business partner in preparing manufacturing industries to convert to computer integrated assembly systems. IVCC signed a contract with IBM in 1988 that led to the corporate giant donating $1.2 million in state -of-the -art equipment to IVCC. At the time, Dr. Wisgoski said, \"This agreement guarantees IVCC will offer the ve ry best in high technology training on equipment better than that found in all but a handful of the nation's community colleges.\" Dr. Jean Goodnow was named IVCC's eighth President in 1996 and within a year a master plan for facility renovations, new construction and infrastructure upgrades was developed. In 1998, $4.2 million in Technology Funding Bonds were sold for computer networ k and telecommunications infrastructure improvements. During her tenure, the college received in excess of $15 million in grants and nine new career programs were developed. To further expand resources, a Development Office was established and the assets of the IVCC Foundation grew from $1.7 million in 1996 to $2.6 million in 2004. In the fall of 2000, IVCC opened a new Ottawa Center located in Marquette High School to better serve the students on the east side of the district. In 2003, IVCC won its third consecutive Arrowhead Conference All -Sports Award. Dr. Goodnow departed IVCC in June of 2005 for Michigan and Dr. Charles R. Novak was appointed Interim President. IVCC History 8| Illinois Valley Community College College Catalog Dr. Novak, as the former Director of Continuing Education at IVCC in the 1970s and past pr esident of two other Illinois community colleges, came out of retirement to assist the board in its search for IVCC's next president. After a nationwide search, Dr. Larry Huffman, former longtime President at Kankakee Community College, was chosen as IVCC 's ninth President beginning in July 2006. Dr. Huffman had served as IVCC's Dean of Student Development from 1974 to 1977. Upon returning to IVCC, Dr. Huffman implemented strategic planning, strengthened the college's outreach to businesses and industries , built upon IVCC's strong pre -baccalaureate reputation, enhanced career/occupational program offerings and initiated creation of the Foundation's IVCC -LPO Hall of Fame and 21st Century Scholars Society. Following Dr. Huffman's resignation in June 2007, D r. Dave Louis was appointed Interim President. Dr. Louis, retired President of Kishwaukee Community College, served IVCC until the board announced the appointment of Dr. Jerome Corcoran as President on March 18, 2008. Dr. Corcoran, promoted from Vice -Pres ident for Business Services and Finance/Treasurer, is IVCC's tenth President. Highlights of his tenure include: Construction of the 80,000 -square -foot Peter Miller Community Technology Center. The CTC project received 75 percent of its $30.5 million in funding from the state. Building the Truck Driver Training facility and Skill Path Opening the Ottawa Center satellite campus in 2010 Raising more than $4 million in private funding plus an estate bequest valued at $10 million $1 million renovatio ns of both the chemistry and biology labs Expanding partnerships with district high schools leading to more opportunities for students to earn college credit including Marquette Academy's Running Start Program.

The links below are descriptions and requirements of the IAI General Education Math and transfer degrees. It is recommended that students planning to transfer follow the requirements o f one of the following: IAI General Education Core Curriculum Credential (p. Error! Bookmark not defined. ) The Associate of Arts (A.A.) (p. Error! Bookmark not defined. ) The Associate of Science (A.S.) (p. Error! Bookmark not defined. ) The Associate in Engineering Science (A.E.S.) (p. Error! Bookmark not defined. ) List of common majors at Illinois Colleges/Universities The Associate in General Studies Degree (A.G.S) The Associate in General Studies Degree (A.G.S) (p. Error! Bookmark not defined. ) requires completion of 60 credit hours with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 and is an individualized degree that meets the needs and interests of the student. This degree allows for the combination of both transfer and career courses. While not intended to be a transfer degree, the A.G.S. degree recognizes completion of two years of college. Career Programs Career programs are designed to lead to employment after one or two years of study. Normally courses in these programs are not designed to be transferred. There are exceptions and IVCC counselors can help explain how parts or all of a career program can be transferred. IVCC offers two options within the Career Program: Associate of Applied Science (p. 45)The A.A.S. is the degree program in the career area. The A.A.S. can be completed in two years of full -time study (or longer if attending on a part -time basis). About 75 percent of the course work required for the A.A.S. is directly in the particu lar major or field of study, or very closely related to it. The remaining 25 percent of the course work is in General Education. Some IVCC degrees and certificates may lead to licensure and will be cross listed. Certificates (p. 86) Certificates are shorter career programs. Some certificates consist of as few as three courses; other advanced certificates may contain over 40 credi t hours. Most certificate programs take about one year to complete (as a full-time student). Certificate programs contain many of the same courses found in the longer A.A.S. degree programs. Some IVCC degrees and certificates may lead to licensure and will be cross listed. Licensure Programs (p. 139 ) For students wanting to take Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) and/or Emergency Me dical Responder (EMR) courses. EMT Basic and EMR courses may lead to State Certification. These do not lead to an IVCC Certificate or Associate in Applied Science. Degree and Transfer Requirements The advantages of completing the Associate Degree before transferring: 1. The agreement with most four -year colleges in Illinois allows all lower level general education classes to transfer if they follow the agreed -upon transfer guidelines. Degrees and Certificates 26| Illinois Valley Community College College Cat alog 2. Community colleges have agree ments with most state universities; students who complete the degrees of A.A., A.S. or A.E.S. will transfer their credit and typically enter the university with full junior standing. 3. Some universities accept degree benefits by allowing students to trans fer university credits back to IVCC to complete their associate degree requirements. 4. The more course work you complete prior to transfer, the less your baccalaureate degree will cost. Transfer Degree Requirements NOTE: While these degrees can be complet ed in two years, many students opt to take longer. If you are working full - time or need more developmental course work, for example, you should plan to complete your degree in more than two years. Associate in Arts and Associate in Science will satisfy low er division general education requirements for Illinois colleges and universities participating in the Illinois Articulation Initiative program.

Transfer Programs Associate of Arts and Associate of Science Associate of Arts and Associate of Science: IVCC offers a wide variety of courses specifically designed for transfer. For most college majors this enables students to complete their first two years of coursework leading toward a bachelor's degree in virtually any field of study at a four -year college or university. It is important for successful transfer to start planning immediately whe re you want to transfer and what baccalaureate degree you plan to complete. Counselors at the college are available to assist students in planning their program of study and their selection of coursework. Students who plan to complete an associate's degree and transfer as a junior in their major should achieve the following goals: 1. Complete the Associate in Arts (A.A.) or Associate of Science (A.S.) degree. The general education requirements for these degrees are on the following pages. 2. Fulfill the lo wer level (freshman/sophomore) general education and major requirement of the institution you plan to attend. The AA/AS degrees typically meet the lower level general education requirements, but your college major will determine what general education co urses you should complete. For information on college major requirements students should see a counselor and visit https://www.ivcc.edu/transferservices. Another way to meet lower level general education requirements for most Illinois colleges/universities is to complete the General Education Core Course requirements that are part of the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI). 3. When you are ready for transfer, obtain a Request for Transcript form from the Admissions/Records Office. A transcript should b e sent at the time of application and each semester of attendance before matriculation to your college/university.

Cooperative Agreements IVCC has entered into the Comprehensive Agreement Regarding the Expansion of Education Resources (CAREER) with all other community colleg e districts in the state of Illinois. This agreement allows students to attend programs in other districts if the home district does not have the career or occupational program desired by the student. A complete list of community colleges participating in this agreement is listed below. Cooperative Agreements make it possible for: Residents of the IVCC district to attend other community colleges as an in -district student to pursue a career or occupational program NOT OFFERED by IVCC and pay that college's in-district tuition rate. Students need to complete IVCC's cooperative agreement form. The form should be completed and submitted to the Office of Academic Affairs for approval at least 30 days prior to the start of the semester. The form is approved b y the Office of Academic Affairs and sent directly to the college to be attended. An approved IVCC cooperative agreement is good for one academic year. The cooperating college will issue the degree or certificate for success completion of the program of st udy. IVCC's cooperative agreement form can be found at https://www.ivcc.edu/cooperativeagreement/. IVCC has an agreement with three community colleges that the cooperative agreement can be used by the student if he or she only wants or needs to take on e course not offered by IVCC in a particular semester. The other community college's course number and title of the course should be used in place of the program on the form 144| Illinois Valley Community College College Catalog Residents of other community college districts to attend IVCC to pursue a career or occupational program NOT OFFERED by their home district community college and pay IVCC's in -district tuition rate. Students need to contact their home district community college to obtain a cooperative agreement form and adhere to that institution's guidelines for completing the form. Three community colleges have an agreement with IVCC that the cooperative agreement can be used by the student if he or she only wants or needs to take one course not offered by their home district community college in a particular semester.

Credit Hours College credit hours are earned by students when they spe nd hours learning a skill or a specific body of knowledge. At IVCC, credit hours are assigned to each course when it is developed. One credit hour is equal to one 50 -minute class \"hour\" per week for a lecture course over a sixteen -week semester. The number of credit hours assigned to a course and required for student attendance are equated, based on the length and method(s) of the course. Credit hour equivalents vary for different types of methods (lecture, lab, field experience, etc.) All courses, includin g assigned credit hours, are approved by the Illinois Community College Board. Financial Aid The Financial Aid Office Mission The Financial Aid Office serves students and families by helping them find sources of assistance that give t hem access to college. The Financial Aid Office educates people about financial aid programs, application procedures, responsible management of financial aid funds and fulfilling all responsibilities that accompany being a student, student employee or an e ducational loan borrower. Phone: (815) 224 -0438 Fax: (815) 224 -0638 Web Address: https://www.ivcc.edu/financialaid/ Overview of Services Financial Aid Advising The Financial Aid Office staff is available to answer your questions about all aspects of applyi ng for and receiving financial assistance. Students and their parents are welcome to contact us at any time. Admissions and Registration | 145 Special Financial Aid Reviews In certain cases, a financial aid application may not accurately reflect an applicant's current financial situation d ue to circumstances beyond his/her control. As a result, the Financial Aid Office may exercise \"professional judgment\" and revise an application to reflect the applicant's current financial situation. The following scenarios illustrate some special circums tances that can be addressed by the Financial Aid Office. This is not an exhaustive list. Major loss of income or benefits due to unemployment, unexpected layoff, dislocation, natural disaster, certain unexpected nondiscretionary expenses, etc. Separation or divorce after an initial financial aid application has been completed. Death of a parent or spouse after an initial financial aid application has been completed. Tuition Deferments and Bookstore Vouchers Students with financial aid, if th e amount awarded exceeds the cost of tuition and fees, are eligible to defer their tuition and may charge required books and supplies in the bookstore before financial aid funds are disbursed. Contact the Financial Aid Office or Cashier for information. What happens to Financial Aid recipients who withdraw or stop attending classes? Students who receive federal financial aid are subject to a federal regulation if they cease attending before the end of the term. This law applies in cases where a student ceases enrollment officially OR unofficially. This law is explained in the following paragraphs. Leave of Absence Students who need to request a complete withdrawal (withdrawal from all courses) may do so by using WebAdvisor or by submitting a Withdrawal F orm to the Records Office. Students who receive financial aid are strongly encouraged to contact the Financial Aid Office to determine what effect it may have on their current and future financial aid eligibility. (see Return of Title IV Funds.) Return of Title IV Funds IVCC must return financial aid funds to the Department of Education when a student stops attending before 60% of the term has been completed. If a student stops attending classes before that point in time, IVCC must return a portion of the f inancial aid because it was not \"earned.\" Because IVCC has to repay money to the federal government, the Business Office will bill the student for this amount (i.e., the balance created on the student's account once the funds have been returned by the coll ege). If this balance is not paid, the student will be prevented from registering for future classes at IVCC and a hold will be placed on the student's academic transcripts. The amount the student will owe is based on the date the student stops attending. IVCC will determine what percent of the semester has been completed. For example, if the student's tuition and fees are $800 and the student completes 25% of the semester, then IVCC must return 75% of the student's aid (= $600) to the Department of Educati on. The student will then owe $600 to IVCC for the now unpaid tuition and fees. Financial Aid Disbursements A student receiving financial aid who stops attending IVCC may also be required to return a portion of Federal Grant aid (Pell Grant or SEOG Grant ) which was paid directly to the student by IVCC. The student may be required to return a percentage of the unearned grant aid he/she received if he/she stopped attending before 60% of the term has been 146| Illinois Valley Community College College Catalog completed. Students who do not return these federal f unds will be barred from receiving further financial aid because IVCC will refer these persons to the Department of Education for debt collection. If that happens, the student will lose eligibility for financial aid at all colleges in the United States unt il he/she has either repaid the money or established a satisfactory repayment program with the Department of Education. Because this regulation is complex, you are strongly encouraged to contact the Financial Aid Office before you stop attending IVCC. Who is eligible to receive financial aid? In order to be eligible for Financial Assistance the applicant must: Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non -citizen; have a high school diploma, graduated from a Home School, or have a GED certificate; not be in defa ult on a student loan, nor have borrowed in excess of established Title IV loan limits; not owe a refund on a Federal or State grant received at any previously attended school(s); be registered with Selective Service if you are a male as required by Fe deral law; be enrolled in an associate degree program or an approved certificate program of at least 16 credit hours in length; maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress while completing a degree or certificate program (see section on Satisfactory Academ ic Progress (p. 146 )). How do I apply for financial aid? To apply for Federal and State financial aid (grants, work -study and lo ans) you must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). You can complete the FAFSA online at https://fafsa.ed.gov/. (https://fafsa.ed.gov/) Use School Code: 001705. Satisfactory Academic Progress What is satisfactory academic progress? Federal and state regulations require that Illinois Valley Community College establish and implement a standard of academic progress for students receiving financial assistance. The Satisfactory Academic Progress Pol icy applies to all IVCC students receiving federal Title IV financial aid, state aid, institutional aid, and/or military benefits. Satisfactory academic progress is measured in three ways: 1. GRADE POINT AVERAGE 2. COURSE COMPLETION RATE 3. MAXIMUM TIME FR AME TO COMPLETE PROGRAM You must satisfy all three of these standards of progress to maintain financial aid eligibility, including veteran benefits (except where noted). 1. Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement: A student must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or higher to be eligible for continued financial assistance. Incomplete (I) grades will be calculated as an 'F' until the final grade has been submitted. It is the student's Admissions and Registration | 147 responsibility to noti fy the Financial Aid Office when their final grade has been completed. Withdrawals (W) and transfer courses are not normally included in the GPA calculation. For repeated classes, all grades will be included in the GPA calculation. Students who do not have a cumulative 2.0 GPA will be put on one semester of warning, but will still receive financial aid for that semester. If a 2.0 GPA is not achieved by the end of that semester, they will be suspended and will no longer be eligible for financial aid. 2. Co urse Completion Rate: A new, continuing, or transfer student must successfully complete more than 66.67 percent of the courses attempted throughout his/her entire enrollment at IVCC. A successful completion is defined as earning a grade of 'D' or better. Withdrawals (official or unofficial), incompletes, repeated courses, developmental courses, and transfer credits are included in hours attempted. Courses completed with a passing grade and transfer courses, applicable to the student's program of study, will count as completed credit hours. Students who do not have a completion rate of more than 66.67 percent will be put on a one semester warning, but will still receive financial aid for that semester. If the required completion rate is not achieved by the en d of that semester, they will be suspended and will no longer be eligible for financial aid (Note: Illinois Veteran's Grant and Illinois National Guard Grants are exempt from course completion requirements.) 3. Maximum Timeframe to Complete Program: Studen ts may pursue completion of a degree or certificate program on a full or part -time basis, but the federal government requires that students make progress toward completion in a timely fashion. A student cannot receive financial assistance beyond the specif ied time allotted for completion of his/her program. Students maximum attempted hours of eligibility at IVCC are determined by multiplying the length of the Academic Program by 150 percent. Included in attempted hours are credit hours transferred to IVCC f rom other institutions and \"Prior\" hours attempted at IVCC, regardless of whether or not the student previously received financial aid. Examples are as follows: Associate Degree requiring 64 credit hours = 60 x 150% = 90 Maximum Credit Hours Attempted. Cer tificate Program requiring 24 credit hours = 24 x 150% = 36 Maximum Credit Hours Attempted. If financial aid is discontinued under the Maximum Timeframe Standard, special consideration may be given, through the Appeal Process, only for the following reaso ns: Students are allowed a maximum of 30 attempted hours of developmental course work in addition to the 90 Maximum Credit Hour Limit. Students who have changed majors may be granted a reasonable extension of hours provided they submit a letter from an IVCC Counselor verifying the change in major and the remaining courses required for degree completion. Students must have been meeting the required Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress prior to changing majors. The review of the Maximum Timeframe S tandard will occur at the end of each semester. Once a student reaches 150 percent of the standard program hours, financial aid will be discontinued. Important note: Students who have completed their program of study, regardless of whether they have recei ved their degree or certificate, will be considered as suspended from receiving further financial aid. Financial aid cannot pay for course work taken to meet prerequisites for a program of study at another college or university. Students who plan on pursui ng a second degree or certificate at IVCC may submit an appeal for the reinstatement of their financial aid. Evaluation and Appeal Process 148| Illinois Valley Community College College Catalog Evaluation Process: The Standards of Academic Progress tracking begins when the student attempts his/her first credi t hour course at IVCC. The evaluation process is run at the end of each academic semester. 1. Students who do not meet the cumulative 2.0 GPA and/or a completion rate of more than 66.66 percent will be placed on \"Warning Status\" for their next semester of attendance. Students will be allowed to receive financial aid during this warning period. 2. Students, who are currently on warning status and fail to meet the2.0 GPA, a completion rate of more than 66.66 percent, and/or have exceeded the 150 percent time frame, will be placed on \"Suspend Status.\" While on suspended status students may not receive any federal or state financial aid, including: grants, student loans and military benefits (an exception is made for the Illinois Veteran and National Guard Gran ts if the 2.0 GPA requirement has been met.) 3. Students who have met or exceeded the maximum program timeframe will be placed on \"Suspend Status.\" Appeal Process: Any student placed on suspend status has the right to appeal. Appeal Forms are available in the Financial Aid Office or may be printed from the Financial Aid web page. All appeals must be complete and provide detailed information about extenuating circumst ances. Extenuating circumstances include: personal illness/accident, serious illness or death within the immediate family, an auto accident or other situation beyond the reasonable control of the student. Third party documentation is required with each app eal when applicable. Documentation may include, but is not limited to, copies of medical records, accident reports, and/or letters from an IVCC counselor, work supervisor or other counselor. Appeals must be submitted prior to or during the semester for whi ch the student is seeking financial aid. Students will be notified by mail of the Standards of Academic Progress Committee's decision as promptly as possible. All appeal decisions are final. Students whose initial appeal is denied cannot submit a subseq uent appeal until successful completion of at least one additional term, in which a minimum of six credit hours have been attempted. Students may also regain good standing by completing additional semester(s) at their own expense and bringing their cumulat ive GPA and/or course completion rate up to the required standard, or, by completing 'I' grades or repeating failed courses for a higher grade. It is the student's responsibility to notify the Financial Aid Office, through an appeal, in order to have their financial aid reinstated. Students who are reinstated by the Standards of Academic Progress Committee are placed on \"Probation Status\" and are expected to meet and maintain the cumulative 2.0 GPA and a completion rate of more than 66.67 percent by the en d of the semester for which he/she was reinstated. Students who meet the standards for the reinstated term but have not been able to bring their cumulative rates up to the required standards may appeal for another semester of \"Probation Status.\" NOTE: If a student is not meeting the minimum standards of academic progress at either the time of initial application or after the warning semester and the student has shown academic improvement during the preceding term(s), the Director of Financial Aid reserves the right, on a case -by-case basis, to \"place\" or \"continue\" a student on probation. The Director also reserves the right to suspend a student without a semester of warning based on academic performance during the preceding term(s). This includes new trans fer students who failed to meet the required standards of academic progress at their previous postsecondary institution(s). While the Financial Aid Office will attempt to notify students of their warning, probation or suspended status, it is the student's responsibility to read, understand and follow the Standards of Academic Progress Policy. If you have any questions or need additional information regarding this policy or appeal procedures, please contact the Financial Aid Office, CTC -101S, (815) 224 -0438.

Employment Two different types of employment opportunities are available to IVCC students. Federal Work -Study is a federally funded financial aid employment program for students with demonstrated financial need. A va riety of on -campus jobs are offered through the Work -Study Program. Student employment enables students to earn money while attending school. All student employees at IVCC are paid the State Minimum Wage and are limited to 20 hours per week (or less) durin g enrollment periods. College employment opportunities are also available (without regard to financial need). Students interested in employment should contact the IVCC Financial Aid Office to obtain an application for employment. Applicants are not guar anteed a job but are given equal consideration for positions that are open. Loans for Students Stafford Loans: Stafford Loans are either subsidized or unsubsidized. A subsidized loan is awarded on the basis of financial need. You will not be charged any interest during periods of enrollment. The federal government \"subsidizes\" the interest during these periods. An unsubsidized loan is not awarded on the basis of need. You'll be charged interest from the time the loan is disbu rsed until it is paid in full. If you allow the interest to accumulate, it will be capitalized - that is, the interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan and additional interest will be based upon the higher amount. This will increase the a mount you have to repay. If you choose to pay the interest as it accumulates, you'll repay less in the long run. You can receive a subsidized loan and an unsubsidized loan for the same enrollment period. If you're a dependent undergraduate student at IVCC, you can borrow up to $5,500 if you're a first -year student enrolled in a program of study that is at least a full academic year ($3,500 of this amount may be in a subsidized loan; the remainder will be unsubsidized); $6,500 if you've completed your first year of study and the remainder of your program is at least a full academic year ($4,500 of this amount may be in a subsidized loan; the remainder will be unsubsidized). If you're an independent undergraduate student or a dependent student whose parents ar e unable to get a PLUS Loan (see the following), you can borrow up to $9,500 if you're a first -year student enrolled in a program of study that is at least a full academic year ($3,500 of this amount may be in a subsidized loan; the remainder will be unsub sidized); $10,500 if you've completed your first year of study and the remainder of your program is at least a full academic year ($4,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans; the remainder will be unsubsidized). Admissions and Registration | 151 These are the maximum amounts that you can borrow for a full academic year. For periods of study that are shorter than an academic year, the maximum amounts you can borrow may be less. The Financial Aid Office will determine the specific amount that you are eligible to borrow. The Financial Aid Office has the right to refuse certification of a student loan or may reduce the amount requested. Students will be sent written notification of the denial or reduction and the reason why this action was taken. Parent Loan for Undergradua te Students (PLUS) PLUS Loans enable parents with good credit histories to borrow to pay the education expenses of each child who is a dependent undergraduate student enrolled at least half time. To be eligible to receive a PLUS Loan, your parents generall y will be required to pass a credit check. The yearly limit on a PLUS Loan is equal to your cost of attendance minus any other financial aid you receive. For example, if your cost of attendance is $6,000 and you receive $4,000 in other financial aid, your parents could borrow up to - but no more than $2,000.

Grading System A = Excellent -4 grade poin ts per each semester hour B = Good -3 grade points C = Average -2 grade points D = Passing, Below Average -1 grade point F = Failing -0 grade point P = Passing -credit earned only, not computed in grade point average 156| Illinois Valley Community College College Catalog I = Incomplete -temporary grade assigned when a small portion of the class remains to be completed. Assigned for extenuating circumstances. Must eventually be replaced by a letter grade (A through F above). W = Withdrawn -not computed in the grade point average Computing your Grade Point Average The formula for computing the GPA is: Total grade points earned \u00f7 total hours attempted = GPA Example: Student attempts 9 semester hours (three courses) and earns grades of A, B, D respectively. 24 grade points (12 for 3 semester hours of A, 9 for 3 hours of B and 3 for 3 hours of D) \u00f7 9 total semester hours attempted = 2.666 GPA A GPA of 2.0 and above is considered Good Academic Standing Pass/Fail Grade Students enrolling in certain designated cour ses may elect a pass/fail option. Students electing this option must declare their intent at the time of registration. No more than 12 semester hours earned in pass/fail courses are applicable to a degree and no more than three semester hours earned are ap plicable toward a certificate offered by the college. Grade of \"Incomplete\" \"Incomplete\" is a temporary grade assigned when illness, unavoidable absence, or other reasons satisfactory to the instructor prevent completion of th e course requirements by the end of the semester. A grade of \"INC\" must be removed as designated by the instructor, but not later than the last class day of the semester following the issuance of the incomplete, excluding Summer semester. If the incomplete is not made up within the allotted time, the grade for the course is changed to an F, or failing grade. Questions about incompletes should be directed to the Office of Admissions and Records. Veterans must make up incomplete grades promptly to insure cont inued receipt of G.I. Bill benefits. Questions about the impact on veteran benefits should be directed to the Financial Aid Office. Withdrawal from Classes Rationale : The purpose of the withdrawal option is to allow students to make responsible decisions regarding their academic status and their ability to complete an individual course. This responsibility is similar, and thus preparatory, to students' experiences in universities and the workforce. It is understood that for t hem to make informed decisions regarding their academic careers, students must have the appropriate information regarding their status. It is the instructor's responsibility, therefore, to provide students with some form of assessment of their academic sta tus prior to the last official withdrawal date. All withdrawals earn a grade of \"W,\" which does not affect the GPA but deletes the course credit(s) for the involved course(s). No refund is given for withdrawals. Procedure for Student Withdrawal: 1. Stu dents have until the end of the twelfth week of a regular 16 -week semester course (or an equivalent length of Admissions and Registration | 157 time in courses of different lengths) to request a withdrawal. 2. Students who wish to withdraw from a course can withdraw in person in the Office of Admissions and Records or online through WebAdvisor. 3. In person withdrawals will require a photo ID and the withdrawal to be signed by the student. No instructor or dean signature will be needed. The yellow copy of the withdrawal will be forwarded to the instructor upon processing of the withdrawal. 4. Online withdrawals will require full course information provided, as well as the Student ID number to serve as the student's signature.
