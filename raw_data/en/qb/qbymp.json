In this system, the human organism is viewed as a whole, inseparable from its organs and organ systems. All tangible life forms contain five essential elements or building blocks, ether, air, fire, water and earth. In every living being the five elements of the universe combine to give three distinct individual constitutions called doshas: Ether and air compose the Vata dosha, responsible for gastrointestinal and water compose the Pitta dosha (internal fire- digestion, body heat). Water and earth compose the Kapha mucous, tendons, synovial fluid). Each individual is a combination of the three doshas. However one is typically dominant. The Ayurvedic approach to healing is threefold: - Determining one's predominant constitution of Prakruti. - Determining the Vikruti, the root cause of illness (which doshas are imbalanced) - Applying therapeutic recommendations to balance elements causing the illness.
