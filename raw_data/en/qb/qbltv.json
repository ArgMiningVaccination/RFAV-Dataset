Functional medicine uses the latest scientific research about how our genetics, environment and lifestyle all interact with each other. Functional medicine focuses assessment and intervention at the root levels of metabolic imbalance and is an evolution that addresses the healthcare needs of the 21st century by focusing on prevention and uncovering the underlying causes of serious chronic disease. Instead of just suppressing symptoms, it deals with the root causes of illness and is less concerned with making a diagnosis and more concerned with the underlying imbalances, which are the mechanisms of the illness process. Homeopathy Homeopathy is alternative medicine on the offense. While we speak of Functional Medicine as balancing the whole person and bringing into focus the prevention and resolution of many issues, many acute and chronic complaints respond well to [homeopathic remedies](../health-and-wellness/homeopathic-remedies.html). These remedies are highly personalized with proven results. For additional information [ click here](../health-and-wellness/homeopathic-remedies.html). Why Do We Need Functional Medicine? ** Unfortunately, the acute-care approach to medicine lacks the proper methodology and tools for preventing and treating complex, chronic disease. - Sharp increase of complex, chronic illnesses. - Our society is experiencing a sharp increase in the number of people who suffer from complex, chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, mental illness, and autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis. - Most physicians practice acute care medicine. - The system of medicine practiced by most physicians is oriented toward acute care, the diagnosis and treatment of trauma or illness that is of short duration and in need of urgent care, such as appendicitis or a broken leg. - Huge gap between research and the way doctors practice. - The gap between emerging research in basic sciences and integration into medical practice is enormous\u2014as long as 50 years\u2014 particularly in the area of complex, chronic illness. - Most physicians are not adequately trained. - Most physicians are not adequately trained to assess the underlying causes of complex, chronic disease and to apply strategies such as nutrition, diet, and exercise to both treat and prevent these illnesses in their patients. How are we different? We look for the origins, prevention, and balancing of complex, chronic illness. We provide the hallmarks of functional medicine which include: - Individual personalized care. - The focus of functional medicine is on centered care, promoting health as a positive vitality, beyond just the absence of illness. - An integrative, science-based healthcare approach. - Functional medicine practitioners look \"upstream\" to consider the complex web of interactions in the patient's history, physiology, and lifestyle that can lead to illness. The unique genetic makeup of each patient is considered, along with both internal (mind, body and spirit) and external (physical and social environment) factors that affect total functioning. - Integration of care. - Functional medicine focuses on prevention through nutrition, diet, and exercise; We use the latest technology of bioenergy assessment which is painless and can be used in all ages. We then apply proven remedies of botanical medicines, supplements, therapeutic diets, detoxification programs, or stress-management techniques to balance the stressed areas. "}
