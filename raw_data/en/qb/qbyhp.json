How Supplements Support Immune Health There are many ways to improve your body's immune system. Experts recommend reducing stress as it suppresses the body's immune response through the release of cortisol which interferes with T-cell production. Many also suggest moderating your alcohol consumption. Too much alcohol tampers with the body's immune system pathway. Vitamin C is an essential micronutrient that plays a vital role in immunity. Vitamin C is water-soluble with antioxidant properties that enhances immune cell function. Those who are low or deficient in Vitamin C can experience impaired immune functions and are at a higher risk to infections. Vitamin C also plays a vital role in healing wounds, keeping bones strong, and helping ensure optimal brain function. While Vitamin C is abundant in many fresh fruits and vegetables like pineapples, oranges, and broccoli, many of us may not be getting the proper amount of vitamins through the food we consume. The body also does not store Vitamin C. We take Vitamin C to ensure sufficient collagen during the seasonal attacks we endure, including flu and related infectious viruses. Collagen is the \"glue\" that holds us together and gives cells their resilience and integrity. If an invading pathogen is bounced off, it then has no access to the cytoplasm and the cell nucleus. Another way to improve the condition of our immune system is by making sure we get enough Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids. Omega 3 and Omega 6 are a type of polyunsaturated fat the body is not capable of making on its own. Omega 3s help fight inflammation in the body while Omega 6s are a proinflammatory. In order to keep the body healthy and in balance, it's recommended to take a 4:1 (Omega 6 to Omega 3) ratio of these fatty acids. Those who don't have the proper amounts of essential fatty acids in their bodies can experience gastrointestinal disorders as well as heart and circulatory problems. Help balance your essential fatty acid intake with supplements such as Balance Oil. "}
