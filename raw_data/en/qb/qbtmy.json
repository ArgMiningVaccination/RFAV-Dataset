PROJECT DESCRIPTION A. Executive Summary of the Project : The purpose of this BRIEF executive summary is to convey to the reader a holistic understanding of the proposed project: what it is, why you need to do it, and what it will cost. A one- page response will suffice. Please include: (1) Brief Description of the project - what the appl icant proposes to do (2) Rationale for the project - the need and/or business case for the proposed project (3) Cost - the total cost of implementing the proposed project Applicant Response: 4620 Melwood Road OPCO, LLC proposes to establish an alcohol and drug abuse intermediate care facility in Prince George's County, Maryland. The proposed facility will include 55 Detox / Assessment beds subject to a Certificate of Need review pursuant to COMAR \u00a7 10.24.14. Applicant expects to license these beds as American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) level III.7D - Medically Monitored Inpatient Detoxification. 1 Patients in the detoxification program will undergo a comprehensive medical and psychosocial evaluation and will receive detoxification services including medications to ensure a medically safe withdrawal. Patients will be closely monitored 24 hours a day by medical and nursing staff. The proposed facility will also include 70 residential beds that Applicant expects to license as ASAM level III.5 - Clinically Managed High -Intensity Residential Treatment. 2 Patients in the residential program will receive intensive, structured, multi -disciplinary treatment 24 hours a day provided by clinical, nursing and medical st aff. 1 COMAR \u00a7 10.47.02.09 defines a level III.7.D program as \" [a] medically monitored intensive inpatient treatment program\" that shall : (1) [o]ffer a planned regimen of 24- hour professionally directed evaluation, care, and treatment in an inpatient setting; (2) [a]ct as an Intermediate Care Facility Type C/D; and (3) [m]eet the certification requirements for detoxification services as described in COMAR 10.47.02.10E. \" Id. at .09(A). Patients appropriate for this level of care \"(1) Meet the current edition of the American Society of Addiction Medicine P atient Placement Criteria for Level III.7, or its equivalent as approved by the Administration; and (2) [r]equire 24- hour monitoring and care for subacute biomedical and emotional or behavioral conditions severe enough to warrant inpatient treatment.\" Id. at .09(B). ASAM defines Level III.7 Services as \"Medically Monitored High- Intensity Inpatient Services,\" and described as \"24- hour nursing care with physician availability for significant problems in Dimensions 1, 2, or 3. 16 hour/day counsel ability.\" The ASAM Criteria: Treatment for Addictive, Substance- related, and Co- occurring Conditions, Third ed., Ch. 3, Ed. David Mee -Lee, American Society of Addiction Medicine, 2013. Dimension 1 is defined as \"Acute Intoxication and/or Withdrawal Potential;\" Dimension 2 is defined as \"Biomedical Conditions and Complications\"; Dimension 3 is defined as \"Emotional, Behavioral or Cognitive Conditions and Complications.\" Id., Ch. 7. 2 COMAR \u00a7 10.47.02.09 defines a level III.5 program as \" [a] clinically managed high intensity residential program\" that shall \"(1) [p]rovide a highly structured environment in combination with moderate to high intensity treatment and ancillary services to support and promote recovery; and (2) [b] e characterized by its reliance on the treatment community as a therapeutic agent.\" Id. at .08(A). Patients appropriate for this level of care \"meet the current edition of the American Society of Addiction Medicine Patient Placement Criteria for Level III.5, or its equival ent as approved by the Administration.\" The ASAM Criteria, Ch. 3. ASAM defines Level III.5 Services as \"C linically Managed High Intensity Residential Services,\" described as \" 24 hour care with trained counselors to stabilize multidimensional imminent danger and prepare for outpatient treatment. Able to tolerate and use full active milieu or therapeutic community.\" Id., Ch. 7. 6 Thousands of Maryland residents who are suffering from addiction need treatment today. Relying on data from Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH), the Washington Post reported that \"Heroin- related deaths in Maryland spiked 88 percent from 2011 to 2013 . . . and intoxication overdoses of all types now outnumber homicides in the state.\" See Exhibit 4. Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, former DHMH Secretary, has remarked \"Overdose is a public - health crisis in Maryland, as it is in many states...and we are bringing everything we can to bear against this challenge.\" Id. Maryland's existing portfolio of treatment facilities cannot begin to solve this problem. The most recently approved CON for bed expansion at Father Martin's Ashley, dated September 19, 2013, noted need for 107 to 152 Private ICF/CD beds for the Central Maryland Region alone. Additionally, Applicant's calculations indicate a need for new ICF treatment beds in the range of 450 to 598, using 2014 population data, and 471 to 624 using projected 2019 population data. The Southern Maryland Region has a net bed need of 99 to 120 using 2014 population data, and 104 to 126 using 2019 projected population. Applicant, together with its investors, is prepared to devote significant financial and clinical resources to not only developing the facility and treatment regimens, but to providing education and support to its surrounding communities. The total project c ost is $21,019,435. Because Applicant will fund the project entirely through private channels , rather than seek state or local, or charitable funding, this cost represents a significant gain to the State and its efforts to combat the current addiction cri ses. B. Comprehensive Project Description: The description should include details regarding: (1) Construction, renovation, and demolition plans (2) Changes in square footage of departments and units (3) Physical plant or location changes (4) Changes to affected services following completion of the project (5) Outline the project schedule. Applicant Response: I. THE RECOVERY CENTERS OF AMERICA 4620 MELWOOD ROAD FACILITY A. The 4620 Melwood Road Facility The site consists of approximately 68 acres fronting on Melwood Road in rural Prince George' s County Maryland, p roximate to Andrews Air force Bas e. The facility consists of a main building and one ancillary building to be used for a fitness cent er. \"German Protestant Orphan Asylum Association of the District of Columbia\" constructed the main building in 1965 and graduated their last class in 1978. Specifically designed for their purpose, the building was suited for juvenile communal living quarters in the mid -century. At some point thereafter, Second Genesis ran an addiction recovery operation at the site. While the building was constructed with quality materials and has been well maintained, it exhibits significant functional obsolescence related to the proposed clinical program. Examples of such functional obsolescence include the following features of the current building: 7 The wings are positioned between the first and second floors similar to a split level house. Traffic flow between floors is much less than optimal; Bathrooms are centrally located and must be repositioned to allow better access from all patient rooms; The building is built into the side of a hill, and due to the depth of the building, the back portion is not useable. To address the functional obsolescence of the main building to accommodate the needs of the clinical staff and patients, Applicant plans to raze the main building and construct a new facility that is designed from the inside out to accommodate these needs. The ancillary building was constructed as a gym and will be used by the applicant as a fitness center and will also be used from time to time for various self -help groups. Construction is scheduled to begin early spring 2016, and will be completed in the fall of 2016. The total size of the facility will be approximately 74 ,000 square feet. Once complete the facility will include a fitness area where patients may participate in program offerings such as personal training, yoga and/or dance therapy. The prototype was designed for unique group spaces, such as a Starbucks -like caf\u00e9, and offers several meeting spaces in comfort settings. B. Recovery Centers of America Recovery Centers of America (\"RCA\") will be the operator of the facility under an arrangem ent with Applicant, the proposed licensee. RCA is a privately held company that will provide services for individuals with substance use disorder and their families. The RCA Executive Team represents an average of 22 years of experience managing facilities that treat up to 40,000 individuals daily. The Executive Team's experience is in the following sectors: Residential and Outpatient Treatment Facilities Acute Care Hospitals Behavioral Health Services Academic Research Governmental Drug Policy Initiatives RCA has developed a continuum of care model that is tailored to the unique needs of each patient and their families. The proposed project mission is to provide neighborhood -based, world class treatment with immediate solutions and a commitment to supportin g lifelong recovery. RCA will offer clinical excellence to its patients, family, alumni, and the larger community through a continuum of care. RCA's model will include the following services, as the market demands: Residential/Inpatient Treatment Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP) Intensive Outpatient (IOP) Traditional Outpatient (OP) Family Therapy Support Groups (AA/NA/12- Step Groups) Community Groups 8 Spiritual Services Contact Center RCA plans to utilize a technologically advanced, scientific treatment approach. RCA will treat everyone who walks through the doors of its state- of-the-art facilities with respect and dignity. RCA employees truly care about the recovery of patients and will provide the quality communication, long- term monitoring, and accountability. II. RCA' S TALENTED WORKFORCE A. RCA Chief Clinical Officer RCA's clinical care will be overseen by Deni Carise, Ph.D., Chief Clinical Office r for all RCA facilities. Dr. Carise, a clinical psychologist, will live at each RCA facility f or the month prior to and following the facility's opening, and will remain involved in each RCA facility after opening, setting standards for clinical care, measuring effectiveness, and being available to the RCA staff. Dr. Carise has worked in the field of substance abuse and behavioral healthcare, as a researcher and clinician, for more than 28 years . She has extensive personal knowledge, know -how, and experience with regard to the types of activities she will be undertaking for RCA.

Top innovators : Tom McLellan, Herbert Kleber, Amelia Arria, Charles O'Brien, Maxine Stitzer, Kathy Carroll, Bill Miller, William White, Kathleen Brady, Rick Rawson, Lisa Marsch . III. TREATMENT AND PROGRAMMING A. Approach to Treatment and Recovery Getting a patient into treatment has historically been difficult and included numerous break -points or times when the patient finds it easier to walk away from treatment than to engage in or continue treatment. Some of these breakpoints include: The inability to identify the correct program ; The inability to find quality treatment close to home; Treatment programs that do not answer phones or return calls ; Difficulty identifying if the treatment provider accepts their health insurance; Lack of immediate transportation to the program ; and Difficulty transitioning from residential to a new outpatient treatment center . RCA insists on having a full continuum of care at its facilities . The National Institute on Drug Abuse - Principles of Drug Addiction Treatment: A Research Based Guide (Third Edition) (\"NIDA Guide\"), reports that good outcomes are contingent on adequate treatment length . Exhibit 6 at p. 12. One of the most common break -points or times when patients leave treatment occurs when they need to transition from one facility to another , such as from residential to intensive outpatient or step -down care. If a patient has to devel op new treatment relationships and start over in a new system with new peers, they rarely show up for the next, lower level of services. However, it the pati ent gets that service in the same system, or better yet, the same place, where the patient received residential care, the patient is more to continue in treatment and recovery. The NIDA Guide remarks: Individuals progress through drug addiction treatment at various rates, so there is no predetermined length of treatment. However, research has shown unequivocally that good outcomes are contingent on adequate treatment length. Generally, for residential or outpatient treatment, participation for less than 90 days is of limited effectiveness, and treatment lasting significantly longer is recommended for maintaining positive outcomes. For methadone maintenance, 10 12 months is considered the minimum, and some opioid- addicted individuals continue to benefit from methadone maintenance for many years. Treatment dropout is one of the major problems encountered by treatment programs; therefore, motivational techniques that can keep patients engaged will also improve outcomes. By viewing addiction as a chronic disease and offering continuing care and monitoring, programs can succeed, but this will often require multiple episodes of treatment and readily readmitting patients that have relapsed. Exhibit 6 at p. 12. RCA will give patients the highest likelihood of making th e 90-day mark and increasing positive long -term outcomes. In an effort to create a program where patients will have better treatment outcomes and better enable patients to have a meaningful, continued recovery, RCA will: Eliminate breakpoints for getting patients into treatment ; Have a full continuum of care to extend gains made in all levels of treatment ; Deliver services by highly trained, educated staff ; Utilize evidence- based / best practices ; Involve the family and other support systems ; Provide indi vidualized, tailored treatment including treatment plans, services, etc. ; and Measure success rates . In addition, RCA will participate in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network (CTN). In the CTN, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, treatment researchers, and community -based service providers cooperatively develop, validate, refine, and deliver new treatment options to patients in treatment. Members of RCA's leadership have long- standing involvement in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network. B. Clinical Programming RCA Clinical Programming will include common elements for all patients, but will also allow each patient to develop special services that are unique to his or her needs and interests. Examples of planned programming within the Clinical Services are: Individual Therapy Lectures/Workshops Small Groups (Primary Group Therapy, Gender groups, LGBT) Psychodrama Creative Art Therapies (Art, Dance, Music) Recreation Therapies (Challenge/Ropes Course) Stress Management Body/Central Nervous System Management (Meditation, Yoga, Progressive relaxation) Clinical programming at RCA will be comprised of scientifically proven effective practices, known as Evidence- Based Practices (EBPs). EBPs examine reasons why specific 11 procedures, treatments and medicine are given in an effort to meet two important goals: providing the most effective treatments and ensuring patient safety. RCA's clinical programming will consist of EBPs registered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Registry of Evidence- based Programs and Practices (NREPP), including: Motivational Interviewing (Wm . Miller/MINT model) Toolkit and 12-Step Facilitation (Proj ect Match, TRI Toolkit) Dialectical Behavior Therapy (U niversity of Wash ington Model) Cognitive Behavioral Therapies Behavioral Couples Therapy (Harvard University Model) The Matrix Model (selected sites) Trauma -Support Therapies (Boston, HWR & Seeking Safety) Supportive- Expressive Psychotherapy ( University of Pennsylvania Model) Social Skills Training (T exas Christian University Model) C. Patient Treatment Path RCA will provide the following support and services to patients as they engage on their path to treatment and rehabilitation. 1. Contact Center RCA will operate 24/7, 365 day a year Contact Center , through which individuals can access services by calls, texts, web chat , or emails. The Contact Center will be available to all Marylanders without limitation. Based on inquiries and medical necessity, every inbound contact will be assessed and referred within a close proximity to assure accessibility. RCA is in the process of obtaining referral agreements in the state of Maryland within a 30 mile radius that include but are not limited to residential, both inpatient and outpatient, sober living, half way houses, and other support groups related to addiction services. The Contact Center will be an asset t o individuals and entities that will be available 24/7 with access to professionals trained and knowledgeable in regard to its callers and access to neighborhood resources. It will also offer insurance advocacy, and will be dedicated and committed to helpi ng anyone who suffers from the disease of addiction. The Contact Center will be staffed with RCA Care Advocates - clinically trained counselors who will specialize in assisting individuals navigate through the barriers to treatment. Care Advocates will act as a liaison for the patient, patient's family , and loved ones. Care Advocates will also verify insurance benefits and obtain authorization and case manage all inbound contacts regardless of their ability to pay. Care Advocates will dispatch Interventi onists and transportation to an RCA facility if appropriate, and refer patients to appropriate levels of care based on medical necessity. Referrals will include, but will not be limited to, RCA facilities, RCA partners and any other resources available to meet the caller's needs. RCA will place patients into meaningful recovery in their own neighborhoods, regardless of insurance or economic barriers. The Contact Center will have full integration of all RCA systems, i ncluding its CRM (Salesforce), t elephonic system and EMR (electronic medical record system). The integration of RCA systems is mission critical and will allow RCA Care Advocates to see real time facility data, the location of the individual who is calling in, and any history of the caller if t hey have called 12 RCA before. This will allow for seamless transition of patient information when the patient is admitted into an RCA treatment program. RCA will have a robust database with a variety of treatment options, support groups, and educational inf ormation to meet our customers' every need. 2. Intervention RCA's team of trained Interventionists will conduct an intervention on- site or in a patient's home when needed. The Interventionist will facilitate the intervention from start to finish. They will arrange the intervention, prepare the family and friends, and lead the discussions during the intervention. The Interventionist will then prepare a clinical assessment, address payment options, accompany the patient to the treatment program, provide transportation via black car service if needed, and provide family counseling to begin the healing process for the patient and their loved ones. 3. Detoxification Upon admission, all patients will undergo a comprehensive medical evaluation. When medically indicat ed, patients will receive detoxification services , including medications to ensure a medically safe withdrawal and help ease the pain associated with withdraw symptoms. Patients are closely monitored 24 hours a day by physicians and other medical staff. The second goal of Detoxification is to ensure transition into the next level of care - residential or some form of outpatient. Detoxification alone is never considered a full course of treatment. 4. Inpatient/Residential Treatment Intensive, structured res idential care will be available. A patient's care will begin with a series of medical and clinical assessments, the results of which will be used to determine the patient's schedule, services and length of stay. Patients will be actively engaged in clinical services from 7:30 AM to 9:30 PM every day. Patient services include: daily group therapy and education seminars; individual therapy sessions one or two times per week; family program along with family and couples counseling; m ultiple choices for patient to select types of additional services such as a rt therapy, music therapy, relapse prevention. Some of these programs will be required, and some will be elective. 5. Partial Hospitalization/Day Program (PHP) RCA will provide PHP s ervices to individuals needing extended daily treatment in an outpatient setting. Clinical programming for PHP occupies 20 hours per week and includes the following: Daily group therapy and educational seminars, weekly individual therapy sessions, bi - weekl y family therapy sessions, and psychiatric and medical services available as need. 6. Intensive Outpatient (IOP) The RCA IOP treatment model will provide primary, organized treatment program to patients who are able to establish abstinence and recovery within the context of their usual daily activities. Treatment consists of educational and group therapy sessions thr ee days per week, three hours per day. It also includes ongoing individual, family and couples therapy sessions. Psychiatric and medical services are available as needed. 13 7. Traditional Outpatient Treatment (OP) The RCA OP treatment model will include indivi dual, family, couples and group counseling. Patients likely will attend one to three times a week in 45- 90 minute sessions. Psychiatric and medical services will be available as needed. 8. Recovery Support Services RCA will offer Recovery Support Services ( RSS) that are designed and delivered by people who have experienced both substance use disorder and recovery. RSS will help people become and stay engaged in the recovery process, reduce the likelihood of relapse, and focus on strength and resilience. The four major types of RSS are: (1) peer mentoring or coaching, (2) recovery resource connecting, (3) facilitating and leading recovery groups, and (4) building community. Examples of RSS include but are not limited to: peer -led support groups, parenting classes, Job Readiness training, assistance accessing community health and social services, alcohol - and drug -free social events and opportunities. 9. Concurrent Recovery Monitoring Concurrent Recovery Monitoring (CRM) will provide patients monthly support for one year post -discharge from a RCA residential treatment program. Based on chronic disease medical models, CRM will provide clinically -relevant evaluation and recovery support for the patient. The monthly evaluation will include a standardized assessment of physical and behavioral health, societal/familial function, reduction in substance use and cravings. Based on the patient's assessment response, the counselor will: Provide recommendations for continuing care, such as outpatient treatment. Connect patient to support groups in the local area Provide accountability and recovery support 10. Post -Treatment Alumni Services RCA's Alumni Program is built on the foundation that offering continued support for those in recovery is a necessary service. The program will provide patients with the necessary support and resources to maintain sobriety close to home. The services will offer patients and their families a safe environment where they can come to talk, build relationships, attend Recovery Support Meetings, receiv e continued education, participate in fun events and activities, and more. RCA Alumni Program Activities will include Sober Events, 12- Step Meetings, cookouts, group activities such as hiking trips, family activities, and fundraising events. D. Elective Patient and Community Programming RCA will provide educational, spiritual, and community support programming to its patients, some of which will be available to the surrounding community. 1. Self-Help Groups Also known as mutual help, mutual aid, or support groups, these groups will be comprised of people who share a common problem or addiction and provide mutual support to help each other to cope with and heal or recover from, their problems. RCA will provide space 14 on the grounds of its programs for numerous self -help groups to meet on a regular basis. Patients can attend these meetings before, during , and after their treatment to help develop their support network and provide the highest likelihood of maintaining recovery. Examples of Mutual or Self -Help Groups include: Alcoholics Anonymous, Cocaine Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Secular Organization for Sobriety, SMART Recovery, Adult Children of Alcoholics, Al-Anon, Alateen, Debtors Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Emotions Anonymous, and Overeaters Anonymous. 2. Spiritual Services All RCA Treatment Programs will have spiritual staff dedicated to helping others find recovery. These staff may be from any one of a number of various religious affiliations, with the common their belief that any spiritual basis can be of help in the maintenance and continuation of a rewarding life in recovery. Part of their job will be to provide services for RCA patients, family, staff, alumni , and anyone the community who may be at tracted to our particular blend of spiritual services that include exceptional discussions and musical performances amid prayer and meditation. 3. Speaker Series The RCA Speaker Series serves will provide information and opportunity for dialogue to the local community, families of patients, alumni and professionals. Speakers will include RCA employees, researchers and other experts in the field. Topics may include but are not limited to: o What To Do If You Suspect A Loved One Is Abusing Drugs o Does Treatment Fo r Substance Use Disorder Work?

An application for a Certificate of Need shall be evaluated according to all relevant State Health Plan standards and other review criteria. If a particular standard or criteria i s covered in the response to a previous standard or criteria, the applicant may cite the specific location of those discussions in order to avoid duplication. When doing so, the applicant should ensure that the previous material directly pertains to the requirement and to the directions included in this applicat ion form.

THE STATE HEALTH PLAN . Every applicant must address each applicable standard in the chapter of the State Health Plan for Facilities and Services3. Commission staff can help guide applicants to the chapter(s) that applies to a particular proposal. Please provide a direct, concise response explaining the project's consistency with each standard. Some standards require specific documentation (e.g., pol icies, certifications) which should be included within the application as an exhibit . THE STATE HEALTH PLAN FOR FACILITIES AND SERVICES: ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG ABUSE INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITY TREATMENT SERVICES. 10.24.14.05 Certificate of Need Approval Rules and Review Standards for New Substance Abuse Treatment Facilities and for Expansions of Existing Facilities .05A. Approval Rules Related To Facility Size. Unless the applicant demonstrates why a relevant standard should not apply, the following standards apply to applicants seeking to establish or to expand either a Track One or a Track Two intermediate care facility. (1) The Commission will approve a Certificate of Need application for an intermediate care facility having less than 15 beds only if the applicant dedicates a special population as defined in Regulation .08. (2) The Commission will approve a Certificate of Need application for a new intermediate care facility only if the facility will have no more than 40 adolescent or 50 adult intermediate care faci lity beds, or a total of 90 beds, if the applicant is applying to serve both age groups. 3 Copies of all applicable State Health Plan chapters are available from the Commission and are available on the Commission's w eb site here: http://mhcc.maryland.gov/mhcc/pages/hcfs/hcfs_shp/hcfs_shp . 22 (3) The Commission will not approve a Certificate of Need application for expansion of an existing alcohol and drug abuse intermediate care facility if its approval w ould result in the facility exceeding a total of 40 adolescent or 100 adult intermediate care facility beds, or a total of 140 beds, if the applicant is applying to serve both age groups. Applicant Response Only Standard .05A(2) applies to the proposed f acility. Applicant is seeking Commission approval to establish a new Track One intermediate care facility located in the Southern Maryland region. The new Track One intermediate care facility will serve only adult patients. The proposed facility will in clude 55 Detox / Assessment beds subject to a Certificate of Need review pursuant to COMAR \u00a7 10.24.14, and an additional 70 adult rehabilitation beds. The proposed new adult intermediate care beds exceed the standard of 50 noted in subpart (2). An in termediate care facility of this size has the patient volume and revenue stream that can support additional that staff would be difficult to attract and fund at smaller sites. For example, the facility's expected patient volume will enable Applicant to more easily attract and support a full-time Site Medical Director, who would be more difficult to find, financially support and provide enough clinical need for a smaller site. This is a crucial component of care at the facility as it creates a position for someone who will take ownership of all medical services and direct the team in this delivery of care. The facility size also allows Applicant to offer additional clinical programming and enhanced clinical staff coverage, which has a high labor cost, than Applicant could offer at a smaller scale facility. In addition, the size of the proposed project also allow s Applicant to have one or more full-time Psychiatrists , creating capability of having extended psychiatry coverage for all patients as well as the assurance that when a psychiatrist takes vacation, there will be others to work with patients. The project size is also reasonable in light of the extreme need for treatment beds in Maryland. Applicant's calculations indicate a need for new ICF treatment beds in the range of 450 to 598, using 2014 population data, and 471 to 624 using projected 2019 population data. The Southern Maryland Region has a net bed need of 99 to 120 using 2014 population data, and 104 to 126 using 2019 projected population. Furthermore, based on the facility catchment area, Applicant expects that only 25 of its detox / assessment beds will be used to serve Maryland patients by year 2019. Please see Applicant's response to Standard .05B for a greater discussion of the overal l bed need in the jurisdiction, and in the state of Maryland. .05B. Identification of Intermediate Care Facility Alcohol and Drug Abuse Bed Need. (1) An applicant seeking Certificate of Need approval to establish or expand an intermediate care facility for substance abuse treatment services must apply under one of the two categories of bed need under this Chapter: 23 (a) For Track One, the Commission proj ects maximum need for alcohol and drug abuse intermediate care beds in a region using the need projection methodology in Regulation .07 of this Chapter and updates published in the Maryland Register . (b) For Track Two, as defined at Regulation .08, an applicant who proposes to provide 50 percent or more of its patient days annually to indigent and gray area patients may apply for: (i) Publicly -funded beds, as defined in Regulation .08 of this Chapter, consistent with the level of funding provided by the Maryland Medical Assistance Programs (MMAP), Alcohol and Drug Abuse Administration, or a local jurisdiction or jurisdictions; and (ii) A number of beds to be used for private- pay patients in accordance with Regulation .08, in addition to the number of beds projected to be needed in Regulation .07 of this Chapter. (2) To establish or to expand a Track Two intermediate care facility, an applicant must: (a) Document the need for the number and types of beds being applied for; (b) Agree to co- mingle publicly -funded and private- pay patients within the facility; (c) Assure that indigents, including court -referrals, will receive preference for admission, and (d) Agree that, if either the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Administration, or a local jurisdiction terminates the contractual agreement and funding for the facility's clients, the facility will notify the Commission and the Office of Health Care Quality within 15 days that that the facility is relinquishing its certification to operate, and will not use e ither its publicly - or privately - funded intermediate care facility beds for private- pay patients without obtaining a new Certificate of Need. Applicant Response I. Drug and Alcohol Addiction as a National Problem The need for additional beds is supported by the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), an annual survey sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) , an agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services . 4 The survey is t he primary source of information on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco in the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States aged 12 years old or older. The following are key results of the survey: A. Illicit Drug Use In 2013, an estimated 24.6 million Americans aged 12 or older were current (past month) illicit drug users, meaning they had used an illicit drug during the month prior to the survey interview. This estimate represents 9.4 percent of the population aged 4 The survey is available at http://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/ NSDUHresultsPDFWHTML2013/Web/NSDUHresults2013.pdf (last accessed 3/5/2015). 24 12 or older. Illicit drugs include marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or prescription- (pain relievers, tranquilizers, sedatives) used nonmedically. The rate of current illi cit drug use among persons aged 12 or older in 2013 (9.4 percent) was similar to the rates in 2010 (8.9 percent) and 2012 (9.2 percent), but it was higher than the rates in 2002 to 2009 and in 2011 (ranging from 7.9 to 8.7 percent) , showing significant inc rease in use over the past several years . Marijuana was the most commonly used illicit drug in 2013. There were 19.8 million current ( past month ) users in 2013 (7.5 percent of those aged 12 or older), which was similar to the number and rate in 2012 (18.9 million or 7.3 percent). The 2013 rate was higher than the rates in 2002 to 2011 (ranging from 5.8 to 7.0 percent). Marijuana was used by 80.6 percent of current illicit drug users in 2013. Daily or almost daily use of marijuana (used on 20 or more days in the past month) increased from 5.1 million persons in 2005 to 2007 to 8.1 million persons in 2013. In 2013, there were 1.5 million current cocaine users aged 12 or older, or 0.6 percent of the population. These estimates were similar to the numbers and rates in 2009 to 2012 (ranging from 1.4 million to 1.7 million or from 0.5 to 0.7 percent), but they were lower than those in 2002 to 2007 (ranging from 2.0 million to 2.4 million or from 0.8 to 1.0 percent). The number of past year heroin users in 2013 (681,000) was similar to the numbers in 2009 to 2012 (ranging from 582,000 to 669,000) and was higher than the numbers in 2002 to 2005, 2007, and 2008 (ranging from 314,000 to 455,000). An estimated 1.3 million persons aged 12 or older in 2013 (0.5 percent) used hallucinogens in the past month. The number of users in 2013 was similar to that in 2012 (1.1 million), but it was higher than in 2011 (1.0 million). The percentage of persons aged 12 or older who used prescription- type psychotherapeutic drugs nonmedically in the past month in 2013 (2.5 percent) was similar to the percentages in 2010 to 2012 (ranging from 2.4 to 2.7 percent). The number and percentage of past month methamphetamine users in 2013 (595,000 or 0.2 percent) were similar to those in 2012 (440,000 or 0.2 percent) and 2011 (439,000 or 0.2 percent), but they were higher than the estimates in 2010 (353,000 or 0.1 percent). Among youths aged 12 to 17, the rate of current illicit drug use was lower in 2013 (8.8 percent) than in 2002 to 2007 ( ranging from 9.6 to 11.6 percent) and in 2009 to 2012 (ranging from 9.5 to 10.1 percent). The rate of current marijuana use among youths aged 12 to 17 in 2013 (7.1 percent) was similar to the 2012 rate (7.2 percent) and the rates in 2004 to 2010 (ranging from 6.7 to 7.6 percent); however, it was lower than the rates in 2002, 2003, and 2011 (ranging from 7.9 to 8.2 percent). 25 Among youths aged 12 to 17, the rate of current nonmedical use of prescription- type drugs declined from 4.0 percent in 2002 and 2003 to 2.2 percent in 2013. The rate of nonmedical pain reliever use among youths also declined from 3.2 percent in 2002 and 2003 to 1.7 percent in 2013. The rate of current use of illicit drugs among young adults aged 18 to 25 in 2013 (21.5 percent) was simi lar to the rates in 2009 to 2012 (ranging from 21.3 to 21.6 percent), which was consistent with the steady rate of current marijuana use in this age group during this time (19.1 percent in 2013 and ranging from 18.2 to 19.0 percent in 2009 to 2012). Among young adults aged 18 to 25, the rate of current nonmedical use of prescription -type drugs in 2013 was 4.8 percent, which was similar to the rates in 2011 (5.0 percent) and 2012 (5.3 percent), but it was lower than the rates in the years from 2002 to 2010 (ranging from 5.5 to 6.5 percent). The rate of current cocaine use in 2013 among young adults aged 18 to 25 was 1.1 percent, which was similar to the rates in 2009, 2011, and 2012, but it was lower than the rates from 2002 to 2008 and in 2010. Among adul ts aged 26 or older, the rate of current illicit drug use in 2013 (7.3 percent) was similar to the rate in 2012 (7.0 percent), but it was higher than the rates in 2002 to 2011 (ranging from 5.5 to 6.6 percent). This was driven by rates of current marijuana use, which also remained steady between 2013 and 2012 (5.6 and 5.3 percent, respectively). However, the rate of current marijuana use in 2013 was higher than the rates in 2002 to 2011 (ranging from 3.9 to 4.8 percent). Among adults aged 50 to 64, the rat e of current illicit drug use increased from 2.7 percent in 2002 to 6.0 percent in 2013. For adults aged 50 to 54, the rate increased from 3.4 percent in 2002 to 7.9 percent in 2013. Among those aged 55 to 59, the rate of current illicit drug use increased from 1.9 percent in 2002 to 5.7 percent in 2013. Among those aged 60 to 64, the rate of current illicit drug use increased from 1.1 percent in 2003 and 2004 to 3.9 percent in 2013. Among unemployed adults aged 18 or older in 2013, 18.2 percent were current illicit drug users, which was higher than the rates of 9.1 percent for those who were employed full time and 13.7 percent for those who were employed part time. However, most illicit drug users were employed. Of the 22.4 million current illicit drug users aged 18 or older in 2013, 15.4 million (68.9 percent) were employed either full or part time. In 2013, 9.9 million persons (3.8 percent of those aged 12 or older) reported driving under the influence of illicit drugs during the past year, which was sim ilar to the rate in 2012 (3.9 percent). In 2013, the rate was highest among young adults aged 18 to 25 (10.6 percent), although this rate was lower than the rate in 2012 for this age group (11.9 percent). Among persons aged 12 or older in 2012- 2013 who us ed pain relievers nonmedically in the past 12 months, 53.0 percent got the drug they used most recently from a friend or relative for free, and 10.6 percent bought the drug from a friend or relative. Another 21.2 percent reported that they got the drug thr ough a prescription from one 26 doctor. An annual average of 4.3 percent got pain relievers from a drug dealer or other stranger, and 0.1 percent bought them on the Internet. B. Alcohol Use Slightly more than half (52.2 percent) of Americans aged 12 or older reported being current drinkers of alcohol in the 2013 survey, which was similar to the rate in 2012 (52.1 percent). This translates to an estimated 136.9 million current drinkers in 2013. In 2013, nearly one quarter (22.9 percent) of persons aged 12 or older were binge alcohol users in the past 30 days. This translates to about 60.1 million people. The rate in 2013 was similar to the estimate in 2012 (23.0 percent). Binge drinking is defined as having five or more drinks on the same occasion on at least 1 day in the 30 days prior to the survey. In 2013, heavy drinking was reported by 6.3 percent of the population aged 12 or older, or 16.5 million people. This rate was similar to the rate of heavy drinking in 2012 (6.5 percent). Heavy drinking is defined as binge drinking on at least 5 days in the past 30 days. Among young adults aged 18 to 25 in 2013, the rate of binge drinking was 37.9 percent, and the rate of heavy drinking was 11.3 percent. These rates were lower than the corresponding rates in 2012 (39.5 and 12.7 percent, respectively). The rate of current alcohol use among youths aged 12 to 17 was 11.6 percent in 2013. Youth binge and heavy drinking rates in 2013 were 6.2 and 1.2 percent, respectively. The rates for current and binge alcohol use were lower than those reported in 2012 (12.9 and 7.2 percent, respectively). In 2013, an estimated 10.9 percent of persons aged 12 or older drove under the influence of alcohol at least once in the past year. This percentage was lower than in 2002 (14.2 percent), but it was similar to the rate in 2012 (11.2 percent) . The rate was highest among persons aged 21 to 25 and persons aged 26 to 29 (19.7 and 20.7 percent, respectively). Among persons aged 12 to 20 and those aged 21 to 25, the rates of driving under the influence of alcohol were lower in 2013 (4.7 and 19.7 percent, respectively) than in 2012 (5.7 and 21.9 percent, respectively). An estimated 8.7 million underage persons (aged 12 to 20) were current drinkers in 2013, including 5.4 million binge drinkers and 1.4 million heavy drinkers. Corresponding percentages of underage persons in 2013 were 22.7 percent for current alcohol use, 14.2 percent for binge alcohol use, and 3.7 percent for heavy use. All of these percentages were lower than those in 2012. 4 Past month, binge, and heavy drinking rates among underage persons declined between 2002 and 2013. Past month alcohol use declined from 28.8 to 22.7 percent, binge drinking declined from 19.3 to 14.2 percent, and heavy drinking declined from 6.2 to 3.7 percent. In 2013, 52.2 percent of current underage drinkers reported that their last use of alcohol occurred in someone else's home, and 34.2 percent reported that it had occurred in their own home. Most current drinkers aged 12 to 20 (77.6 percent) were 27 with two or more other people the last time they drank alcohol. The rate of drinking alone the last time that underage persons drank alcohol was highest among youths aged 12 to 14 (14.5 percent). Among current underage drinkers, 28.7 percent paid for the alcohol the last time they drank, including 7.8 percent who purchased the alcohol themselves and 20.5 percent who gave money to someone else to purchase it. Among those who did not pay for the alcohol they last drank, 36.6 percent got it from an unrelated person aged 21 or older; 24.5 percent got it from a parent, g uardian, or other adult family member; and 16.4 percent got it from another person younger than 21 years old. In 2013, underage current drinkers were more likely than current alcohol users aged 21 or older to use illicit drugs within 2 hours of alcohol us e on their last reported drinking occasion (19.9 vs. 5.7 percent, respectively). The most commonly reported illicit drug used by underage drinkers in combination with alcohol was marijuana. II. Maryland Bed Need Thousands of Maryland residents who are suff ering from addiction need treatment today. Relying on data from Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH), the Washington Post reported that \"Heroin- related deaths in Maryland spiked 88 percent from 2011 to 2013 . . . and intoxication overdoses of all types now outnumber homicides in the state.\" See Exhibit 4. Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, former DHMH Secretary, has remarked \"Overdose is a public - health crisis in Maryland, as it is in many states...and we are bringing everything we can to bear against this challenge.\" Id. Maryland's existing portfolio of treatment facilities cannot begin t o solve this problem. The most recently approved CON for bed expansion at Father Martin's Ashley dated September 19, 2013 noted need for Private ICF/CD beds 107 to 152 for the Central Maryland Region alone. Additionally, Applicant's calculations indicate a need for new ICF treatment beds in the range of 450 to 598, using 2014 population data, and 471 to 624 using projected 2019 population data. The Southern Maryland Region has a net bed need of 99 to 120 using 2014 population data, and 104 to 126 using 2019 projected population. A. Methodology Applicant projected need based on the method of calculation for private beds outlined in the State Health Plan, COMAR 10.24.14.07B (7) (the \"ICF S tate Health Plan Methodology\"). .07(B)(7)(a): Identify by geographic region the non- indigent Maryland population for the 12-17 years and 18 years and above age groups by subtracting the number of Medical Assistance recipients from the projected Maryland population for the target year. Applicant identified the geo graphic region for the facility as Southern Maryland, as defined in .07B( 3), Geographic Regions. .07(B)(7)(b): Estimate the adolescent and adult populations at risk of alcohol and drug abuse by multiplying the non- indigent population in Maryland by a prevalence rate of 0.15 for the adolescent population and a prevalence rate 0.0864 for the adult population. 28 Adult Population Data Applicant first defined the total adult (18+) population in Maryland for years 2010, 2014 and 2019. Applicant did not estimat e the adolescent population because its facility will treat adults only. To define the adult population in Maryland, Applicant selected population data for the years 2010 and 2014, and projected population for 2019. The 2010 data is from Maryland's Depart ment of Planning d atabase and Data Analysis, which was sourced by the 2010 US Census. The 2014 population and 2019 projected population data were sourced by ESRI Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software. ESRI's Updated Demographics data is built on Census 2010 data and 2010 geography, and contains current -year estimates and five- year projections for categories such as population, households, income, and housing. The source is described in more detail in the document attached as Exhibit 9. Using thes e sources, Applicant defined the total adult (18+) population in Maryland for years 2010, 2014 and 2019 as demonstrated in Table 1 below. A full page rendering of Table 1 appears in Exhibit 10. 29 Table 1 2010 and projected 2014, 2019 Population Southern Region , Maryland Estimated Number of Privately Insured People After defining the adult population, Applicant determined the commercially -insured population rather than the non- indigent population referred to in the standard above. Applicant believes t hat calculating the number of privately insured Maryland residents is the most representative of the population who will seek treatment at Applicant's facility. To determine the amount of residents in the region who are privately insured, Applicant applied a 64.2% figure to the population total. The 64.2% figure is the national average for the privately insured population, based on the 2013 National Health Interview Survey, available on the website of the CDC, http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/health -insurance.htm . St. Mary's County, MD Prince George's State Calculated Southern Region Population (18+) RCA Calculated Southern Region Population (18+) 2010 2014 2019 Saint Mary's Estimated Number of Substance Abusers After determining the population of Maryland residents with private insurance, Applicant estimated the number of substance abusers in that population by applying prevalence rate of 0.0864, as provided in standard .07(B)(7)(b). .07(B)(7)(c): Estimate the non -indigent adolescent and adult target population by multiplying the at -risk adolescent population by 0.20 and the at -risk adult population by 0.25. Estimate the non- indigent adolescent and adult populations requiring some form of treatment by multiplying the adolescent and adult target populations by 0.95. Applicant estimated the target population by multiplying the at -risk privately insured adult population with commercial insurance by .25. As noted previously, Applicant focused on the privately insured population rather than the non -indigent population, and did not project need for the adolescent population. .07(B)(7)(d): Estimate the non -indigent adolescent and adult target treatment populations requiring care in an intermediate care facility by multiplying the adolescent target treatment population and the adult target treatment population by 0.15. Applicant estimated the privately insured adult target treatment population requiring care in an intermediate care facility by multiplying the adult t arget treatment population by .12.5 and .15, based on the assumption set forth in the ICF State Health Plan, COMAR \u00a710.24.14.04(e). As noted previously, Applicant focused on the privately insured population rather than the non -indigent population, and did not project need for the adolescent population. .07(B)(7)(e): Estimate the intermediate care treatment populations requiring readmission in the target year by multiplying the adolescent intermediate care treatment population by 0.20 and the adult intermediate care treatment population by 0.10. Applicant estimated the intermediate care treatment populations requiring readmission in the target year by multiplying the adult intermediate care treatment population by 0. 10. As noted previously, Applicant did not project need for the adolescent population. .07(B)(7) (f) Calculate the total number of persons requiring intermediate care by adding the intermediate care treatment population, readmissions, and the number of out -of-state discharges from intermediate care facilities in the base year. Applicant calculated the total number of privately insured adults requiring intermediate care by adding the intermediate care treatment population and readmissions. Applicant did not calculate the number of out -of-state di scharges from intermediate care facilities in the base year. Instead, Applicant projected need solely for the population in the facility's geographic region. Applicant later determined its catchment area and determined what percentage of its beds it expects to use to serve patients in the geographic region, as discussed below. 31 .07(B)(7) (g) Calculate the gross number of adolescent and adult intermediate care beds required by multiplying the total number of persons requiring intermediate care by a 22- day average length of stay for adolescents and a 14- day average length of stay for adults, and dividing by the product of 365 and 0.85. Applicant c alculated the gross number adult intermediate care beds required by multiplying the total number of privately insured adults requiring intermediate care by a 14- day average length of stay for adults, and dividing by the product of 365 and 0.85.5 As noted previously, Applicant focused on the privately insured population rather than the non -indigent population, and did not project need for the adolescent population. .07(B)(7) (h) Calculate the adjusted inventory of intermediate care beds by subtracting the number of intermediate care beds in facilities recognized by the Commission as serving at least 30 to 50 percent publicly -budgeted indigent patients from the total number of licensed and certified beds that are identified by the Commission as providing intermediate care, including beds that may be licensed for psychiatric care that are included in the inventory. Identifying Existing Non -Funded Facilities Because the ICF State Health Plan Methodology was last updated in 2005, Applicant did not rely on its representation of existing track one facilities. Instead, Applicant determined which of the existing facilities in the geographic region that offer care at level III.7 and/or III.7D are not identified as \"funded\" by Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Behavioral Health Administration Maryland Certified Treatment Locator. 6 Determining Number of Detox Beds Applicant determined, based on calls to the facilities and using a website that aggregates drug and alcohol inpatient treatment facility information, all beds within each facility.7 The facilities appear to use beds flexibly for detox and residential treatment. Applicant took the total number of beds and discounted them by 80% to find the 'true' number of beds that serve patients in detox at any given time. Source of 20% Assumption Applicant used 20% as an estimate for 'true' detox beds for each facility based on the RCA management team's experience in the field and the 2013 The National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services , attached as Exhibit 11. The N-SSATS (National Surv ey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services) is an annual survey conducted by the Substance 5 This 14 day length of stay is used as the basis for Applicant's modified revenue, expense, and statistical projections. Upon review of its clinical programming and in connection with modifying this application, Applicant determined that a 14 day length of stay is appropriate. Many patients will require a 14 day stay in Applicant's detox program due to co- occurring mental disorders, complicated medical issues or longer benzodiazepine tapers. 6 http://bha.dhmh.maryland.gov 7 http://addictionresourceguide. com/name.html 32 Abuse and Mental Health Services A dministration (SAMHSA). This is data from 94.2% (349 facilities) of Maryland's substance abuse treatment centers on one day (March 31 , 2011). There are two ways to consider the data provided in the Type of Care section (pg. 2). (1) The Residential (Non- Hospital) section, which is equivalent to what the Melwood Road facility will provide, shows 21.6% of patients in treatment facilities w ere in treatment for detoxification. Table 2 Maryland Residential Treatment Patients in Treatment on March 31, 2011 by Care Level # Patients in level of care % of ALL levels of care % of Residential Residential (non-hospital) 74 21.2 Short Term 28 8.0% 37.8% Long Term 68 19.5% 91.9% Detoxification 16 4.6% 21.6% (2) The Total Dat a from All Treatment (Outpatient, Residential (non -hospital), and Hospital Inpatient), shows totals to 24.4% patients in residential treatment facilities were in treatment for detoxification.

(4) Applicant was not able to determine the number of beds. .07(B)(7) (i) Calculate the total net number of adolescent and adult intermediate are beds needed by subtracting the adjusted inventory from the gross number of intermediate care beds needed. Applicant calculated the total net number of intermediate beds for privately insured adults by subtracting the adjusted inventory from the gross number of intermediate care beds needed. Additional Step One: Total Adult ICF Bed Need Because Applicant first projected the need only for the population its beds will primarily serve - privately insured patients, Applicant added a step to demonstrate the total adult bed need in the State. To do this, Applicant multiplied the total number of beds needed for privately insured adults by 1+35.8% (1.358), based on the 35.8% of the population that is not covered by private insurance.

Additional Step Two: Distrib uting Applicant Beds among in- state and out -of state patients In order to project how many of Applicant's beds will be used to serve Maryland patients, Applicant determined the number of in- state and out of state residents in its catchment area. To define the primary catchment area of the facility, Applicant first procured a 30, 60 and 90 mile radius around the proposed location. As a result of the large regional market strategy that Applicant intends to deploy in the mid- Atlantic market, and the lack of like providers in the marketplace, Applicant included clusters of large populations that bordered the 90 mile catchment area, roughly extending the catchment area in some cases 110 miles from the facility. This selection of large population clusters was done using the population density function of the ESRI software (heatmap). To include these areas of high population in the primary catchment area, Applicant inserted a polygon around the Applicant's selected area. This resulted in the catchment area, demonstrated by the black line in Figure 1 below. Figure 1 Facility Catchment Area 35 Figure 2, below, identifies towns and cities within the 30 miles of the facility. A full page image of Figure 2 is included in Exhibit 10. Figure 2 Major Cities and Towns within 30 Miles of Facility 36 Once the catchment area was defined, Applicant used the ESRI software to determine what the population within the catchment area was from Maryland, and the out -of state population in the catchment area. Table 5 Facility Catchment Area, 2014 Table 6 Facility Catchment Area, 2019 A full size rendering of Tables 5 and 6 appear in Exhibit 10. Appli cant then applied the ratio of Marylanders within the catchment area to total population within the catchment area' to the total number of detox beds sought, to show how many of the requested detox beds would likely serve Maryland residents, and how many would likely serve out -of-state residents. Additional Step Three: Projecting Maryland Statewide Need Using the same methodology described above, Applicant projected need for the entire State of Maryland. 2014 Estimate MD 2014 Population Not MD Calc RCA MD Catchment Total 4,513,229 2019 Estimate MD 2019 Population Not MD Calc RCA MD Catchment Total 103,781 4,689,719 37 B.

Sliding Fee Scale. An applicant must establish a sliding fee scale for gray area patients consistent w ith the client's ability to pay . Applicant Response The facility will utilize a sliding fee scale for gray area patients consistent with the patient's ability to pay. The fee schedule is summarized as follows, and represents discount percentages from the standard billing rate charged to insurance carriers for each ser vice: <100% of Federal Poverty Level 75% <150% but >100% of Federal Poverty Level 50% <200% but >150% of Federal Poverty Level 25% A policy outlining the sliding scale fee is attached as Exhibit 12. .05D. Provision of Service to Indigent and Gray Area Patients. (1) Unless an applicant demonstrates why one or more of the following standards should not apply or should be modified, an applicant seeking to establish or to expand a Track One intermediate care facility must: (a) Establish a sliding fee scale for gray area patients consistent with a client's ability to pay; (b) Commit that it will provide 30 percent or more of its proposed annual adolescent intermediate car e facility bed days to indigent and gray area patients; and (c) Commit that it will provide 15 percent of more of its proposed annual adult intermediate care facility bed days to indigent or gray area patients. (2) A existing Track One intermediate care facility may propose an alternative to the standards in Regulation D(1) that would increase the availability of alcoholism and drug abuse treatment to indigent or gray area patients in its health planning region. (3) In evaluating an existing Track One intermediate care facility's proposal to provide a lower required minimum percentage of bed days committed to indigent or gray area patients in Regulation D(1) or an alternative proposal under Regulation D(2), the Commission shall consider: (a) The needs of the population in the health planning region; and (b) The financial feasibility of the applicant's meeting the requirements of Regulation D(1). (4) An existing Track One intermediate care facility that seeks to increase beds shall provide information regarding the percentage of its annual patient days in the preceding 12 months that were generated by charity care, indigent, or gray area patients, inc luding publicly -funded patients. 42 Applicant Response Applicant request s a modification of subsection (1) (c) as the healthcare insurance landscape has changed dramatically since this standard was promulgated . A. Increased Medicaid and Private Insurance Coverage Under the Affordable Care Act . As discussed in the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation report dated January 6, 2014, attached as Exhibit 13, the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) has the potential to extend coverage to many of the 47 million nonelderly uninsured people nationwide, including 756,000 uninsured Marylanders. The ACA establishes coverage provisions across the income spectrum, with the expansion of Medicaid eligibility for adults serving as the vehicle for covering low-income individuals and premium tax credits to help people purchase insurance directly through new Health Insurance Marketplaces serving as the vehicle for covering people with moderate incomes. The 2012 ruling of the United States Supreme Court in Nat'l Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius , 567 U.S. (2012), made the Medicaid expansi on optional for states. Maryland implemented the expansion in 2014. As a result, almost all nonelderly uninsured, most of whom are adults, are now eligible for coverage expansions. With Maryland deciding to implement the Medicaid expansion, nearly six in ten (59%) uninsured nonelderly people in the state are eligible for financial assistance to gain coverage through either Medicaid or the m arketplaces. Given the income distribution of the uninsured in the state, the main pathway for coverage is Medicaid, with four in ten (40%) uninsured Marylanders eligible for either Medicaid or CHIP as of 2014. While some of these people (such as eligible children) are eligible under pathways in place before the ACA, most adults are newly - eligible through the ACA expansion. One in five (20%) uninsured people in Maryland are eligible for premium tax credits to help them purchase coverage in the marketplace. Other uninsured Marylanders may gain coverage under the ACA but will not receive direct financial assistance. These people include the 23% with incomes above the limit for premium tax subsidies or who have an affordable offer of coverage through their employer. Some of these people are still able to purchase unsubsidized coverage in the Marketplace, which may be more affordable or more comprehensive than coverage they could obtain on their own through the individual market. Lastly, the approximately 17% of uninsured people in Maryland who are undocumented immigrants are ineligible for financial assistance under the ACA and barred from purchasing coverage through the marketplaces. This group is likely to remain uninsured, though they will still have a need for health care services. The ACA will help many currently uninsured Marylanders gain health coverage by provi ding coverage options across the income spectrum for low and moderate -income people. While almost all of the uninsured in Maryland are eligible for some type of coverage under the ACA, the impact of the ACA will depend on take- up of coverage among the elig ible uninsured, and outreach and enrollment efforts will be an important factor in decreasing the uninsured rate. The ACA includes a requirement that most individuals obtain health coverage, but some people (such as the lowest income or those without an af fordable option) are exempt and others may still remain uninsured. Medicaid's role in purchasing and delivering substance abuse services is changing dramatically. Prior to the implementation of the ACA, most state Medicaid programs did not cover childless adults and covered only a limited number of parents. Moreover, coverage of substance abuse services has traditionally been an optional Medicaid benefit and, as a result, 43 many states have provided only limited substance abuse service coverage. Twenty -five states plus Washington, DC, are expanding Medicaid in 2014 and will collectively cover as many as 5 million adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). Benefits extended to these newly covered adults must include mental healt h and substance abuse services that meet the requirements of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA). Taken together, these changes are a major catalyst for transformation of substance abuse service coverage and delivery in Medicaid. While Applicant's facility will not ser ve patients covered by Medicaid, t he expansion in Medicaid coverage means that treatment services are now available to more Maryland residents at other facilities that are already in existence. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, there are already over 20 substance abuse treatment facilities in the state of Maryland that accept Medicaid. Because of the ACA, 59% of the previously uninsured nonelderly people in the state will now have access to seek Medicaid coverage and be eligible for treatment at these facilities . B. The Applicant's Commitment to Provide Care for Indigent and Gr ay Area Patients . Notwithstanding the greater availability of coverage for Marylanders, the Applicant is committed to providing care to indigent and gray area patients. However, the level of commitment set forth in Standard .05D(1)(c) ( i.e., 15 percent or more of bed days) is not reasonable in light of the increased number of covered patients. In fact, prior to the expansive effect of the ACA, the Commission staff had already expressed concern that the level of care called for in Standard .05D(1)(c) is too high. See September 19, 2013 Transcript of Proceedings before the Commission on Father Martin's Ashley CON Application for Bed Expansion, Exhibit 14 at 7. Given that the Affordable Care Ac t has expanded Medicaid and private insurance coverage for an estimated 59% of previously uninsured Marylanders, Applicant believes it would be reasonable to reduce the amount of indigent care required by this standard decision, which preceded the effect o f the ACA act, by 59%. Applying this figure, it would be reasonable to provide 6.15% of patient days for indigent and gray area patients. (15% x 41% = 6.15%). Applicants revenue and expense projection tables, Exhibit 1, Tables G, H, J and K, reflect thi s commitment o 6.15%. However, at the request of the Commission staff, Applicant has produced alternative financial tables that reflect the 15% figure referenced in this standard. See Exhibit 2, Tables G, H, J and K. Applicant is prepared to invest subs tantial resources into the construction and operation of this detox and residential treatment facility, and will bear the financial risk of this venture. This facility will be a positive step towards addressing the significant need for Intermediate Care Facilities in Maryland. .05E. Information Regarding Charges. An applicant must agree to post information concerning charges for services, and the range and types of services provided, in a conspicuous place, and must document that this information is avail able to the public upon request . 44 Applicant Response The Applicant will post charges for services, and the range and types of services provided in a conspicuous place. This information will be available to the public . A list of services and prices is attached as Exhibit 15. .05F. Location. An applicant seeking to establish a new intermediate care facility must propose a location within a 30- minute one -way travel time by autom obile to an acute care hospital . Applicant Response The proposed facility is within 30 minutes driv ing time from MedStar Southern Maryland Hospital Center, 7503 Surratts Road, Clinton, MD 20735 (10 minutes without traffic/11 minutes with traffic, according to Google Maps). .05G. Age Groups.

The Commission shall consider the applicable need analysis in the State Health Plan. If no State Health Plan need analysis is applicable, the Commission shall consider whether the applicant has demonstrated unmet needs of the population to be served, and established that the proposed project meets those needs. INSTRUCTIONS: Please discuss the need of the population served or to be served by the Project. Responses should include a quantitative analysis that, at a minimum, describes the Project's expected service area, population size, characteristics, and projected growth. If the relevant chapter of the State Health Plan includes a need standard or need projection methodology , please reference/address it in your response. For applications proposing to address the need of special population groups, please specifically identi fy those populations that are underserved and describe how this Project will address their needs. If the project involves modernization of an existing facility through renovation and/or expansion, provide a detailed explanation of why such modernization is needed by the service area population. Identify and discuss relevant building or life safety code issues, age of physical plant issues, or standard of care issues that support the need for the proposed modernization. Please assure that all sources of inf ormation used in the need analysis are identified. List all assumptions made in the need analysis regarding demand for services, utilization rate(s), and the relevant population, and provide information support ing the validity of the assumptions. Complet e the Statistical Projection (Tables D and E, as applicable) worksheets in the CON Table Package, as required. Instructions are provided in the cover sheet of the CON package. Table D must be completed if the applicant is an existing facility. Table E must be completed if the application is for a new facility or service or if it is requested by MHCC staff. Applicant Response Please see Applicant's response to standard .05B, supra . 53 10.24.01.08G(3)(c). Availability of More Cost -Effective Alternatives. The Commission shall compare the cost effectiveness of the proposed project with the cost effectiveness of providing the service through alternative existing facili ties, or through an alternative facility that has submitted a competitive application as part of a comparative review. INSTRUCTIONS: Please describe the planning process that was used to develop the proposed project. This should include a full explanat ion of the primary goals or objectives of the project or the problem(s) being addressed by the project. It should also identify the alternative approaches to achieving those goals or objectives or solving those problem(s) that were considered during the p roject planning process , including the alternative of the services being provided by existing facilities. For all alternative approaches, provide information on the level of effectiveness in goal or objective achievement or problem resolution that each alternative would be likely to achieve and the costs of each alternative. The cost analysis should go beyond development cost to consider life cycle costs of project alternatives. This narrative should clearly convey the analytical findings and reasoning that supported the project choices made. It should demonstrate why the proposed project provides the most effective goal and objective achievement or the most effective solution to the identified problem(s) for the level of cost required to implement the project, when compared to the effectiveness and cost of alternatives including the alternative of providing the service through alternative existing facilities, or through an alternative facility that has submitted a competitive application as part of a c omparative review . Applicant Response The proposed project involves renovating existing structure to create an efficient and modern Intermediate Care Facility for Alcohol and Drug Abuse treatment. RCA has selected the proposed site based on the shortage of quality provider beds in the State of Maryland (and across the country). Many Maryland residents are suffering from addict ion and need treatment today. See Exhibit 23. At a State House news conference, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan described how pervasive he found the problem as he traveled around the state last year. \"'This used to be considered an urban problem, but it's not anymore,' he said. All over the state, he said, local officials told him heroin had becom e their No. 1 problem.\" See Exhibit 23. Applicant' s bed need calculations demonstrate that existing providers do not have enough capacity to meet the growing need and RCA brings a solution to a massive problem. Acquisition of existing providers does not address the need for incremental new beds and produces no net benefit to residents of the State of Maryland. Additionally, limiting sites of service and increasing bed size does not provide the necessary breadth of coverage residents of Maryland require to address the growing population suffering from addiction Accordingly, RCA determined to build new treatment facilities of a scope that could begin to address the dire need in the State of Maryland. It looked at existing properties in the $1M to $20M price range across the State, and targeted locations with dense populations and commensurate bed need. To the extent possible, RCA looked to repurpose existing struc tures 54 in order to minimize environmental impacts. The charts below demonstrate RCA's demographic analysis that contributed to its site selection and subsequent CON applications. Site Selection The A pplicant selected the property at 4620 Melwood Avenue, Upper Marlboro, MD as a future location for the company's Inpatient Substance Abuse program. The Applicant reviewed many different sites across the state of Maryland, considering many factors. Such factors include, but were not limited to, zoning parameters by right and special exception, site size, points of access to major roadways , and interchanges , among others . Of the factors reviewed that have not been previously discussed in the application is the time the applicant spent observing the demographics of the site. The Applicant used a 90 mile catchment area to determine if the site was viable on the basis of being able to capture a patient who was able to afford A pplicant 's services. The Applicant concluded the site was viable. Below is a summary of the site's demographic. Table 11 Summary of Site's Demographic Catchment Area 90 Mile Radius Source - ESRI 55 Selection of Multiple Sites Applicant has selected two additional sites to develop a detox and residential treatment facility, which are the subjects of other CON applications. Although Applicant recognizes that it may be possible to gain some financial efficiency by operating one l arger facility, this approach would not be consistent with Applicant's model of care. By having three sites strategically located across the state of Maryland, Applicant will be able to provide treatment that is readily available to patients near where patients live and work. This improves patients' access to treatment because, in most cases, they can reach their chosen facilities within 60 miles of their home or workplace. A single large facility in the center of the state would hinder patients' access to care. Many patients would have to travel more than 90 miles to access a centralized facility. In the field of substance abuse treatment, if treatment is difficult to access and not readily available, then the likelihood increases that a patient may c ontinue in their current addiction or relapse into addiction. See, e.g., Exhibit 24. Many people with the disease of addiction are uncertain about entering into treatment, so taking advantage of available services that are close to them the moment they are ready for treatment is crucial for their success. The earlier treatment is offered in the disease process, the greater likelihood of positive outcomes. Thus, while having one large facility centrally located would allow RCA to take advantage of large economies of scale, it would hinder access to treatment greatly. 56 10.24.01.08G(3)(d). Viability of the Proposal . The Commission shall consider the availability of financial and nonfinancial resources, including community support, necessary to implement the project within the time frames set forth in the Commission's performance requirements, as well as the availability of resources necessary to sustain the project. INSTRUCTIONS: Please provide a complete description of the funding plan for the project, documenting the availability of equity, grant (s), or philanthropic sources of funds and demonstrating, to the extent possible, the ability of the applicant to obtain the debt financing proposed. Describe the alternative financing mechanisms considered in project planning and provide an explanation of why the proposed mix of funding sources was chosen. Complete applicable Revenue & Expense Tables and the Workforce and Bedside Care Staffing worksheets in the CON Table Package, as required . Attach additional pages as necessary detailing assumptions with respect to each revenue and expense line item. Instructions are provided in the cover sheet of the CON package and on each worksheet. Explain how these tables demonstrate that the proposed project is sustainable and provide a description of the sources and methods for recruitment of needed staff resources for the proposed project, if applicable. If the projections are based on Medicare percentages above the median for the jurisdiction in which the nursing home exists or is proposed, explain why the projected Medicare percentages are reasonable. Audited financial statements for the past two years should be provided by all applicant entiti es and parent companies to demonstrate the financial condition of the entities involved and the availability of the equity contribution. If audited financial statements are not available for the entity or individuals that will provide the equity contribut ion, submit documentation of the financial condition of the entities and/or individuals providing the funds and the availability of such funds. Acceptable documentation is a letter signed by an independent Certified Public Accountant. Such letter shall detail the financial information considered by the CPA in reaching the conclusion that adequate funds are available. If debt financing is required and/or grants or fund raising is proposed, detail the experience of the entities and/or individuals involved in obtaining such financing and grants and in raising funds for similar projects. If grant funding is proposed, identify the grant that has been or will be pursued and document the eligibility of the proposed project for the grant. Describe and document relevant community support for the proposed project. Identify the performance requirements applicable to the proposed project (see question 12, \"Project Schedule\") and explain how the applicant will be able to implement the project in compliance with those performance requirements. Explain the process for completing the project design, obtaining State and local land use, environmental, and design approvals, contracting and obligating the funds within the prescribed time frame. Describe the construction proc ess or refer to a description elsewhere in the application that demonstrates that the project can be completed within the applicable time frame(s). 57 Applicant Response Project Financing The funding plan for the project is summarized as follows: Equity $ 9,248,552 Senior bank debt $ 11,770,883 Total project cost $ 21,019,435 Of the total project cost, 44% is attributable to the detox ification treatment component requiring CON approval. RCA has engaged Stifel Nicolaus and Company, an investment banking firm, to facilitate the capital raise for all RCA projects. It has received a term sheet and has executed an engagement letter with an equity partner to fund the equity portion of the project. Due diligence is underway and is anticipated to conclude by the end of March 2015, with funding concurrent with the closing of the senior bank debt. RCA is in negotiations with multiple banks and other financing institutions to place the senior bank debt. This debt will be structured either as mortgage debt or a senior term loan, depending upon the institution selected for funding. This financing plan was put in place based on the advice of outside consultants and RCA's internal expertise in raising capital. The RCA ex ecutive management team has significant experience in both types of financing, with total financing obtained and placed for their respective businesses in the billions of dollars. Under current market conditions in the industry, as well as in the overall financing marketplace, both management and the investment banking team are extremely confident that the projects will be funded within the expected timelines. RCA will advise the Commission of its progress in financing the project. Documentation of Financial Condition of Investor Deerfield Management Company is providing the equity and senior debt for the entire transaction. The terms of equity contribution and the debt are not able to be made publicly available as doing so would compromise RCA by disclosing such terms to competitors and other outside parties, and the Company is under a non- disclose agreement with the investor/lender. Attached as Exhibit 25 is the ADV form on file with the SEC for Deerfield. The relevant part of the financial inform ation for the RCA funding is the current gross asset value of the \"Private Design III\" fund from which the transaction will be funded. On page 38 of the ADV form it shows a fund valuation of $1,667,124,016. Project Design Recognizing the critical need for timely and effective conversion of significant capital resources into facilities that support the clinical program, RCA recruited senior real estate team members with significant and complementary experience. RCA's team excels in two critical 58 areas in developing real estate for a specialized application such as this. First, RCA recognizes that the real estate team must understand the requirements, programs, adjacencies, and appropriate staffing levels of the facility's clinical program. To that extent, RCA created a prototype facility designed to optimally support the patient as s/he migrates through the continuum of care. Second, RCA recognized the importance of working with local officials and local vendors to develop and execute on an efficient timeline for navigating the permitting approval processes. RCA met with local officials and local vendors to identify activities and timeframes required to achieve municipal approvals for the project. RCA's real estate team has consistently executed programs and projects with previous employers and has developed a plan to successfully execute Applicants project and programs. Because of the quality construction and maintenance at the facility, RCA at first thought to the facility would be a candidate for renov ation and repurposing. However, during the planning process RCA discovered that the building would not meet its standards and would need to be razed. The new facility is based on our prototype that is designed from the inside out. This decision requires additional capital and resources, however, attributes of the site, including lot size and location, make the facility one of RCA's most highly regarded locations. Revenue & Expense, and Wor kforce Projections Please see Exhibit 1. The statements of assumptions for those proje ctions, included within Exhibit 1, outlines the assumptions utilized to prepare the tables that exist as part of the application. T hese tables included in Exhibit 1 demonstrate the ability for RCA to create a sustainable project. The use of projected staffing was based on research on market comparable positions and salary levels as well as demographics of individuals in the area. Community Support Applicant is in the process of seeking letters of support from various organizations and community members in 4620 Melwood Road's service area, and expects to receive letters of support throughout the CON application process. Applicant will keep the Commission informed of its progress. Applicable Performance Requirements Pursuant to COMAR \u00a7 10.24.01.12, once the Commission grants a Certificate of Need, Applicant will have 18 months to obligate not less than 51 percent of the approved capital expenditure, as documented by a binding construction contract or equipment purchase order. Applicant will have four months from the effective date of the construction contract to break ground, and must complete the project 18 months thereafter. COMAR \u00a7 10.24.01.12.B(1),(2), C(1)(c ). Applicant will meet the of COMAR \u00a7 0.24.01.12. Applicant expects to obligate not less than 51% of the approved capital expenditure within four months of CON approval. Applicant expects to break ground two months thereafter and to complete construction within 11 months after breaking ground. 59 10.24.01.08G(3)(e). Compliance with Conditions of Previous Certificates of Need. An applicant shall demonstrate compliance with all terms and conditions of each previous Certificate of Need granted to the applicant, and with all commitments made that earned preferences in obtaining each previous Certificate of Need, or provide the Commiss ion with a written notice and explanation as to why the conditions or commitments were not met. INSTRUCTIONS : List all of the Maryland Certificates of Need that have been issued to the project applicant , its parent, or its affiliates or subsidiaries over the prior 15 years , including their terms and conditions, and any changes to approved Certificates that needed to be obtained. Document that these projects were or are being implemented in compliance with all of their terms and conditions or explain why t his was not the case. Applicant Response Not applicable. No Maryland Certificates of Need that have been issued to the Applicant, its parent, or its affiliates or subsidiaries over the prior 15 years. 60 10.24.01.08G(3)(f). Impact on Existing Providers and the Health Care Delivery System . An applicant shall provide information and analysis with respect to the impact of the proposed project on existing health care providers in the health planning region, including the impact on geographic and demographic access to services, on occupancy, on costs and charges of other providers, and on costs to the health care delivery system. INSTRUCTIONS : Please provide an analysis of the impact of the proposed project . Please assure that all sources of information used in the impact analysis are identi fied and identify all the assumptions made in the impact analysis with respect to demand for services, payer mix, access to service and cost to the health care delivery system including relevant populations considered in the analysis, and changes in market share, with information that supports the validity of these assumptions. Provide an analysis of the following impacts : a) On the volume of service provided by all other existing health care providers that are likely to experience some impact as a result of this project; b) On the payer mix of all other existing health care providers that are likely to experience some impact on payer mix as a result of this project . If an applicant for a new nursing home claims no impact on payer mix, the applicant must identify the likely source of any expected increase in patients by payer. c) On access to health care services for the service area population that will be served by the project. (S tate and support the assumptions used in this analysis of the impact on access); d) On costs to the health care delivery system. If the applicant is an existing facility or program, provide a summary description of the impact of the proposed project on the applicant 's costs and charges, consistent with the information provided in the Project Budget, the projections of revenues and expenses, and the work force information. Applicant Response Data are not readily available regarding the operations of existing ICF provi ders. However , it is clear the project will not have a materially adverse impact on existing providers. The Applicant proposes to add only 55 detox/assessment beds (and 70 residential beds). Based on projected admissions in the proposed facility's servi ce area, only 25 of the 55 detox/assessment beds will be used for Maryland residents ( see Table 8) by year 2019. With an expected length of stay of fourteen days, the 25 beds for Maryland admissions will serve only approximately 554 Maryland adult patient s per year ([(.85 occupancy rate x 25 beds ) x 365 days] / 14 day LOS = 554). Using the need methodology set forth in the State Health Plan, as many as 2,151 adult Marylanders residing in the Southern Maryland Region will require ICF care in 2019. Present ly, the Southern Maryland Region has only one non- funded facility: Anchor @ Walden- Sierra . See Table 4. Thus, the demand for beds exceeds the current supply, and the addition of 25 beds for Maryland admissions will not significantly adversely impact other providers. 61 This project is primarily aimed at improving access of care for residents of Maryland and secondarily on increasing access for individuals in need of treatment from across the country. Officials across Maryland, including Governor Hogan, have made it clear that the State of Maryland has an inadequate substance use disorder treatment system to serve the rising numbers of Maryland residents who suffer from the disease of addiction. The current system of substance abuse treatment in the nation is failing - 89% of Americans who meet DSM 5 criteria for substance abuse or dependence do not get treatment. This problem needs all providers to work together in reducing these s tartling statistics. If only 11% of cancer victims received treatment, the country would be in an uproar. The applicant plans on attacking the disease head- on through a multi -pronged approach that consistently educates the community and minimizes the barri ers that stand in the way of receiving treatment. Applicant's efforts will also focus on reducing stigma and celebrating recovery. Applicant's efforts combat this disease will come from many avenues including: Provid ing a local continuum of care to extend gains made in all levels of treatment Treatment that is close to the patients home and/or workplace Utiliz ing evidence- based / best practices Providing individualized, tailored treatment Deliver ing Patient -Centered Care as defined by the Institute of Medicine Providing on and off -site educational seminars, workshops and other activities Providing a family program and intervention services Having on the ground care advocates who will establish relationships with community resources (physicians, hospitals, schools, etc.) A 24/7 contact center that will serve as a resource for anyone seeking treatment for themselves of a loved one on, any person who does not meet our clinical criteria to a highly qualified referral A 24/7 transportation service Employ ing science identified by the National Institute of Drug Abuse following NIDA's Principles of Effective Treatment Collaborat ing w ith colleagues from the top research institutions and with the top innovators in the field A targ eted regional marketing campaign spend comprised of both digital and traditional media that not only promotes brand awareness but aims at educating and reducing the stigma associated with the disease The proposed project will increase access to urgently needed alcohol and drug abuse treatment services in the Sothern Maryland Region and throughout the projected service area. The Applicant has committed to provide 6.15% of patient days for indigent and gray area patients, and to make additional resources available to the entire community. Thus, patients with limited financial resources will have greater access to care after implementation of the project. In addition, A pplicant asks that the Commission note the lack of providers that will directly compete w ith Applicant's locations. Table 12 below demonstrates the low amount of direct competition in the Mid- Atlantic Region, and provides a better understanding of Applicant's 62 'neighborhood' model. Applicant's 'neighborhood' model is defined as 90 miles reach from the facility, or roughly an hour and half drive. A full page rendering of Table 12 appears in Exhibit 10. Table 12 Neighboring Providers Source: Applicant phone calls to facilities and SAMHSA Treatment Locator (1) Applicant assumed that Maryland ICF facilities use 20% of their licensed beds for detox, as discussed in response to standard .05B, supra (2) Facility identified number of beds used for detox via phone Applicant is confident that it's multi -prong attack on this disease along wi th the efforts of other providers, county and state official's, tasks forces and other alliances, will be successful in empowering more individuals to seek treatment for their disease. Applicant believes that this reduction will provide a net benefit to ex isting providers.

CURRENT ENTIRE FACILITYPROJECTED CHANGES AS A RESULT OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT THROUGH THE LAST YEAR OF PROJECTION (CURRENT DOLLARS)OTHER EXPECTED CHANGES IN OPERATIONS THROUGH THE LAST YEAR OF PROJECTION (CURRENT DOLLARS)PROJECTED ENTIRE FACILITY THROUGH THE LAST YEAR OF PROJECTION (CURRENT DOLLARS) *1 Statement of Assumptions for Financial Projections Expenses A pplicant has budgeted its expenses based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the following: S taffing ratio requirements of the state Industry comparable information, when available Experience of executive program and clinical personnel from other facilities Experience of executive finance personnel with costs associated for expenses and s ervices in similar type facilities T he RCA salaries are based on detail rosters by location that comply with or exceed the staffing requirements for the respective services. Benefit and taxes have been applied based on management experience with the costs for similar benefit packages at other organizations. Estimates for utilities, mainte nance, and other facility related costs are based on both the experience of RCA management from other similar facilities, as well as estimates from personnel familiar with facility costs from similar sized facilities in their hospitality portfolio. Food costs were estimated based on the experience of RCA management at other residential facilities, and were increased nearly twofold in order to ensure that RCA will be able to deliver the high quality of food that will be required in its world class facilities. Liability, property and other insurance costs are based on estimates received from RCA's insurance brokers, who have done preliminary pricing with a variety of insurance carriers ahead of actual binding of insurance coverages. Finally, other patient based expenses (i.e. program activities, etc.) were also based on the RCA management team's experience at other similar facilities. I n general, Applicant based the expenses of its budget on known factors where available, and on the significant past experience of its executive program, clinical and financial teams in order to provide what it believes to be the most accurate, and if unknown then conservative, expense projections available at this time. Revenue A pplicant used various forms of data to support the average daily rate assumptions used in schedules G and H to calculate annual revenue. Applicant examined data from multiple payors that includes out -of-network (OON) claims processed, in- network negotiated rates from proprietary sources, databases that provide claims paid representing a population mix of OON and in- network data, as well as self -pay rates. Applicant focused on four key information sources: (i) Medivance Billing Service data (OON claims processed), (ii) TruVen Health Analytics data (claims paid, thus representing a mix of OON and in- network), (iii) American Addiction Centers (NYSE: AAC) public metrics (primarily OON, with small portion of self -pay), and (iv) internal employee confidential rate data (in- network negotiated rates). The s ummary of Applicant's data analysis by source is below, with the results supporting its assumptions and serving to triangulate around RCA's average daily rates. 2 (i) Medivance Billing Service (MBS) specializes in offering comprehensive substance abuse billi ng, collections and revenue cycle management services to substance abuse rehab facilities. It provided Applicant with a comprehensive proposal for providing services to RCA. Throughout that process, Applicant has been gathering data from MBS' billing bas e of 45 clients (representing 60 facilities) and over $60 million worth of claims data each month, 95% of which is out -of-network insurance claims. MBS has provided 2014 data with regard to average payment rates, all from their proprietary information of claims. The average payment rate represents the actual amount paid by the insurance provider to the rehabilitation facility, which is after the patient responsibility portion of the bill (including coinsurance, deductibles, etc.). The data includes indiv idual claim data from 50+ different insurance providers and over 2000 individual data points. The summary of the MBS average daily payment data for OON claims paid to substance abuse facilities is as follows: Level of Service ProvidedAverage Daily Payment Detox $1,618 Inpatient Rehab / Residential $1,135 Partial Hospitalization (PHP) $989 Intensive Outpatient (IOP) $610 General Outpatient (GOP) $193 3 (ii) TruVen Health Analytics (TruVen) has a proprietary and confidential database called Reimbursement Benchmarks, which represents 350 insurance carriers and 67 million covered lives. TruVen has provided data that represent the same services Applicant will be providing , although from a hospital standpoint, and not a \"free- standing\" rehabilitation facility (i.e. a different site service). Applicant views this data as an indirect confirmation that the value of Applicant's services is commensurate with the TruVen summary data below. Applicant is in consistent dialog with the TruVen Health team to fine tune its relevant claims data.

AAC publishes several select metrics that Applicant track s closely, among those being average gross daily revenue and average net daily revenue both quarterly and annuall y. AAC is achieving substantially higher daily rates than we are forecasting in our model and they are summarized below. 2013 2014 3rdQ2014 Rates - RCA Proprietary: The following rates represent negotiated in- network daily rates for a west coast -based substance abuse facility. These rates are averages from over 15 major regional and national payors and are primarily based on \"all-inclusive\" per diem fee schedules.

EXHIBIT 4 Local Heroin deaths spike in Maryland By Susan Svrluga June 27, 2014 Heroin\u00adrelated deaths in Maryland spiked 88 percent from 2011 to 2013, according to figures released Friday by the state's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and intoxication overdoses of all types now outnumber homicides in the state. \"Overdose is a public\u00adhealth crisis in Maryland, as it is in many states,\" said the agency's secretary, Joshua Sharfstein, \"and we are bringing everything we can to bear against this challenge.\" Cyndi Glass of Brookeville, whose son Jeremy died of a heroin overdose in 2008, gasped when she heard the statistics. \"That is shocking. I knew it would increase, but I didn't know it would increase that much,\" she said. Payroll Services payroll.buyerzone.com Compare Payroll Service Prices Find the Best Deal and Save Today! Glass has been raising money for treatment, prevention and awareness programs because she had no idea, when her son was prescribed opioid painkillers after a football injury led to three knee surgeries, that it could possibly lead one day to a heroin addiction. \"He would have turned 26 yesterday,\" she said. Heroin use has been surging across the country \u2014 often as people addicted to prescriptionopiates switch to a similar, but cheaper and more readily available, high \u2014 with fatalities rising along with it. In Virginia, heroin\u00adrelated deaths more than doubled from 2011 through 2013, for a total of 213. In 2013 in Maryland, which has a more comprehensive system for tracking deaths, there were 464 \u2014 an 18 percent increase from the previous year. Both states began training programs this year to help family members or friends learn to administer naloxone, a drug that can sometimes prevent an overdose. In Maryland, 2,000 people have been trained already in addition to the first\u00adresponders, Sharfstein said, and by July 1 all ambulances will carry naloxone. Maryland saw a dramatic jump in the number of deaths from heroin spiked with non\u00ad prescription fentanyl. Typically they had seen two or three a month, Sharfstein said, \"but in October we started to see 10, 15, 20 a month ... and that has persisted, to a certain extent, into this year. That is a huge increase. Fentanyl is highly potent and definitely dangerous in combination with heroin. That is a huge challenge.\" Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) created an interagency council to try to prevent overdose deaths, using some of the same techniques the state has used to understand and reduce the number of homicides. Payroll Services payroll.buyerzone.com Compare Payroll Service Prices Find the Best Deal and Save Today! One of his main goals has been to reduce intoxication deaths by 20 percent by the end of next year. (A graphic of a meter on a state Web site shows negative 7.4 percent progress toward that goal, since all intoxication deaths increased from 799 to 858 in 2013.) Heroin\u00adrelated deaths increased in western and central Maryland and on the EasternCute Plus Size Clothing zulily.com Up to 70% Off On Plus Size Dresses & Accessories. Shop Now!Black Mold Allergy Symptoms local.com/Black_Mold_Removal Does Your House Have Black Mold? Find A Specialist To Remove It!Shore. And they more than doubled in Frederick County, from 10 in 2012 to 21 in 2013. Over the past five to 10 years, heroin, once mainly associated with urban centers such as Baltimore, has spread throughout the state, Sharfstein said. (Baltimore had a large increase in heroin deaths from 2012 to 2013, as well.) The state has launched a public\u00adinformation campaign to counter opioid overdoses, trying to erase stigmas about treatment such as methadone and looping in the 211 call centers so that people can ask where to find help. Officials hope to provide everyone leaving detention centers with information warning about overdose deaths: Former inmates can easily overdose after being off the drug if they go back to their original dose once they're freed from incarceration because of lost tolerance. And officials will study cases, looking for common factors (such as certain doctors, in the case of prescription\u00addrug overdoses), recent release from prison and so on. The governor is also asking the boards that oversee prescribers to require all practitioners to take continuing education in two areas: Appropriate opioid prescribing and addiction treatment. \"It may be that we're making some progress,\" Sharfstein said. \"It's just hard to say, given the enormous increases affecting the East Coast right now. Everything we're doing is really not enough to turn the corner.\" Susan Svrluga is a reporter for the Washington Post, covering higher education for the Grade Point blog.

It is characterized by intense and, at times, uncontrollable drug craving, along with compulsive drug seeking and use that persist even in the face of devastating consequences. This update of the National Institute on Drug Abuse's Principles of Drug Addiction Treatment is intended to address addiction to a wide variety of drugs, including nicotine, alcohol, and illicit and prescription drugs. It is designed to serve as a resource for healthcare providers, family members, and other stakeholders trying to address the myriad problems faced by patients in need of treatment for drug abuse or addiction. Addiction affects multiple brain circuits, including those involved in reward and motivation, learning and memory , and inhibitory control over behavior. That is why addiction is a brain disease. Some individuals are more vulnerable than others to becoming addicted, depending on the interplay between genetic makeup, age WN\u0003M`XW[]ZM\u0003\\W\u0003LZ]O[\u0014\u0003IVL\u0003W\\PMZ\u0003MV^QZWVUMV\\IT\u0003QV\u00c6]MVKM[\u0016\u0003 While a person initially chooses to take drugs, over time the effects of prolonged exposure on brain functioning compromise that ability to choose, and seeking and consuming the drug become compulsive, often eluding a person's self-control or willpower. But addiction is more than just compulsive drug taking\u2014 it can also produce far-reaching health and social consequences. For example, drug abuse and addiction increase a person's risk for a variety of other mental and physical illnesses related to a drug-abusing lifestyle or the toxic effects of the drugs themselves. Additionally , the dysfunctional behaviors that result from drug abuse can interfere with a person's normal functioning in the family , the workplace, and the broader community . Because drug abuse and addiction have so many dimensions and disrupt so many aspects of an individual's life, treatment is not simple.

Volkow, M.D. Director National Institute on Drug Abuse Nearly four decades of scientic research and clinical practice have yielded a variety of effective approaches to drug addiction treatment. 3 2 Principles of Effective Treatment 1. Addiction is a complex but treatable disease that affects brain function and behavior. Drugs of abuse alter the brain's structure and function, resulting in changes that persist long after drug use has ceased. This may explain why drug abusers are at risk for relapse even after long periods of abstinence and despite the potentially devastating consequences. 2. No single treatment is appropriate for everyone. Treatment varies depending on the type of drug and the characteristics of the patients. Matching treatment settings, interventions, and services to an individual's particular problems and needs is critical to his or her ultimate success in returning to productive functioning in the family, workplace, and society. 3. Treatment needs to be readily available. Because drug-addicted individuals may be uncertain about entering treatment, taking advantage of available services the moment people are ready for treatment is critical. Potential patients can be lost if treatment is not immediately available or readily accessible. As with other chronic diseases, the earlier treatment is offered in the disease process, the greater the likelihood of positive outcomes. 4. Effective treatment attends to multiple needs of the individual, not just his or her drug abuse. To be effective, treatment must address the individual's drug abuse and any associated medical, psychological, social, vocational, and legal problems. It is also important that treatment be appropriate to the individual's age, gender, ethnicity, and culture. 5. Remaining in treatment for an adequate period of time is critical. The appropriate duration for an individual depends on the type and degree of the patient's problems and needs. Research indicates that most addicted individuals need at least 3 months in \\ZMI\\UMV\\\u0003\\W\u0003[QOVQ \u00c5KIV\\Ta\u0003ZML]KM\u0003WZ\u0003[\\WX\u0003\\PMQZ\u0003LZ]O\u0003][M\u0003 and that the best outcomes occur with longer durations of treatment. Recovery from drug addiction is a long- term process and frequently requires multiple episodes of treatment. As with other chronic illnesses, relapses to drug abuse can occur and should signal a need for treatment to be reinstated or adjusted. Because individuals often leave treatment prematurely, programs should include strategies to engage and keep patients in treatment. 6. Behavioral therapies\u2014including individual, family, or group counseling\u2014 are the most commonly used forms of drug abuse treatment. Behavioral therapies vary in their focus and may involve addressing a patient's motivation to change, providing incentives for abstinence, building skills to resist drug use, replacing drug-using activities with constructive and rewarding activities, improving problem-solving skills, and facilitating better interpersonal relationships. Also, participation in group therapy and other peer support programs during and following treatment can help maintain abstinence. 7. Medications are an important element of treatment for many patients, especially when combined with counseling and other behavioral therapies. For example, methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone (including a new long-acting formulation) are effective in helping individuals addicted to heroin or other opioids stabilize their lives and reduce their illicit drug use. Acamprosate, LQ[]T\u00c5ZIU\u0014\u0003IVL\u0003VIT\\ZM`WVM\u0003IZM\u0003UMLQKI\\QWV[\u0003IXXZW^ML\u0003 for treating alcohol dependence. For persons addicted to nicotine, a nicotine replacement product (available as patches, gum, lozenges, or nasal spray) or an oral medication (such as bupropion or varenicline) can be an effective component of treatment when part of a comprehensive behavioral treatment program.3 25 4 5 8. An individual's treatment and services plan must be assessed continually and modied as necessary to ensure that it meets his or her changing needs. A patient may require varying combinations of services and treatment components during the course of treatment and recovery. In addition to counseling or psychotherapy, a patient may require medication, medical services, family therapy, parenting instruction, vocational rehabilitation, and/or social and legal services. For many patients, a continuing care approach provides the best results, with the treatment intensity varying according to a person's changing needs. 9. Many drug-addicted individuals also have other mental disorders. Because drug abuse and addiction\u2014both of which are mental disorders\u2014often co-occur with other mental illnesses, patients presenting with one condition should be assessed for the other(s).

Drug use during treatment must be monitored continuously, as lapses during treatment do occur. Knowing their drug use is being monitored can be a powerful incentive for patients and can help them withstand urges to use drugs. Monitoring also provides an early indication of a return to drug use, signaling a possible need to adjust an individual's treatment plan to better meet his or her needs. 13. Treatment programs should test patients for the presence of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases, as well as provide targeted risk-reduction counseling, linking patients to treatment if necessary. Typically, drug abuse treatment addresses some of the drug-related behaviors that put people at risk of infectious diseases. Targeted counseling focused on reducing infectious disease risk can help patients further reduce or avoid substance- related and other high-risk behaviors. Counseling can also help those who are already infected to manage their illness. Moreover, engaging in substance abuse treatment can facilitate adherence to other medical treatments. Substance abuse treatment facilities should provide onsite, rapid HIV testing rather than referrals to offsite testing\u2014 research shows that doing so increases the likelihood that patients will be tested and receive their test results. Treatment providers should also inform patients that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has proven effective in combating HIV, including among drug- abusing populations, and help link them to HIV treatment if they test positive.7 6 1. Why do drug-addicted persons keep using drugs? Nearly all addicted individuals believe at the outset that they can stop using drugs on their own, and most try to stop without treatment. Although some people are successful, many attempts result in failure to achieve long- term abstinence. Research has shown that long-term drug abuse results in changes in the brain that persist long after a person stops using drugs. These drug-induced changes in brain function can have many behavioral consequences, including an inability to exert control over the impulse \\W\u0003][M\u0003LZ]O[\u0003LM[XQ\\M\u0003IL^MZ[M\u0003KWV[MY]MVKM[\u00b8\\PM\u0003LM \u00c5VQVO\u0003 characteristic of addiction.

Psychological stress from work, family problems, psychiatric illness, pain associated with medical problems, social cues (such as meeting individuals from one's drug- using past), or environmental cues (such as encountering streets, objects, or even smells associated with drug abuse) can trigger intense cravings without the individual even being consciously aware of the triggering event. Any one of these factors can hinder attainment of sustained abstinence and make relapse more likely .

The best programs provide a combination of therapies and other services.9 combination of treatments will vary depending on the patient's individual needs and, often, on the types of drugs they use. Drug addiction treatment can include medications, behavioral therapies, or their combination. Treatment medications, such as methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone (including a new long- acting formulation), are available for individuals addicted to opioids, while nicotine preparations (patches, gum, lozenges, and nasal spray) and the medications varenicline and bupropion are available for individuals addicted to \\WJIKKW\u0016\u0003,Q[]T\u00c5ZIU\u0014\u0003IKIUXZW[I\\M\u0014\u0003IVL\u0003VIT\\ZM`WVM\u0003IZM\u0003 medications available for treating alcohol dependence,1 which commonly co-occurs with other drug addictions, including addiction to prescription medications. Treatments for prescription drug abuse tend to be similar to those for illicit drugs that affect the same brain systems. For example, buprenorphine, used to treat heroin addiction, can also be used to treat addiction to opioid pain medications. Addiction to prescription stimulants, which affect the same brain systems as illicit stimulants like cocaine, can be treated with behavioral therapies, as there are not yet medications for treating addiction to these types of drugs. Behavioral therapies can help motivate people to participate in drug treatment, offer strategies for coping with drug cravings, teach ways to avoid drugs and prevent relapse, and help individuals deal with relapse if it occurs. Behavioral therapies can also help people improve communication, relationship, and parenting skills, as well as family dynamics. 2. What is drug addiction treatment? Drug treatment is intended to help addicted individuals stop compulsive drug seeking and use. Treatment can occur in a variety of settings, take many different forms, and last for different lengths of time. Because drug addiction is typically a chronic disorder characterized by occasional relapses, a short-term, one-time treatment is ][]ITTa\u0003VW\\\u0003[]N \u00c5KQMV\\\u0016\u0003.WZ\u0003UIVa\u0014\u0003\\ZMI\\UMV\\\u0003Q[\u0003I\u0003TWVO\u0015\\MZU\u0003 process that involves multiple interventions and regular monitoring.

How effective is drug addiction treatment? In addition to stopping drug abuse, the goal of treatment is to return people to productive functioning in the family , workplace, and community . According to research that tracks individuals in treatment over extended periods, most people who get into and remain in treatment stop using drugs, decrease their criminal activity , and improve their occupational, social, and psychological functioning. For example, methadone treatment has been shown to increase participation in behavioral therapy and decrease both drug use and criminal behavior. However, individual treatment outcomes depend on the extent and nature of the patient's problems, the appropriateness of treatment and related services used to address those problems, and the quality of interaction between the patient and his or her treatment providers. Relapse rates for addiction resemble those of other chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. Like other chronic diseases, addiction can be managed successfully . Treatment enables people to counteract addiction's powerful disruptive effects on the brain and behavior and to regain control of their lives. The chronic nature of the disease means that relapsing to drug abuse is not only possible but also likely , with symptom recurrence rates similar to those for other well-characterized chronic medical illnesses\u2014such as diabetes, hypertension, and I[\\PUI\u0003\u0010[MM\u0003\u00c5O]ZM\u0014\u0003\u00b9+WUXIZQ[WV\u0003WN\u0003:MTIX[M\u0003:I\\M[\u0003 Between Drug Addiction and Other Chronic Illnesses\")\u2014 that also have both physiological and behavioral components. Many treatment programs employ both individual and group therapies. Group therapy can provide social reinforcement and help enforce behavioral contingencies that promote abstinence and a non-drug-using lifestyle. Some of the more established behavioral treatments, such as contingency management and cognitive-behavioral therapy , are also being adapted for group settings to QUXZW^M\u0003MN \u00c5KQMVKa\u0003IVL\u0003KW[\\\u0015MNNMK\\Q^MVM[[\u0016\u00030W_M^MZ\u0014\u0003 particularly in adolescents, there can also be a danger of unintended harmful (or iatrogenic) effects of group treatment\u2014sometimes group members (especially groups of highly delinquent youth) can reinforce drug use and thereby derail the purpose of the therapy . Thus, trained counselors should be aware of and monitor for such effects. Because they work on different aspects of addiction, combinations of behavioral therapies and medications (when available) generally appear to be more effective than either approach used alone. Finally , people who are addicted to drugs often suffer from other health (e.g., depression, HIV), occupational, legal, familial, and social problems that should be addressed concurrently . The best programs provide a combination of therapies and other services to meet an individual patient's needs. Psychoactive medications, such as antidepressants, anti-anxiety agents, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotic medications, may be critical for treatment success when patients have co-occurring mental disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders (including post-traumatic stress disorder), bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. In addition, most people with severe addiction abuse multiple drugs and require treatment for all substances abused. Treatment for drug abuse and addiction is delivered in many different settings using a variety of behavioral and pharmacological approaches.13 12 health and social costs by far more than the cost of the treatment itself. Treatment is also much less expensive than its alternatives, such as incarcerating addicted persons. For example, the average cost for 1 full year of methadone maintenance treatment is approximately $4,700 per patient, whereas 1 full year of imprisonment costs approximately $24,000 per person. Drug addiction treatment reduces drug use and its associated health and social costs. According to several conservative estimates, every dollar invested in addiction treatment programs yields a return of between $4 and $7 in reduced drug-related crime, criminal justice costs, and theft. When savings related to healthcare are included, total savings can exceed costs by a ratio of 12 to 1. Major savings to the individual and \\W\u0003[WKQM\\a\u0003IT[W\u0003[\\MU\u0003NZWU\u0003NM_MZ\u0003QV\\MZXMZ[WVIT\u0003KWV\u00c6QK\\[#\u0003 greater workplace productivity; and fewer drug-related accidents, including overdoses and deaths.Unfortunately , when relapse occurs many deem treatment a failure.

For example, when a patient is receiving active treatment for hypertension and symptoms decrease, treatment is deemed successful, even though symptoms may recur when treatment is discontinued. For the addicted individual, lapses to drug abuse do not indicate failure\u2014rather, they signify that treatment needs to be reinstated or adjusted, or that alternate treatment Q[\u0003VMMLML\u0003\u0010[MM\u0003\u00c5O]ZM\u0014\u0003\u00b9?Pa\u0003Q[\u0003)LLQK\\QWV\u0003<ZMI\\UMV\\\u0003 Evaluated Differently?\"). 4.

Within a treatment program, successful clinicians can establish a positive, therapeutic relationship with their patients. The clinician should ensure that a treatment plan is developed cooperatively with the person seeking treatment, that the plan is followed, and that treatment expectations are clearly understood. Medical, psychiatric, and social services should also be available. Whether a patient stays in treatment depends on factors associated with both the individual and the program. Because some problems (such as serious medical or mental illness or criminal involvement) increase the likelihood of patients dropping out of treatment, intensive interventions may be required to retain them. After a course of intensive treatment, the provider should ensure a transition to less intensive continuing care to support and monitor individuals in their ongoing recovery . 7. How do we get more substance- abusing people into treatment? 1\\\u0003PI[\u0003JMMV\u0003SVW_V\u0003NWZ\u0003UIVa\u0003aMIZ[\u0003\\PI\\\u0003\\PM\u0003\u00b9\\ZMI\\UMV\\\u0003 gap\" is massive\u2014that is, among those who need treatment for a substance use disorder, few receive it. In 2011, 21.6 million persons aged 12 or older needed treatment for an illicit drug or alcohol use problem, but only 2.3 million received treatment at a specialty substance abuse facility . Reducing this gap requires a multipronged approach. Strategies include increasing access to effective treatment, achieving insurance parity (now in its earliest phase of implementation), reducing stigma, and raising awareness 5. How long does drug addiction treatment usually last? Individuals progress through drug addiction treatment at various rates, so there is no predetermined length of treatment. However, research has shown unequivocally that good outcomes are contingent on adequate treatment length. Generally , for residential or outpatient treatment, participation for less than 90 days is of limited effectiveness, IVL\u0003\\ZMI\\UMV\\\u0003TI[\\QVO\u0003[QOVQ\u00c5KIV\\Ta\u0003TWVOMZ\u0003Q[\u0003ZMKWUUMVLML\u0003NWZ\u0003 maintaining positive outcomes.

Good outcomes are contingent on adequate treatment length. Treatment dropout is one of the major problems encountered by treatment programs; therefore, motivational techniques that can keep patients engaged will also improve outcomes. By viewing addiction as a chronic disease and offering continuing care and monitoring, programs can succeed, but this will often require multiple episodes of treatment and readily readmitting patients that have relapsed. 6.

Whether a patient stays in treatment depends on factors associated with both the individual and the program. Individual factors related to engagement and retention typically include motivation to change drug-using behavior; degree of support from family and friends; and, frequently , 17 16 among both patients and healthcare professionals of the value of addiction treatment. To assist physicians in identifying treatment need in their patients and making appropriate referrals, NIDA is encouraging widespread use of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) tools for use in primary care settings through its NIDAMED initiative. SBIRT , which evidence shows to be effective against tobacco and alcohol use\u2014 and, increasingly , against abuse of illicit and prescription drugs\u2014has the potential not only to catch people before serious drug problems develop but also to identify people in need of treatment and connect them with appropriate treatment providers. 8. How can family and friends make a difference in the life of someone needing treatment? Family and friends can play critical roles in motivating individuals with drug problems to enter and stay in treatment. Family therapy can also be important, especially for adolescents.

How can the workplace play a role in substance abuse treatment? Many workplaces sponsor Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) that offer short-term counseling and/or assistance in linking employees with drug or alcohol problems to local treatment resources, including peer support/recovery groups. In addition, therapeutic work environments that provide employment for drug-abusing individuals who can demonstrate abstinence have been shown not only to promote a continued drug-free lifestyle but also to improve job skills, punctuality , and other behaviors necessary for active employment throughout life. Urine testing facilities, trained personnel, and workplace monitors are needed to implement this type of treatment.11. What role can the criminal justice system play in addressing drug addiction? It is estimated that about one-half of State and Federal prisoners abuse or are addicted to drugs, but relatively few receive treatment while incarcerated. Initiating drug abuse treatment in prison and continuing it upon release is vital to both individual recovery and to public health and safety . Various studies have shown that combining prison- and community-based treatment for addicted offenders reduces the risk of both recidivism to drug- related criminal behavior and relapse to drug use\u2014which, in turn, nets huge savings in societal costs. A 2009 study in Baltimore, Maryland, for example, found that opioid- addicted prisoners who started methadone treatment (along with counseling) in prison and then continued it after release had better outcomes (reduced drug use and criminal activity) than those who only received counseling while in prison or those who only started methadone treatment after their release. Individuals who enter treatment under legal pressure have outcomes as favorable as those who enter treatment voluntarily. The majority of offenders involved with the criminal justice system are not in prison but are under community supervision. For those with known drug problems, drug addiction treatment may be recommended or mandated as a condition of probation. Research has demonstrated that individuals who enter treatment under legal pressure have outcomes as favorable as those who enter treatment voluntarily . The criminal justice system refers drug offenders into treatment through a variety of mechanisms, such as 21 20 diverting nonviolent offenders to treatment; stipulating treatment as a condition of incarceration, probation, or pretrial release; and convening specialized courts, or drug courts, that handle drug offense cases. These courts mandate and arrange for treatment as an alternative to incarceration, actively monitor progress in treatment, and arrange for other services for drug-involved offenders. The most effective models integrate criminal justice and drug treatment systems and services. Treatment and criminal justice personnel work together on treatment planning\u2014including implementation of screening, placement, testing, monitoring, and supervision\u2014as well as on the systematic use of sanctions and rewards. Treatment for incarcerated drug abusers should include continuing care, monitoring, and supervision after incarceration and during parole.

Many life circumstances predominate in women as a group, which may require a specialized treatment approach. For example, research has shown that physical and sexual trauma followed by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is more common in drug-abusing women than in men seeking treatment. 7\\PMZ\u0003NIK\\WZ[\u0003]VQY]M\u0003\\W\u0003_WUMV\u0003\\PI\\\u0003KIV\u0003QV\u00c6]MVKM\u0003\\PM\u0003 treatment process include issues around how they come into treatment (as women are more likely than men to seek the assistance of a general or mental health practitioner), \u00c5VIVKQIT\u0003QVLMXMVLMVKM\u0014\u0003IVL\u0003XZMOVIVKa\u0003IVL\u0003KPQTL\u0003KIZM\u0016 13. What are the unique needs of pregnant women with substance use disorders? Using drugs, alcohol, or tobacco during pregnancy exposes not just the woman but also her developing fetus to the substance and can have potentially deleterious and even long-term effects on exposed children. Smoking during pregnancy can increase risk of stillbirth, infant mortality , sudden infant death syndrome, preterm birth, respiratory problems, slowed fetal growth, and low birth weight. Drinking during pregnancy can lead to the child developing fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by low birth weight and enduring cognitive and behavioral problems. Prenatal use of some drugs, including opioids, may cause a withdrawal syndrome in newborns called neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Babies with NAS are at greater risk of seizures, respiratory problems, NMMLQVO\u0003LQN \u00c5K]T\\QM[\u0014\u0003TW_\u0003JQZ\\P\u0003_MQOP\\\u0014\u0003IVL\u0003M^MV\u0003LMI\\P\u0016\u0003 Research has established the value of evidence-based treatments for pregnant women (and their babies), including medications. For example, although no medications have been FDA-approved to treat opioid dependence in pregnant women, methadone maintenance combined with prenatal care and a comprehensive drug treatment program can improve many of the detrimental outcomes associated with untreated heroin abuse. However, newborns exposed to methadone 23 22 during pregnancy still require treatment for withdrawal symptoms. Recently , another medication option for opioid dependence, buprenorphine, has been shown to produce fewer NAS symptoms in babies than methadone, resulting in shorter infant hospital stays. In general, it is important to closely monitor women who are trying to quit drug use during pregnancy and to provide treatment as needed. 14. What are the unique needs of adolescents with substance use disorders? Adolescent drug abusers have unique needs stemming from their immature neurocognitive and psychosocial stage of development.

Are there specic drug addiction treatments for older adults? With the aging of the baby boomer generation, the composition of the general population is changing dramatically with respect to the number of older adults. Such a change, coupled with a greater history of lifetime drug use (than previous older generations), different cultural norms and general attitudes about drug use, and increases in the availability of psychotherapeutic medications, is already leading to greater drug use by older adults and may increase substance use problems in this population. While substance abuse in older adults often goes unrecognized and therefore untreated, research indicates that currently available addiction treatment programs can be as effective for them as for younger adults.25 24 16. Can a person become addicted to medications prescribed by a doctor? Yes. People who abuse prescription drugs\u2014that is, taking them in a manner or a dose other than prescribed, or taking medications prescribed for another person\u2014risk addiction and other serious health consequences. Such drugs include opioid pain relievers, stimulants used to treat ADHD, and benzodiazepines to treat anxiety or sleep disorders. Indeed, in 2010, an estimated 2.4 million people 12 or older met criteria for abuse of or dependence on prescription drugs, the second most common illicit drug use after marijuana. To minimize these risks, a physician (or other prescribing health provider) should screen patients for prior or current substance abuse problems and assess their family history of substance abuse or addiction before prescribing a psychoactive medication and monitor patients who are prescribed such drugs. Physicians also need to educate patients about the potential risks so that they will follow their physician's instructions faithfully , safeguard their medications, and dispose of them appropriately . 17. Is there a difference between physical dependence and addiction? Yes. Addiction\u2014or compulsive drug use despite harmful consequences\u2014is characterized by an inability to stop using a drug; failure to meet work, social, or family obligations; and, sometimes (depending on the drug), \\WTMZIVKM\u0003IVL\u0003_Q\\PLZI_IT\u0016\u0003<PM\u0003TI\\\\MZ\u0003ZM\u00c6MK\\\u0003XPa[QKIT\u0003 dependence in which the body adapts to the drug, requiring more of it to achieve a certain effect (tolerance) IVL\u0003MTQKQ\\QVO\u0003LZ]O\u0015[XMKQ \u00c5K\u0003XPa[QKIT\u0003WZ\u0003UMV\\IT\u0003[aUX\\WU[\u0003 if drug use is abruptly ceased (withdrawal).

How do other mental disorders coexisting with drug addiction affect drug addiction treatment? Drug addiction is a disease of the brain that frequently occurs with other mental disorders. In fact, as many as 6 in 10 people with an illicit substance use disorder also suffer from another mental illness; and rates are similar for users of licit drugs\u2014i.e., tobacco and alcohol. For \\PM[M\u0003QVLQ^QL]IT[\u0014\u0003WVM\u0003KWVLQ\\QWV\u0003JMKWUM[\u0003UWZM\u0003LQN \u00c5K]T\\\u0003\\W\u0003 treat successfully as an additional condition is intertwined. Thus, people entering treatment either for a substance use disorder or for another mental disorder should be assessed for the co-occurrence of the other condition. Research indicates that treating both (or multiple) illnesses simultaneously in an integrated fashion is generally the best treatment approach for these patients. 27 26 19. Is the use of medications like methadone and buprenorphine simply replacing one addiction with another? No. Buprenorphine and methadone are prescribed or administered under monitored, controlled conditions and are safe and effective for treating opioid addiction when used as directed. They are administered orally or []JTQVO]ITTa\u0003\u0010Q\u0016M\u0016\u0014\u0003]VLMZ\u0003\\PM\u0003\\WVO]M\u0011\u0003QV\u0003[XMKQ \u00c5ML\u0003LW[M[\u0014\u0003IVL\u0003 their effects differ from those of heroin and other abused opioids. Heroin, for example, is often injected, snorted, or smoked, KI][QVO\u0003IV\u0003ITUW[\\\u0003QUUMLQI\\M\u0003\u00b9Z][P\u0014\u00ba\u0003WZ\u0003JZQMN\u0003XMZQWL\u0003 of intense euphoria, that wears off quickly and ends in I\u0003\u00b9KZI[P\u0016\u00ba\u0003<PM\u0003QVLQ^QL]IT\u0003\\PMV\u0003M`XMZQMVKM[\u0003IV\u0003QV\\MV[M\u0003 craving to use the drug again to stop the crash and reinstate the euphoria. The cycle of euphoria, crash, and craving\u2014sometimes repeated several times a day\u2014is a hallmark of addiction and results in severe behavioral disruption. These characteristics result from heroin's rapid onset and short duration of action in the brain. As used in maintenance treatment, methadone and buprenorphine are not heroin/opioid substitutes. In contrast, methadone and buprenorphine have gradual onsets of action and produce stable levels of the drug in the brain. As a result, patients maintained on these medications do not experience a rush, while they also markedly reduce their desire to use opioids. If an individual treated with these medications tries to take an opioid such as heroin, the euphoric effects are usually dampened or suppressed. Patients undergoing maintenance treatment do not experience the physiological or behavioral abnormalities from ZIXQL\u0003\u00c6]K\\]I\\QWV[\u0003QV\u0003LZ]O\u0003TM^MT[\u0003I[[WKQI\\ML\u0003_Q\\P\u0003PMZWQV\u0003 use.

Most drug addiction treatment programs encourage patients to participate in self-help group therapy during and after formal treatment. These groups can be particularly helpful during recovery , offering an added layer of community-level social support to help people achieve and maintain abstinence and other healthy lifestyle behaviors over the course of a lifetime. 29 28 21. Can exercise play a role in the treatment process? Yes. Exercise is increasingly becoming a component of many treatment programs and has proven effective, when combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy , at helping XMWXTM\u0003Y]Q\\\u0003[UWSQVO\u0016\u0003-`MZKQ[M\u0003UIa\u0003M`MZ\\\u0003JMVM \u00c5KQIT\u0003MNNMK\\[\u0003 by addressing psychosocial and physiological needs that nicotine replacement alone does not, by reducing negative feelings and stress, and by helping prevent weight gain following cessation. Research to determine if and how exercise programs can play a similar role in the treatment of other forms of drug abuse is under way . 22. How does drug addiction treatment help reduce the spread of HIV/ AIDS, hepatitis C (HCV), and other infectious diseases? Drug-abusing individuals, including injecting and non- injecting drug users, are at increased risk of human QUU]VWLM \u00c5KQMVKa\u0003^QZ][\u0003\u001001>\u0011\u0014\u0003PMXI\\Q\\Q[\u0003+\u0003^QZ][\u0003 (HCV), and other infectious diseases. These diseases are transmitted by sharing contaminated drug injection equipment and by engaging in risky sexual behavior sometimes associated with drug use. Effective drug abuse treatment is HIV/HCV prevention because it reduces activities that can spread disease, such as sharing injection equipment and engaging in unprotected sexual activity . Counseling that targets a range of HIV/HCV risk behaviors provides an added level of disease prevention. Drug abuse treatment is HIV and HCV prevention. Injection drug users who do not enter treatment are up to six times more likely to become infected with HIV than those who enter and remain in treatment. Participation in treatment also presents opportunities for HIV screening and referral to early HIV treatment. In fact, recent research from NIDA 's National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network showed that providing rapid onsite HIV testing in substance abuse treatment facilities increased patients' likelihood of being tested and of receiving their test results. HIV counseling and testing are key aspects of superior drug abuse treatment programs and should be offered to all individuals entering treatment. Greater availability of inexpensive and unobtrusive rapid HIV tests should increase access to these important aspects of HIV prevention and treatment.31 30Drug Addiction Treatment in the United States Drug addiction is a complex disorder that can involve virtually every aspect of an individual's functioning\u2014in the family, at work and school, and in the community. Because of addiction's complexity and pervasive consequences, drug addiction treatment typically must involve many components. Some of those components focus directly on the individual's drug use; others, like employment training, focus on restoring the addicted individual to productive membership in the family and society (see diagram on page 8), enabling him or her to experience the rewards associated with abstinence. Treatment for drug abuse and addiction is delivered in many different settings using a variety of behavioral and pharmacological approaches. In the United States, more than 14,500 specialized drug treatment facilities provide counseling, behavioral therapy , medication, case management, and other types of services to persons with substance use disorders. Along with specialized drug treatment facilities, drug IJ][M\u0003IVL\u0003ILLQK\\QWV\u0003IZM\u0003\\ZMI\\ML\u0003QV\u0003XPa[QKQIV[\u00bc\u0003WN \u00c5KM[\u0003IVL\u0003 mental health clinics by a variety of providers, including counselors, physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, and social workers.

Because drug abuse and addiction are major public health problems, a large portion of drug treatment is funded by local, State, and Federal governments. Private and employer-subsidized health plans also may provide coverage for treatment of addiction and its medical consequences.

Outpatient Treatment Programs Outpatient treatment varies in the types and intensity of services offered. Such treatment costs less than residential or inpatient treatment and often is more suitable for people with jobs or extensive social supports. It should be noted, however, that low-intensity programs may offer little more than drug education. Other outpatient models, such as intensive day treatment, can be comparable to residential programs in services and effectiveness, depending on the individual patient's characteristics and needs. In many outpatient programs, group counseling can be a major component. Some outpatient programs are also designed to treat patients with medical or other mental health problems in addition to their drug disorders.

These programs were originally designed to treat alcohol problems, but during the cocaine epidemic of the mid-1980s, many began to treat other types of substance use disorders. The original residential treatment model consisted of a 3- to 6-week hospital-based inpatient treatment phase followed by extended outpatient therapy and participation in a self-help group, such as AA. Following stays in residential treatment programs, it is important for individuals to remain engaged in outpatient treatment programs and/or aftercare programs. These programs help to reduce the risk of relapse once a patient leaves the residential setting.37 36 Treating Criminal Justice-Involved Drug Abusers and Addicted Individuals Often, drug abusers come into contact with the criminal justice system earlier than other health or social systems, presenting opportunities for intervention and treatment prior to, during, after, or in lieu of incarceration. Research has shown that combining criminal justice sanctions with drug treatment can be effective in decreasing drug abuse and related crime. Individuals under legal coercion tend to stay in treatment longer and do as well as or better than those not under legal pressure. Studies show that for incarcerated individuals with drug problems, starting drug abuse treatment in prison and continuing the same treatment upon release\u2014in other words, a seamless continuum of services\u2014results in better outcomes: less drug use and less criminal behavior. More information on how the criminal justice system can address the problem of drug addiction can be found in Principles of Drug Abuse Treatment for Criminal Justice Populations: A Research-Based Guide (National Institute on Drug Abuse, Grisson, G.; .

Individualized Drug Counseling Individualized drug counseling not only focuses on reducing or stopping illicit drug or alcohol use; it also addresses related areas of impaired functioning\u2014such as employment status, illegal activity , and family/social relations\u2014as well as the content and structure of the patient's recovery program. Through its emphasis on short-term behavioral goals, individualized counseling helps the patient develop coping strategies and tools to abstain from drug use and maintain abstinence. The addiction counselor encourages 12-step participation (at least one or two times per week) and makes referrals for needed supplemental medical, psychiatric, employment, and other services. Group Counseling Many therapeutic settings use group therapy to capitalize on the social reinforcement offered by peer discussion and to help promote drug-free lifestyles.

Currently , researchers are testing conditions in which group therapy can be standardized and made more community-friendly .39 38 This section presents examples of treatment approaches and components that have an evidence base supporting their use. Each approach is designed to address certain aspects of drug addiction and its consequences for the individual, family , and society . Some of the approaches are intended to supplement or enhance existing treatment programs, and others are fairly comprehensive in and of themselves. The following section is broken down into Pharmacotherapies, Behavioral Therapies, and Behavioral Therapies Primarily for Adolescents. They are further subdivided according to particular substance use disorders. This list is not exhaustive, and new treatments are continually under development. Pharmacotherapies Opioid Addiction Methadone Methadone is a long-acting synthetic opioid agonist medication that can prevent withdrawal symptoms and reduce craving in opioid-addicted individuals. It can also block the effects of illicit opioids. It has a long history of use in treatment of opioid dependence in adults and is taken orally . Methadone maintenance treatment is available in all but three States through specially licensed opioid treatment programs or methadone maintenance programs. Combined with behavioral treatment Research has shown that methadone maintenance is more effective when it includes individual and/or group counseling, with even better outcomes when patients are provided with, or referred to, other needed medical/ psychiatric, psychological, and social services (e.g., employment or family services).Evidence-Based Approaches to Drug Addiction Treatment Each approach to drug treatment is designed to address certain aspects of drug addiction and its consequences for the individual, family, and society.41 40 *]XZMVWZXPQVM\u0003\\ZMI\\UMV\\\u0003NWZ\u0003LM\\W`Q\u00c5KI\\QWV\u0003IVL\u0017WZ\u0003 UIQV\\MVIVKM\u0003KIV\u0003JM\u0003XZW^QLML\u0003QV\u0003WN \u00c5KM\u0015JI[ML\u0003[M\\\\QVO[\u0003Ja\u0003 Y]ITQ\u00c5ML\u0003XPa[QKQIV[\u0003_PW\u0003PI^M\u0003ZMKMQ^ML\u0003I\u0003_IQ^MZ\u0003NZWU\u0003\\PM\u0003 Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), them \\W\u0003XZM[KZQJM\u0003Q\\\u0016\u0003<PM\u0003I^IQTIJQTQ\\a\u0003WN\u0003WN \u00c5KM\u0015JI[ML\u0003\\ZMI\\UMV\\\u0003 for opioid addiction is a cost-effective approach that increases the reach of treatment and the options available to patients.

Buprenorphine Buprenorphine is a synthetic opioid medication that acts as a partial agonist at opioid receptors\u2014it does not produce the euphoria and sedation caused by heroin or other opioids but is able to reduce or eliminate withdrawal symptoms associated with opioid dependence and carries a low risk of overdose. Buprenorphine is currently available in two formulations that are taken sublingually: (1) a pure form of the drug and (2) a more commonly prescribed formulation called Suboxone, which combines buprenorphine with the drug naloxone, an antagonist (or blocker) at opioid receptors. Naloxone has no effect when Suboxone is taken as prescribed, but if an addicted individual attempts to inject Suboxone, the naloxone will produce severe withdrawal symptoms. Thus, this formulation lessens the likelihood that the drug will be abused or diverted to others. 43 42 or parolees. Recently , a long-acting injectable version of naltrexone, called Vivitrol, was approved to treat opioid addiction. Because it only needs to be delivered once a month, this version of the drug can facilitate compliance and offers an alternative for those who do not wish to be placed on agonist/partial agonist medications.

Paper presented at the 2010 annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, New Orleans, LA. Tobacco Addiction Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) A variety of formulations of nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) now exist, including the transdermal nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenges. Because nicotine is the main addictive ingredient in tobacco, the rationale for NRT is that stable low levels of nicotine will prevent withdrawal symptoms\u2014which often drive continued tobacco use\u2014and help keep people motivated to quit. Research shows that combining the patch with another replacement therapy is more effective than a single therapy alone.Treatment, not Substitution Because methadone and buprenorphine are themselves opioids, some people view these treatments for opioid dependence as just substitutions of one addictive drug for another (see Question 19 above). But taking these medications as prescribed allows patients to hold jobs, avoid street crime and violence, and reduce their exposure to HIV by stopping or decreasing injection drug use and drug-related high-risk sexual behavior. Patients stabilized on these medications can also engage more readily in counseling and other behavioral interventions essential to recovery . Naltrexone Naltrexone is a synthetic opioid antagonist\u2014it blocks opioids from binding to their receptors and thereby prevents their euphoric and other effects. It has been used for many years to reverse opioid overdose and is also approved for treating opioid addiction. The theory behind this treatment is that the repeated absence of the desired effects and the perceived futility of abusing opioids will gradually diminish craving and addiction.

Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association 48(5):659-665, 2008.Bupropion (Zyban\u00ae) Bupropion was originally marketed as an antidepressant (Wellbutrin). It produces mild stimulant effects by blocking the reuptake of certain neurotransmitters, especially norepinephrine and dopamine. A serendipitous observation among depressed patients was that the medication was also effective in suppressing tobacco craving, helping them quit smoking without also gaining weight. Although bupropion's exact mechanisms of action in facilitating smoking cessation are unclear, it has FDA approval as a smoking cessation treatment. Varenicline (Chantix\u00ae) Varenicline is the most recently FDA-approved medication for smoking cessation. It acts on a subset of nicotinic receptors in the brain thought to be involved in the rewarding effects of nicotine. Varenicline acts as a partial agonist/antagonist at these receptors\u2014this means that it UQTLTa\u0003[\\QU]TI\\M[\u0003\\PM\u0003VQKW\\QVM\u0003ZMKMX\\WZ\u0003J]\\\u0003VW\\\u0003[]N \u00c5KQMV\\Ta\u0003 to trigger the release of dopamine, which is important for the rewarding effects of nicotine. As an antagonist, varenicline also blocks the ability of nicotine to activate dopamine, interfering with the reinforcing effects of smoking, thereby reducing cravings and supporting abstinence from smoking. Combined With Behavioral Treatment Each of the above pharmacotherapies is recommended for use in combination with behavioral interventions, including group and individual therapies, as well as telephone quitlines. Behavioral approaches complement most tobacco addiction treatment programs. They can amplify the effects of medications by teaching people how to manage stress, recognize and avoid high-risk situations for smoking relapse, and develop alternative coping strategies (e.g., cigarette refusal skills, assertiveness, and time management skills) that they can practice in 47 46 is generally poor.

Current research focuses on how to produce even more powerful effects by combining CBT with medications for drug abuse and with other types of behavioral therapies. A computer-based CBT system has also been developed and has been shown to be effective in helping reduce drug use following standard drug abuse treatment.

Below are a number of behavioral therapies shown to be effective in addressing substance abuse (effectiveness with particular drugs of abuse is denoted in parentheses). Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (Alcohol, Marijuana, Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Nicotine) Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) was developed as a method to prevent relapse when treating problem drinking, and later it was adapted for cocaine-addicted individuals. Cognitive-behavioral strategies are based on the theory that in the development of maladaptive behavioral patterns like substance abuse, learning processes play a critical role. Individuals in CBT learn to identify and correct problematic behaviors by applying a range of different skills that can be used to stop drug abuse and to address a range of other problems that often co-occur with it. A central element of CBT is anticipating likely problems and enhancing patients' self-control by helping them LM^MTWX\u0003MNNMK\\Q^M\u0003KWXQVO\u0003[\\ZI\\MOQM[\u0016\u0003;XMKQ\u00c5K\u0003\\MKPVQY]M[\u000351 50 more times weekly), participants supplying drug-negative urine or breath tests draw from a bowl for the chance to win a prize worth between $1 and $100. Participants may also receive draws for attending counseling sessions and completing weekly goal-related activities. The number of draws starts at one and increases with consecutive negative drug tests and/or counseling sessions attended but resets to one with any drug-positive sample or unexcused absence. The practitioner community has raised concerns that this intervention could promote gambling\u2014as it contains an element of chance\u2014and that pathological gambling and substance use disorders can be comorbid. However, studies examining this concern found that Prize Incentives CM did not promote gambling behavior.

Contingency Management Interventions/ Motivational Incentives (Alcohol, Stimulants, Opioids, Marijuana, Nicotine) Research has demonstrated the effectiveness of treatment approaches using contingency management (CM) principles, which involve giving patients tangible rewards to reinforce positive behaviors such as abstinence. Studies conducted in both methadone programs and psychosocial counseling treatment programs demonstrate that incentive-based interventions are highly effective in increasing treatment retention and promoting abstinence from drugs. V oucher-Based Reinforcement (VBR) augments other community-based treatments for adults who primarily abuse opioids (especially heroin) or stimulants (especially cocaine) or both. In VBR, the patient receives a voucher for every drug-free urine sample provided. The voucher has monetary value that can be exchanged for food items, movie passes, or other goods or services that are consistent with a drug-free lifestyle. The voucher values are low at \u00c5Z[\\\u0014\u0003J]\\\u0003QVKZMI[M\u0003I[\u0003\\PM\u0003V]UJMZ\u0003WN\u0003KWV[MK]\\Q^M\u0003LZ]O\u0015NZMM\u0003 urine samples increases; positive urine samples reset the value of the vouchers to the initial low value.

Community Reinforcement Approach Plus Vouchers (Alcohol, Cocaine, Opioids) Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) Plus Vouchers is an intensive 24-week outpatient therapy for treating people addicted to cocaine and alcohol. It uses a range of recreational, familial, social, and vocational reinforcers, along with material incentives, to make a non- drug-using lifestyle more rewarding than substance use. The treatment goals are twofold: \u008c\u0003To maintain abstinence long enough for patients to learn new life skills to help sustain it; and\u008c\u0003To reduce alcohol consumption for patients whose drinking is associated with cocaine use Patients attend one or two individual counseling sessions each week, where they focus on improving family relations, learn a variety of skills to minimize drug use, receive vocational counseling, and develop new recreational activities and social networks.

Patients submit urine samples two or three times each week and receive vouchers for cocaine-negative samples. As in VBR, the value of the vouchers increases with consecutive clean samples, and the vouchers may be exchanged for retail goods that are consistent with a drug- free lifestyle. Studies in both urban and rural areas have found that this approach facilitates patients' engagement in treatment and successfully aids them in gaining substantial periods of cocaine abstinence. A computer-based version of CRA Plus Vouchers called the Therapeutic Education System (TES) was found to be nearly as effective as treatment administered by a therapist in promoting abstinence from opioids and cocaine among opioid-dependent individuals in outpatient treatment. A version of CRA for adolescents addresses problem-solving, coping, and communication skills and encourages active participation in positive social and recreational activities.

Motivational Enhancement Therapy (Alcohol, Marijuana, Nicotine) Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) is a counseling approach that helps individuals resolve their ambivalence about engaging in treatment and stopping their drug use. This approach aims to evoke rapid and internally motivated change, rather than guide the patient stepwise through the recovery process. This therapy consists of an initial assessment battery session, followed by two to four individual treatment sessions with I\u0003\\PMZIXQ[\\\u0016\u00031V\u0003\\PM\u0003\u00c5Z[\\\u0003\\ZMI\\UMV\\\u0003[M[[QWV\u0014\u0003\\PM\u0003\\PMZIXQ[\\\u0003 provides feedback to the initial assessment, stimulating discussion about personal substance use and eliciting self-motivational statements. Motivational interviewing principles are used to strengthen motivation and build a plan for change. Coping strategies for high-risk situations are suggested and discussed with the patient. In subsequent sessions, the therapist monitors change, reviews cessation strategies being used, and continues to encourage commitment to change or sustained abstinence. 8I\\QMV\\[\u0003[WUM\\QUM[\u0003IZM\u0003MVKW]ZIOML\u0003\\W\u0003JZQVO\u0003I\u0003[QOVQ\u00c5KIV\\\u0003 other to sessions. Research on MET suggests that its effects depend on the type of drug used by participants and on the goal of the intervention. This approach has been used successfully with people addicted to alcohol to both improve their engagement in treatment and reduce their problem drinking. MET has also been used successfully with marijuana-dependent adults when combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy , constituting a more comprehensive treatment approach. The results of MET are mixed for people abusing other drugs (e.g., heroin, cocaine, nicotine) and for adolescents who tend to use multiple drugs. In general, MET seems to be more effective for engaging drug abusers in treatment than for producing changes in drug use. Further Reading: Baker, A.; Lewin, T .; Devir, H.; and Terry , M.

The Matrix Model (Stimulants) The Matrix Model provides a framework for engaging stimulant (e.g., methamphetamine and cocaine) abusers in treatment and helping them achieve abstinence. Patients learn about issues critical to addiction and relapse, receive direction and support from a trained therapist, and become familiar with self-help programs. Patients are monitored for drug use through urine testing. The therapist functions simultaneously as teacher and coach, fostering a positive, encouraging relationship with the patient and using that relationship to reinforce positive behavior change. The interaction between the therapist and the patient is authentic and direct but not confrontational or parental. Therapists are trained to conduct treatment sessions in a way that promotes the patient's self-esteem, dignity , and self-worth. A positive relationship between patient and therapist is critical to patient retention. Treatment materials draw heavily on other tested treatment approaches and, thus, include elements of relapse prevention, family and group therapies, drug education, and self-help participation. Detailed treatment manuals contain worksheets for individual sessions; other components include family education groups, early recovery skills groups, relapse prevention groups, combined sessions, urine tests, 12-step programs, relapse analysis, and social support groups.

Brief Strategic Family Therapy Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) targets family interactions that are thought to maintain or exacerbate adolescent drug abuse and other co-occurring problem behaviors. Such problem behaviors include conduct problems at home and at school, oppositional behavior, delinquency , associating with antisocial peers, aggressive and violent behavior, and risky sexual behavior. BSFT is based on a family systems approach to treatment, in which family members' behaviors are assumed to be interdependent such that the symptoms of one member (the drug-abusing adolescent, for example) are indicative, at least in part, of what else is occurring in the family system. The role of the BSFT counselor is to identify the patterns of family interaction that are associated with the adolescent's behavior problems and to assist in changing those problem-maintaining family patterns.

Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach and Assertive Continuing Care The Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) is another comprehensive substance abuse treatment intervention that involves the adolescent and his or her family . It seeks to support the individual's recovery by increasing family , social, and educational/ vocational reinforcers. After assessing the adolescent's needs and levels of functioning, the therapist chooses from among 17 A-CRA procedures to address problem-solving, coping, and communication skills and to encourage active participation in positive social and recreational activities. A-CRA skills training involves role-playing and behavioral rehearsal. Assertive Continuing Care (ACC) is a home-based continuing-care approach to preventing relapse. Weekly home visits take place over a 12- to 14-week period after an adolescent is discharged from residential, intensive outpatient, or regular outpatient treatment. Using positive and negative reinforcement to shape behaviors, along with training in problem-solving and communication skills, ACC combines A-CRA and assertive case management services (e.g., use of a multidisciplinary team of professionals, round-the-clock coverage, assertive outreach) to help adolescents and their caregivers acquire the skills to engage in positive social activities. 67 66 Further Reading: Dennis, J.C.; Kamier, Y .; Webb, Funk R.

Established in 1999, NIDA 's National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) uses community settings with diverse patient populations and conditions to adjust and test protocols to meet the practical needs of addiction treatment. Since its inception, the CTN has tested pharmacological and behavioral interventions for drug abuse and addiction, along with common co-occurring conditions (e.g., HIV and PTSD) among various target populations, including adolescent drug abusers, pregnant drug-abusing women, and Spanish- speaking patients. The CTN has also tested prevention strategies in drug-abusing groups at high risk for HCV and HIV and has become a key element of NIDA 's multipronged approach to move promising science-based drug addiction treatments rapidly into community settings. For more information on the CTN, please visit drugabuse. gov/CTN/Index.htm . Criminal Justice-Drug Abuse Treatment Studies NIDA is taking an approach similar to the CTN to enhance treatment for drug-addicted individuals involved with the criminal justice system through Criminal Justice-Drug Abuse Treatment Studies (CJ-DATS). Whereas NIDA 's CTN has as its overriding mission the improvement of the quality of drug abuse treatment by moving innovative approaches into the larger community , research supported through CJ-DATS is designed to effect change by bringing new treatment models into the criminal justice system and thereby improve outcomes for offenders with substance use disorders. It seeks to achieve better integration of drug abuse treatment with other public health and public safety forums and represents a collaboration among NIDA; SAMHSA; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Department of Justice agencies; and a host of drug treatment, criminal justice, and health and social service professionals. Blending Teams Another way in which NIDA is seeking to actively move science into practice is through a joint venture with SAMHSA and its nationwide network of Addiction Technology Transfer Centers (ATTCs). This process involves the collaborative efforts of community treatment practitioners, SAMHSA trainers, and NIDA researchers, [WUM\u0003WN\u0003_PWU\u0003NWZU\u0003\u00b9*TMVLQVO\u0003<MIU[\u00ba\u0003\\W\u0003KZMI\\M\u0003 products and devise strategic dissemination plans for them.

The Vendor Accuracy Study [PDF]compared total population and households data from Esri and four other major demographic data vendors to the Census 2010 results. The study found that Esri's Updated Demographics data variables were the most accurate across all geographies in the United States, especially at the census tract and block group geography levels, which are especially difficult to forecast. \"Esri had the lowest score in population, household, and overall error,\" said the authors of the study in their final report. (Lower scores indicate higher accuracy rates.) Scorecards were developed to summarize each vendor's relative performance. Lower scores reflect the most precise data, meaning the highest accuracy. Built on Census 2010 data and in 2010 geography, Esri's Updated Demographics data contains current-year estimates and five-year projections for categories such as population, households, income, and housing. Esri provides the data in standard census geographies such as states, counties, census tracts, and block groups and user-defined areas such as rings, drive times, and hand-drawn areas to enable even more precise analysis. Study Commissioned by Esri The decennial census, conducted every 10 years, gives data vendors the opportunity to evaluate the accuracy of their annual demographic estimates by conducting a benchmark study comparing the data forecasts to census results. Data vendors also can learn how their estimates compare to those of other providers. In 2011, following the 2010 Census, Esri commissioned an independent study to obtain an unbiased answer about its data accuracy. Esri sponsored the study to identify areas where its methodologies could be improved and ensure that Esri provides the most accurate demographic data to its users. \"Because an analysis of this magnitude\u2014especially at the census tract and block group geography levels\u2014has never before been undertaken, the research provides groundbreaking insight into error analysis and the testing of error measurement,\" said Lynn Wombold, Esri's chief demographer. Why are Esri's demographic data estimates and projections so accurate? According to Wombold, Esri's data development team continually improves the accuracy of demographic data updates by ground- truthing housing data at the block group level; by including non-traditional data such as residential Tweet 0News 0 661 Industries Products Support & Services About CommunitySign In Page 1of 2 And the Study Says, \"Esri Current Events Maps Disaster Response ArcNews ArcUser ArcWatch Subscribe to Publications Media RelationsCompany Information About Esri Careers Esri Insider Blog Esri International User ConferenceUnderstanding GIS What Is GIS?

The Vendor Accuracy Study was conducted by Matthew Cropper, GISP, of Cropper GIS; Jerome N. McKibben, PhD, McKibben Demographic Research; David A. Swanson, PhD, University of California, Riverside; and Jeff Tayman, PhD, University of California, San Diego. The research team included geographers and demographers who are noted authorities on small-area forecasts and measures of forecast accuracy. Data from each of the individual vendors was provided to the research team and identified only by number, enabling a completely blind study. The researchers had no idea which vendor's data was included or the methodologies used by the respective vendors. Why Accurate Demographic Data Is Important Many people assume that all demographic data is the same because all data providers use census data as the foundation to build their demographic data offerings. Differences in demographic data accuracy can occur with the addition of data from other sources and the methodologies developed by each data vendor. However, demographic estimates and forecasts can vary significantly from vendor to vendor. Data inaccuracies may occur by either over- or underestimating populations or the number of households, with dramatic consequences for agencies and businesses, which analyze demographic data for a variety of reasons, such as designating areas that need additional social or health care services, deciding where to open new stores, or identifying residential areas that are at high risk for fires. Health care providers that use faulty data could underestimate populations and miss vaccinating vulnerable people or waste doses by overestimating numbers. Retailers that locate a new store based on overestimated population data risk losing significant revenue. Local government officials who calculate area populations with poor data might lose grant funds. Public safety agencies could overlook people who have special needs before, during, and after a disaster. Does data accuracy matter? Yes, it does\u2014in terms of dollars, health, grants, and services\u2014and, in some cases, even life itself. Esri's Updated Demographics data is available as a database in a variety of formats including shapefile, file geodatabase, and Microsoft Excel.

The 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) has the potential to extend coverage to many of the 47 million nonelderly uninsured people nationwide, including the 756,000 uninsured Marylanders . The ACA establishes coverage provisions across the income spectrum, with the expansion of Medicaid eligibility for adults serving as the vehicle for covering low -income individuals and premium tax credits to help people purchase insurance directly through new Health Insurance Marketplaces serving as the vehicle for covering peo ple with moderate incomes. The June 2012 Supreme Court ruling made the Medicaid expansion optional for states, and as of December 2013, Maryland was planning to implement the expansion in 2014. As a result, the ACA will be fully implemented in Maryland , and almost all nonelderly uninsured, most of whom are adults, are eligible for coverage expansions. As the ACA coverage expansions are implemented and coverage changes are assessed, it is important to understand the potential scope of the law in the state. HOW D OES THE ACA EXPAND H EALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE IN MARYLAND ? Historically, Medicaid had gaps in coverage for adults because eligibility was restricted to specific categories of low -income individuals, such as children, their parents, pregnant women, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities. In most states, adults without dependent children were ineligible for Medicaid, regardless of their income, and income limits for parents were very low\u2014often below half the poverty level.1 The ACA aimed to fill in these gaps by extending Medicaid to nearly all nonelderly adults with incomes at or below 138% of poverty (about $32,500 for a family of four in 2013). Thus, as of January 2014, Medicaid eligibility in Maryland cover s almost all nonelderly adults up to 138% of poverty, as shown by the dark blue shading in Figure 1. All states previously expanded eligibility for children to higher levels than adults through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and in Maryland , children with family incomes up to 322% of poverty (about $ 75,800 for a family of four) are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. As was the case before the ACA, undocumented immigrants remain ineligible to enroll in Medicaid, and recent lawfully residing immigrants are subject to ce rtain Medicaid eligibility restrictions. 2 Under the ACA, p eople with incomes between 100% and 400% of poverty may be eligible for premium tax credits when they purchase coverage in a Marketplace. The amount of the tax credit is based on income and the cost of insurance, and tax credits are only available to people who are not eligible for other cov erage, such as Medicaid/CHIP, Medicare, or employer coverage, and who are citizens or lawfully -present immigrants. Thus, the effective lower income limit for tax credits in Maryland is 322% of poverty for children and 138% of poverty for adults , as indicat ed by the bright blue shading in Figure 1. Citizens and lawfully -present immigrants with incomes above 400% of poverty can purchase unsubsidized coverage through the Marketplace.

With Maryland deciding to implement the Medicaid expansion, nearly six in ten ( 59%) uninsured nonelderly people in the state are eligible for financial assistance to gain coverage through either Medicaid or the Marketplaces (Figure 2). Given the income distrib ution of the uninsured in the state, the main pathway for coverage is Medicaid, with four in ten (40%) uninsured Marylanders eligible for either Medicaid or CHIP as of 2014. While some of these people (such as eligible children) are eligible under pathways in place before the ACA, most adults are newly -eligible through the ACA expansion. One in five (20%) uninsured people in Maryland are eligible for premium tax credits to help them purchase coverage in the Marketplace. Other uninsured Marylanders may gai n coverage under the ACA but will not receive direct financial assistance. These people include the 23 percent with incomes above the limit for premium tax subsidies or who have an affordable offer of coverage through their employer. Some of these people a re still be able to purchase unsubsidized coverage in the Marketplace, which may be more affordable or more comprehensive than coverage they could obtain on their own through the individual market. Last ly, the approximately 17 percent of uninsured people in Maryland who are undocumented immigrants are ineligible for financial assistance under the ACA and barred from purchasing coverage through the Marketplaces. This group is likely to remain uninsured, though they will still ha ve a need for health care services. *** The ACA will help many currently uninsured Marylanders gain health coverage by providing coverage options across the income spectrum for low and moderate -income people. While almost all of the uninsured in Maryland are eligible for some type of coverage under the ACA, the impact of the ACA will depend on take- up of coverage among the eligible uninsured, and outreach and enrollment efforts will be an important factor in decreasing the uninsured rate. The ACA includes a requirement that most individuals obtain health coverage, but some people (such as the lowest income or those without an affordable option) are exempt and others may still remain uninsured. There is no deadline for enrolling in Medicaid coverage under t he ACA, and open enrollment in the Marketplaces continues through March 2014. Continued attention to who gains coverage as the ACA is fully implemented and who is excluded from its reach \u2014as well as whether and how their health needs are being met \u2014can help inform decisions about the future of health coverage in Maryland . 1 Some states had expanded coverage to parents at higher income levels or provided coverage to adults without children. See http://www.kff.org/medicaid/fact -sheet/medicaid -eligibility -for-adults -as-of-january -1-2014/ for more detail on pre - and post -ACA Medicaid eligibility for adults. 2 For more detail on Medicaid coverage for immigrants, see sum to 100% due to rounding. People who have an affordable offer of coverage through their employer or other source of public coverage (such as Medicare or CHAMPUS) are ineligible for tax credits. Unauthorized immigrants are ineligibl e for either Medicaid/CHIP or Marketplace coverage.

DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 3 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Agenda Item Number 3 is Father 1 Martin's Ashley has applied for a Certificate of Need to 2 construct a new two -story building to address deficiencies in 3 the existing physical facilities. 4 Joel Riklin, Acting Chief of the Certificate of Need , 5 will present the staff recommendation. Joel. 6 MR. RIKLIN: Chairman Tanio and Commissioners, you 7 have before you a proposal by Ashley, Incorporated, doing 8 business as Father Martin's Ashley, to modernize and expand its 9 existing facility. And I might refer to it as FMA at times 10 during this presentation. 11 Father Martin's Ashley provide s in-patient alcoholism 12 and drug abuse treatment services on its campus in Havre de 13 Grace. The applicant proposes construction of a new buil ding, 14 approximately 42,000 square feet. This building will increase 15 its bed capacity by 15, from 85 beds to 100, and address a 16 number of deficiencies in its existing physical plan, including 17 replacing patient rooms and attic space that is currently 18 unsuitable for occupancy and causes the facility to actually 19 operate only 78 of its beds. 20 It will also eliminate patient rooms with more than 21 two beds. It will increase the number of private rooms from 11 22 to 20. It will also consolidate the admission and intak e 23 process. The project costs $18,653,000. The funding, expected 24 funding is -- at least initial funding -- is $6 million in cash, 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 4 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 approximately $5.7 million in fundraising, which has already 1 been received or pledged and $7 million in debt in the form of a 2 letter of credit or a five -year bond. The applicant expects to 3 pay off the debt through additional fundraising. 4 Now, this application is relatively new to this CON 5 program. It's only the second application from an alcoholism 6 and drug abuse treatment fa cility in the last 12 years. And the 7 way the State Health Plan regulates these facilities is actually 8 there are two different types. There is those that have over 50 9 percent public funding and those are considered Track 2. And 10 then there are those with less than 50 percent public funding, 11 and that's Track 1. 12 Father Martin's Ashley is a Track 1. And it's the 13 only private application we've received in the 12 years. The 14 other application was from a state -run facility. Father 15 Martin's Ashley is also uniqu e in that half of its admissions 16 come from outside the State of Maryland. 17 The applicant is also relevant and unusual because it 18 doesn't not accept any payment from Medicaid or any other public 19 funding. Of the 10 intermediate care, drug , and alcohol 20 treatment facilities in Central Maryland, there is only one 21 other facility that does not appear to accept any public 22 funding. 23 Now, this application is covered by the State Health 24 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 5 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 Plan chapter for alcoholism, drug abuse, intermediate care, 1 facility treatment ser vices. That's a mouthful. And some of 2 you may remember, in 2012, the applicant petitioned the 3 Commission to amend the docketing requirements of this plan 4 chapter that had required a minimum occupancy rate of licensed 5 beds and a minimum number of days to be provided to indigent and 6 near indigent patients before the Commission would consider the 7 application. 8 Father Martin's Ashley didn't meet the licensed bed 9 occupancy -docketing requirement at the time because, as I 10 pointed out, it doesn't use all of its be ds. It also didn't 11 meet the docketing requirement with regard to service to the 12 indigent and near indigent population and claimed that it could 13 not meet this requirement and viably operate. 14 The Commission staff proposed plan amendments to 15 address these co ncerns, which were adopted and became effective 16 in February of this year. To address the concern of how bed 17 occupancy will be considered, the amendments allow consideration 18 of occupancy rate for operating bed capacity when some portion 19 of a license, bed c apacity is not usable. 20 To address the concern about -- with the minimum 21 service to indigent and near indigent care, the docketing rule 22 is eliminated. And consistent with the approach taken in other 23 State Health Plan Chapters, the requirement was included in a 24 State Health Plan check standard, which allows us to consider 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 6 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 what the applicant has done in the past and what they're 1 proposing to do in the future in this regard. 2 The standard now requires the Commission to consider 3 the financial feasibility of the applicant meeting the state d 4 minimum, which was 15 percent of its patient days being provided 5 to indigent and near indigent patients. 6 These amendments were considered in this review, as 7 well as the other State Health Plan standards and the review 8 criteria . Staff finds that the proposed project complies with 9 the applicable State Health Plan standards and that 10 consideration of the project, in light of the required review 11 criteria , support approval. 12 Staff finds that the proposed project meets a need to 13 modernize Father Martin's Ashley campus. Staff also finds that 14 there is a need for more Track 1 beds to serve residents of 15 Central Maryland, and that the addition of the 15 beds will have 16 little or no impact in other providers, in part because of the 17 multi-state service area of Father Martin's Ashley. 18 Staff also found that the applicant has demonstrated 19 that it has the financial resources to undertake and sustain the 20 project. While staff found the applicant to be consistent with 21 all State Health Plan standards , Father Martin's Ashley's 22 commitment to provide charity care to the indigent and near 23 indigent is significantly less than the target amount. However, 24 it is a significant increase. They are proposing an increase 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 7 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 currently from 3.4 percent of patient stays to 6.3 percent. And 1 this is just for the indigent and near indigent population. 2 And we also feel that it's possible that the State 3 Health Plan requirement is somewhat high. One comparison -- not 4 strictly in apples -to-apples but somewhat -- is if you lo ok at 5 what Maryland hospitals do. For Fiscal Year 2012, the range of 6 charity care for Maryland Hospitals was .44 percent , a low, to a 7 high of 11.8 percent, with a median of about 3.5 percent. 8 The applicant 's charity care, which also includes 9 charity care to non-indigent, which was about 13 percent of 10 operating expenses in FY2012, and they are projecting it to be 11 17 percent in Fiscal Year of 2017. 12 To ensure that Father Martin follows through on its 13 commitment expressed in this application regarding the care to 14 indigent and near indigent, staff recommends that there be a 15 condition that Father Martin report -- provide audited data to 16 show that they are providing this care. 17 Staff also found that the applicant's failure to 18 report to the alcohol and drug abuse ad ministration substance 19 abuse information system was disappointing. While it, the 20 applicant , has not been required to report because it is -- 21 doesn't accept public funds, and the standard only requires that 22 they agree to report, we think the Father Martin' s Ashley has 23 been dealing with this, the standards and this standard in 24 particular, for a period of time whil e they develop this 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 8 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 application and should have had time to start reporting. 1 Therefore, staff recommends that the approval be 2 conditioned on the applicant, commencing reporting within six 3 months of the approval. Staff also found that while Father 4 Martin has demonstrated the selection of the most cost -effective 5 alternative to accomplish its objectives to modernize and add 6 beds that it does not have a formal process to track and measure 7 the effectiveness of its programs. It does not quantitatively 8 compare its performance or success to other similar facilities. 9 Therefore, staff recommends a third condition that 10 Father Martin's Ashley report back to t he Commission on its 11 efforts to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of its 12 approach to treatment through rigorous follow -up evaluation of 13 treatment succ ess and collaborative efforts with similar 14 programs in other states to institute standardized peer -reviewed 15 study and improve program effectiveness. 16 Staff recommends approval of this project with these 17 three conditions . The applicant has reviewed all the conditions 18 and indicated acceptance to staff. At this time, I would be 19 pleased to answer any quest ions. 20 And also available from -- representing Father 21 Martin's Ashley is Father Mark Hushen, the President and CEO ; 22 Dr. Bernadette Solounias , Medical Director; Steven Kendrick, 23 Chief Operating Officer; Al Germann , CFO; Daniel Berardi, Vice for pport Services; Richard Koglin, Consultant; and 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC.

FALCONE: Motion . 5 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Second? 6 MS. MONTGOMERY: Second . 7 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Okay. Discussion and questions. 8 Reverend ? Yeah. 9 COMMISSIONER CONWAY: Obviously, a wonderful 10 facility . Obviously, a wonderful program, wonderful facility. 11 What tugs at my heart right now is this some recent things that 12 happened and t hey sort of keep happening in society . So my 13 question basically is this. Directly or indirectly, wil l this 14 facility have any impact on people with depression , mental 15 problems , so forth ? 16 MR. RIKLIN : Can I grab the microphone? 17 COMMISSIONER CONWAY: Yes. 18 MR. RIKLIN : Solounias. 19 MS. SOLOUNIAS: Your question is will we have any 20 impact on people with depression and other psychiatric 21 illnesses? 22 COMMISSIONER CONWAY: Yes. 23 DR. SOLOUNIAS: Yes. We, right now have psychiatrists 24 on our staff, psychologists on our staff. And we treat people 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 10 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 with stable psychiatric illnesses which include primarily 1 depression and anxiety disorders, but also other mood disorders 2 and substance -induced psychiatric illnesses. 3 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Other questions? 4 COMMISSIONER BARR: Chairman Tanio, this is Michael 5 Barr. I have a question. 6 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Okay. 7 COMMISSIONER BARR: Thank you for your excellent 8 report. On the recommendation to demonstrate effectiveness, I'm 9 wondering what standards will be used for that report. Are 10 there national quality standards that staff are made to report 11 on? 12 MR. RIKLIN: Well, I think, that was one of the 13 problems. It's not only did n't -- did the applicant indicate 14 they didn't do any comparative analysis, we were not able to 15 find anything in the lit erature. 16 DR. SOLOUNIAS: That's correct. 17 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Indentify yourself, please. 18 DR. SOLOUNIAS: Oh, I'm sorry. Dr. Bernadette 19 Solounias. That's correct. There aren't any standards on how 20 to evaluate addiction treatment programs. There are studi es 21 that look at different outcomes, but they're not standardized 22 outcomes that have been evaluated. 23 COMMISSIONER BARR: Thank you. So do you think this 24 will create some creative thinking that will be potentially 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 11 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 interesting for the Commission to see how t his evolves before 1 the reporting occurs because it may apply another budget ? 2 DR. SOLOUNIAS: That's correct. 3 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Diane? 4 COMMISSIONER STOLLENWERK: Sir, I appreciate the 5 report and I appreciate the conditions. I do find the rate of 6 care for t he indigent and near indigent disappointing. I also 7 have a question about -- and perhaps I'm focusing too much on 8 specific words, but sometimes exactly how something is worded is 9 very careful. 10 In reporting on efforts to assess program 11 effectiveness does n't necessarily, actually assess program 12 effectiveness. And so I just wanted to get staff clarification 13 that the expectation is actually assessing program effectiveness 14 and not just reporting on we're trying, but aren't quite there 15 yet. 16 There are, with th e National Quality Forum and other 17 groups, there are a number of folks who work and are coming 18 together on reaching consensus around measures and metrics to 19 assess chemical dependency, substance abuse, mental health 20 service needs. So while there may not b e a definitive set, 21 there are, certainly, quite a bit of work has been done in that 22 area. So you're not starting with a blank slate, fortunately, 23 so I do think it's reasonable to expect that the conditions 24 about reporting on program effectiveness, not jus t the effort to 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 12 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 try to get there. 1 MR. RIKLIN: Well that was certainly the hope that it 2 would actually report on the effectiveness. 3 COMMISSIONER STOLLENWERK: So my request would be that 4 to make sure that the wording and the condition is very specific 5 -- is that it's about reporting on the effectiveness, not just 6 the efforts to get there. Thank you. 7 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Diane, are you making a movement to 8 amend any of the -- 9 COMMISSIONER STOLLENWERK: Absolutely. 10 CHAIRMAN TANIO: -- conditions? Okay. 11 COMMISSIONER STOLLENWERK: I would prefer 12 that the wording be very specific about the condition be the 13 report is around the findings regarding program effectiveness. 14 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Okay. 15 COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER: Second. 16 COMMISSIONER STEFFEN: Okay. Let's -- 17 MR. STEFFEN: So let's be sure that we have -- can you 18 restate? 19 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Let's get this for the record exactly 20 right. 21 [MOTION TO AMEND CONDITIONS OF MOTION ON THE FLOOR] 22 COMMISSIONER STOLLENWERK: So I move that the 23 condition be -- that one of the three conditions be specifically 24 worded, and I leave that to staff to decide exactly what that 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 13 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 wording should be, but specifically worded so that it's clear 1 that the expectation is around reporting on program 2 effectiveness as opposed to reporting on efforts to assess 3 program effectiveness. 4 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Yep. That's quite clear. 5 COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER: Second. 6 CHAIRMAN TANIO: There's a second. Any discussion of 7 this particular -- 8 CHAIRMAN MONTGOMERY: -- I just have a question in 9 terms, I guess, of all the conditions . The conditions are only 10 good until first use is approved on the CON, and once CON ends, 11 that -- the authority of the Commission sort of ends there. So 12 I mean, I'm trying to figure out how this all works with by the 13 time this project is completed, w hat -- how do you -- you just 14 look at it that place and then you authorize or you delay the 15 opening until all these conditions are met or how is that going 16 to work? 17 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Joel, would you like to comment on 18 that? 19 MR. RIKLIN: Well yeah. I think there -- at this 20 point, the way it is, the only -- on those -- on that conditi on, 21 and probably to some degree -- and to some degree certainly on 22 the indigent care condition, it would just be that they would 23 need to keep reporting and we would need to follow up. And the 24 only -- the implicat -- the only kind of shtick we have is they 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 14 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 are coming back to us at this point. 1 COMMISSIONER MONTGOMERY: If they choose to come back 2 to -- 3 MR. RIKLIN: Yeah -- 4 COMMISSIONER MONTGOMERY: -- The CON -- 5 MR. RIKLIN: -- I'm thinking that on \"three,\" maybe we 6 can move it up too 'cause -- 7 COMMISSIONER MONTGOMERY: I just raise it as a 8 point -- 9 MR. RIKLIN: Yeah. 10 COMMISSIONER MONTGOMERY: -- practical point 'cause 11 it's not licensing where they come back regularly to you. This 12 is we approve th e project. 13 CHAIRMAN TANIO: That's c orrect. 14 COMMISSIONER MONTGOMERY: The project is approved and 15 the project ends. 16 MR. RIKLIN: Well, once it's operational, yes. 17 COMMISSIONER MONTGOMERY: Right. 18 MR. RIKLIN: Yeah. So like on the first condition we 19 probably have -- we have first-use approval as a ultimate check 20 on that. 21 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Any other comments? Yeah? 22 COMMISSIONER STOLLENWERK: A little more clarity. So 23 this is Diane again . I request that -- or I move that the 24 condition be that there is a re port on program effectiveness 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 15 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 with a standards to be approved by staff. 1 [MOTION TO REVISE MOTION ON FLOOR TO AMEND ] 2 COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER: I'll second it again. 3 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Yeah. Okay. So you would withdraw 4 your other motion and that this is amended? Okay. 5 COMMISSIONER STOLLENWERK: Yes, I do. 6 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Okay. 7 [FIRST MOTION ON FLOOR WITHDRAWN ] 8 COMMISSIONER STOLLENWERK: This is simply 9 trying to be a little bit -- 10 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Yeah. 11 COMMISSIONER STOLLENWERK: -- more clear -- 12 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Yeah. 13 COMMISSIONER STOLLENWERK: -- I think. 14 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Okay. And with -- we'll take the 15 spirit of that motion without too much of the wordsmithing 16 because I do think that it can -- 17 COMMISSIONER STOLLENWERK: Yeah. 18 CHAIRMAN TANIO: -- be -- the final order can be 19 easily adjusted there. 20 Any further discussion of Commissioner Stollenwerk's 21 -- 22 COMMISSINER SCHNEIDER : -- Well, I have a question. 23 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Yes? 24 COMMISSIONER SCHNEIDER : I don't know if you want the 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC.

We would have an opportunity, 4 as the applicant, to weigh in to be sure it's feasible and 5 acceptable from our point of view as well ? 6 CHAIRMAN TANIO: With the wording? Ye s. I think we 7 -- yeah, we're not going to dictate standards. I think the 8 essence is basically having a good faith . I mean, we 've just 9 talked about that the measurement of effectiveness is something 10 that's emerging. 11 MR. ELLER: Right. 12 CHAIRMAN TANIO: I think the way that I interpret 13 the motion is -- 14 MR. ELLER: -- That's how we -- 15 CHAIRMAN TANIO: -- that Commissioner Stollenwerk is 16 basically saying that's true, but, you know, there is , you know, 17 sort of early stages to just say you're tryi ng to systematically 18 evaluate it versus you actually are evaluating it and s o that's 19 the intent of this. 20 MR. ELLER: Okay. 21 CHAIRMAN TANIO: So there would be -- 22 MR. ELLER: Thanks. 23 CHAIRMAN TANIO: There would be wordsmithing after 24 this -- 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 17 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 MR. ELLER: We are -- 1 CHAIRMAN TANIO: -- with that part. 2 MR. ELLER: -- absolutely agreeable to a phase 3 standard and intent of the standard. As long as we can work out 4 the wording, that's fine. 5 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Perfect. Okay. 6 COMMISSIONER FALCONE: I think -- 7 CHAIRMAN TANIO: -- Commissioner Falcone? 8 COMMISSIONER F ALCONE: -- I think you answered my 9 question, Mr. Chairman. I guess I was going to say, 'cause I 10 thought I heard before there aren't really any national metric s 11 or standards for measuring quality in the se types of 12 organizations. So I'll go back to your question. What are you 13 saying that the staff should come up with some quality measures? 14 That's where I was confused. 15 COMMISSIONER STOLLENWERK: No, I'm glad you raised it. 16 I mean the National Quality F orum and others, through the 17 Measure Application Partnership, they've been looking at this 18 issue, in particular, looking at, for example, the -- within the 19 context of the Medicare and Medicaid dual eligible population 20 where chemical dependency and mental h ealth substance use 21 services are a high priority area and they're -- while there may 22 not be the best perfect set of measures where people look at it 23 and they say 'Yes, this is comprehensive and we -- it gives us 24 the total picture ,' we also know at the other end of the 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 18 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 spectrum where there is nothing available. There are measures 1 available. So using, particularly, nationally -available 2 measures, which would be ideal, there is at least something to 3 start with. So that's my contention in that I just wanted t o 4 move away from being able to meet the condition by submitting a 5 report saying we're working on it because by the way this is 6 worded, it says it simply needs to be a report detailing their 7 efforts to evaluate as opposed to actually evaluating. That's 8 the distinction I'd like to submit. 9 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Okay. All right. Any other 10 discussion? Then we'll just -- 11 COMMISSIONER PHILLIPS : -- Not on this point. 12 CHAIRMAN TANIO: That's fine. No. Okay. 13 So let's vote on Commissioner Stollenwerk's amendment 14 to the staff conditions. 15 All in favor? 16 COMMISSIONERS: Aye. 17 [All commissioners respond \"aye\". ] 18 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Any opposed? 19 [None were opposed.] 20 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Okay. Now, general discussion around 21 the approval of Certificate of Need. Fran . 22 COMMISSIONER PHILLIPS : I guess my question probably 23 goes to the applicant and it involves the decision not to accept 24 Medicaid, or perhaps Medicare, to be a Track 1, for example, 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 19 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 rather than a Track 2 facility , recognizing the overwhelming 1 burden that substance abuse places on Marylanders, and 2 particularly, as we're at the brink now of expanding Medicaid 3 coverage to -- not only Medicaid coverage, but subsidized 4 commercial coverage to hundreds of thousands of more 5 Marylanders. 6 Perhaps one of you could talk about the f acility's 7 decision to stay on Track 1 as opposed to moving to Track 2, 8 which I understand is a Track of these facilities that accept 9 public funds. 10 It's a complicated question, but I think you kind of 11 get to the -- 12 MR. ELLER: -- Yes. There has been an awf ul lot of 13 discussion over the last -- 14 MR. STEFFEN : -- Could you come forward and identify 15 yourself and then speak ? Because we do have four commissioners 16 on line -- 17 MR. ELLER: Yes. 18 MR. STEFFEN: -- that can't hear you unless you 're 19 speak into -- 20 MR. ELLER: I'm just going to -- 21 MR. STEFFEN: -- the microphone . 22 MR. ELLER: -- I'm going to introduce Al Germann , who 23 is the CFO and Vice-President for Finance at the facility. I 24 just wanted to preface his remarks by saying that over the 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 20 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 course of the last ye ar since the State Health Plan was changed 1 and permitted Father Martin's Ashley to bring its application to 2 you, the new standard in the plan permitted consideration of 3 alternatives to the previous standard that was very rigid , and 4 there have been lots of paper, lots of discussion with staff. 5 And as you might imagine, and as reflected in the staff report, 6 and I think that we have reached an understanding and Mr. 7 Germann will further explain, directly, the answer to the 8 Medicaid question. 9 MR. GERMANN: As I understand it, and open for 10 clarification, Track 1 and Track 2 has to do with public funding 11 of the institution. We haven't needed public funding in the 12 past. We won't anticipate needing it in the future, but more 13 directly to your Medicaid question, we know that there -- to 14 participate in Medicaid , you sign contracts with medical care 15 organizations. 16 As part of background, I was a CFO with Maryland 17 Physicians Care for five years preceding this. I'm very 18 familiar with that process. I've worked for United Healthcare 19 as well, Aetna, Maryland Physician's Care. So as part of a 20 contracting process, we would accept Medicaid patients. We have 21 not been approached, at least at this point, to contract with a 22 Medicaid care organization. Not to say that we wouldn' t; we 23 haven't ruled it out. 24 Our mission is certainly one where we would accept 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 21 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 that type of patient or clientele. It's not an issue with us at 1 all, if it meets our needs and our mission. And I would also 2 say, in terms of the indigent percentages, you kn ow, we've 3 donated charity care, we've done over $20 million in the last 10 4 years. 5 Annually, we're spending about $2.4 million, about 10 6 percent of revenue, under 10 percent of revenue. If you look at 7 the projection going from 2012 to 2017, I think it's on page 12 8 of the recommendation, you'll see that the change in charity 9 care is basically in the indigent gray area, percentage. 10 So there is -- to be clear -- there is a commitment 11 on Father Martin's Ashley to provide care not only to the 12 indigent and gra y area, but also to those folks in the middle 13 class that may not necessarily be able to afford it, that have 14 jobs and have other commercial insurance coverage that really 15 can't -- still can't afford it. And we are happy to provide 16 charity care for those f olks as well. 17 COMMISSIONER PHILLIPS: So just to follow -up. 18 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Go ahead. 19 COMMISSIONER PHILLIPS: T he condition that was placed 20 in connection with charity care -- what is it, 6.3 -- 21 MR. GERMANN: 6.3 percent. 22 COMMISSIONER PHILLIPS: -- 6.3 percent. So maybe this 23 question is for staff. How, going forward, how will that be 24 monitored and Health Commission be kept aware of that? 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 22 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 MR. RIKLIN: Well, we're requiring Father Martin's 1 Ashley to file audited reports for five years, starting with 2 when this project is completed, when they are projected to meet 3 the -- to hit that 6.3 percent figure. 4 COMMISSIONER PHILLIPS: So five years after the 5 issuance -- for five years during that period. 6 MR. RIKLIN: For five years after the project 7 completion. 8 COMMISSIONER PHILLIPS: So that's the term of the 9 condition? 10 MR. RIKLIN: Right. As it's stated -- 11 COMMISSIONER PHILLIPS: Right. 12 MR. RIKLIN: -- in the recommended -- 13 COMMISSIONER PHILLIPS: The -- 14 MR. RIKLIN: -- audit. 15 COMMISSIONER PHILLIPS: The re is so muc h happening 16 with regard to whittling away at what we call the uninsured or 17 the indigent population so that it may be something that the 18 commission needs to take a look at the definition of indigent 19 population, given the fact that with the expansion of Medi caid, 20 up to, I think 138 for childless adults, up to 138 percent of 21 poverty, it gets that definition of indigent care, thinner and 22 thinner slices of population. 23 So that might be something -- this is not relevant 24 specifically to this application, but in g eneral, to look at how 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC. DBA FATHER MARTIN'S ASHLEY 23 One Stop Legal (301) 379 -6607 we regard indigent care in this changing demographic with regard 1 to the greater insurance coverage. 2 MR. RIKLIN: Well, as far as this State Health Plan 3 Chapter as it currently is -- and this w as adopted -- this went 4 into effect in 20 02 -- indigent care is essentially defined as 5 Medicaid eligible. That's as far as this Chapter goes. That's 6 not necessarily universally throughout the regulatory scheme. 7 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Commissioner Phillips, I see your 8 point. We can put that in a cue for staff to -- 9 COMMISSIONER PHILLIPS: Yeah. I'd like to. 10 CHAIRMAN TANIO: -- look through it and get back to 11 the Commission -- 12 COMMISSIONER PHILLIPS: Thank you. 13 CHAIRMAN TANIO: -- on that. 14 MR. GERMANN: I would just add, you know, one of the 15 things that forced us to look at, through this process, and the 16 definition of indigent care were those folks that were not 17 considered indigent, but really, in our minds, met the indigent 18 criteria. That is, you know, you have some one that supported, 19 but just b arely meets , you know, the 180 percent of poverty. 20 You know, w e found that there were instances where we 21 felt we provided indigent care that wasn't being credited for 22 that. So it would be a nice thing to do to look at that again. 23 CHAIRMAN TANIO: Other questions, comments, 24 discussion? 25 CER TIFICATE OF NEED - ASHLEY, INC.

POLICY: All patients who have symptomatic withdrawal from drugs and alcohol are treated with a prescribed detoxification protocol related to the substance that was abused. DEFINITIONS AND RESPONSIBILITY: Buprenorphine - A synthetic narcotic with both antagonist and agonist properties. It will be administered in its oral form, which is currently marketed as Subutex . Buprenorphine/Naloxone - This combination consists of buprenorphine as described above combined with naloxone, which is a pure opiate antagonist. This medication is marketed under the trade name of Suboxone. The purpos e for this medication combination is to prevent unauthorized IV injection of the medication. If injected, the naloxone contained in the compound would produce an instant narcotic antagonist effect and the patient would feel significant levels of withdrawal. Taken orally, the naloxone component of this medication has no effect. SCOPE AND RESPONSIBILITY: The physician or physician assistant prescribes the medical detoxification protocol and the N ursing staff carries out these orders. PROCEDURES: 1. Physician or physician assistant is to follow all protocols listed in this policy. 2. All protocols are to be order ed utilizing the Electronic Healthcare System. 3. A thorough History and Physical Examination is be completed on all patients upon admission. An attempt must be made to obtain a complete medical and addiction history from the patient, regardless of their state of intoxication or withdrawal. History from significant others should be obtained, if available. A thorough physical exam is mandatory in all cases except when a patient is combative. 4. Chemically dependent patients frequently present with known or unknown co- existing medical or psychiatric illnesses that need to be identified early in treatment. Simply assuming the patient's presenting clinical status is solely due to their current state of intoxication or withdrawal is unacceptable and may result in complications. RECOVERY CENTERS OF AMERICA POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL Supersedes All Previous Policy Page 2 of 8 Dated: 1/2015 No. 5200 .001 Revised: SUBJECT: Nursing, Medical Related Department(s): n/a __________________________________________________________________________________ DRAFT I. ROUTINE LAB ORDERS 1. CBC 2. Complete Metabolic Profile 3. RPR 4. Urinalysis /Urine Drug Screen 5. ECG - if clinically indicated 6. Chest x -ray - if clinically indicated. A chest x -ray should be obtained on all HIV patients and patients with a history of positive PPD. 7. PPD - intermediate strength (Mantoux ) - if negative in the past. A PPD is not necessary if a patient has written documentation of a negative PPD within one month of admission. 8. Urine pregnancy test - on any woman of child bearing age and capacity. 9. HIV testing - Will be completed if the pa tient agrees. A signed consent form must be completed by the nurse or the laboratory. II. ALCOHOL DETOXIFICATION A. In cases No significant withdrawal symptomatology present - vital signs stable, no coarse tremors, no hallucinations, no history of seizures. a. Monitor vital signs q shift or more frequently if indicated. b. When the patient presents in an intoxicated state, it is best to continue assessing until the patient has begun to demonstrate withdrawal sy mptomatology. During the initial phase of treatment, observe these patients closely for progressive obtundation and evolving coma. c. Thiamine 50- 100mg p.o. or IM d. Diazepam 5- 10mg p.o. q 4- 6h if indicated. Diazepam is not usually indicated when the patient is intoxicated but should be started if and when wit hdrawal symptoms appear. Since it is difficult to predict the degree of withdrawal symptomatology a patient will exhibit, consider a prn order initially. Once stabilized with benzodiazepines, a tapering dosage can be initiated with a prn benzodiazepine order for breakthrough withdrawal signs and symptoms. Chlordiazepoxide may also be used in place of diazepam. Lorazepam or oxazepam should be considered in the elderly patient or those patients RECOVERY CENTERS OF AMERICA POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL Supersedes All Previous Policy Page 3 of 8 Dated: 1/2015 No. 5200 .001 Revised: SUBJECT: Related n/a __________________________________________________________________________________ DRAFT with hepatic impairment. Short acting benzodiazepines should be tapered more slowly than the longer acting benzodiazepines to prevent a rebound in withdrawal symptoms and complications. e. Most texts do not recommend the routine use of phenytoin. However, consider phenytoin if the past history of seizures are not clearly withdrawal related or have occurred several weeks after cessation of alcohol intake. If patient has a positive seizure history that requires phenytoin, and the patient has been non -compliant, it is suggested to then give loading dose of 300mg p.o. stat, and repeat q 4h x 2. Then give 100mg p.o. tid- qid starting the following day. Check phenytoin level in 3- 4 days. The loading dosage must be used with caution if the patient has liver or renal disease. f. Provide B-Complex and/or multi- vitamins if clinically indicated. g. Folic Acid, 1mg p.o. once daily if peripheral neuropathy is suspected. B. In cases where s ignificant withdrawal symptomatology is present - elevated temperature, blood pressure and pulse, marked tremors of hands/tongue, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, diaphoresis, seizures, insomnia. a. Vital signs q 1/2h until stable. b. Stat CBC, Lytes, FBS, BUN, Creatinine, Urinalysis c. Diazepam 20mg p.o. q 1h prn until stable. Use lorazepam 1 -2mg q 4 -8h in older patients or in presence of marked hepatic impairment. If parenteral benzodiazepines are indicated, lorazepam may be given IM, whereas diazepam IM should be avoided due to erratic absorption. Lorazepam IM is probably the drug of choice in initi al treatment of significantly advanced delirium tremens. f. If patient 's in acute delirium tremens the patient should be transferred to an acute care hospital or treatment. g. If IV's are utilized, give Thiamine prior to administration of glucose. h. If pulse or blood pressure is persistently elevated, consider utilizing a beta -blocker if there are no pulmonary or cardiac contraindications. Atenolol 50mg once daily, a beta- 1 selective blocker, appears to work well. Clonidine has also been utilized in alcohol withdrawal. However, there is no evidence indicating that these drugs will prevent seizures or DT's. In fact, use of the above such medications may mask impending RECOVERY CENTERS OF AMERICA POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL Supersedes All Previous Policy Page 4 of 8 Dated: 1/2015 No. 5200 .001 Revised: SUBJECT: Nursing, n/a __________________________________________________________________________________ DRAFT withdrawal seizures or delirium tremens. Thus, these medications should be used cautiously . III. SEDATIVES DETOXIICATION A. Withdrawal signs present (tremulousness, anxi ety, insomnia, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, tendon hyper -reflexia, diaphoresis, orthostatic hypotension, seizures, delirium) a. If symptoms are mild, quantify addiction (amount used daily); then establish Phenobarbital equivalent from should the daily Phenobarbital dosage exceed 600mg/day. iii. Once patient appears stabilized x2 days, decrease dose by 30mg/day. iv. If patient appears intoxicated, secondary to Phenobarbital, (ataxia, slurred speech, nysta gmus), then you may need to recalculate daily dose. v. Avoid daily decrease if withdrawal symptoms appear. b. If symptoms moderate to severe, or level of addiction is unclear, may use Pentobarbital challenge technique: i. Give 200mg Pentobarbital and examine patient in one hour. 1. If patient is asleep, then tolerance is doubtful and there is a questionable need for detox 2. If patient appears intoxicated (slurring of speech,nystagmus, ataxia), start with 125mg to 220mg of Phenobarbital/day 3. If patient is comfortabl e (only fine nystagmus), start with 250mg of Phenobarbital/day 4. If Pentobarbital has no effect or patient still appears to be in withdrawal, start with an increased dose. If using Phenobarbital in acute withdrawal, may want to give initial dose IM ii. Once starting dose is determined, stabilize and then decrease daily and continue to monitor and assess. RECOVERY CENTERS OF AMERICA POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL Supersedes All Previous Policy Page 5 of 8 Dated: 1/2015 No. 5200 .001 Revised: SUBJECT: Nursing, Medical Related Department(s): n/a __________________________________________________________________________________ DRAFT B. If no withdrawal symptoms present, may want to use 200mg Pentobarbital challenge to establish addiction. IV. BENZODIAZEPINES WITHDRAWAL If patient is dependent upon benzodiazepines, he/she is easily detoxified with other benzodiazepines. Ideally, one should use a long acting benzodiazepine unless medical indications warrant a shorter acting benzodiazepine. If possible, it is best to use a different benzodiaz epine than the patient's drug of choice. Phenobarbital may also be used for benzodiazepine withdrawal. V. OPIATE DETOXIFICATION Opiate detoxification may be accomplished by utilizing buprenorphine alone, clonidine alone, methadone alone, or a combination of medications. Below are protocols for opiate detoxification utilizing buprenorphine, clonidine alone and a methadone/clonidine combination. The protocol utilizing buprenorphine is the treatment of choice. However, there may be situations where Methadone or Clonidine alone may be best utilized or preferred by the patient . Before initiating detox protocols, it is imperative that we establish the presence of opiate dependence. This may be accomplished through historical information, physical findings, and Urine Drug Screen. The state of intoxication or withdrawal needs to be assessed. It is also important to identify any other coexisting drug or alcohol dependencies. A. BUPRENORPHINE PROTOCOL 1. If the physician determines the presence of an opiate dependency, the option of utilizing buprenorphine for detoxification should discussed with the patient. 2. Should the patient agree to use buprenorphine, informed consent will be obtained 3. The nurs e will be responsible for observing the patient taking the sublingual tablet of buprenorphine and making sure it is dissolved. 4. Buprenorphi ne detoxification will proceed per the detoxification protocol. 5. Subutex will be the first choice or f or opiate detoxification 6. Buprenorphine detoxification is not to be initiated until the patient is documented to have signs and symptoms of acute opiate withdrawal and/or a positive UDS. 7. Buprenorphine detoxification must not be initiated until at least 24 hours after the last dosage of methadone or 12 hours after the last dose of heroin/opiates. 8. Benzodiazepines should be avoided as an adjunctive therapy during buprenorphine treatment. However, in cases where patients are in withdrawal from both opiates and benzodiazepines, benzodiazepines should be used with caution 9. Suggested buprenorphine dosages follow : 10.

METHADONE PROTOCOL 1. The maximum dose of methadone utilized will be 20mg. It will be tapered by 5mg per day. The methadone can be administered in a single daily dose, or the dosage can be administered in two doses . 2. The admitting physician will determine the proper dosage level for a patient. If the admitting physician determining the initial dose is not the attending physician who conducted the History and Physical examination, the attending physician shall consult with the admitting physician who performed the examination before determining the patient's initial dose and schedule. 3. Methadone shall be administered or dispensed in oral fo rm only and shall observed. 4. For patients coming from a methadone maintenance program, they will be advised that they should be tapered down to 20mg before being admitted to our inpatient detoxification program. However, patients not tapered down to 20mg methadone may be considered on a case -by-case basis, with the knowledge that t heir daily dose of methadone will not exceed 20mg. . 5. The patient will be made aware of his/her dosage schedule of methadone and how it is to be tapered. The patient must also understand that we will not waiver from this protocol unless the patient refuse s the methadone, or the patient is experiencing adverse affects RECOVERY CENTERS OF AMERICA POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL Supersedes All Previous Policy Page 7 of 8 Dated: 1/2015 No. 5200 .001 Revised: SUBJECT: Nursing, Related Department(s): n/a __________________________________________________________________________________ DRAFT secondary to the methadone. The patient will be advised in the case of emesis, the dosage will not be re -administered and thus the patient should be advised to request an anti-emetic prior to his/her dose of methadone if nausea is present. Methadone should not be initiated until the patient starts to demonstrate signs and symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Do not administer methadone to an intoxicated patient. 6. Specific orders: a. Methadone 20mg p .o. daily in single or split dose that decreases by 5mg per day. b. Clonidine - As the methadone is decreased, clonidine may be added. A test dose of 0.1mg may be given, and if tolerated, 0.2mg q 4- 6h may be utilized. Hold clonidine if blood pressure is les s than 90mmHg systolic or 60mmHg diastolic. A Catapres -TTS 1 or 2 may be used in place of, or along with, p.o. clonidine. c. Tigan 250mg prn for nausea and vomiting. d. Bentyl 20mg q 4- 6h prn for abdominal -50mg 4h p.o. prn for agitation h. MVI daily i. Benzodiazepines may be utilized, but avoid using large dosages in patients nearing completion of the detoxification program. C. CLONIDINE PROTOCOL 1. Clonidine - Give test dose of 0.1mg, then watch blood pressure. If patient's blood pressure is stable in four hours, may give 0.1- 0.2mg p.o. q 4-6h prn or routine. BP checks prior to each dose. Hold clonidine if systolic BP is less than 90- 100mmHg, or diastolic BP is less than 60mmHg. However, these are general guidelines. In someone with an elevated blood pressure, you may want to hold the limit somewhat higher and in someone who presents with a low base line blood pressure, the cut -off points could be somewhat lower. Use clonidine with caution if other anti -hypertensive medications or medicines with potentially hypot ensive side used cocurrently . (Catapres -TTS) may be utilized for opiate withdrawal. It is best used after the patient has been stabilized with p.o. clonidine and the withdrawal symptoms are beginning to abate. Always advise the patient of t he rationale behind the use of clonidine and the side effects, primarily orthostatic hypertension. 3. A benzodiazepine, such as diazepam or oxazepam may be utilized. The dosage will vary from patient to patient, and needs to be titrated as clinical needs indicate. a.

Frequent intervention with the patient provides reassurance and emotional support during the period when s/he is apprehensive and experiencing both physical and emotional discomfort. Frequent discussions also begin an early teaching process regarding primary symptoms of the disease process. Without the formalized questions, symptoms such as visual or auditory disturbances may go undetected until the progress to an advanced state. Observat ions relating to the patient's orientation and thought processes may give an early indication of other organic issues or psychosis. POLICY : Nursing will follow Detoxification Procedures for all patients to ensure quality care and patient safety and com pliance with all State and Federal Regulations. The detoxification process is based on medical protocol and is monitored by Medical Staff. All medical orders are from physicians /physicians assistant and/or a CRNP . Detoxification services are provided by qualified medical and nursing staff at all times, 24 hours, 7 days a week. DEFINITIONS : n/a PROCEDURES : 1. The objectives of following the detoxification procedure is: a. To frequently monitor the patient's status during withdrawal period at regular intervals. b. To assure appropriate and effective nursing intervention with the patient. c. To assign a numerical value to an evaluation of withdrawal, which may indicate progress or deterioration in patient status. d. To focus nursing attention on each area of wit hdrawal symptoms and to assure consistency in evaluation of patient status. e. To begin early patient educational regarding primary symptoms of the disease process to assist in self diagnosis. 2. Prior to detoxification protocol, patient undergoes a Nursing Assessment as part of Multi - disciplinary Assessment. This includes patient's medical history, health screening and assessment by a physician/physician assistant or CRNP for medication orders. 3. The detoxification assessment is utilized by the nurse as a tool to evaluate the patient's level of withdrawal from any chemical substance. The assessment is administered at regular intervals which correlate to the severity of the patient's physical withdrawal from chemical substances.

The patient is asked a set of questions relating to a variety of symptoms, which may include: gastrointestinal, tactile, visual, auditor disturbances, etc. Numbers are recorded in a column on the Assessment Sheet. The num bers are then totaled and thus provide a numerical basis for determining the status and progress of the patient. 5. The Detoxification Assessment must be completed by a RN or LPN. Assessment includes obtaining vital signs - pulse, temperature and respiration. This is face to face contact with the patient. The patient's vital signs and physiological responses are recorded at the time of the assessment. 6. Nursing Care Plan is completed by nurse and reviewed with patient. This is part of the education process of detoxification protocol with patients. The plan is reviewed continually as patients follow through with detox process. 7. The Detoxification Assessment is to be used routinely on all patients admitted for detoxification from any substance. 8. The assessment is conducted a minimum of every 4 hours and a maximum of every 8 hours while the patient is experiencing acute withdrawal symptoms (i.e. a D/A score >8). The nurse may increase the frequency of the assessment according to patient's needs. 9. Once the acute withdrawal symptoms have subsided, the administration of the assessment may be changed or increased to every 6 hours. 10. As part of assessment procedure, any symptoms of medical distress shall be documented addressed with the physician/physician assistant or CRNP and progress shall be noted. 11. The detoxification assessment may be discontinued when no sedative medications have been used in four consecutive assessments. Nurse must contact the physican/physican assistant or CRNP to receive an order to advance the patient to rehab. The phsycian/physician assistant or CRNP m ust review the patient's physical status prior writing the order to advance to rehab status. 12. Once the order is written, all detoxification medications are discontinued. Once patient is advanced from detox to rehab status, patients are considered for inpatient rehab or aftercare outside the facility where deemed appropriate for the Treatment Team. The patient's primary counselor is responsible for aftercare arrangements and for providing information regarding importance of further treatment past detoxification. 13. When the physician orders a specific frequency for detoxification assessments, a physician's/CRNP order is required to reduce or discontinue the frequency.

POLICY : RCA desires to keep the facility as free of infection as is possible. DEFINITIONS : Standard Precautions (formerly known as Universal precautions) - an infection control strategy designed to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms from both recognized and unrecognized sources of infection. Standard Precautions synthesize the major features of Universal (Blood and Body Fluid) Precautions ( designed to reduce the risk of transmission of bloodborne pathogens) and Body Substance Isolation (designed to reduce the risk of transmission of pathogens from moist body substances) and applies them to all patients regardless of their diagnosis or presum ed infection status. Standard Precautions apply to (1) blood, (2) all body fluids, secretions and excretions except sweat, regardless of whether they contain visible blood, (3) non- intact skin, and (4) mucous membranes. Transmission- based Precautions - used in addition to Standard Precautions for patients known or suspected to be infected by epidemiologically important pathogens spread by airborne or droplet transmission or by contact with dry skin or contaminated surfaces. They include (1) Airborne, (2) Droplet and (3) Contact Precautions. Refer to policy 9000.008 - Isolation Precautions: Transmission Based. PROCEDURES : A. Standard Precautions - RCA follows the most current guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for prevention of disease transmission, modified as needed for the unique needs of the organization. Standard Precautions are used for all patients. 1. The procedures detailed below were developed utilizing the 2007 CDC publication Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings. A link to the complete document can be found on the Intranet. (http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/isolati on/Isolation2007.pdf .) 2. Standard Precautions are used for the care of all patients.

Before leaving work d. Alcohol -based hand sanitizer is available at the nurses' stations and in first aid kits. When hands are visibly soiled, washing with soap and running water is the preferred method. Alcohol -based hand rinses are not effective against C -diff spores or Norovirus. To prevent ingestion, alcohol -based hand sanitizers are not to be made available to patients unless staff supervision is provided. 4. Gloves a. Wear clean, non -sterile gloves when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions and contaminated i tems. b. Put on clean gloves just before touching mucous membranes and non -intact skin. c. Change gloves between tasks and procedures on the same patient after contact with material that may contain a high concentration of microorganisms. d.

Larry Hogan unveiled Tuesday what he called a \"holistic\" strategy to deal with Maryland's growing heroin problem, but stopped short of declaring the state of emergency he vowed last year to put in place. After weeks of buildup, Hogan announced a four\u00adpronged approach to one of the signature issues of his campaign. It involves no dramatic breaks from the policies followed by former Gov. Martin O'Malley. Hogan put much of the substantive policy development in the hands of a task force that will report to him by Dec. 1. The program includes a $500,000 federal grant, but no new state money for treatment. At a State House news conference, Hogan seemed to choke up several times as he described how pervasive he found the problem as he traveled around the state last year. \"This used to be considered an urban problem, but it's not anymore,\" he said. All over the state, he said, local officials told him heroin had become their No. 1 problem. The governor said he felt a personal connection because a cousin died of an overdose a couple of years ago. \"I know the kind of devastation it can cause for families and communities, but still I was shocked by how widespread this problem had become,\" he said. Hogan said heroin was both a law enforcement problem and a health issue. \"This is a disease, and we will not be able to just arrest our way out of that crisis,\" he said. Some were unimpressed by the governor's plan. \"This is the biggest joke I've ever heard in my life,\" said Mike Gimbel, a former drug user who served as director of Baltimore County's substance abuse office. \"We need long\u00adterm, residential drug\u00adfree treatment in the state of Maryland. We've never had it. There are people out there who need it immediately.\" Del. Kirill Reznik, a Montgomery County Democrat, said the task force duplicates the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Council he has served on since it was created by O'Malley in 2007. Reznik said the council has already identified what the state needs \u2014 more treatment beds and more preventive education programs starting as early as elementary school. \"I'm not seeing anything that begins to really address this problem,\" he said. \"The idea of another task force, I'm a little skeptical of it.\" Others applauded Hogan's effort. Del. Brett Wilson, a Hagerstown Republican who was named to the task force, called the plan \"exactly what we need.\" \"I like this approach about actually learning about a problem before we address it,\" he said. Del. Peter A. Hammen, a Baltimore Democrat who chairs the House health committee, also welcomed the3/5/2015 Hogan unveils plan to fight heroin \u00ad Baltimore Sun http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs\u00admd\u00adhogan\u00adheroin\u00ad20150224\u00adstory.html 2/3program . \"I'm pleased the governor is focusing on the issue because it's a significant problem throughout the state.\" Heroin overdoses have shot up 95 percent since 2010 as the drug's price has fallen and prescription painkillers have become more difficult to obtain. In 2013, Hogan said, Maryland had 464 overdose deaths, exceeding the state's 387 homicides. He said preliminary numbers show deaths by overdose continued to rise last year. His four\u00adpoint program includes two executive orders \u2014 one to create a coordinating council of the agencies involved in tackling the problem and the other setting up the task force. Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford will chair both groups. The third point was Hogan's announcement of a donation of 5,000 EVZIO kits for the rapid treatment of heroin and other opiate overdoses by manufacturer Kaleo Pharmaceuticals. EVZIO is a delivery device similar to an epi\u00ad pen for the delivery of naloxone, a drug used to counter the effects of those substances in emergencies. Each kit has two doses, for a total of 10,000. Hogan also announced a $500,000 federal grant to the Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention that will be used to increase treatment programs in the state's jails and prisons. After the announcements, Hogan signed the executive orders and left without taking questions. He turned over the news conference to Rutherford, whom he had previously named his point man on the state's response to the heroin epidemic. Rutherford, asked why Hogan had decided not to declare the \"state of emergency\" he had talked about during the campaign, said the administration found there is no statutory basis for such a declaration. \"We still consider it an emergency,\" Rutherford said. \"It really doesn't fit from a legal standpoint.\" During his campaign, Hogan criticized the administration of O'Malley and Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown for leaving Maryland as the only state on the East Coast that hadn't declared a heroin emergency \u2014 a claim that was later debunked. The Republican candidate repeatedly charged that the Democratic administration did little to address the heroin epidemic. Hogan's plan so far is similar to O'Malley initiatives. Hogan's coordinating council will consist of the departments of Health and Mental Hygiene, Public Safety and Correctional Services, Juvenile Services and Education, as well as the Maryland State Police and other agencies. The membership largely overlaps that of a group O'Malley formed last June to address the overdose treatment problem. The new administration's work in securing the donation of naloxone doses builds on Maryland's efforts in recent years to put the drug in the hands of more first responders, to expand training on its use and to make the drug eligible for Medicaid coverage. Like O'Malley, Hogan is facing criticism from advocates for cutting the budget for providers of drug treatment. Dan Martin, public policy director of the Mental Health Association, said the things Hogan announced Tuesday are \"important and necessary.\" But Martin and his group will be part of a rally Wednesday outside the State House calling for the restoration of3/5/2015 Hogan unveils plan to fight heroin \u00ad Baltimore Sun http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs\u00admd\u00adhogan\u00adheroin\u00ad20150224\u00adstory.html 3/3Copyright \u00a9 2015, The Baltimore Sun$23 million cut by the O'Malley and Hogan administrations from programs that include drug treatment. \"What we really need is to restore the budget for behavioral health so that people with substance abuse and mental health issue can get the treatment they need,\" Martin said. mdresser@baltsun.com EXHIBIT 24 EXHIBIT 25 FORM ADV UNIFORM APPLICATION FOR INVESTMENT ADVISER REGISTRATION AND REPORT BY EXEMPT REPORTING ADVISERS Primary Business Name: DEERFIELD MANAGEMENT COMPANY CRD Number: Rev. 10/2012 3/31/2015 3:12:47 PM WARNING: Complete this form truthfully.
