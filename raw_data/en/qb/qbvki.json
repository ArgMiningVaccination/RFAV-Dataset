Research has also shown that people of color, particularly African Americans, face greater than average risks from the health impacts of both air pollution and COVID-19. This webinar will present the findings from the public health, data science and local government perspectives, and will include a discussion of the research-public policy collaborations underway to understand these interconnected health risks, as well as efforts to mitigate them.
