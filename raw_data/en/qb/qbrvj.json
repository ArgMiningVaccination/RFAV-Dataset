La Cusinga, Eco-Lodge La Cusinga Eco Lodge in Uvita, Costa Rica is a coastal rainforest eco lodge dedicated to marine and terrestrial conservation and environmental education. Its location on the southern Pacific coast provides guests with sweeping ocean views and a relaxing beach vacation. In addition La Cusinga is part of a private nature reserve that supplies the visitor with an unparalleled look at Costa Rican wildlife and rainforest. The reserve consists primarily of 250 hectares of virgin rainforest that borders thousands of more acres of privately protected forest. On Costa Rica1s still wild south-western Pacific coast, La Cusinga Lodge borders Ballena Marine National Park which was developed to protect the humpback whales that frequent the coast. La Cusinga Lodge was established in order to share the unique site with Costa Ricans as well as international visitors. Besides getting exposure to rural Costa Rican culture and beautiful vistas, visitors have access to highly prolific areas of primary tropical rainforest and unspoiled coast, all conveniently accessible. In 2010 they received 4 out of 5 leafs in the CST Certification. La Cusinga Ecolodge maintains several trails that wind through the pristine protected rainforest and along the beautiful beaches. From three-hour treks through the forest to short walks down to the beach there are trails for all ages and abilities. On each trail the visitor is sure to get a glimpse of the diverse Costa Rican wildlife. Wildlife at La Cusinga is abundant and you will see many species that may include: morpho butterflies, tree frogs, ospreys, parrots, parakeets, toucans, howler monkeys, bottle-nosed dolphins, hawksbill turtles and the great humpback whale. La Cusinga Eco Lodge is constantly looking for the perfect balance between the natural and social environment. They are protecting their forest and want to keep it as it is, without harming or changing the delicate ecosystems that are working inside each corner in the jungle and the woods. Finally they are also interested in raising the local families1 wellbeing, because they have dedicated their time and life in this dream. "}
