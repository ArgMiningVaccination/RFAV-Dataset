These reviews provide comprehensive, science- based information on common, costly medical conditions, and new health care technologies and strategies. Systematic reviews are the building blocks underlying evidence- based practice; they focus attention on the strength and limits of evidence from research studies about the effectiveness and safety of a clinical intervention. In the context of developing recommendations for practice, systematic reviews can help clarify whether assertions about the value of the intervention are based on strong evidence from clinical studies. For more information about AHRQ EPC systematic reviews, see www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reference/purpose.cfm . AHRQ expects that these sys tematic reviews will be helpful to health plans, providers, purchasers, government programs, and the health care system as a whole. Transpa rency and stakeholder input are essential to the Effective Health Care Program.

The Vanderbilt Evidence -based practice Center systematically reviewed evidence about interve ntions for symptomatic abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) , both irregular and cyclic. We focused on interventions that are suitable for use in primary care practice including medical, behavioral, and complementary and alternative medicine approaches. Data s ources . We searched MEDLINE randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English from January 1980 to June 2012 in women with symptomatic AUB. We also searched regulatory data and scientific publications for data about harms. Review m ethods . Using dual review with a priori criteria, we excluded 1,734 publications because they did not address a K ey Q uestion, were not an eligible study design, or did not apply to the primary care treatment of AUB . Results . Thirty -nine RCTs (6 good quality, 10 fair quality , and 23 poor quality) evaluated 1 2 distinct interventions. These included 7 studies of the levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine system (LNG -IUS), 13 of (NSAIDs), 6 of tranexamic acid (TXA ), and 5 of combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs). The majority of studies made direct comparisons to other drugs. Ten studies enrolled women with irregular uterine bleeding; the remainder focused on women with heavy cyclic bleeding. Among women with ir regular menses, metformin, metformin with exenatide, and a tricyclic oral contraceptive improved menstrual regularity. Among women with heavy, cyclic menstrual bleeding all seven studies of LNG -IUS favored the intrauterine system in comparisons that included NSAIDs , COCs, progestogens and usual care. Reduction in menstrual blood loss ranged from 70 to 87 percent less bleeding than baseline. NSAIDs reduced bleeding in six of six studies w hen compared with placebo or progestogens . The degree of improvement wa s highly variable for individual women. TXA was more effective than progestogens and NSAIDs in three of four studies , and COCs provided benefit compared with placebo in two studies . Harms were rare and trials underpowered to assess harms for all interventions . For most interventions , surveillance studies of longer -term risks were not done in comparable populations. Conclusions . Two interventions for irregular bleeding (metformin, COCs) and four for heavy cyclic bleeding (LNG -IUS, NSAIDs, TXA) have low or m oderate strength of evidence for effectiveness , while COCs have high strength of evidence. Several common interventions (including diet and exercise and acupuncture) lack sufficient evidence. Across interventions, data are sparse to evaluate long -term improvements and risk of harms. Limitations include a predominance of small, short trials lacking standard terminology and diagnostic criteria for identifying and including women with AUB . Tools for collecting outcom e data are crude ( e.g., collection of sanitary products to measure blood loss ) and may contribute to a high rate of attrition. Emphasis on biologic outcomes may neglect the importance of patient - reported outcomes that assess whether symptoms are considered resolved by women themselves. vii Contents Executive Summary ........................................................................................................

Ongoing StudiesES-1 Executive Summary Background Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is among the most common gynecologic complaints of reproductive -age women in ambulatory care settings. It is estimated to affect 11 to 13 percent of reproductive -age women at any given time. Prevalence increases with age, reaching 24 percent in women aged 36 to 40.1,2 Women generally present for care because the amount, timing, or other characteristics of the bleeding have changed from their individual norm. Population norms for menstrual bleeding, as established by 5th and 95th percentiles, are:3-7 Frequency of menses within a 24- to 38- day window Regularity (i.e., cycle- to-cycle variation) within 2 to 20 days Duration of flow from 4 to 8 days Blood loss volume from 5 to 80 ml Symptoms outside this normal range, or dif ferent from normal for the individual, can become problematic and deserve evaluation because they can warn of underlying conditions. Common problems include worry about the cause, embarrassment if the bleeding includes flooding- type bleeding with saturatio n of clothing, missed work and responsibilities, limitations of social activities and exercise, decreases or changes in sexual activity, and frustration with costs of sanitary protection. Collectively, the effects of troublesome bleeding reduce quality of life and drive desire for information about causes and treatment options. 1,8 There is not a clear consensus on the clinical evaluation of a patient presenting with abnormal bleeding. Recommendations suggest that initial evaluation confirm the source and timing of bleeding, and exclude certain architectural etiologies (e.g., fibroids, polyps), cancer and precancerous changes in the cervix or uterus, coagulation defects, and systemic disease. The 2011 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FI GO) classification recommends a structured history followed by uterine evaluation. 9 In the research setting, the alkaline hematin method is the preferred technique for direct measurement of total menstrual blood loss (MBL). The pictorial blood loss assessm ent chart is a semi -quantitative tool for uniform reporting of bleeding as represented by the degree of saturation of sanitary pads and tampons. Diagnostic tools and evaluation strategies are not within the scope of this review; 10,11 however, the review captures the operational definitions used by researchers and addresses applicability of the findings to contemporary practice. Terminology Nomenclature to classify AUB has evolved steadily over the past several decades.12 Early classifications relied primarily on bleeding characteristics, using terms like menorrhagia (i.e., abnormally long or heavy menses) and metrorrhagia (i.e., bleeding at irregular intervals). These terms were often linked with timing and amount to infer whether or not regular and predicta ble ovulation was occurring. These terms are generally applied without formal documentation of ovulatory status. Furthermore, previously applied terms like \"dysfunctional uterine bleeding\" also carried a variable element of recognition that the label was a diagnosis of exclusion. 12 The resulting challenge was that practitioners and researchers applied different exclusions before selecting interventions or enrolling patients. Over time, these differences in terminology and use of operational definitions resulted in inconsistent application of diagnostic terms. 4,12-14 ES-2 Recent international consensus recommendations, formally adopted by FIGO in 2010 and published in 2011, more consistently align terminology by creating two major groupings (i.e., discrete struct ural vs. nonstructural) for causes of bleeding.9,15,16 The FIGO classification includes nine categories of abnormal bleeding arranged according to the acronym PALM - COEIN:9,15 four have objective visual criteria detected by imaging, biopsy, or pathology (i.e., PALM: p olyps; adenomyosis; l eiomyomata; and malignancy and hyperplasia) while another five are not directly related to structural abnormalities (i.e., COEIN: c oagulopathy; ovulatory dysfunction; e ndometrial; i atrogenic; and not yet classified). If we map the intended focus of this comparative effectiveness review to the FIGO classification, we are addressing the COEIN groups that are characterized as \"ovulatory dysfunction\" (AUB -O), hemostatic yet class ified\" (AUB -N) abnormal bleeding. However it is crucial to note that direct measures of ovulation are not employed in most available literature and endometrial samples for classification are even rarer, except when used to rule out malignancy. Indeed much remains to be explained about the pathophysiology of the very common and problematic complaint of unpredictable and/or heavy bleeding. In summary, the relevant population for this review includes nonpregnant women from menarche to menopause who have had abnormal bleeding (scant or heavy) for 3 months or longer that is not attributed to structural abnormalities, coagulation defects, systemic illnesses, or medications. While some reviews further subdivide women experiencing AUB into age groups, 17 such as those near menarche and in the perimenopausal timeframe, we plan to retain an emphasis on categorization. Women across the reproductive lifespan can have abnormal bleeding that arises from ovulatory dysfunction or endometrial processes. 18 While the underlying causes may vary, for instance from lack of consistent regulation of the hypothalamic -pituitary -ovarian axis in teens near the onset of menses, and from lack of ovarian reserve in perimenopausal women, the treatment options overlap. 19 We will report when r esearch was done with an age -restricted population but will otherwise cover all the relevant literature regardless of reproductive age or reproductive history of participants. Therapies In a recently published research article examining the practice patter ns for medical treatment of AUB, authors reported that practicing obstetrician- gynecologists most frequently selected oral contraceptives for the treatment of both irregular and abnormal cyclic menstrual bleeding and lacked an overall awareness of current evidence on effectiveness of treatment options for AUB. 20 Current recommendations for medical management of irregular and abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding include levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine system (LNG -IUS), nonsteroidal anti - (NSAIDs), antifibrinolytics, combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and progestogens.21-26 Surgical intervention is usually reserved for women with persistent bleeding that does not respond to medical therapy or for women who have finished childbearing and do not wish to indefinitely continue medical therapy.2,21 Scope and Key Questions The relevant population for this review includes nonpregnant women from menarche to menopause who have had AUB for 3 months or longer, that is not attributed to structural abnormalities, coagulation defects, systemic illnesses, or medications. This review evaluates the interventions and direct comparisons among treatments that are often used and promoted as first -ES-3 line choices, with the goal of clearly describing their effectiv eness and potential harms for use in primary care settings. We explicitly defined eligibility criteria using a PICOTS (population, intervention, comparator [s], outcome, timing, and setting) structure (Table A). Table A. PICOTS PICOTS Element Description Population: Nonpregnant women from menarche to menopause who have had abnormal bleeding for 3 months or longer whose bleeding is not caused by structural abnormalities, coagulation defects systemic disease, cancer, or medication. Two specific subtypes of abnormal bleeding will be the focus: Irregular uterine bleeding: problem bleeding (frequent or infrequent) of 3 months or greater duration, excluding regular cyclic/menstrual patterns of bleeding, fibroids, polyps, adenomyosis, cancers, medication side ef fects, coagulation defects, and related systemic disease. Abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding: problem bleeding of 3 months or greater duration, excluding irregular and unpredictable patterns of bleeding, fibroids, polyps, adenomyosis, cancers, medication si de effects, coagulation defects, and related systemic disease. Interventions:a Medical therapies o Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs o Antifibrinolytics o Oral hormone treatments (e.g., oral contraceptives, progestogens) o Levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine system o Vaginal ring contraceptive device Behavioral strategies (e.g., stress reduction, weight reduction, exercise) Complementary and alternative medicine therapies (e.g., acupuncture, herbal medicine) Comparator: Direct comparison among interventions listed above or comparison to placebo. Outcomes: Bleeding profile (e.g., amount, frequency, duration, pattern, symptom bother, hematocrit) Quality of life including both general and bleeding specific measures Pain related to bleeding Sexual function as reported by sexual function measures, general measures of sexual activity, frequency and satisfaction Patient satisfaction with outcomes and acceptability of treatment Fertility Time to conception Additional interventions including concurrent and consecutive surgical and nonsurgical treatments Harmsb (e.g., thromboembolic events, emotional side effects, weight gain, short - and long- term harms) Timing: Interventions initiated after symptoms present most months for 3 months or longer. Setting: Any clinical care setting. PICOTS = population, intervention, comparator, outcome, timing, and setting aExcluding surgical interventions and procedures such as endometrial ablation. bIncludes treatment -related adverse events (e.g., drug side effects); does not include consequences related to the failure to adequately treat the symptom . Key Questions Key Question 1A What is the evidence for the effectiveness of medical, behavioral, and complementary and alternative medicine interventions (e.g., hormonal treatment, weight loss, or acupuncture) for improving short and long- term outcomes in women with irregular uterine bleeding? ES-4 Key Question 1B What is the evidence for the effectiveness of medical, behavioral, and complementary and alternative medicine inter ventions (e.g., hormonal treatment, weight loss, or acupuncture) for improving short and long- term outcomes in women with abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding? Key Question 2 What are the harms, including adverse events, associated with medical, behavioral, and complementary and alternative medicine interventions (e.g., hormonal treatment, weight loss, or acupuncture) in women with irregular uterine bleeding or abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding? Analytic Framework We developed the analytic framework (Figure 1 of full report) based on clinical expertise of Key Informants and refined it with input from a Technical Expert Panel. The analytic framework illustrates the population, interventions, outcomes, and adverse effects that guided the literature search, study el igibility, screening, and synthesis. Methods Literature Search For K ey Q uestion (KQ) 1, we searched MEDLINE \u00ae, CINAHL \u00ae, and Embase. Search results were limited to papers published in English, and published in or after 1980. Search strategies used a combination of subject headings (i.e., controlled vocabulary) and keywords (Appendix A of full report). We also searched the reference lists of included publications and recent systematic reviews related to management of AUB. For KQ2, we expanded our search of primary literature to include standard drug package inserts, and structured a separate literature search to identify publications that conducted surveillance for harms in large datasets (Appendix A of full report). Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria We predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria related to the study population, intervention, comparators, outcomes, timing, and setting in order to assess the eligibility of the search results. Eligible studies had to explicitly define and describe the study population, interventions, and outcomes. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for women with irregular or abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding. We excluded studies of women with AUB caused by coagulation defects, systemic disease, structural abnormalities, cancer, or medication side - effects. For KQ1A we included studies of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) if the patient baseline and outcome data included information on cycle regularity. We excluded studies of women with infertility if the primary treatment goal was conception. Harms data to address KQ2 was captured from the included RCTs for KQ1, reports based on pharmacoepidemiological databases, large observational studies, large case- controlled studies, and postmarket ing surveillance data. ES-5 Study Selection We developed screening forms to assess eligibility for inclusion in the review for KQ1 and KQ2. We revised the forms following testing by the team. We conducted screening in two phases: abstract and full -text screenin g. Publications were promoted to full -text review when one reviewer indicated that the publication met all inclusion criteria or when the title and abstract did not provide adequate information to make a determination. Two reviewers independently reviewed each publication at the full -text screening phase. Discordant classifications were resolved in team meetings including senior investigators. Data Extraction Two reviewers independently extracted relevant data from all included publications using a predefin ed evidence table shell. A senior investigator reviewed the evidence tables for accuracy and completeness. The final evidence tables are provided in Appendix J of the full report. Quality (Risk of Bias) Assessment We assessed quality of RCTs using the Coc hrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool,27 which evaluates domains including sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, outcome data reporting, and reporting bias. Two independent reviewers assessed risk of bias as low, high, or unclear for each domain. We used a preestablished threshold of criteria to rate the quality of each study based on the risk of bias assessment as good, fair, or poor. Discordant assessments were resolved in team meetings including senior investigators. A summary of all com ponent items and overall risk of bias/quality score for each included study is provided in Appendix I of the full report. Data Synthesis We provide a systematic narrative synthesis of the available data from original research studies of acceptable quality for nonsurgical treatment of AUB. We present individual study data grouped by KQ and then intervention. Detailed study information is provided in evidence tables included in Appendix J of the full report. A meta -analysis was not feasible for this review. F ew studies had comparable treatment doses, interval, or duration of followup. Among those that did, the ability to aggregate data is limited by differences in outcomes measures which included measures of blood loss from sanitary product collection, and sel f-report using scoring systems including standardized pictorial systems. For regularity of bleeding no two measures of outcome were the same. Strength of the Body of Evidence For KQ1, we used explicit criteria to grade the overall strength of the evidence (e.g., low, moderate, high, and insufficient) on each intervention. We used established concepts of the quantity of evidence (e.g., numbers of studies, aggregate ending- sample sizes), the quality of evidence (i.e., from the quality ratings of individual articles), directness of the outcomes for informing the KQs, and the coherence or consistency of findings across similar and dissimilar studies and in comparison to known or the oretically sound principles of clinical or behavioral research and practice. For KQ2, we did not rate of strength of evidence because a fully inclusive ES-6 assessment of harms could not be completed for each of the 12 interventions that have been widely studie d in populations that lack direct applicability to this report. Applicability We assessed applicability of the results from the literature to the population of women with abnormal cyclic and irregular uterine bleeding. Using the PICOTS framework, we identi fied factors that may limit the applicability of individual research studies. We summarized the applicability of the body of evidence and described key elements from the PICOTS framework that characterize the applicability of the identified studies. Resul ts For KQ1, we identified 1 ,775 titles and abstracts for screening; 219 publications were identified as potentially eligible for inclusion and were promoted for full -text review. We identified 41 publications from 39 unique studies that met criteria for inclusion. Ten studies included in the review addressed KQ1A; 31 publications representing 29 studies addressed KQ1B. We conducted a separate search and screening process for KQ2. We identified 2,730 titles and abstracts for screening. Of these, 788 referenc es were promoted for full text review. Using predefined criteria, we found 25 publications about harms that were eligible for inclusion. We obtained package inserts for each KQ1 included drug intervention. Description of Included Studies (KQ1) Thirty -nine included studies evaluated NSAIDs ring study),54 progestogens study ),59 lifestyle/behavioral changes (2 studies),61,62 acupuncture (2 studies),61,63 and patient decision aids (3 studies)64-66 using at least one comparator or placebo arm. The total number of interventions addressed is greater than the number of studies because of direct comparisons between one or more interventions within single studies. Study duration was typically 6 months or less. Four of the studies addressing KQ1B included a followup of 1 to 2 years. KQ1A. Management of Irregular Uterine Bleeding Ten RCTs addressed restoring menstrual regularity in those with irregular uterine bleeding. Three were conducted in the United States,51,57,62 two in Italy,56,60 two in Turkey,58,59 and one each in China,63 Sweden,61 and the United Kingdom.55 The studies ranged in size from 23 to 201 participants and examined the efficacy of metformin (4 studies),55-58 progestogen (1 study),59 triphasic birth control pills (1 study),51 cabergoline (1 study),60 diet and exercise (1 stu dy),62 and acupuncture (2 studies).61,63 The majority compared treatment to placebo or sham intervention; three included comparisons of effectiveness of two interventions. Two studies were classified as good quality, 51,60 two studies as fair quality,55,63 and six studies as poor quality.56-59,61,62 Metformin and Exenatide Metformin was an active treatment arm in four RCTs conducted among women with PCOS. Two RCTs compared metformin outcomes to a placebo group,55,56 one compared metformin to N-acetyl -cystein e,58 and one metformin only, exenatide only, and ES-7 both.57 In each case, compared with baseline or placebo, metformin was effective for improving the regularity of bleeding over a number of months.55,56,58 Combination therapy improved cycle frequency better than metformin or exenatide alone in 60 women with PCOS.57 Progestogens Vaginal micronized progesterone and oral dydrogesterone were studied in a single trial among women clinically classified as having dysfunctional uterine bleeding.59 Both routes of administration improved cycle regularity with 92 percent and 85 percent of participants, respectively, achieving cycle length of less than 35 days and no intermenstrual bleeding by the third cycle of use. Effects were statistically comparable, but the trial was not powered to show equivalence or noninferiority. COCs A triphasic oral contraceptive was also studied in a single RCT among women with irregular uterine bleeding.51 This trial included women with both short and long intervals between bleeding episodes and with both heavy and normal amounts of bleeding. The outcomes are provided by the authors in aggregate and not presented by initial bleeding characteristics. Overall , 68 percent of women taking the COC achieved excellent or good cycle control as assessed by the study investigators compared with 26 percent of those receiving a placebo. Cabergoline In a very preliminary investigation of cabergoline,60 a drug indicated for the treatment of prolactinoma, treatment over 6 months was associated with return of regular menses in three of eight women compared with none of six receiving placebo. Women in the study had PCOS and normal prolactin levels. Behavioral and Lifestyle Interventions Among adolescents with PCOS, both a low -fat, calorie -restricted diet and a carbohydrate- restricted diet in conjunction with 30 minutes of aerobic activity 3 days a week resulted in more regular menses among those who lost we ight. 62 This single small study did not present outcomes by the diet group to which participants were randomized. Presumably there was not a clear difference, meaning there is no evidence for which dietary approach to choose. A single trial of acupuncture in 84 women 61 also included an exercise control group at the same intensity as the diet and exercise trial. This group experienced a meaningful improvement in their menstrual frequency (42 % increase from baseline calculated by study investigators) that was comparable to acupuncture at 32 weeks. We did not find evidence comparing diet to exercise directly. Complementary and Alternative Medicine Two studies of acupuncture with different underlying hypotheses and different methods (conventional acupuncture and low -frequency electroacupuncture) found benefit for a specific style of acupuncture when compared with no intervention or alternate placement of acupuncture needles.61,63 By 32 weeks in the trial of electroacupuncture for PCOS,61 women who received 14 acupuncture treatments over 16 weeks had a 121 percent improvement in cycle regularity while those who exercised only had a 42 percent improvement. Both were statistically comparable in this small trial. Both acupuncture and exercise were superior to no treat ment. In the trial of two differing placements of needles every other day for 3 cycles, 63 women who received treatment ES-8 for \"mind tranquilizing and menstruation promotion\" had greater improvements (no treatment failures among 21 women) compared with those r eceiving traditional placement (n=16) for \"delayed menses\" among whom 19 percent did not have improvements. KQ1B. Management of Abnormal Cyclic Bleeding We identified 31 publications representing 29 studies addressing nonsurgical interventions for the mana gement of abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding. The interventions evaluated in the studies included the LNG -IUS (7 contraceptive vaginal ring (1 stud y).54 We also identified three studies that evaluated decision aids for the management of AUB.65-67 Included studies described nonsurgical interventions and compared these interventions to another intervention (17 studies), 28,29,31,33,34,37,38,40-45,48,49,54,58,67 placebo (9 studies),30,32,35,36,39,47,50,52,53 or usual care (4 studies)46,64-66 Studies were conducted in 16 countries (United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Pol and, Ukraine, Turkey, India, Egypt, and Brazil). Of the 29 included studies, 4 studies were assessed as good quality, 35,47,52,53 8 as fair quality,30,38,39,42,45,49,50,54 and 17 as poor quality.28,29,31-34,36,37,40,41,43,44,46,48,64-66 LNG -IUS LNG -IUS was an effective intervention for reduction of abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding in all seven of the identified studies.28,41-46 Five studies that measured menstrual blood loss (MBL) directly from collected sanitary materials documented 70 to 87 per cent reductions in bleeding when comparing treated women with their baseline.28,41-43,45 When measured, 80 percent or more of women who were enrolled because they met criteria for heavy menses achieved normal total blood loss. These improvements were signi ficantly greater than changes in comparison groups treated with NSAIDs, COCs, progestogens, and usual care. Evidence suggests the LNG -IUS effectively reduces self -reported symptom severity and duration of bleeding. A single study among women scheduled for hysterectomy found that LNG -IUS users were more likely to cancel their surgery compared with women in the usual care group. 46 NSAIDs In 13 studies, NSAIDs including mefenamic acid, naproxen, meclofenamate, and flurbiprofen given at the onset of menses for up to 5 days reduced MBL when compared with baseline.28-40 NSAIDs are effective when compared with placebo.35,39,68 Overall , 6 of 13 studies provided statistical comparisons to baseline only. Evidence is equivocal, one trial each, showing NSAIDs are similar in effectiveness or superior to oral norethisterone. 33,37 When measured, specific NSAIDs have been shown to reduce blood loss by 20 to 59 percent.28-31,33-35,38-40,68 While NSAIDs can significantly reduce MBL, they did not consistently reduce bleeding t o levels considered clinically normal (i.e., less than 80 ml) in all patients. There was considerable variability in response, with some patients experiencing an increase in blood loss during treatment. Studies evaluated treatment durations from one to six menstrual cycles. There were no differences in MBL reductions between NSAIDs and oral norethisterone or COCs. There were also no differences seen between individual types of NSAIDs, specifically mefenamic acid and naproxen. The most recent study found sim ilar reductions in patient -reported assessments of bleeding severity when NSAIDs plus TXA was compared with TXA alone. 40 ES-9 TXA All seven RCTs including TXA treatment demonstrated effectiveness for improving heavy bleeding.29,34,40,47-50 TXA at a dose of 1.95 to 4.5 grams per day for 4 to 5 days from the onset of bleeding led to a clinically significant reduction in MBL, ranging from a 26 to 54 percent decrease in studies lasting up to a year. Both biologic and self -reported symptoms of bleeding severity wer e improved. In comparison to progestogens (norethisterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate), COCs, and NSAIDs, TXA provided greater reduction in MBL, however not all trials presented statistical analysis for head -to-head comparisons. No head- to- head compari sons LNG -IUS identified. COCs Five RCTs included groups treated with COCs.31,41,43,52,53 Measured reduction in bleeding was from 43 to 69 percent with complete normalization of total volume of bleeding achieved in 30 to 44 percent of women. One crossover comparison to mefenamic acid in 24 participants found both to be effective but lacked pow er to determine if either treatment was superior. 31 Two placebo -controlled studies found COCs effective for reducing menstrual bleeding and days of bleeding.52,53 In the two head- to-head comparisons between COCs and LNG -IUS,41,43 reductions in heavy menstr ual bleeding were documented in both treatment groups. Women with a LNG - IUS had greater benefit. Contraceptive Vaginal Ring A single RCT compared the efficacy of the contraceptive vaginal ring with norethisterone in 95 women with abnormal cyclic uterine bl eeding. The treatments were equally effective, reducing the patient -reported bleeding score by 67 percent in the contraceptive vaginal ring group and by 70 percent in the norethisterone group.54 Decision Aids Three studies investigated decisions aids to as sist women seeking treatment for heavy cyclic bleeding in making informed decisions about care.64-66 Their findings suggest these tools do increase patient knowledge and enhance satisfaction with care. Overall , decision aids did not result in choices that influence disease symptoms in directly measurable ways. One study found fewer women who received the decision aid ultimately choose surgical referral and hysterectomy. 65 However this treatment choice cannot necessarily be linked to improvement in bleeding symptoms. KQ 2. Harms of Interventions for Management of Abnormal Bleeding Capturing useful information about potential harms of treatment for reproductive -age women that is specifically applicable to interventions for abnormal bleeding is a challenge bec ause many agents have multiple indications and harms are often not well -studied in reproductive -age women. A wide range of interventions are used to treat abnormal bleeding. Twelve interventions relevant to the primary care setting were identified for this report. In this section we have restricted brief summaries to medications only (behavioral and lifestyle interventions, acupuncture, and decision support tools, each with little potential for serious harm, are discussed in the full report). We summarized harms and present findings in this order: ES-10 Addressing the clinical trials included in this review. Compiling the key content of package inserts. Searching for surveillance studies that aimed to examine risk of harm in large populations of individuals (i.e ., 1,600 or more) for specific interventions. Providing information from existing contemporary reviews and guidance on harms for common medications with broad indications. We have grouped the interventions together, presenting those for abnormal irregula r uterine bleeding first, followed by those for abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding. In instances in which the agent was used for both conditions the information is presented only once. Metformin and Exenatide In the included trials , metformin is associated with increased gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea.55-57 This is compatible with the package insert.69 Severe harms of metformin detected in larger studies, typically among older adults wit h type 2 diabetes, include lactic acidosis, serious hypoglycemia (most often in combination with other agents) and liver failure. Incidence of such serious harms is below 1 in 10,000 and may be as low as 1 per 100,000 person- years of exposure. 70 Exenatide is typically used as a second agent when adequate glycemic control is not achieved with a single diabetes treatment. Its harm profile is uninformed by the literature in this review which included only one study with 40 women treated. 57 The package insert s uggests hypoglycemia is the most serious side effect,71 and large scale surveillance studies have not confirmed initial concerns that pancreatitis was more common among those treated.72,73 Reviews including data about harms identify metformin as a first- line agent of choice for diabetes management, and concur that both agents are associated with excess GI complaints.74-76 Progesterone Route of progestogen administration was compared in one comparative effectiveness trial for women with irregular menses.59 In the remaining studies, progestogens were included as the comparator arms (in each case hypothesizing and documenting the superiority of the agent under study) or within COCs. 33,37,42,44,45,48,49 The progesterone -releasing intrauterine system is separately reviewed below. Progestogens, like depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), and vaginal micronized progesterone gel are associated with increased complaints of weight gain, fluid reten tion, abdominal pain, nausea, change of mood, and change in appetite. Many of these were documented in the included studies which were typically under -powered or made comparisons to other active agents, making comparisons of risk of side effects less infor mative. Among the most common complaints associated with progestogens is irregular bleeding. Package inserts also note potential dangers of exposure to high doses in pregnancy. 77 A surveillance study has linked DMPA to increased future rate of fractures (t hough analyses were not controlled for key confounders like smoking and body mass index),78 while another large study showed recovery of normal bone density within 2 to 3 years of ceasing use.79 Some data suggest use of progestogens is associated with incr eased risk of deep venous thrombosis, though other research restricted to those using particular drugs for the indication of heavy menses demonstrates that women with heavy menses have higher risk of deep vein thrombosis regardless of the intervention they use suggesting some degree of confounding by the indication ES-11 for which the drug is given.80 Reviews and meta- analyses confirm common side effects, including progestogens being a cause of irregular bleeding.81 COCs Primary care providers and many women are aware of the most serious risks of COCs and the more common side -effects including edema, nausea, breast tenderness, skin changes, and GI symptoms. The studies in this review reported harms profiles for common symptoms similar to package insert documents.82-85 Certain risks like that for venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, hypertension, gallbladder disease , and benign liver tumors are also well documented. Patients and clinicians should be alerted to factors that increase ri sk of complications such as cigarette smoking, advancing age (with 35 often used as a threshold), and predisposition to thrombotic events. Two recent systematic reviews have reiterated increased risk for deep venous thrombosis with a suggestion that risk i s lowest in those COCs containing levonorgestrel or norgestimate as the progestogens. 6,86 Cabergoline The sole study of cabergoline in this review was exploratory with 14 women with PCOS and 15 normal controls.60 When used for treatment of prolactinoma, this drug is associated with nausea, headache, dizziness, lack of energy, and constipation. Cochrane reviews on three different conditions found no difference in overall risk of harms for cabergoline compared with placebo, 87,88 however a review of use for Pa rkinson's patients revealed increased valvular heart disease on echocardiogram with few symptomatic individuals.89,90 The applicability of this data to young women with irregular menses is very limited. LNG -IUS Participants in the included trial of use of the LNG -IUS for abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding had few serious complications. Common side effects include changes in bleeding pattern including spotting and complete absence of menses. Abdominal pain/bloating, headache, depressed or altered mood, heavy bleeding, breast tenderness, and intrauterine device expulsion are expected to occur in approximately 5 percent or more of women using this treatment, as reflected in package inserts. 91,92 Surveillance studies provide good estimates from large registries of users. Difficult insertions occur in 3 to 4 percent of women, with painful insertion occurring in about 1 percent. 93,94 Risk of uterine perforation is between 0.9 and 2.6 per 1,000 users and the majority are not recognized at the time of insertion.94-97 Nulliparous status and noncontraceptive indications do not appear to influence risk of perforation. Hair loss, that is known to be reversible in many but not all patients, occurs in about 1.8 per 1,000 users. 95 The LNG -IUS is not associated with increased risk of deep vein thrombosis in more than 8 million person- years of observation.98-100 Systematic reviews match package insert and surveillance data also noting that expulsion occurs in 5 to 16 percent of women.81,84,101,102 Contraceptive Vaginal Ring In the single trial of the contraceptive vaginal ring included in this review, the incidence of nausea, headache, and breast tenderness was comparable in both treatment groups during three cycles of treatment. The contraceptive vaginal ring users were less likely to report breakthrough bleeding than women taking norethisterone. Local events, including vaginal discomfort, vaginitis, foreign body sensation and coital problems were reported more f requently in ring-ES-12 users, but no one discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Product materials note that the contraceptive vaginal ring is contraindicated in cigarette smokers over age 35 due to increased risk of venous thromboembolism. A 15- year coho rt study that included over 38,000 person- years of contraceptive vaginal ring use reported an elevated adjusted relative risk of 2.5 (95% CI, 1.4 to 4.4) for thrombotic stroke and 2.1 (95% CI, 0.7 to 6.5) for myocardial infarction compared with women (over 9 million person- years) who had not used hormonal contraception. 98 Systematic reviews have noted that the risk of venous thromboembolism for the contraceptive vaginal ring was elevated and similar to COCs. 103 NSAIDs NSAIDs are generally dosed intermittent ly in young women with problem bleeding. This makes detection of harms challenging. Complaints commonly reported in trials included: abdominal pain, nausea, gastritis, and light headedness or dizziness. Less common events included rashes and itching. These agents include a boxed warning on the product labels about cardiovascular and GI risks. 104-106 Upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurs in approximately 1 percent of patients treated for 3 to 6 months and at higher rates with longer use.105-107 However, the majority of use assessed in this way is chronic, daily use. Product materials note that short term use is not without risk but do not provide risk estimates. Other common side effects include edema, abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, vomiting, heart burn, headache, nervousness , and conflicting central nervous system complaints like anxiety and tremor as well as malaise and somnolence. A pooled analysis of trials found mild neurologic and GI adverse events were more common in those treated than among pla cebo users. 108 The available reviews note additional investigation is required to clarify potential cardiovascular risks.109,110 TXA Within studies in our review similar numbers of participants withdrew from TXA treatment arms as from placebo and comparis on groups.47,48 Side effect profiles were similar across those treated and untreated with the agent who remained in trials. The Food and Drug Administration has examined concerns about changes in QT -interval changes on electrocardiograms, but overall the n umber of subjects included in trials was considered to be low for evaluating harms and drug safety. 111 The updated prescription label now includes headache, nasal and sinus symptoms, back pain, and abdominal pain as occurring in more than 10 percent of those taking the drug.112 Joint pain, muscle cramps and spasms, migraine, anemia, and fatigue occur in mo re than 5 percent of users. Post -marketing reports have identified thrombosis, allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, and visual disturbances.112 This led to contraindications similar to those for COCs recommending that women with any history of thrombotic disease, risk for thrombotic disease, who smoke, are over age 35, or who concomitantly use tissue plasminogen activator, avoid the drug. Several reviews have examined harms and concluded that GI effects are most common and no thrombotic events were ide ntified in 10 study populations. 113-116 It is important to note that overall these trials are small and large -scale surveillance data over time will likely be required for definitive answers. ES-13 Discussion Summary of Strength of Evidence and Findings The strength of evidence tables (Table B and Table C) summarize the total number of studies and within those studies the number of women who received the specific intervention. The tables also provide the assessment of the risk of bias, consistency of findings acr oss trials, directness of the evidence that treatment improves the symptom, and precision of the estimates provided by the literature. Overall the evidence to answer KQs about the management of AUB did not reach standards for high strength of evidence for any intervention from the literature relevant to treatment of women with irregular uterine bleeding (Table B). COCs, as represented in a single good quality placebo controlled trial with 201 participants, documented effectiveness. 51 The treatment effect was large with improvement in bleeding patterns reported for more than 80 percent of women taking COC compared with 45 percent for the placebo group. Combined, these factors provided moderate evidence of benefit. Use of metformin is supported by low strength of evidence predominantly related to small trials of somewhat limited quality. For the remainder of the interventions investigated for management of irregular uterine bleeding, there is insufficient evidence that follows from single and/or lower quality s tudies. Table B.

For management of heavy cyclic bleeding, the literature was more robust (Table C). COCs are supported by high strength of evidence for the purpose of decreasing MBL. The LNG -IUS, various NSAIDs, and TXA are also effective for reducing the amount of measured menstrual bleeding and are each supported by moderate strength of evidence. In head -to-head comparisons with statistically significant differences, the LNG -IUS has one trial showing superiority to NSAIDs ,28 two showing superiority to COCs,41,43 and two showing superiority to progestogens.42,44,45 COCs were equivalent in one trial compared with an NSAID.31 TXA was also superior to NSAIDs,29,34 and when combined with an NSAID was superior to TXA alone.40 Most of these interventions have been shown to have additional positive effects, typically including shorter duration of bleeding a nd improvement in symptoms when participants used standardized scoring systems to report treatment response.

ES-16 Applicability Applicability describes the extent to which results observed in published studies from this review are likely to reflect the expected outcomes when an intervention is applied to broader populations in real -world conditions. Studies for this review were intended to provide information to inform primary care management of irregular or cyclic AUB. In shaping the methods for this review, we engineered the report so that the included research is applicable to primary care of women with these complaints in the United States. Because we narrowed our focus to symptomatic women of reproductive age w ith chronic complaints of abnormal bleeding, this comes at the cost of fewer studies being addressed. However, it assures that studies included were explicitly designed to examine the effectiveness of the treatments for improving the outcomes of interest i n the populations of interest. Applicability of the findings is therefore high. For each intervention, it is important to note the following provisions. The results of this review apply for women: Who are reproductive age and state they have an irregular pattern of menstrual bleeding or heavy cyclic menstrual bleeding; Without abnormal findings on pelvic exam or on ultrasound report (fibroids, polyps); Without an intrauterine device in place, and who are not pregnant or lactating; Who are healthy, and without renal impairment, hepatic impairment, intestinal disease, thyroid disease, abnormal cervical cytology, noncyclic bleeding, history or presence of significant medical problems (e.g., thromboembolic disease, coagulopathy, subarachnoid hemorrhage, endocrine disorders, or eye disease); For whom any additional clinically determined diagnostic and screening tests have be en completed to rule out other causes of abnormal bleeding; Does not have any of the contraindications found in the Food and Drug Adminis tration sources discussed in the main document and do not have risks of drug -drug interactions if they take multiple prescription medications. This review was not designed to guide evaluation of women with abnormal bleeding, rather to address what treatmen ts have evidence of effectiveness once the diagnosis is established and primary care management is to be initiated. Overall applicability was high. However, often women who are in trials do not reflect the full range of those with abnormal bleeding seen i n primary care. Study participants were more likely to be normal weight, nonsmokers, with few, if any concomitant conditions. The interventions (except in the case of specific comparators as noted) are available in the same doses and formulation in the Uni ted States. Outcomes such as measured blood loss, self -reported symptom severity and days of bleeding are of direct relevance to women with abnormal bleeding. Our findings are sparse for outcomes which can be considered essential for a condition like AUB t hat is defined by symptoms. Important outcomes include satisfaction with response to treatment, definitive assessments of whether or not the women considered their complaint resolved, and whether they wished to continue the same treatment or add additional treatments. Followup in general was brief, so the findings may not apply well to management of a chronic condition like abnormal bleeding. This makes assessments of harms challenging since use of interventions over extended periods may have different risk profiles from short timeframes like one to six cycles. ES-17 Research Gaps Recent improvements in unifying nomenclature and formalizing consensus definitions for the clinical groupings of bleeding abnormalities9 will likely continue to have a positive influence on the ability to properly interpret the findings of individual studies, to identify groups of studies with comparable methods, and to aggregate results. An array of methodologic recommendations and specific research needs are detailed in the full report. Common themes included the need for larger, better controlled RCTs, with combinations of biological and patient -reported outcomes and that evaluate outcomes over longer periods of time, at least past 1 year. Populations need to become more representative of those seeking care (teens, heavier women, those with common comorbidities like diabetes) and need to directly address common clinical interventions like COCs and progestogens that are represented in the literature by a surprisingly small number of older studies, given how ubiquitous their application is in clinical care. No studies examine trajectories through care, mapping sequential treatment options or costs of care based on the initial treatment strategy assigned. No studies examined combining effective treatments, especially in women who had improvements but did not reach satisfactory control of bleeding or cycle regularity. Overall trial designs should begin to shift towards effectiveness from efficacy, moving beyond the level of proof of concept that is required for drug and device approval to a deeper level that can better inform care, cost considerations and policy. Conclusions Women who have problematic irregular or heavy cyclic menstrual bleeding have a number of treatment options available that are supported by systematic review of the research literature. These include high strength of evidence that COCs can improve menstrual regularity for women with irregular bleeding patterns. Metformin is supported by moderate strength of evidence for impro ving cycle regularity especially among women with PCOS. This provides both a contraceptive and a noncontraceptive option for irregular menses. Other interventions like progestogens are associated with statistically and clinically meaningful improvements fr om baseline patterns, however the overall evidence is insufficient from well -designed, larger studies with ability to directly compare treatment arms rather than only pre -post measures within groups. Multiple interventions for heavy cyclic bleeding are supported by evidence that they reduce MBL. These include strong evidence that COCs are effective and moderate strength of evidence that the LNG -IUS, NSAIDs, and TXA reduce bleeding relative to baseline, decrease total volume of bleeding when comparisons are made across treatment groups, and when measured, decrease days of bleeding per cycle. In direct comparisons, LNG -IUS is superior to NSAIDs. TXA is superior to NSAIDs and TXA combined with an NSAID was superior to TXA alone. Results from COC and NSAID compa risons suggest comparable effectiveness. Not all women will benefit from these interventions. Across agents data are sparse to evaluate long -term improvements and risk of harms. Limitations include a predominance of small, short trials lacking standard terminology and diagnostic criteria for identifying and including women with AUB. Tools for collecting outcome data are crude (collection of sanitary products) and may contribute to a high rate of attrition. Biologic outcomes, like measured blood loss and hemoglobin or hematocrit levels, may neglect the importance of patient -reported outcomes that assess whether symptoms are considered resolved by women themselves. Nevertheless, the variety of effective options suggests many women can achieve symptom relief and have available choices that address both symptoms and ES-18 contraceptive or fertility desires, as well as potentially improving other symptoms like menstrual cramping.

PMID: 21196541. 1 Introduction Background Condition Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is among the most common of gynecologic complaints from reproductive -age women in ambulatory care settings \u2014of similar frequency to th e number seeking care for urinary tract infections and vaginitis. In the general population, AUB is estimated to affect 11 to 13 percent of reproductive -age women . The prevalence of AUB increases with age, reaching 24 percent in women aged 36 to 40.1,2 In addition to gynecologists, all primary care practitioners including pediatricians, family physicians, advanced practice nurses, and internists, will encounter the need to evaluate, treat, or refer women wit h bleeding- related symptoms.3 Women generally present because the amount, timing, or other characteristics of the bleeding have changed from their individual norm. Population norms for menstrual bleeding, as established by 5th and 95th percentiles, are:4-7 Frequency of menses within a 24 to 38 day window Regularity (cycle -to-cycle variation) within 2 to 20 days Duration of flow from 4 to 8 days Volume of blood loss from 5 to 80 ml Symptoms outside this range or different from normal for the individual can become problematic and deserve evaluation because they can warn of underlying conditions. Common problems include worry about the cause, embarrassment if the bleeding includes flooding- type bleeding with saturation of clothing, missed work and responsibili ties, limitations of social activities and exercise, decreases or changes in sexual activity, and frustration with costs of sanitary protection. 1,8 Collectively, the effects of troublesome bleeding reduce quality of life and drive desire for information about causes and treatment options.1,8 There is not a clear consensus on the clinical evaluation of a patient presenting with abnormal bleeding. Recommendations suggest that initial evaluation confirm the source and timing of bleeding, and exclude certain a rchitectural etiologies, cancer, coagulation defects, and systemic disease. The 2011 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification recommends a structured history followed by uterine evaluation. 9 In the research setting, the a lkaline hematin method is the preferred technique for direct measurement of total menstrual blood loss (MBL). The pictorial blood loss assessment chart is a semi -quantitative tool for u niform report ing of bleeding as represented by the degree of saturati on of sanitary pads and tampons. Diagnostic tools and evaluation strategies are not within the scope of this review;10,11 however, the review capture s the operational definitions used by researchers and address es applicability of the findings to contemporary practice. Terminology Nomenclature to classify symptomatic problem bleeding has evolved steadily over the past several decades.12 Early classifications primarily used characteristics of the bleeding to group women. Terms like menorrhagia (abnormally long or heavy menses) and metrorrhagia (bleeding at irregular intervals) were often linked with timing (short or long intervals) and amo unt (heavy or light) to infer whether or not regular and predictable ovulation was occurring and further assign likely ovulatory or anovulatory status. These terms are generally applied without formal 2 documentation of ovulatory status. Furthermore, previously applied terms like \"dysfunctional uterine bleeding \" also carried a variable element of recognition that the label was a diagnosis of exclusion.12 The resulting challenge was that practitioners and researchers applied different exclusions before selecti ng interventions or enrolling patients. Over time, differences in terminology choice and in operational definitions have resulted in wide inconsistencies in application of diagnostic terms.4,12-14 Recent international consensus recommendations , formally a dopted by FIGO in 2010 and published in 2011, more consistently align terminology by creating two major groupings (i.e., discrete structural vs. nonstructural) for causes of bleeding.9,15,16 The FIGO classification includes nine categories of abnormal blee ding arranged according to the acronym PALM - COEIN:9,16 four have objective visual criteria detected by imaging, biopsy, or pathology (i.e., PALM: p olyps; adenomyosis; l eiomyomata; and malignancy and hyperplasia) while another five are not directly related to structural abnormalities (i.e., COEIN: c oagulopathy; ovulatory dysfunction; e ndometrial; i atrogenic; and not yet classified). If we map the intended focus of this comparative effectiveness review (CER) to the FIGO classification, we are addressing the COEIN groups that are characterized as \"ovulatory dysfunction\" (AUB classified\" (AUB -N) abnormal bleeding . However it is crucial to note that direct measures of ovulation are not employed in most available literature and endometrial samples for classification are even more rare, except when used to rule out malignancy. Indeed much remains to be explained about the pathophysiology of the very common and problematic complaint of unpredictable and/ or heavy bleeding. In summary, t he relevant population for this review includes nonpregnant women from menarche to menopause who have had abnormal bleeding (scant or heavy) for 3 months or longer that is not attributed to structural abnormalities, coagulat ion defects, systemic illnesses , or medications. While some reviews further subdivide women experiencing AUB into age groups, 17 such as those near menarche and in the perimenopausal timeframe, we plan to retain an emphasis on categorization. Women across the reproductive lifespan can have abnormal bleeding that arises from ovulatory dysfunction or endometrial processes. 18 While th e underlying causes may vary, for instance from lack of consistent regulation of the hypothalamic -pituitary -ovarian axis in teens near the onset of menses, and from lack of ovarian reserve in perimenopausal women, the treatment options overlap. 3 We will re port when research was done with an age -restricted population but will otherwise cover all the relevant literature regardless of reproductive age or reproductive history of participants. Therapies Current guidelines from professional societies including the American Co ngress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,19-22 the American Academy of Family Physicians,23 and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence24 recommend medical therapy, including the levonorgestrel -releasing -IUS), and progestogens , as the first-line treatment for irregular uterine bleeding and abnormal cyclic bleeding. In a recently published research article,25 Matteson and colleagues examined the practice patterns and attitudes from a U .S. sample of obstetricians and gynecologists regarding the medical treatment of women with AUB . The authors reported that practicing obstetrician - gynecologists most frequently s elected COCs for the treatment of both irregular and abnormal 3 cyclic menstrual bleeding and that participants lacked an overall awareness of current evidence on effectiveness of common treatment options for AUB .25 However, another recent publication26 reported that, that in conflict with recommendations, uterine -preserving surgical procedures were the most common first- line treatment for women with heavy menstrual bleeding within a large cohort from a national claims database of large employers. Prima ry Care Treatment Options Pharmacologic therapies to treat AUB in the ambulatory setting include estrogens, progestogens, combination (estrogen and progestogen) hormonal -releasing intrauterine devic es (IUDs) . Medical interventions are generally considered first -line treatment.27,28 Surgical intervention is usually reserved for women with persistent bleeding that does not respond to medical therapy or for women who have finished childbearing and do not wish to continue medical therapy indefinitely.2,23 LNG -IUS A pooled analysis of data from five randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) reported that the LNG -IUS provided clinically and statistically significant sustained reductions in MBL .29 Locally released progesterone from the IUD reduces growth of the uterine lining , minimizing the tissue available to be shed during menstruation. IUDs are used as contraception by approximately 5 percent of women in the United States.30 Based on large -scale claims data, us e of the LNG -IUS increased 19 -fold between 2002 and 2008 to 7.7 per 1000 women , becoming the most commonly used IUD in the United States.31 NSAIDs NSAIDs are commonly used to treat AUB (more recently termed AUB -E) because of the role of prostaglandins in the pathogenesis of heavy menstrual bleeding. Higher levels of prostaglandin E2 have been observed in the endometria of women with heavy menstrual bleeding. 32 Additional evidence points to an abnormal ratio of spec ific prostaglandins as a contributing factor to problems with hemostasis.32 NSAIDs act to reduce prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme cyclo -oxygenase and therefore reducing endometrial prostaglandin levels leading to decreased potential for vas odilation and angiogenesis .33 Based on a limited number of small studies, a 2007 Cochrane Review34 found that NSAIDs were superior to placebo but less effective than tranexamic acid and LNG -IUS at reducing MBL . TXA is an that slows the breakdown of fibrin in blood clots. By decreasing the degradation of physiologic blood clots, blood flow from uterine vessel s sealed by the clot is decreased. Since it is not a hormonal agent and does not have contraceptive effects it may be useful for wo men who desire a pregnancy or for whom hormonal treatment i s contraindicated. TXA appears to be well -tolerated and cost -effective, reducing blood loss considerably and improving health related quality of life for women with menorrhagia.35 COCs COCs are com monly used to manage abnormal bleeding associated with ovulation since they work in part by superimposing an organized cycle and discourage thick growth of the uterine lining. The American Co ngress of Obstetrics and Gynecologists 2010 Practice Bulletin for 4 noncontraceptive uses of hormonal contraceptives recommends COCs as a reasonable choice to regulate and reduce menstrual bleeding, based on good and consistent scientific evidence.21 However, according to a 2009 Cochrane systematic review,36 there is insu fficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of the oral contraceptive pill compared with other medical therapies, placebo, or no therapy for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding.36 In a clinical review for diagnosis and management of AUB ,37 authors assert that COCs are likely beneficial for treatment of anovulatory (i.e., acyclic) AUB but there is lack of good quality data to support their use in abnormal cyclic bleeding.37 The COC is also known to cause abnormal bleeding patterns , with breakthrou gh bleeding reported as one of the most common reasons for discontinuation of COC use.38 Additional data are needed on the number needed to treat and the number need ed to harm for adverse effects. Progestogens During a normal cycle, the natural rise and fa ll of progesterone, which is produced by the ovary after ovulation, has multiple biological effects on the endometrium. These include \"organization\" that results in the coordinated withdrawal bleeding observed as the menses after progesterone levels fall. Cyclic administration of progest ogens in women with AUB is intended to mimic natural production of progesterone in the luteal phase and then withdrawal, by providing the agent for a number of days, typically 10 to 14, after which bleeding occurs. Other methods of administration of progest ogen , such as by long acting injection or oral contraceptive pills that contain only a progestogen, exploit a different biologic property of progestogens. When continuously administere d, progestogens encourage endometrial quiescence and reduce growth of the endometrium . In women with AUB , these effects can modulate problematic symptoms by fostering endometrial stability and a relatively thin endometrium resulting in l ess bleeding . The American Co ngress of Obstetrics and Gynecologists practice bulletins on management of anovulatory bleeding and noncontraceptive use s of hormonal contraceptives note that progestogens are an appropriate first -line choice for medical management of irregular b leeding that results from lack of regular, predictable ovulation. 19,21 Behavioral and Lifestyle Interventions Diet and physical activity interventions have been proposed for irregular menstrual bleeding because irregular menses often indicate irregular or absent ovulation. Obesity and metabolic syndrome, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) , are associated with increased risk of anovulatory cycles. Trials that have achieved modest weight loss in infertile patients have restored regular ovulatory fun ction in a majority of women with obesity -related subfertility. 39 Both aerobic and strength training as well as weight loss may improve blood sugar profiles and reduce relative or frank insulin resistance, which are intermediates to restoring regular menses in some women. Complementary and Alternative Medicine Initial literature scans suggested that there is an extremely limited body of literature on trials of complementary and alternative medicine for AUB . Complementary and alternative medicine based therapies are included as interventions of interest due to their increasing popularity among patients and growing interest to clinicians.40 5 Scope and Key Questions Scope of the Review The relevant population for this review includes nonpregnant women from mena rche to menopause who have had AUB for 3 months or longer , that is not attributed to structural abnormalities, coagulation defects, systemic illnesses , or medications . The literature reflects various management options for women with AUB with conflicting recommendations/summaries. Interventions of interest for this review include medical, complementary and alternative medicine, and behavioral/lifestyle interventions. This review does not consider surgical interventions for AUB , as surgical management is adequately covered by other groups conducting systematic reviews. This review is focused on the evidence available to inform selection of nonsurgical options to treat AUB with an emphasis on interventions that are accessible to and within t he scope of usual practice for primary care practitioners in a clinical care setting . This means that while we did not restrict literature review to studies conducted only in primary care settings, we did restrict the review to include only those intervent ions that could be deployed in primary care. We address abnormal bleeding that is chronic in nature, meaning the symptom has persisted for the majority of the prior 3 months, and is of two primary and common types: (1) irregular in timing (i.e., acyclic); and (2) abnormal though cyclic. We explicitly defined eligibility criteria using a PICOTS (population, intervention, comparator(s), outcome, timing, and setting) structure (Table 1). Table 1. PICOTS PICOTS Element Description Population: Nonpregnant women from menarche to menopause who have had abnormal bleeding for 3 months or longer whose bleeding is not caused by structural abnormalities, coagulation defects, systemic disease, cancer, or medication. Two specific subtypes of abnormal bleeding will be the focus: Irregular uterine bleeding: problem bleeding (frequent or infrequent) of 3 months or greater duration, excluding regular cyclic/menstrual patterns of bleeding, fibroids, polyps, adenomyosis, cancers, medication side effects, coagulation defects, and related systemic disease. Abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding: problem bleeding of 3 months or greater duration, excluding irregular and unpredictable patterns of bleeding, fibroids, polyps, adenomyosis, cancers, medication side effects, coagulation defects, and related systemic disease. Interventions:a Medical therapies o Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs o Antifibrinolytics o Oral hormone treatments (e.g., oral contraceptives, progestogens) o Levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine system o Vaginal ring contraceptive device Behavioral strategies (e.g., stress reduction, weight reduction, exercise) Complementary and alternative medicine therapies (e.g., acupuncture, herbal medicine) Comparator: Direct comparison among interventions listed abo ve or comparison to placebo. 6 Table 1 . PICOTS (continued) PICOTS Element Description Outcomes: Bleeding profile (e.g., amount, frequency, duration, pattern, symptom bother, hematocrit) Quality of life including both general and bleeding specific measures Pain related to bleeding Sexual function as reported by sexual function measures, general measures of sexual activity, frequency and satisfaction Patient satisfaction with outcomes and acceptability of treatment Fertility Time to conception Additional interventions including concurrent and consecutive surgical and nonsurgical treatments Harmsb (e.g., thromboembolic events, emotional side effects, weight gain, short - and long- term harms) Timing: Interven tions initiated after symptoms present most months for 3 months or longer. Setting: Any clinical care setting. PICOTS = population, intervention, comparator, outcome, timing, and setting aExcluding surgical interventions and procedures such as endometrial ablation . bIncludes treatment -related adverse events (e.g., drug side effects); does not include consequences related to the failure to adequately treat the symptom . Key Questions Key Question 1A (KQ1A) What is the evidence for the effectivenes s of medical, behavioral, and complementary and alternative medicine interventions (e.g., hormonal treatment, weight loss, or acupuncture) for improving short and long- term outcomes in women with irregular uterine bleeding? Key Question 1B (KQ1B) What is the evidence for the effectiveness of medical, behavioral, and complementary and alternative medicine interventions (e.g., hormonal treatment, weight loss, or acupuncture) for improving short and long- term outcomes in women with abnormal cyclic uterine blee ding? Key Question 2 (KQ2) What are the harms, including adverse events, associated with medical, behavioral, and complementary and alternative medicine interventions (e.g., hormonal treatment, weight loss, or acupuncture) in women with irregular uterine bleeding or abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding? Analytic Framework We developed the analytic framework (Figure 1) drawn from clinical expertise of Key Informants and refined it with input from a T echnical E xpert P anel (TEP). The analytic framework illustrates the population, interventions, outcomes, and adverse effects that guided the literature search, study eligibility, screening, and synthesis. 7 Figure 1. Analytic framework CAM = complementary and alternative medicine Note: Numbers in circles represent Key Questions. Organization of This Report The Methods c hapter describes our processes including our search strategies, inclusion and exclusion criteria, approach to review of abstract and full publications, methods for extraction of data into evidence tables , and compiling evidence. We also describe our approach to grading the quality of the literature and assessing the strength of the evidence. The Results Chapter presents the findings of the literature search and review of the evidence by Key Question (KQ). When there are distinct populations in which the interventions have been studied such as enrollment based on differing criteria, we discuss related data together. Within KQs we present summary information in the order: devices, medications, lifestyle and behavior interventions, and complementary and alternative medicine. Within a category such as medication, we organize the results from greater number of studies to fewer, and presented the results of placebo controlled trials before direct comparisons. The final section discusses the results and enlarges on the methodologic considerations relevant to each KQ. We also outline the current state of the literature and needs for future research on management of AUB. We include a list of abbreviations and acrony ms at the end of the report followed by appendixes to provide further detail on our methods and the studies assessed. The appendices are as follows: Appendix A Literature Search Strategies Appendix B Abstract Review Form (KQ1) Appendix C Abstract Review Fo rm (KQ2) Appendix D Form (KQ2) F Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool Appendix G Cochrane Risk of Bias Criteria Appendix H Thresholds for Quality Assessment Appendix I Risk of Bias and Quality Score fo r Individual Studies Appendix J Evidence Table Appendix K Reasons for Exclusion (KQ1) 8 Appendix L Reasons for Exclusion (KQ2) Appendix M Labeled Indications for Drugs Included in Review Appendix N Harms from Package Inserts for Drugs Included in Review Appendix O Systematic Reviews Appendix P Ongoing Studies 9 Methods The methods for this comparative effectiveness review (CER) follow those suggested in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ) Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews .41 The main sections in this chapter reflect the elements of the protocol established for the CER; certain methods map to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses ( PRISMA ) checklist.42 Topic Refinement and Review Protocol The topic for this report was nominated by a health care professional using the Effective Health Care Web site (http://effectiveh ealthcare.ahrq.gov/ ). Working from the nomination, we drafted the initial Key Questions (KQs) and analytic framework and sought input from Key Informants representing family medicine, generalist and subspecialty obstetrics and gynecology, and midwifery. Ke y Informants uniformly stressed the importance of terminology and of establishing clear and distinct categories of women for whom the review is intended to apply and suggested framing the review from the vantage point of a primary care provider or speciali st who is at the earliest stage of management of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) , which is typically nonsurgical management. KQs were refined to reflect the feedback from Key Informants and address gaps in existing evidence reviews and knowledge base about management of AUB . After review from AHRQ, the KQs and analytic framework were posted online for public comment. We received no comments during the public posting phase. We prepared final KQs and resubmitted them to AHRQ for review. We identified Technic al Experts on the topic to provide assistance during the project. The Technical Expert Panel (TEP) included individuals with expertise in bleeding abnormalities, nomenclature and classification of AUB , and lead authors of ongoing reviews of surgical interv entions. The TEP included five members serving as technical or clinical experts. To ensure robust, scientifically relevant work, we called on the TEP to review and provide comments as our work progressed. TEP members participated in conference calls and di scussions through e -mail to: Refine the analytic framework and KQs; Discuss the preliminary assessment of the literature, including inclusion/exclusion criteria; Provide input on the information and domains included in evidence tables; Literature Search Strategy Search Strategy Databases We searched the following databases: MEDLINE \u00ae (PubMed interface), the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL \u00ae), and E mbase. All search results were limited to English language. Searches were further restricted from 1980 forward in order to ensure literature was relevant to current secular trends in practice as well as available treatment strategies. We carried out hand searches of the reference lists of recent systematic reviews related to managem ent of AUB and the reference lists of included publications. Searches were executed between September 2011 and June 2012. 10 Search Terms Each search strategy used a combination of subject headings (i.e., controlled vocabulary) and keywords appropriate for ea ch database (Appendix A). The search strategies included terms related to AUB , along with drug and therapy terms relevant to the topic and focus of Key Question 1A ( KQ1A ) and Key Question 2 ( KQ2 ), we conducted a second, separate search in MEDLINE (PubMed interface), using controlled vocabulary and keywords focusing on adverse effects and harms associated with those drugs and treatments from our KQ1A and KQ1B included studies. We also employed a combination of subject headings and keywords to narrow retrieval to desired study types; for KQ1A and KQ1B, this included terms related to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) , and for KQ2, terms geared toward also retrieving cohort and postmarketing surveillance studies. Supplementary Infor mation for KQ2 To further assess KQ2, we searched Internet resources to identify current research and regulatory information related to adverse effects and harms specific to those drugs and therapies from KQ1A and KQ1B included publications , with the term harm referring to any negative psychological, physical, or health system consequence associated with the intervention being studied. These searches were executed between January and March 2012. The Scientific Resource Center invited manufacturers of drugs from our included studies to provide Scientific Information Packets. For each included intervention, we conducted searches of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) database of approved drugs (Drugs@FDA) and DailyMed to locate the most recent label inform ation, determine the approval date, ascertain therapeutically equivalent drugs, and find other relevant information related to harms. For those drugs no longer marketed or unavailable in the United States, label information (including indications and usage , and harms) was also retrieved from the regulatory agencies of other countries where the drug is approved (e.g., HealthCanada's Drug Product Database), drug information databases (e.g., Micromedex \u00ae and LexiComp \u00ae), and manufacturer or pharmaceutical compan y Web site s. Additionally, we searched the FDA's safety information and adverse reporting Web site (MedWatch) to verify the most recent changes to label information were included in our harms data. To supplement the harms data extracted from package insert s and relevant studies, we adapted our primary PubMed search strategy to identify systematic reviews and meta analyses examining the therapeutic agents identified in our analysis of the literature for KQ1, limiting to items published since 2005. To ascertain current and ongoing research, we searched clinicaltrials.gov with topic keywords (e.g., \" abnormal uterine bleeding \", \"menorrhagia \", \"heavy menstrual bleeding \"), looked at both recruiting and completed studies, and again focused on those drugs and therapies from KQ1A and KQ1B included publications. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria To be considered for inclusion, studies had to explicitly define and describe the study population, the interventions, and outcomes. For this CER, the population of interest i ncluded women with symptomatic cyclic or irregular uterine bleeding ( Table 2 ). We excluded studies of women with AUB caused by coagulation defects, systemic disease (e.g., thyroid disease), structural abnormalities (e.g., 11 fibroids, polyps), cancer, or medi cation side effects. Studies that included patients with AUB of mixed or ill- defined etiologies were reviewed for evaluable data from patients meeting the description of the population of interest . For KQ1A we included studies of women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) if the patient baseline and outcome data included information on cycle regularity. We excluded studies of women with infertility if the primary treatment goal was conception. Table 2. Definitions of eligible patient populations Patient group Description Irregular uterine bleeding Problem bleeding (frequent or infrequent) of 3 months or greater duration, excluding regular cyclic/menstrual patterns of bleeding, fibroids, polyps, adenomyosis, cancers, medication side effects, coagulation defects, and related systemic disease. Abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding Problem bleeding of 3 months or greater duration, excluding irregular and unpredictable patterns of bleeding, fibroids, polyps, adenomyosis, cancers, medication side effects, coagulation defects, and related systemic disease. To be considered for inclusion, clinical resear ch studies had to evaluate a nonsurgical intervention. For KQ1 and KQ2 we included data from controlled clinical trials (e.g., RCTs ) designed to evaluate an intervention or treatment strategy for individuals from the population of interest. For KQ2, we als o included data from uncontrolled observational studies, namely high - quality, large cohort studies, postmarketing surveillance studies, and registries/databases, with a population of 1,600 or more patients or records to capture information on adverse event s or other harms.43 We determined that a minimum sample size of 1 ,600 was needed in order to reliably detect harms with an estimated prevalence of 1 percent. We did not specify a minimal population size for KQ1 . Several factors, including varying prevalence of cyclic and irregular patterns of bleeding and the large number of interventions under consideration for this review, make it difficult to reliably establish a minimum sample size for evaluating treatment effe ctiveness. To balance resources and focus on literature of most immediate relevance to primary care practice in the United States, we excluded papers that were not published in English. 44 Study Selection We developed individual abstract and full -text screening forms for KQ1 and KQ2 (Appendixes B, C, D and E). We revised the forms following testing by the team. The forms were adapted for use in the Web -based systematic review product, DistillerSR (Evidence Partners, Ottawa, Canada). We conducted screening in two phases: abstract and full -text screening. Publications were promoted to full -text review when one reviewer indicated that the publication met all inclusion criteria or when the title and abstract did not provide adequate information to make a determ ination. Two reviewers independently reviewed each publication at the full -text screening phase. Discordant classifications were resolved in team meetings including senior investigators. Quality (Risk of Bias) Assessment of Individual Studies Two senior te am members independently assessed quality of the included studies; disagreements were resolved through discussion or third party adjudication as needed. We recorded quality assessments in tables, summarizing each study. We used the Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews 41 and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool45 (Appendix F), an existing tool with established validity and 12 reliability , to assess methodological quality of inc luded studies. This tool includes criteria for judging risk of bias for specific elements from five fundamental domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, outcome data, and selective reporting (Appendix G ) in RCTs. From these domains a n overall assessment of risk of bias was calculated based on prespecified thresholds for modified q uality assessment criteria f rom the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) Tool (Appendix H). The overall risk of bias assessment was then expressed as one of three final study quality ratings: studies assessed as having a high risk of bias were categorized as \"poor\" quality studies; studies having a medium risk of bias were categorized as \"fair\" qual ity studies; and studies assessed as low risk of bias were categorized as \"good\" quality studies. We assessed quality for the included studies that a ddressed KQ1 only. For KQ2, we sought evidence from varied sources; it was not possible to systematically assess the quality of the evidence related to harms. A summary of all component items and overall risk of bias/quality score for each included study i s provided in Appendix I . Data Extraction We created uniform evidence tables to extract data and facilitate data synthesis. We collected those data related to population characteristics, type of abnormal bleeding, intervention characteristics, and outcomes including harms. We evaluated the ability to capture data across publications about candidate effect modifiers and confounders of treatment response and uniformly extracted information about candidates including age, body mass index, parity, and smoking status. When available we also collected current and prior contraception, perimenopausal status, fibroid status, and comorbidities including diabetes and PCOS. The final evidence tables are provided in Appendix J. Data Synthesis A meta -analysis was not feasible for this review. Few studies had comparable treatment doses, interval, length of treatment, or duration of followup. Among those that did, the ability to aggregate data was limited by differences in outcomes measures which included measures of blood loss from sanitary product collection, and self -report using scoring systems including standardized pictorial systems. For regularity of bleeding no two measures of outcome were the same. We provide a narrative synthesis of the available data from origina l research studies of acceptable quality for nonsurgical treatment of AUB . 46 We group findings and summary tables by KQ, intervention, and outcomes. Strength of the Body of Evidence The strength of evidence evaluation is stipulated in the Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative Effectiveness Reviews.41,47 The guide emphasizes the following four major domains: risk of bias (low, medium, high); consistency (inconsistency not present, inconsistency present, unknown or not applicable); directness (dire ct, indirect); and precision (precise, imprecise) of the evidence. Risk of bias was derived from the quality assessment of the individual studies that addressed the KQ and specific outcomes under consideration. We used explicit criteria for rating the overall strength of the evidence on each intervention into qualitative categories (e.g., low, moderate, high, and insufficient). We used established concepts of the quantity of evidence (e.g., numbers of studies, aggregate ending -sample sizes), 13 the quality of evidence (i.e., from the quality ratings on individual articles), directness of the outcomes for informing the KQs, and the coherence or consistency of findings across similar and dissimilar studies and in comparison to known or theoretically sound ideas of clinical or behavioral knowledge. For this CER, overall strength of evidence for each intervention was made based upon a qualitative consideration of the assessment for each domain. We assessed the overall strength of evidence rating based on the assessments for the individual domains for cycle regularity (KQ1A) and menstrual blood loss (MBL) reduction KQ1B. Data from studies that were considere d to be fair or good quality were included in the assessments. Poor quality studies were identified but not included in the assessment of strength of evidence. For KQ2, we did not rate of strength of evidence because a fully inclusive assessment of harms could not be completed for each of the 12 interventions that have been widely studied in populations that lack direct applicability to this report. The overall strength of evidence was graded as \"high\" , \"moderate\", \"low\", or \"insufficient\" (Table 3). 47 When no studies were available for an outcome or comparison of interest, or if the available evidence was weak (i.e. from studies with high risk of bias) we graded the evidence as insufficient. Two senior investigators independently graded the body of evidence and final assignment was reviewed with the project team. We achieved alignment through group discussion with careful attention to application of consistent standards across each area item being graded. Table 3. Strength of evidence grades and definitions Grade Definition High We are very confident that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has few or no deficiencies. We believe that the findings are stable. Moderate We are moderately confident that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has some deficiencies. We believe that the findings are likely to be stable, but some doubt remains. Low We have limited confidence that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this outcome. The body of evidence has major or numerous deficiencies (or both). We believe that additional evidence is needed before concluding either that the findin gs are stable or that the estimate of effect is close to the true effect. Insufficient We have no evidence, we are unable to estimate an effect, or we have no confidence in the estimate of effect for this outcome. No evidence is available or the body of evidence has unacceptable deficiencies, precluding judgment . Applicability We assessed applicability of the results gathered from the literature to the population of women with abnormal cyclic and irregular uterine bleeding according to EPC methods guidance.48 Assessments of applicability were done to account for any factors limiting the ability to apply interventions to other populations or other settings, such as inadequate description of the intervention or failure to report followup data. Using the patient, intervention, comparator, outcome, timing, and setting ( PICOTS ) framework, we identified factors that may limit the applicability of individual research studies. We summarized the applicability of the body of evidence and described key element s from the PICOTS framework that characterize the applicability of a body of studies. 14 Peer Review and Public Commentary Experts in reproductive endocrinology and primary care treatment of women were invited to provide external peer review. The draft repor t was posted for 4 weeks to elicit public comment. We addressed all reviewer comments by revising the text as appropriate. Responses to peer and public review comments will be listed in the disposition of comments report. This report will be available on the AHRQ Web site 3 months after the posting of this final CER. 15 Results Introduction This chapter presents the results of the systematic review of the literature on primary care management of abnormal uterine blee ding (AUB). We present findings for Key Question 1 (KQ1) beginning with an overview of the content of the literature as a whole, followed by results and detailed analysis organized first by studies addressing irregular uterine bleeding (KQ1A) and then by s tudies addressing abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding (KQ1B). When there are distinct populations in which the interventions have been studied such as enrollment based on differing criteria, we discuss related data together. Within KQs we present summary info rmation in the order: devices, medications, lifestyle and behavioral interventions, and complementary and alternative medicine. Within a category such as medication, we organize the results from greater number of studies to fewer, and presented the results of placebo controlled trials before direct comparisons. These analyses are followed by review of the studies and supplemental information addressing KQ2, which pertains to harms associated with the interventions identified for KQ1. Studies also are descri bed in summary tables, generally organized to present particular common outcomes, like change in volume of bleeding, in a single summary in the relevant section of text. Details on quality assessment and individual components of the quality scoring for ind ividual studies can be found in Appendix I. Information about the overall strength of evidence supporting the effectiveness of specific interventions (or lack of utility) is summarized by related outcomes in the Discussion. Results of Literature Searches Searches identified 1 ,775 titles and abstracts for screening for KQ1 . From this broad screening, we reviewed the publication abstracts and identified 219 publications as potentially eligible for inclusion. Following a review of the full text, we identified 39 studies described in 41 publications that met the predetermined criteria for inclusion. Publications from 10 studies addressed KQ1A. Thirty -one publications from 29 studies addressed KQ1B. Overall 6 of these studies were rated as good quality, 10 as fair, and 23 as poor with regard to risk of bias in the findings. Details of the scoring of individual publications are included in Appendix I. We conducted a separate search and screening process for KQ2. We identified 2 ,730 titles and abstracts for screenin g. Of these , 788 references were promoted for full -text review. Using predefined criteria, we found 25 publications that were eligible for inclusion. We received 4 of 17 requested industry packets and obtained package inserts for each KQ1 included drug intervention. See Figures 2 ( KQ1) and 3 (KQ2) for a diagram of literature search and screening . The complete list of excluded papers and exclusion reasons i s provided in Appendix K for KQ1 and in Appendix L for KQ2. 16 Figure 2.

Table 4 includes a complete list of the medications from the included studies . Twenty -one studies were head -to-head comparisons and 14 of the included studies established intervention efficacy by comparison to placebo . Four studies compared the intervention to usual or existing care. The majority of studies ( 29 studies reported in 31 publications) included in this review recruited women with complaints of abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding (KQ1B). Ten of the included studies targeted women with irregular uterine bleeding (KQ1A). Fourteen studies (36 percent ) included some measur e of patient reported outcome. Sixteen studies (41 percent ) included some measure of symptom resolution or normalization. The duration of the studies included in this review was generally short. Studies addressing KQ1A had a duration of 6 months or less with most (7 /10) lasting 3 to 4 months. For KQ1B, study duration ranged from 2 cycles to 2 years. The majority of the studies (2 2/29) evalua ting an intervention for abnormal cyclic bleeding lasted 6 months or less. Two studies that compared the effectiveness of LNG -IUS with COC lasted for 1 year. Of the two studies on the use of decision aids, one included a 1 -year followup and the other inclu ded a 2-year followup. We did not identify publications that explicitly focused on reducing heavy menstrual blood loss (MBL) in the context of irregular menses, especially menses with extended intervals between episodes of bleeding. T he publications included for KQ1A are focused exclusively on irregular bleeding patterns, most often oligomenorrhea (fewer cycles than normal across months). Studies that met the criteria for inclusion for KQ1A evaluated progestogens ( 1 study ), 49 exenatide ( 1 study ),53 cabergoline ( 1 study) ,55 diet (1 study ),56 and exercise ( 1 study ),57 and acupuncture ( 2 studies ).57,58 These total to more than 10 since several were direct comparisons . Two studies were good quality,50,55 2 were fair quality,51,58 and 6 were poor quality.49,52-54,56,57 For KQ1B, most of the included studies evaluated LNG ( studies ),59-65 TXA (7 studies) .66,71,77-81 We identified 5 studies59,61,68,82,83 that evaluated the use of COCs for the management of AUB and 1 study of the contraceptive vaginal ring .84 We found 3 studies85-87 that evaluated decision aids for the management of AUB. Included studies evaluated the effect of these interventions on MBL , quality of life, menstrual cycle patterns, and other clinical and functional outcomes. Among the most common outcome metrics was change in MBL expressed as a percent. This was typically reported as a comparison of post -treatment blood loss to baseline. T he alkaline hematin method and the pictorial blood loss assessment chart score were used to measure MBL. The alkaline hematin method, the current gold standard for estimating MBL, require s women to collect their used feminine hygiene products; consequently , it is rarely used outside of a research setting . 88,89 The pictorial blood loss assessment chart score is a practical, s emi quantitative method of estimating MBL , in which women indicate the type of product used and the degree of saturation using a chart for guiding classification.90-92 For KQ2, w e identified 23 publications reporting on harms of the included interventions. We also reviewed and summarized harms reported in the randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) from KQ1 and from the package inserts for al l products and prescription interventions included in KQ1. 19 Table 4.

Symptoms like gushing or soaking type bleeding commonly occur in the context of irregular menses, especially menses with extended intervals between episodes of bleeding. The publications available to be included for this KQ focused on improving the regularity of bleeding and enrolled participants with bleeding categorized by the research teams as \"dysfunctional uterine bleeding\" or irregular bleeding with oligomenorrhea ( i.e., fewer cycles than normal). Studies were included whether or not participants reported menorrhagia (heavy bleeding) as long as the authors reported on the use of the interve ntion to improve cycle regularity. We did 20 not review the literature on infertility or subfertility resulting from absent or infrequent ovulation, even when it included cycle regularity data. Interventions for fertility treatment in this group, like clomiphene, are distinct from those for symptom management used in primary care settings . Likewise research populations of infertile women likely lack comparability to the broader population of women whose primary complaint is irregular cycles and may include wom en with subfertility who are seeking treatment for problem bleeding. Overall 10 studies addressed restoring menstrual regularity in those with irregular uterine bleeding. Three were conducted in the United States, 50,53,56 two in Italy,52,55 two in Turkey,49,54 and one each in China,58 Sweden,57 and the United Kingdom.51 The studies ranged in size from 23 to 201 participants and examine d the efficacy of metformin ( 4 studies),51-54 acupuncture ( 2 studies ),57,58 diet study ),56 cabergoline ( 1 study),55 progest ogen (1 study ),49 and triphasic birth control pills ( 1 study ).50 Two studies were classified as good quality,50,55 two as fair quality ,51,58 and six as poor quality49,52-54,56,57 with respect to risk of bias in the assessment of effectivene ss of the intervention of improving cycle regularity. Details of quality scoring for individual publications are included in Appendix I. Overall these 10 studies, that included women with irregular uterine bleeding, offer incomplete evidence that medications, possibly diet and exercise, and potentially acupuncture may offer some benefit for establishing more predictable menstrual bleeding patterns. They provide no direct evidence about the ability to reduce the heaviness of bleeding or the symptoms and bother associated with intermittent heavy bleeding because quantity of bleeding and patient - reported outcomes other than timing of bleeding were not among the outcomes for these trials. Key Points Metformin improves regularity of menstrual bleeding in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) when evaluated over months. When combined with exenatide, a newer injectable drug typically used for type 2 diabetes, the effect is greater than either metformin or exenatide alone over 6 months of followup in a single study of 60 women. In a very preliminary investigation of cabergoline, a drug typically used for elevated prolactin, three of eight women with PCOS and normal prolactin levels resumed regular cycles while none did in the six -person placebo group. Both oral dydrogesterone and vaginal micronized progesterone gel administered on a cyclic schedule had comparable influence on normalizing timing of menses. Triphasic norgestimate -ethinyl estradiol birth control pills provided excellent or good control of bleeding abnormalities in 68 percent of those taking active pills compared with 26 percent of those receiving placebo. In adolescents both a low -fat, calori e-restricted diet or a carbohydrate -restricted diet along with 30 minutes of anaerobic exercise 3 days a week resulted in more regular menses if the individual lost weight. Acupuncture improved cycle regularity in two trials, one in which both acupuncture and exercise (30 minutes 3 days each week) resulted in improvements by 32 weeks compared with placebo. In this study acupuncture provided more rapid relief by 16 weeks than exercise. Another poorly -described study found more individuals \"cured\" using needl e placement specific for mind tranquilizing and menstruation promotion compared with those for delayed menses. In summary a number of available interventions appropriate for use in primary care settings have preliminary evidence of effectiveness for increasing the regularity of 21 menses. Only metformin consistently demonstrated benefit across studies and each of these studies enrolled women with oligomenorrhea and PCOS . Overall, literature is absent to inform choice of any of these modalities over another. Detailed Synthesis Medical Therapies Seven studies, two conducted in the United States, two in Italy , two in Turkey, and one in the United Kingdom examined medical therapies to improve menstrual interval.49-55 Five included women who met detailed criteria for PCOS51-55 and two included women classified as having dysfunctional uterine bleeding by clinical criteria that are not tightly operationalized but include extended intervals between cycles.49,50 We first present the findings for the RCTs that enrolled women with irregular uterine bleeding and then the data from PCOS trials. Medical Therapies for Irregular Uterine Bleeding Two studies, one comparing a triphasic oral contraceptive with placebo and one comparing vaginal micronized progesterone (8% gel) wit h oral dydrogesterone, evaluated medical therapy in women with irregular uterine bleeding (Table 5). Table 5. Primary outcomes of medical interventions for irregular uterine bleeding Author, Year Country Quality Comparison Groups ( n) Key Cycle Control Outcomes Davis et al., 200050 United States Good G1: Triphasic norgestimate- ethinyl estradiol oral contraceptive (101) G2: population included women with oligomenorrhea, menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, and polymenorrhea. Investigators classified resolution of bleeding abnormalities from diaries as excellent or good in 41.2% and 26.8% of those receiving intervention and 10.5% and 15.8% of those on placebo (p<0.001). Women's self -assessments were similar to the investigators' and indicated better outcomes in those receiving the oral contraceptive (p<0.001). Karakus et al., 200949 Turkey Poor G1: Vaginal micronized progesterone, 90 mg every other night for 10 days (34) G2: Oral dydrogesterone , 10 mg daily for 10 days (35) Both groups achieved comparable regularity of bleeding patterns in the 3 treated cycles observed: 92.6%, 88.9%, and 92.6% in the vaginal group, and 81.5%, 88.9%, and 85.2% in oral group (p>0.5). Satisfaction with intervention was comparable between groups (p=0.5). Triphasic Oral Contraceptives Oral contraceptives over -ride the hypothalamic -pituitary -ovarian axis coordination of ovarian sex steroid production. By providing exogenous estrogen and progest ogen, oral contraceptives are intended to regulate cycle control pharmacologically. A single RCT50 evaluated a triphasic norgestimate -ethinyl estradiol preparation compared with placebo among women classified as having dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Triphasic oral contraceptives have three distinct levels of progest ogen (norgestimate in this study) and estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) over the course of the 21 days of active pills in a typical 28 day oral contraceptive pill pack, compared with monophasic pills which have the same horm one level provided across all 21 days of active pills. The researchers randomized 201 women at a 1:1 ratio to receive either the study drug or placebo for three 28 -day cycles. Data from 192 patients were included in the outcome analyses. 22 The study enrolle d participants with a variety of menstrual concerns including heavy periods, frequent periods, irregular and heavy periods, and rare episodes of bleeding. Investigators did not systematically evaluate for the presence of disorders of hemostasis. The data are provided in aggregate for all participants regardless of their bleeding pattern or primary symptom. The study drug regimen included 0.18 mg norgestimate and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol for days 0.215 mg norgestimate and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol for days 8 to 14, 0.25 mg norgestimate and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol for days 15 to 21, and inactive tablets for days 22 to 28. The primary efficacy outcomes included the investigator and the subject's overall assessment of improvement in AUB symptoms. Both the investigator assessments and subject assessments of symptom improvement indicated significant (p<0.001) improvement in cycle control in the study drug group compared with the placebo group. The investigator assessed some level of subject improveme nt (fair, good, or excellent) in 81.4 percent of triphasic norgestimate ethinyl estradiol -treated with 35.8 of placebo -treated patients; the proportions of subject -rated improvement were similar to investigator ratings. Among s everal quality of life measures assessed, improvement over baseline was only observed in physical functioning in the triphasic norgestimate ethinyl estradiol -treated patients compared with their placebo -treated counterparts. This good quality, multicenter, industry -sponsored trial was conducted in the United States and appears to have been conducted to expand the indication for a particular brand name to include cycle control for women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The trial was published in 2000 and was the only study identified that included women with problem bleeding from irregular and closely spaced or rare menses. Progest ogens Prior to menses without ovulation the sequence of biologic events that includes a rise in progesterone and then a preci pitous drop does not occur. This is because the literal site of ovulation, the corpus luteum, is responsible for production of progesterone. In the absence of conception, the corpus luteum involutes and ceases production. This rise and fall in progesterone has multiple biological effects on the endometrium which include \"organization\" that results in a coordinated withdrawal bleed, the menses, after progesterone levels fall. Administration of a progest ogen is intended therapeutically to mimic natural produc tion of progesterone and then withdrawal. A single RCT sought to compare the efficacy of oral dydrogesterone, 10 mg twice daily for 10 days starting on cycle day 15, compared with vaginal micronized progesterone (8 percent gel) applied every other evening from cycle days 17 to 27. Both groups had improvements in cycle regularity compared with their baseline (p value not provided). 49 Regular bleeding patterns were observed in more than 89 percent of the three treated cycles in the vaginal administration group, and more than 82 percent of the oral group. Improvement in bleeding patterns was comparable for both groups (p>0.5). Satisfaction with the intervention was also comparable across groups. Medical Therapies for PCOS Three medical therapies (metformin, e xenatide, and cabergoline) were evaluated in five trials that enrolled women with PCOS (Table 6). We present the findings from the study of cabergoline followed by findings from four studies that evaluated metformin or exenatide. In summary, each of the st udies of medical therapies reported findings that favor the medical intervention for establishing more predictable cycles in women with PCOS. No medication was effective for all participants though several exceeded 80 percent of those on active therapy 23 achieving improvements in cycle regularity. The number and size of studies is small and overall the quality is fair to poor with one small pilot study of good quality design and implementation but limited by lack of statistical power. Table 6. Primary outcom es of medical interventions for irregular uterine bleeding in women with PCOS Author, Year Country Quality Comparison Groups ( n) Key C ycle Control Outcomes Paoletti et al., 199555 Italy Good G1: Cabergoline, 0.5 mg each week (8) G2: Placebo (6) 3 of 8 women receiving cabergoline resumed regular cycles. 5 of 8 had onset of menses within 32 to 37 days of treatment initiation. Among women receiving placebo 3 had no menses and 3 had menstrual cycles that were widely separated in time. (No statistical compar isons are provided.) Fleming et al., 200251 United Kingdom Fair G1: Metformin, 850 mg twice a day (45) G2: Placebo (47) Mean time to first ovulation was shorter with metformin (23.6 days) than placebo (41.8 days) (p=0.02). Total ovulation events where higher among women receiving metformin over 16 weeks (p=0.59). Pregnancy rate not different among those who desired to conceive (4 of 23 in G1 and 1 of 19 in G2). Oner and Muderriss 201154 Turkey Poor G1: Metformin, 3 times a day (50) G2: N-acetyl -cysteine, 600 mg 3 times a day (50) Menstrual regularity improved significantly (p 0.05) from baseline in G1 (from 17% to 47%) and G2 (from 29% to 53%). There was no significant difference in improvement from baseline between G1 and G2. Elkind -Hirsch et al., 200853 United States 10 mcg twice a day (20) G2: Metformin, 500 mg twice a day (20) G3: Both (20) The combination of exenatide and metformin was superior to either medication alone for improving menstrual frequency. Women taking both had 80% of menses predicted for a normal pattern, compared with 57% (G1) and 49% (G2). Moghetti et al., 200052 mg twice a day (11)a G2: Placebo (12)a Study enrolled women with fewer than 6 menses per year and followed for 26 weeks. \"Menstrual frequency\" improved with metformin compared with placebo (p=0.002). exact group size not specified . Cabergoline Cabergoline is a dopamine agonist used in treatment of pituitary adenomas, which are benign hormone producing growths in the pituitary often producing elevated prolactin levels. Mechanism of effectiveness for restoring cycles in PCOS may include amplifying dopamine neurotransmitter actions in the central nervous system resulting in hypoprolactine mia and lower levels of hormone signals that increase androgen production by the ovary. 55 One good quality RCT55 conducted in Italy evaluated cabergoline for improving menstrual cyclicity. In this preliminary study of 14 women, authors compared time to ons et of menses and regularity of cycle in women treated with cabergoline (0.5 mg per week) with women receiving placebo . No statistical comparisons are reported, only the summary that five of the eight women receiving cabergoline had menses with three of them resuming regular cycles over 4 months. All women taking placebo had either no cycles (n=3) or widely spaced cycles (n=3). Metformin and Exenatide Metformin, the most common choice for initial type 2 diabetes management , reduces liver glucose production and increases uptake and use of glucose in other tissues throughout the body. Because relative insulin resistance is one of the manifestations of PCOS, metformin is believed 24 to disrupt this part of the syndrome by improving insulin response. Exenati de, a newer agent for treatment of type 2 diabetes introduced in 2005, is administered by subcutaneous injection. This drug promotes increased insulin release in response to blood glucose and it dampens glucagon activity. Glucagon is the natural hormone which promotes glucose release from storage in the liver. It is often administered as a second agent to improve glycemic control in those with type 2 diabetes. As metformin, it may improve the relative insulin resistance seen in PCOS. One British 51 and one I talian52 RCT evaluated metformin compared with placebo for improving menstrual cycle regularity among women with PCOS defined by rare or absent menstrual cycles, and hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation. The larger trial in the United Kingdom enrolled 82 wo men and randomly assigned them to an 850 mg dose twice a day. As with typical administration the dose was initiated at a lower level and increased over a week to reduce risk of gastrointestinal distress. Over the course of 16 weeks those on metformin ovula ted sooner, an average of 18.2 days earlier (p=0.02), than those receiving placebo. Those on metformin also had a higher total number of ovulatory events (p=0.059). The Italian study (n=23), used a metformin dose of 500 mg 3 times a day (also after a ramp up) and reported \"menstrual frequency\" improved (p=0.002), without additional definitions of the outcome. A poor quality trial (n=100) 54 in Turkey compared metformin (500 mg 3 times a day) to N - acetyl -cysteine (600 mg 3 times a day) for improving menstrual regularity in women with PCOS. Menstrual regularity improved significantly (p 0.05) from baseline in both groups with no significant di fference in improvement between groups. A third trial in the United States compared three arms with 20 participants in each : metformin (500 mg twice each day), exenatide (10 mcg twice a day) , and both.53 Participants were followed for 6 months. The primary outcome for this trial was the proportion of menses achieved over time compared with what would be a predicted normal pattern. For instance a woman predicted to have six menses over 6.5 months would have a menstrual index of 50 percent if she in fact had only three menses over that time. Women taking metformin had 57 percent of expected menstrual bleeds and those on placebo had 49 percent. Those taking both metformin and exenatide had 80 percent of the predicted normal number of menses which was a signific ant advantage in effectiveness. Behavioral Interventions A single , poor quality study in teens with PCOS in the United States (n=24), attempted to examine the influence of diet and exercise on restoration of normal menses (Table 7) .56 Table 7. Primary out comes of behavioral interventions for irregular uterine bleeding in women with PCOS Author, Year Country Quality Comparison Groups ( n) Key Cycle C ontrol Outcomes Ornstein et al., 201156 United States Poor G1: Hypocaloric low -fat diet (12) G2: Carbohydrate restriction without caloric or fat targets (12) Both groups were asked to complete 30 minutes of aerobic exercise 3 times per week. Both lost similar amounts of weight over 12 weeks. Menstrual patterns are not reported by group. Amount of weight loss corr elated with menstrual regularity. Diet and Exercise The rationale for examining the effects of diet and exercise is based on similar effects to the diabetes medications studied. Exercise improves glucose utilization and insulin sensitivity. 25 Likewise diet, with even modest weight loss, can improve insulin response. The study advised girls in both intervention groups to spend 30 minutes in aerobic activity 3 times each week. One arm was instructed in how to keep a hypocaloric diet, consisting of less than 40 grams per day of fat. The other group was instructed in how to follow a low -carbohydrate (i.e., no more than 20 grams per day) diet without specific calorie targets or fat restriction. Among the 16 who completed the study, both groups lost comparable amounts of weight over 12 weeks, an average of 6.5 percent of bodyweight. The authors did not report menstrual patterns by diet treatment group; they report only that degree of weight loss correlated with menstrual regularity (r= 0.2, p=0.001). 56 Complementar y and Alternative Medicine Two trials, one of fair quality58 and another of poor quality ,57 report on use of acupuncture for menstrual regularity among women with oligomenorrhea from PCOS and dysfunctional uterine bleeding, respectively (Table 8) . Table 8. Primary outcomes of acupuncture for irregular uterine bleeding Author, Year Country Population Quality Comparison Groups ( n) Key Cycle C ontrol Outcomes Cai and Wu, 200958 China Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Fair G1: Acupuncture at points for mind tranquilizing and menstruation promotion (23) G2: Routine acupuncture points for delayed menses (17) Based on self -reported scores, 67% of G1 were classified as cured compared with 19% of G2 over 3 cycles. 25% of G1 classified as markedly relieved compared with 19% of G2. There were no failures in G1 and in electroacupuncture (33) G2: Brisk exercise at least 30 minutes 3 days per week (34) G3: No active intervention (17) Electroacupuncture achieved greater improvement in regularity (+146% from baseline) compared with G2 (58% improvement) and G3 (17% worsening). All comparisons p<0.05 at 16 weeks. By 32 weeks, electroacupuncture (+121% increase in cycle regularity) and exer cise (+42%) were comparable and both superior to no intervention ( 17%). PCOS = polycystic ovarian syndrome Acupuncture The smaller study (n=40)58 inadequately describes inclusion criteria specifying only that women were clinically diagnosed with dysfunctional uterine bleeding , and likewise operationalizes outcomes loosely by classifying participants as \"cured\" or not without providing a definition of what characteristics of the menstrual pattern or bleeding constituted a cure. The intervention of interest to the investigators was acupuncture for mind tranquilizing and menstruation promotion compared with a more conventional selection of needle sites used for delayed menses. Over three cycles more women were classified as cured using the mind - tranq uilizing and menstruation promoting method (67% vs.19%); more women classified symptoms as markedly relieved, and there were no failures in the intervention compared with the usual approach arm (19% ,, p<0.05). The larger, poor quality study done in Sweden (n=84)57 randomized participants to low - frequency electroacupuncture for a total of 14 treatments, brisk exercise 30 minutes 3 times each week, or no active intervention. At 16 weeks electroacupuncture achieved greater improvement in menstrual regularity , defined as a ratio of the number of observed versus expected cycles. 26 Women began the study with a ratio of 0.28 menses per expected cycle and improved in the electroacupuncture group to 0.69 menses per expected cycle a 146- percent increase in cycle regula rity when compared with either exercise (58% improvement) or no active intervention (17% worsening) at 16 weeks. By 32 weeks, electroacupuncture (121% increase in cycle regularity) and exercise (42% increase in cycle regularity ) were comparable and both superior to no intervention ( 17% decrease in cycle regularity ). KQ1B. Management of Abnormal Cyclic Bleeding Description of Included Studies We identified 31 publications representing 29 studies addressing primary care interventions for the management of abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding. Most of the studies that qualified for inclusion evaluated the LNG -IUS ( 7 studies We identified five studies59,61,68,82,83 that evaluated use of COCs for the management of AUB and one study of the contraceptive vaginal ring.84 We found three studies85- 87 that evaluated decision aids for the management of AUB . The total number of interventions addressed is greater than the number of studies because of direct comparisons between one or more interventions within single studies . Included studies described interventions appropriate for primary care and compared these interventions to another intervention (1 6 studies ), placebo ( 9 studies ), or usual care ( 4 studies ). The results ar e summarized below and details for each study are presented in the Evidence Table (Appendix J). Levonorgestrel- Releasing Intrauterine System (Mirena\u00ae) Key Points LNG -IUS is associated with a clinically significant reduction in MBL ranging from 70 to 87 percent in studies lasting up to 1 year. However, there are no controlled longer -term followup studies. In comparison to progestogens, combined hormonal pills, and NSAIDs, LNG -IUS provided greater reduction in MBL. No head -to-head comparison s of LNG -IUS versus TXA were assessed. An indirect comparison of the percentage reduction and volume reduction in MBL suggests that LNG -IUS has a greater effect than TXA. Detailed Synthesis The LNG -IUS is an intrauterine, long- term, progestogen- only method of contraception licensed for 5 years of use. The system must be inserted and removed by a qualified practitioner, including primary care providers. The LNG -IUS has a T -shaped plastic frame with a rate - limiting membrane on the vertical stem that releases a daily dose of 20 micrograms of levonorgestrel into the endometrial space. The effects of the LNG -IUS are local and hormonal, including prevention of endometrial proliferation. The LNG -IUS is also licensed for the management of idiopathic menorrhagia or heavy menstrual bleeding. Seven RCTs of LNG -IUS were included (Table 9) . 59-65 The number of study participants ranged from 39 to 165. The total number of women assigned to LNG -IUS was 275 ; study endpoint outcome measures were reported for 255. 27 Criteria for participation varied among the studies. Three trials assessed MBL using the alkaline hematin method for study entry and required that women have a mean MBL of 80 ml or more for at least one63,64 or two 60 cycles prior to randomization. One study required that study participants report a pictorial blood loss assessment chart score greater than 100 for two consecutive cycles . For one trial, the inclusion criterion was self -defined as \"heavy men strual bleeding\" , although mean MBL and pictorial blood loss assessment scores were reported at baseline .59 For one trial the inclusion criterion was intention to undergo hysterectomy for AUB not due to a fibroid greater than 3 cm.65 In one trial, the authors did not adequately describe the inclusion criteria, although organic causes were excluded.62 Baseline median and mean MBL values differed among the studies . The target intervention was the same for all seven trials: LNG -IUS (52 mg levonorgestrel, initial release rate 20 mcg per 24 hours) . The comparator differed among the 7 trials. Two trials compared LNG -IUS to a COC, including continuous daily ethinyl mcg)/levonorgestrel (150 mcg mcg Three trials compared LNG -IUS with a progestogen : single intramuscular injection o f depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) on the first day of the cycle,62 oral tablet of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA ; 5 mg ) daily starting on the first day of the cycle,62 oral MPA (10 mg ) daily for 10 days each cycle starting on cycle day 16,60 and norethisterone (5 mg ) 3 times daily from cycle day 5 to 26 for three cycles.64 One trial compared LNG -IUS with oral mefenamic acid (500 mg ) 3 times daily for first 4 days of each cycle.63 One trial assigned the patients in the control group to continue their preexisting medical treatment for excessive uterine bleeding or symptoms of dysmenorrhea, or both. 65 The primary outcome of six of the LNG -IUS studies was change in blood loss. The alkaline hematin method was used to measure MBL in f our trials.59,60,63,64 One of these f our reported both mean and median MBL.60 Two studies only reported median MBL63,64 and one study only reported mean MBL .59 Two trials used the pictorial blood loss assessment score for the primary outcome measure.61,62 Two trials u sed the pictorial blood loss assessment chart as a secondary outcome measure.59,63 One study reported the proportion of women who cancelled their prior decision to undergo hysterectomy as the primary outcome measure.65 The timing of the summative outcome measure reporting varied among the trials. One trial reported after one menstrual cycle.64 Three trials rep orted after three menstrual cycles.60,63,64 Four trials reported after six menstrual cycles.60,62,63,65 Two trials reported after 12 months.59,61 The setting varied: one trial was conducted in three countries (Brazil, Canada, and the United States );60 two trials were conducted in the United Kingdom ;63,64 the remainder of studies were conducted in Egypt,59 Canada,61 Turkey,62 and Finland.65 Two studies were assessed as fair quality ,60,64 and f ive were of poor quality related to inadequate allocation concealm ent, lack of blinding of participants and assessors, and selective outcome reporting.59,61-63,65 Details of quality scoring for individual publications are included in Appendix I. 28 Table 9.

Four trials59,60,63,64 used the alkaline hematin method to measure MBL and four trials used the pictorial blood loss assessment chart to estimate blood loss .59,61-63 Two studies also reported treatment success as an outcome, defined as MBL less than 80 ml60 or pictorial blood assessment score less than 100.61 One trial reported the proportion of women who cancelled their prior decision to undergo hysterectomy as the primary outcome measure.65 Other outcome measures reported in the studies of LNG -IUS included total bleeding and spotting days, hemoglobin, ferritin, treatment failure, and menorrhagia severity score. Menstrual Blood Loss Reduction Expressed as a Percent Three studies reported the percent reduction in MBL from baseline (Table 10). A fair quality multicenter trial with 1 65 participants compared LNG -IUS with oral MPA administered during the luteal phase of the cycle and reported a mean reduction in MBL of 71 percent (SD \u00b1 88%) in the LNG -IUS group compared with 22 percent (SD \u00b1 3 6%) in the MPA group at the 6- month interval (p<0.001).60 In a small fair quality RCT conducted in the United Kingdom,64 the change in MBL was comparable between groups after 3 months of treatment with a 94- percent reduction in MBL for LNG -IUS users and an 87 -percent reducti on in MBL among women taking norethisterone. A trial conducted in Egypt with 112 participants compared LNG -IUS with continuous combined ethinyl levonorgestrel ( ; continuous COC) reported a n 87- percent (SD \u00b1 1 2%) reduction in mean MBL in the LNG -IUS group compared with a 35-percent (SD \u00b1 77%) reduction in the COC group at the 12- month interval (p=0.013).59 30 Table 10.

Reduction Expressed as a Volume Four studies reported the absolute reduction in MBL from baseline (Table 11). The multicenter trial with 1 65 participants reported a statistically significant (p<0.001) reduction in median MBL after six menstrual cycles wi th LNG -IUS (128.8 ml) compared with those receiving MPA (17.8 ml).60 The United Kingdom trial with 44 participants and 3 months duration reported similar reductions (p=NS) in median MBL for the LNG -IUS group (104 ml) and the norethisterone group (94 ml).64 The trial conducted in Egypt with 112 participants that compared LNG -IUS with continuous COC reported a statistically significant ( p<0.001 ) reduction in mean MBL after with LNG -IUS ( ) compared with those receiving COC (156.1 ml).59 A trial conducted in the United Kingdom with 51 participants that compared continuous LNG -IUS with mefenamic acid for the first 4 days of each cycle reported a statistically significant (p<0.001) difference in reduction in median MBL after s ix menstrual cycles with LNG -IUS (117 ml ) compared with those receiving mefenamic acid (21 ml ).63 The same study reported a statistically significant reduction in median pictorial blood loss assessment chart score: a 215 point reduction after six cycles w ith LNG -IUS compared with a 74 -point reduction with mefenamic acid (p<0.001).63 Table 11.

Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart Score Four studies reported change in pictorial blood loss assessment chart score from baseline. A poor quality Canadian trial with 39 participants compared LNG -IUS with 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 1 acetate (cyclic COC) and reported a n 83-percent reduction in the mean pictorial blood loss assessment chart score in the LNG -IUS group (median scores 31 declined from 228 to 12) compared with a 68 -percent reduction in the c yclic CO C group (median scores declined from 290 to 72) at 12 months .61 Another poor quality Turkish study of 132 women compared LNG -IUS use with either a single intramuscular injection of DMPA or with daily oral MPA. After 6 menstrual cycles, the LNG -IUS users ha d a mean score reduction of 210 compared with a reduction of 138 in the DMPA group (p<0.01) , and a 76- point reduction in the MPA group (p<0.01). No significant difference was reported in the reductions in the pictorial blood loss assessment chart score between DMPA and MPA. 62 The pictorial blood loss assessment was use d in two trials that also measured MBL using the alkaline hematin method. One study reported a reduction in the mean pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of 90 percent ( SD \u00b1 1 2%) in the LNG -IUS group at the 6-month interval compared with a reduction of 42 percent ( SD \u00b1 5 4%) in the COC group.59 At 12 months, the mean s cores declined by 275 (87%) for LNG -IUS users compared with only 51 (3% ) for the women taking COCs.59 In another study, the change in median pictorial blood assessment scores from baseline w as significantly greater (p<0.001) in the LNG -IUS group from 240 (range, 91 to 545) to 25 (range, 0 to 401) compared with the mefenamic acid group from 233 (range, 77 to 469) to 159 (ra nge, 50 to 307) after six cycles of treatment. 63 Treatment Success Three studies reported the percent of women with successful treatment; however the definition of success differed among the trials. The fair quality multicenter trial with 1 65 participants that compared LNG -IUS with oral MPA reported a 85 percent (67/79) success rate in the LNG -IUS group at the 6-month interval, compared with a 22 percent (18/81) success rate in the MPA group (p<0.001).60 Treatment success was defined as MBL less than 80 ml at the end of study and 50 percent or greater reduction in MBL from baseline.60 The poor quality Canadian trial with 39 participants that compared LNG -IUS with cyclic COC reported a treatment success of 80 percent (16/20) in the LNG -IUS group at the 12- month interval compared with 37 percent (7/19) in the cyclic COC group (p<0.009).61 Treatment success was defined as a pictorial blood loss assessment chart score less than 100 at 12 months.61 The poor quality Turkish study that compared LNG -IUS with DMPA injection or oral MPA use reported treatment success rates of 86 percent, 75 percent, and 68 percent, respectively.62 The criterion for determining treatment response was a pictorial assessment bleeding score less than 185 and stabilization or increase in hemoglobin levels. 62 Total Bleeding Days and Total Spotting Days The trial conducted in Egypt with 112 participants that compared LNG -IUS with continuous COC did not report baseline days of bleeding or spotting. The study did report that the endpoint numbe r of bleeding days, adjusted for 1- year duration was 34.5 \u00b1 12.0 for the LNG -IUS group 15.3 for the continuous COC group (p<0.001). The study also reported that the endpoint number of spotting days, adjusted for 1- year duration , was not differen t between the two groups. 59 The trial conducted in Turkey with 132 participants that compared LNG -IUS with either a single intramuscular injection of DMPA or with daily oral MPA reported a statistically significant decrease in mean bleeding days after six menstrual cycles with all three interventions. No significant difference was reported in the decrease in bleeding days between LNG -IUS and DMPA and MPA. 62 32 Hemoglobin The trial conducted in Turkey with 132 participants that compared LNG -IUS with either a single intramuscular injection of DMPA or with daily oral MPA reported a statistically significant increase in hemoglobin after six menstrual cycles with all three interventions. The mean hemoglobin score was increased by 0.8 g/dl in the LNG -IUS group compar ed with 0.5 g/dl with DMPA (p<0.05) and compared with 0.6 g/dL with MPA (p<0.05). No significant difference was reported in the increase in hemoglobin between DMPA and MPA.62 The trial conducted in Egypt with 112 participants that compared LNG -IUS with con tinuous COC reported a statistically significant p<0.001 ) increase in hemoglobin for the LNG -IUS group (1.2 g/dl) compared with the continuous COC group ( 0.4 g/dl).59 The United Kingdom trial with 44 participants reported no significant differences in he moglobin changes over 3 months .64 The Canadian trial with 39 participants that compared LNG -IUS with cyclic COC reported no significant differences in hemoglobin changes.61 Ferritin The trial conducted in Egypt with 112 participants that compared LNG -IUS w ith continuous COC reported a statistically significant p<0.001 ) for the compared with the continuous COC group ( 34.3 mcg/dl).59 The United Kingdom trial with 44 participants and 3 months duration reported no significant differences in ferritin changes.64 Treatment Failure The trial conducted in Egypt with 112 participants that compared LNG -IUS with continuous COC defined treatment failure as initiation of an alternative medical treatment or need for surger y or expulsion of the LNG -IUS. The trial reported a statistically significant ( p=0.007) lower failure rate for the LNG -IUS group compared with the continuous COC group (hazard ratio= 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.73). 59 Proportion of Women Who Cancelled Hysterectomy An open randomized multicenter study conducted in Finland with 56 women aged 33 to 49 scheduled to undergo hysterectomy for treatment of excessive uterine bleeding reported that 64 percent (95% CI, 44 to 81%) of women in the LNG -IUS group comp ared with 14 percent ( 95% CI, 4 to 33%) of women in the control group (continued current medical treatment) had cancelled their decision to undergo hysterectomy after 6 months (p<0.001). 65 Head -to-Head Comparisons LNG -IUS Versus COC Both the trial that com pared LNG -IUS to continuous COC ( estradiol and 150 levonorgestrel )59 LNG -IUS to cyclic COC mcg for days 1 to 21)61 found that LNG -IUS was superior to COC for blood loss reduction expressed as a percent (83 to 90% reduction in mean pictorial blood loss assessment chart score for LNG -IUS compared with 42 to 68% for COC ). One trial reported superiority of LNG -IUS for blood loss expressed as volume, tot al bleeding days, treatment failure, hemoglobin, and ferritin level.59 One of the trials reported superiority of LNG -IUS for achieving blood loss below the definition of heavy menstrual bleeding.61 33 LNG -IUS Versus Progestogen s The only outcome measure used by all three trials that compared progestogens to LNG -IUS was MBL reduction by volume.60,62,64 reported -IUS significantly reduc ed MBL compared with progestogens , including oral MPA ( 10 mg daily for 10 days starting on cycle day 1660 or 5 mg daily starting on cycle day 162) and DMPA (single injection of on cycle day 1) .62 A third trial reported no significant difference between LNG -IUS and norethisterone (5 mg 3 times daily from cycle day 5 to cycle day 26 for three cycles ) for reducing MBL .64 The trials used different progestogen formulations and different measures of blood loss.60,62,64 One of the trials comparing LNG -IUS to oral MPA reported significantly greater treatment success, reduction in blood loss as a percentage, and women achieving blood loss less than the definition of heavy menstrual bleeding in the LNG -IUS group .60 LNG -IUS Versus Mefenam ic Acid A single trial reported significantly greater reduction in MBL for LNG -IUS (117 ml) compared with mefenamic acid (500 mg 3 times daily for first 4 days of cycle ; 21 ml ).63 Prevention of Hysterectomy A single poor quality trial reported significantly more (p<0.001) women cancelled their decision to undergo hysterectomy in the LNG -IUS group ( 64%; 95% CI, 44 to 81%) compared with women who continued current medical treatment (14%; 95% CI, 4 to 33%).65 Contraceptive Vaginal Ring Key Points A single RCT reported that the contraceptive vaginal ring was as effective as norethisterone for improving bleeding. More women who were randomi zed to the vaginal ring were satisfied with treatment compared with women randomized to norethisterone. More women in the vaginal ring group elected to continue treatment than in the oral medication group. Detailed Synthesis We identified a single RCT of fair quality that compared the efficacy of the contraceptive vaginal ring to norethisterone in 95 women with abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding (Table 12). The study was conducted in Egypt among women with a pictorial blood loss assessment chart score over 185. The primary outcome measure was MBL after three cycles of treatment assessed using the pictorial blood loss assessment chart score. Other outcome measures included duration of menses, hemoglobin, ferritin, and quality of life. The treatments were equal ly effective, reducing the patient -reported bleeding score by 67 percent in the contraceptive vaginal ring group and by 70 percent in the norethisterone group. 84 34 Table 12. Primary outcomes of contraceptive vaginal ring for abnormal cyclic uterine bl eeding Author, Year Country Quality Comparison Groups ( n) Key Outcomes Abu Hashim et al., 201284 Egypt Fair G1: Contraceptive vaginal ring, 15 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 120 mcg etonogestr el inserted between day 1 and 5 of cycle and used for 3 weeks/cycle (48) G2: Norethisterone acetate tablets,5 mg 3 times daily on days 5 to 26 (47) Mean PBLAC score declined significantly (p<0.001) from baseline after 3 cycles for G1 (from 288 to 90) and G2 (from 302 to 92). Mean hemoglobin levels increased fr om baseline for both G1 (p=0.02) and G2 (p=0.03). Duration of menses was significantly shorter (p<0.001) for both G1 and G2. More women in G1 (71%) than in G2 (42.5%) were satisfied with treatment. More women in G1 (77%) than in G2 (25.5%) elected to conti nue treatment. PBLAC = pictorial blood loss assessment chart; MBL = menstrual blood loss Nonsteroidal Anti -Inflammatory Drugs Key Points The most commonly studied NSAID was mefenamic acid; other NSAIDs included naproxen, meclofenamate, and flurbiprofen. Overall, NSAIDs demonstrated significant reductions in MBL (20 to 49 percent ) compared with baseline and were significantly more effective than placebo, but many women still have objective menorrhagia after treatment. Variability in treatment response with NSAIDs is considerable, including some individuals with increases in MBL with treatment. Comparing individual NSAIDs, there were no significant differences found in reductions of MBL between mefenamic acid and naproxen. In one RCT, LNG -IUS was significantly more effective at reducing MBL compared with mefenamic acid. In two trials, TXA had significantly greater reductions in MBL compared with either flurbiprofen or mefenamic acid. There were no significant differences bet ween NSAIDs and either norethisterone, low - dose COC, ethamsylate, or an older progesterone -impregnated intrauterine coil in 5 trials. Studies were mostly of short duration with most lasting from 2 to 3 cycles. No studies examined quality of life, sexual function, fertility, or time to conception as an outcome. Quality of life needs further attention since most women will be offered treatment based on complaints/perception rather than objective measurement. NSAIDs are also effective against menstrual -related abdominal pain and cramping. Detailed Synthesis We identified 13 unique studies from 14 publications that examined the use of NSAIDs for abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding (Table 13) . Seven were parallel group RCT s63,66,67,69,70,74,77 and six were randomized, crossover trials.68,71-73,75,76 the United States.72 The number of participants in each trial ranged from 19 to 110 with crossover trials ranging from 14 to 69. One study was assessed as good quality,72 35 three were assessed as fair quality ,67,75,76 and nine were assessed as poor quality.63,66,68-71,73,74,77 Details of qual ity scoring for individual publications are included in Appendix I . Studies used different inclusion criteria for defining menorrhagia. Six trials used the objective alkaline hematin method with MBL more than 80 ml as criteria for inclusion.63,66,67,70,71,75 Two trials used the alkaline hematin method with MBL more than 50 to 60 ml,72,74 one study used a combination of subjective and objective assessments of MBL more than 80 ml,73 and four trials used either subjective criteria or did not define heavy menstrual bleeding for inclusion into the trial.68,69,76,77 Some studies required women to have regular cycles.63,67,68,72,73,77 Most studies excluded populations who had underlying disease or intrauterine device ( IUD) use. One study76 included patients wi th IUD (n=6), fibroids (n=2), Von Willebrand disease (n=1) and reported changes in MBL separately for women with ovulatory menorrhagia from those with underlying disease. Another study also included patients with IUDs (n=7) in the eligible patient populati on. 72 Patients ranged in age from 14 to 51 years of age. The target intervention differed among the 13 studies. For each NSAID, dose and duration did not vary greatly. The most commonly studied NSAID , mefenamic acid , was used in 11 trials.63,66-70,73-77 The usual dose of mefenamic acid was 500 mg 3 times a day starting at the onset of menses for duration of 5 days or until cessation of menses. One study initiated mefenamic acid 5 days prior to onset of menses through cessation. 67 Another trial used a slight ly different regimen with 500 mg at onset of menses followed by 250 mg every 6 hours for 3 to 5 days.73 One study included mefenamic acid at 250 mg 3 times a day from onset menses for 5 days in conjunction with TXA 500 mg 3 times a day for the same 5- day p eriod.77 One trial studied meclofenamate at a dose of 100 mg 3 times a day from onset of menses for duration of 6 days or until cessation of menses.72 Naproxen was studied in two trials with initial loading doses of 500 to 550 mg then 250 to 275 mg every 6 hours for 5 days or until 24 hours after cessation of heavy bleeding.68,75 Flurbiprofen was studied in one trial at a dose of 100 mg twice a day from onset of menses for duration of 5 days.71 The comparator differed among the 13 studies. M efenamic acid was compared with placebo in four studies , two RCTs67,69 and two crossover trials .73,76 One crossover trial compared meclofenamate to placebo.72 Two crossover trials compared mefenamic acid to naproxen68,75 for two cycles. One of these crossover trials al so used low -dose COC with 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel given daily for 21 days for two cycles.68 Two RCTs used norethisterone 5 mg twice daily from day 19 to 26 of the cycle70 or days 15 to 25 of the cycle74 for two cycles. Two RCTs used progesterone -releasing intrauterine systems, including the LNG - IUS that releases 20 mcg of levonorgestrel per day for six cycles63 and an older progesterone - impregnated intrauterine coil that releases 65 mcg of progesterone daily for two cycles.74 One RCT compared mefenamic acid (500 mg every 8 hours) with TXA (1 gram every 6 hours) and ethamsylate ( 500 mg every 6 hours) for the first 5 days of menses for three cycles.66 One crossover trial compared flurbiprofen (100 mg twice a day for 5 days) with 1.5 grams of TXA ( 3 times a day for the first 3 days of menses and 1 gram on days 4 to 5) for two cycles.71 One RCT compared a combination of mefenamic acid (250 mg per day) and TXA ( 500 mg 3 times a day ) to TXA alone from day 1 to 5 of menses f or three cycles.77 Duration of treatment ranged from one67 to six63 menstrual cycles, with the majority consisting of two68,70-76 to three66,69,77 cycles. The primary outcome for m ost studies (11/13) was MBL measured with the alkaline hematin method.63,66-68,70-76 Seven studies reported mean MBL66-68,71-73,76 and four studies reported median MBL.63,70,74,75 One small, placebo -controlled crossover trial73 measured MBL but only 36 reported the proportion of women who experienced reductions in MBL during the treatment cycles . One trial used the pictorial blood loss assessment chart score77 as the primary outcome measure for blood loss and a second trial of NSAIDS used the pictorial blood loss assessment chart as a secondary outcome measure.63 One trial reported the perc entage of patients relieved of menorrhagia,69 however the method of measurement was not provided. Other outcomes studied included duration of bleeding,66,69,70,72,75,76 number of pads/tampons used,66,69,72,75 and total menstrual fluid loss.63 One trial examined patient satisfaction.66 No studies examined quality of life, sexual function, fertility, or time to conception as an outcome.

Description of Results Outcome Measure s All studies of NSAIDs examined bleeding outcomes. Eleven studies used the alkaline hematin method for an objective measure of MBL . Two trials used the pictorial blood loss assessment chart to assess blood loss .63,77 One study69 reported relief of menorrh agia for which methods were not provided. Although we aimed to collect data on measures of quality of life, sexual function, fertility and time to conception, none of the 13 clinical trials reported on these outcomes. One study reported patient satisfacti on based on participants' wish to continue treatment at the end of the study.66 MBL Reduction Expressed as a Percent Four trials of fair to good quality reported statistically significant reductions in MBL compared with baseline, ranging from 40 to 49 percent among those who received one to two treatment cycles of NSAIDs , including mefenamic acid , naproxen, or meclofenamate (Table 14).67,72,75,76 A good quality cross over trial conducted in the United States ,72 randomized 32 women with MBL more than 60 m l to meclofenamate or placebo for 2 treatment cycles. Seven (21%) participants were using an IUD. Significantly (p<0.0001) greater reductions in MBL were reported among those receiving meclofenamate (48.9 \u00b1 3.7% ) compared with those receiving placebo (9.2 \u00b1 5.3% ). During treatment, the change in MBL associated with meclofenamate ranged from 42 \u00b1 3 percent in cycle 1 to 56 \u00b1 8 percent in cycle 3. A small, fair quality, RCT conducted in the Netherlands , 67 randomized women scheduled for a hysterectomy due t o subjective menorrhagia to either mefenamic acid 500 mg ( n=6) or placebo 39 (n=5) 3 times daily starting 5 days before expected menses to cessation of bleeding for 1 treatment cycle. Eligible participants had regular cycles, no IUD, and MBL more than 80 ml. Those receiving mefenamic acid had greater reductions (40% , p=0.01) in mean MBL from baseline compared with placebo where a nonsignificant increase (25%) in MBL was reported, A randomized, double -blind cross over fair quality trial conducted in the U nited Kingdom75 compared naproxen (550 mg at onset of menses then 275 mg every 6 to 8 hours for 5 days) to mefenamic acid among 38 women with MBL more than 80 ml for 2 treatment cycles. Patients with pelvic inflammation, fibroids , or other local disease were excl uded. There were no significant differences in mean MBL reduction between th e two groups receiving mefenamic acid ( 46% and 47%) and the two naproxen ( 44% and 48%). Reductions in MBL compared with baseline were statistically significant (p<0.001) in both the groups receiving mefenamic acid and naproxen . One crossover RCT of fair quality conducted in Australia and published in two papers76,93 randomized 85 women with menorrhagia to mefenamic acid or placebo for two cycles. Overall there was a 28- percent reduction in mean MBL among those who rec eived mefenamic acid compared with those who received placebo (p<0.001). There was a 30-percent reduction (p<0.001) in blood loss among those with MBL more than 80 ml at baseline ( n=30) but a 28- percent increase in blood loss among those with MBL more than 35 ml at baseline ( n=14). Six poor quality trials also reported significantly reduced MBL compared with baseline levels (Table 14). One poor quality RCT conducted in the United Kingdom 63 compared 51 participants randomized to either mefenamic acid or to LNG reduced MBL compared with baseline; however, the study reported a greater reduction in median MBL among those treated with LNG -IUS (95%) compared with those receiving mefenamic acid (23%) after six cycles of treatment . One RCT66 conducted in Ireland randomized women (n=27), acid (n=25), or ethamsylate (n=29) for three cycles . The study reported a 54-percent reduction in mean MBL from baseline for those receiving TXA (p<0.001), a 20-percent reduction for those receiving mefenamic acid (p<0.001), and no reduction for those receiving ethamsylate. A small crossover trial71 conducted in Sweden compar ed TXA to flurbiprofen for two treatment cycles. A greater reduction in mean MBL from baseline was reported among those receiving TXA (53%) compared with those receiving flurbiprofen (24%). One RCT conducted in the United Kingdom 70 examined the efficacy of mefenamic acid compared with norethisterone among 32 participants with MBL more than 80 ml for 2 cycles. Median percent change in blood loss volume was not significantly different between mefenamic acid ( 24%; range , 2 to 53%). Median MBL with treatment was 81 ml (range, 22 to 193 ml) for those receiving mefenamic acid and 92 ml (range, 43 to 189 ml) for those receiving norethisterone. One patient treated with mefenamic acid had an increase in blood loss. One crossover trial 68 conducted in Australia examined the efficacy of mefenamic acid compared with low-dose COC (30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel given daily for 21 days) in one group and mefenamic acid compared with naproxen in another group, each for two c ycles among women with a clinical history of menorrhagia. There w as no significant difference in reduction of mean MBL between those receiving mefenamic acid (38%) and those receiving low -dose COC (43%) or between those receiving mefenamic acid (20%) and those receiving naproxen (12%). 40 Table 14.

Reduction Expressed as a Volume In four trials of fair to good quality,67,72,75,76 treatment with me clofenamate, mefenamic acid or naproxen reduced MBL compared with baseline (Table 15). Mean or median MBL after treatment ranged from 65 to 77 ml. Mefenamic acid and naproxen were comparable in effectiveness .75 A good quality crossover trial conducted in the United States randomized 32 women to meclofenamate or placebo for 2 cycles . There was a significantly greater reduction in mean MBL from baseline with meclofenamate (72.6 ml ) compared with placebo ( 6.0 ml ).72 A small fair quality RCT conducted in t he Netherlands randomized women scheduled for a hysterectomy due to subjective menorrhagia to mefenamic acid (n=6) or placebo (n=5) . There was a significant reduction in mean MBL from baseline in the treatment group (43 ml, p=0.01) compared with a 38 -ml in crease in MBL in the placebo group.67 A fair quality crossover trial conducted in the United Kingdom compared naproxen to mefenamic acid among 38 women with MBL more than 80 ml for 2 treatment cycles. Median reductions in blood volume from baseline for me fenamic acid ranged from 54 ml to 61 ml (p<0.001) and the reduction for naproxen ranged from 52 to 62 ml (p<0.001) over 2 treatment cycles. There were no significant differences in reductions in MBL between mefenamic acid and naproxen. 75 41 A fair quality crossover RCT conducted in Australia reported greater reduction s in mean MBL among those receiving mefenamic acid ( 18.8 ml ) for 2 treatment cycles compared with those receiving placebo. Among the women with MBL more than 80 ml at baseline (n=30), there was a significant (p<0.001) reduction in mean MBL ( 33.6 ml ) among those receiving mefenamic acid compared with those receiving placebo .76 Six poor quality studies reported similar findings ; NSAIDS significantly reduced MBL compared with baseline (Table 15) . In a poor quality RCT conducted in the United Kingdom with 51 women,63 MBL was reduced by 21 ml in those receiving mefenamic acid compared with baseline; however, the women in the LNG -IUS group reported significantly greater reductions in blood loss volume (117 ml , p<0.001) from baseline. In an RCT conducted in Ireland,66 81 women were randomized (n=27), (n=25), or ethamsylate (n=29) for three cycles . Compared with baseline, those receiving TXA had an 89 ml reduction in MBL , those receiving mefenamic acid reported a 43 ml reduction, and those r eceiving ethamsylate reported an increase in MBL of 8 ml. Those receiving TXA had a 46 ml greater reduction in MBL compared with those receiving mefenamic acid (p<0.05) and those receiving mefenamic acid had a 51 ml greater reduction in MBL compared with those receiving ethamsylate; however, m ean MBL (148 ml; range, 138 to 168 ml) after 3 cycles of treatmen t with mefenamic acid remained more than 80 ml. In a crossover trial conducted in Australia , 68 there were no differences in absolute reductions in MBL volume between mefenamic acid and estradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel given daily for 21 days) or between mefenamic acid compared with naproxen. R eductions in blood loss volume compared with baseline were reported for both those receiving mefenamic acid (38.1 ml, p=0.002) and those receiving COC (43.2 ml, p<0.001). In the other group, there were nonsignificant reductions in MBL from baseline for mef enamic acid (26 ml) and naproxen (15.5 ml). In one RCT conducted in the United Kingdom,70 median MBL was reduced after 2 cycles of mefenamic acid from 123 ml (range , 86 to 237 ml) to 81 ml (range , 22 to 193 ml), a reduction of 42 ml (p<0.001) and was signi ficantly reduced with norethisterone from 109 ml (range , 81 to 236 ml) to 92 ml (range , 43 to 189 ml), a reduction of 17 ml (p<0.002), but there was no significant difference in reductions between mefenamic acid and norethisterone. A small crossover trial71 conducted in Sweden that compar ed TXA with flurbiprofen for two treatment cycles, reported significantly (p<0.01) greater reduct ions in mean MBL from baseline for TXA (140 ml , p<0.01) compared with the change in MBL from baseline for flurbiprofen ( 72 ml, p<0.01). In another small RCT conducted in the United Kingdom ,74 median MBL was significantly reduced after two cycles of treatment with mefenamic acid (n=6), 38 ml reduction (median 47 ml; range , 39 to 210 ml) from baseline (85 ml ; range , 68 to 169 ml), p=0.05, and was significantly reduced with a progesterone -impregnated intrauterine coil (n=7), 19 ml reduction (median 45 ml ; range , 31 to 77 ml) from baseline (median 64 ml ; range , 56 to 164 ml, p<0.05). However, there was no significant reduction in median MBL after two cycles of norethisterone (21 ml ; median 110 ml ; range , 18 to 187 ml). 42 Table 15.

Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart Score One poor quality RCT conducted in India77 randomized 110 wom en with menorrhagia to a combination of TXA and mefenamic acid or TXA alone for three treatment cycles . The pictorial blood loss assessment chart score was lowered by 146 points (59%, p<0.01) from baseline in those receiving mefenamic acid plus TXA and by 125 points ( 50%, p=NS ) from baseline i n those receiving TXA alone. In a poor quality RCT conducted in the United Kingdom ,63 women receiving mefenamic acid reported a 74- point reduction (p<0.001) in the median pictorial blood loss assessment chart score fro m baseline. Relief of Menorrhagia Improvement in the subjective relief of menorrhagia with NSAIDs was reported in two trials.66,69 One RCT conducted in India69 randomized 80 women with subjectively defined, cyclic , heavy bleeding to either mefenamic acid or placebo for three cycles . Relief of menorrhagia was significantly greater among those receiving mefenamic acid (86%) compared with those receiving placebo (20%) . Another trial66 reported that most women (57%) who 43 received mefenamic acid thought their blood loss was less after three treatment cycles compared with baseline. A small, placebo -controlled crossover trial conducted in Canada73 randomized women to 2 cycles each of mefenamic acid and placebo and reported t hat 8 of the 10 women who competed the study experienced reductions in MBL during the mefenamic acid cycles compared with their placebo cycles (p<0.05). Duration of Bleeding and Total Menstrual Fluid Loss Duration of bleeding (in days) was reported in six trials of NSAIDs.66,69,70,72,75,76 In two trials , one fair and one good quality , the duration of menstrual blood flow was shorter among those receiving either meclofenamate72 or mefenamic acid76 compared with placebo. Another fair quality study reported that both mefenamic acid and naproxen reduced the mean number of bleeding days. 75 Two poor quality RCTs reported a significantly shorter duration of bleeding during mefenamic treatment cycles compared with pretreatment cycles,69,70 but there was no change with norethisterone.70 In one poor quality, three -arm trial66 of mefenamic acid, TXA, and ethamsylate, there was no difference in duration of menstrual bleeding between treatment arms. In one poor quality study ,63 total menstrual fluid loss was significantly less at cycle 3 and cycle 6 compared with baseline among women receiving mefenamic acid. Hemoglobin In two trials ,71,72 hemoglobin concentrations did not increase during treatment with NSAIDs. In a good qua lity, crossover trial conducted in the United States, the median hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin levels were unchanged compared with baseline .72 In a crossover trial conducted in Sweden,71 hemoglobin concentration during control cycles was no different from hemoglobin concentration during treatment. In the RCT in India ,77 mean hemoglobin increased significantly in the group receiving c ombined mefenamic acid and TXA ( 12.3 g/dl (12.0 Head -to-Head Comparisons Mefenamic Acid Two crossover trials compared mefenamic acid to naproxen.68,75 There were no differences in reduction of MBL between mefenamic acid and naproxen. One fair quality crossover trial75 conducted in the United Kingdom compared naproxen to mefenamic acid among 38 women with MBL more than 80 ml for 2 treatment cycles. Primary outcomes were mean MBL using the alkaline hematin method. Both m efenamic acid and naproxen reduce d median MBL by 46 to 47 percent and 44 to 48 percent, respectively, compared with baseline . The median reductions in MBL volume from baseline for mefenamic acid ranged from 54 ml to 61 ml (p<0.001); the reduction for naproxen ranged from 52 to 62 ml (p<0.001) over two treatment cycles. There were no differences in reductions in MBL between mefenamic acid and naproxen. One poor quality crossover trial 68 conducted in Australia randomized 30 women with a clinical history of menorrhagia to either mefenamic acid or naproxen for 2 cycles. The same dose of mefenamic acid was compared with oral contraceptives in a second group (see section below ). The p rimary outcome was MBL measured by the alkaline hematin method. Mefenamic acid reduced mean MBL by 20 percent compared with baseline (p=NS). Naproxen reduced mean 44 MBL by 12 percent compared with baseline (p=NS) with no significant differences in reductions between mefenamic acid and naproxen. Despite these reductions, the majority of women recei ving NSAIDs still had objective menorrhagia after treatment. There was considerable variability in response to both NSAIDs, with some women experiencing increases in MBL during treatment with NSAIDs. Mefenamic Acid Versus Progesterone- Releasing Intrauteri ne Systems Two poor quality RCTs conducted in the United Kingdom examined the efficacy of mefenamic acid compared with progesterone -releasing intrauterine systems . One studied the continuous LNG -IUS,63 and the other studied an older progesterone -impregnate d intrauterine coil that releases 65 mcg of progesterone daily .74 Both trials used objective measures of MBL (alkaline hematin method) for inclusion criteria, but with slightly different volumes ( more than 80 ml63 and more than 50 ml74) to assess MBL outco mes. One RCT with 51 participants63 reported a statistically significant greater reduction in median MBL from baseline in the women with LNG- IUS ( 117 ml ) compared with the women receiving mefenamic acid ( 21 ml) after six cycles of treatment. Significantly g reater (p<0.001 ) reductions in the me dian pictorial blood loss assessment chart score and total menstrual fluid loss were also reported with LNG -IUS compared with mefenamic acid. Despite significant reductions with mefenamic acid, most patients still had objective MBL more than 80 ml. One small RCT74 reported reductions in median MBL after two cycles of treatment with both mefenamic acid (n=6), with a reduction of 21 ml (median 47 ml ; range , 39 to 210 ml) from baseline (85 ml ; range , 68 to 169 ml; p=0.05) , and with the progesterone -impregnated intrauterine coil (n=7 ) with a reduction of 19 ml (median 45 ml ; range , 31 to 77 ml) from baseline (median 64 ml ; range , 56 to 164 ml; p<0.05) . No statistics for head -to-head comparisons were reported. NSAIDs Versus TXA Two poor quality trials compared NSAID s with TXA.66,71 Both trials reported that women receiving TXA had significantly greater reductions in mean MBL compared with either mefenamic acid or flurbiprofen over three cycles. One RCT66 conducted in Ireland, randomized 81 women with MBL more than 80 ml to either TXA (n=27), mefenamic acid (n=25), or ethamsylate (n=29) for three cycles. There was a significant reduction in mean MBL from baseline over three treatment cycles for two of thre e treatment arms: 54 percent ( p<0.001) for TXA and 20 percent (p<0.001) for mefenamic acid . The absolute change in MBL compared with baseline was 89 ml with TXA, 43 ml with mefenamic acid , and +8 ml with ethamsylate. One small crossover trial71 conducted in Sweden compared TXA to flurbiprofen in 15 women with MBL more than 80 ml . The trial reported a statistically significant reduction in mean MBL (53%) in the group receiving TXA (53%) compared with the group receiving flurbiprofen (24% ). Absol ute reductions in blood loss volume from baseline were greater for TXA (1 40 ml ) compared with flurbiprofen (72 ml ). TXA Plus Mefenamic Acid Versus TXA Alone One poor quality RCT conducted in India77 randomized 110 women with menorrhagia (not objectively defined ) to a combination of TXA and mefenamic acid or to TXA alone. After three treatment cycles, the pictorial blood loss assessment chart score was reduced in those receiving 45 mefenamic acid plus TXA (59%, p<0.01) and in those receiving TXA alone (50%, p=NS). No statistics for head -to-head comparisons were reported. Mefenamic Acid Versus Norethisterone Two poor quality RCTs conducted in the United Kingdom examined the efficacy of mefenamic acid compared with norethisterone . 70,74 Both trials examined the same dose and duration of mefenamic acid (500 mg 3 times daily on cycle days 1 to 5) and the same dose of norethisterone (5 mg twice per day) but given during slightly different cycle days, ( days 19 to 2670 vs. days 15 to 2574). Both trials used the alkal ine method for MBL measurement for inclusion (50 to 80 ml) and outcome criteria. One RCT70 reported no difference in reductions of median MBL among those receiving 2 treatment cycles of mefenamic acid (n=17) compared with those receiving norethisterone (n=15). With either treatment, the majority of women still had MBL more than 80 ml. In the other small RCT,74 no statistics for head -to-head comparisons were reported. Compared with baseline, median MBL was reduced after treatment with mefenamic acid (n=6) by 38 ml and by 21 ml (p=NS) among those receiving norethisterone (n= 6). Median MBL with treatment was 47 ml (range, 39 to 210 ml) with mefenamic acid and 110 ml (range, 24 to 222 ml) with norethisterone. Mefenamic Acid Versus Low -Dose COC One poor quality crossover trial68 conducted in Australia examined the efficacy of mefenamic acid compared with low -dose COC with 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel given daily for 21 days among 30 women with a clinical history of menorrhagia. There were n o differences between mefenamic acid and COC in reductions in mean MBL ( 38% vs. 43% ) or absolute reductions in MBL volume (38 ml vs. 43 ml). Tranexamic Acid Key Points Women taking TXA at a dose of 1.95 to 4.5 grams per day for 4 to 5 days from the onset of bleeding experienced a clinically significant reduction in MBL, ranging from 26 percent to 54 percent in studies lasting up to 1 year. However, there are no long -term followup studies. In comparison to progestogens, combined hormonal pills, and NSAIDs , TXA appeared to provide greater reduction in No head- to-head comparisons of TXA versus LNG - IUS were assessed. The number of reports of side -effects and adverse effects was generally not significantly different between TXA and the compar ator. Although no thromboembolic events were reported in any of the included TXA studies, there are concerns about the possible increased risk of thromboembolic events in particular women . The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has issued precautions and contra -indications. Detailed Synthesis TXA is a competitive inhibitor of plasminogen activation, thereby acting as an antifibrinolytic agent. TXA does not appear to affect platelet numbers or aggregation but acts to reduce the breakdown of fibrin in a preformed clot. Because menstrual bleeding involves 46 liquefaction of clotted blood from the spiral endometrial arterioles, a reduction in this process is the putative mechanism of reduced menstrual bleeding. Seven RCTs of TXA were identified (Table 16).66,71,77-81 One study compared TXA alone to TXA plus mefenamic acid, and is discussed in the NSAIDs section above.77 For the six other studies of TXA, study population ranged from 1571 to 304.81 The total number of women randomiz ed to TXA was 475. The total number of women assigned to TXA for whom study endpoint outcome measures were collected, including intention to treat missing data protocols, was 460. For f ive of the trials, the bleeding criterion for study entry was a mean MBL (assessed using the alkaline hematin method) of at least 80 ml for two or three cycles prior to randomization. 66,71,78,80,81 A six th trial used the pictorial blood loss assessment chart score greater than 100 to enroll participants.79 The mean MBL at baseline was similar for four of the trials (range , 153 to 186 ml).66,78,80,81 The mean MBL at baseline was 295 ml for one trial.71 The intervention dosage differed among the six trials. The TXA administration protocols for each menstrual cycle were: 1.95 grams per day or 3.9 grams per day for up to 5 days,81 2 grams per day for 5 days,79 3.9 g rams per day for up to 5 days,78 4 grams per day for 4 days,80 4 grams per day for 5 days,66 4.5 g rams per day for 3 days and then 2 g rams per day for 2 days.71 Two of the studies were placebo- controlled.78,81The comparator diff ered across the other four trials and included: oral MPA for 20 days,79 oral norethisterone for 7 days,80 mefenamic acid for 5 ethamsylate for 5 days,66 and flurbiprofen for 5 days.71 The primary outcome of the trials was change in blood loss (abso lute volume or percent) or change in pictorial blood loss assessment chart score. The alkaline hematin method was used to assess MBL in five trials. 66,71,78,80,81 The absolute change in mean blood loss from baseline and percent change were reported in five studies.66,71,78,80,81 Three of these four reported mean MBL,71,78,80 and three reported median MBL.66,78,80 One trial used the pictorial blood loss assessment chart, which is a validated chart that helps participants more uniformly report bleeding as rep resented by the degree of saturation of sanitary pads and tampons, for the outcome measure. 79 The timing of the summative outcome measure reporting varied among the trials. Two trials reported after two menstrual cycles.71,80 Two trials reported after thr ee menstrual cycles.66,81 Two trials reported after six menstrual cycles.78,79 The setting varied: two trials were conducted in the United States ,78,81 three in Europe ,66,71,80 and one in India.79 Overall one study was assessed as good quality,78 two were fair quality ,80,81 and three were poor quality .66,71,79 Details of quality scoring for individual publications are included in Appendix I. 47 Table 16.

Proportion of women with at least 50 ml reduction in MBL was 56% in G1 and 19% in G2 (p<0.0001). Women in G1 reported improvements in quality of life (measured by the Menorrhagia Impact Score) compared with G2 (p<0.01). Freeman et al., 201181 Fair G1: TXA 3.9 g per day for up to 5 days of menstrual bleeding (118) G2: TXA 1.95 g per day for up to 5 days of menstrual bleeding (117) G3: Placebo (69) Mean MBL was significantly reduced during treatment compared with baseline for G1 (26%) and for G2 (39%).

Description of Results Outcome Measures The alkaline hematin method for MBL was used as an outcome measure in 5 of the TXA trials.66,71,78,80,81 One poor quality trial used the pictorial blood loss assessment chart to assess blood loss , with menorrhagia defined by a pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of 100 or greater.79 Other outcome measures included hemoglobin level, treatment success, and quality of life. 48 MBL Reduction Expressed as a Percent In five studies ( one good quality, two fair quality, and two poor quality ), TXA was associated with significant reductions in MBL ranging from 26 to 54 percent (Table 17). A good quality placebo -controlled trial reported a statistically significant (p<0.001) reduction in mean MBL among women in the modified intent -to-treat population receiving TXA (40%) compared with those receiving placebo (8%) for six menstrual cycles. The attributable reduction for TXA was 32 percent (p<0.001). 78 The other placebo- controlled tr ial of fair quality reported significant reductions in mean MBL for women receiving 3.9 or 1.95 grams per day of TXA (39% and 26%, respectively) compared with a reduction in MBL of 2 percent for women taking placebo (p<0.001). 81 The trial that compared TXA with norethisterone reported a statistically significant reduction in mean MBL among women receiving TXA for two treatment cycles compared with those receiving norethisterone: 45- percent reduction (95% CI, 23% increase to 93% reduction; p<0.0001 vs. baseline) compared with a 20- CI, 114% increase to 62% reduction; vs. baseline).80 trial that compared TXA with ethamsylate and with mefenamic acid reported that over three treatment cycles the mean reduction in MBL from baseline for the group receiving TXA was 54 percent (p<0.001). For the mefenamic acid group the mean reduction in MBL from baseline was 20 percent (p <0.001). There was no change in MBL f or the ethamsylate group . 66 A small, poor quality, crossover trial (n=15) that compared TXA with flurbiprofen reported that over two treatment cycles the mean reduction in MBL from baseline for TXA was 53 percent (p<0.01) compared with 24 percent for flurbiprofen (p<0.01). 71 Table 17.

Both placebo - controlled trials reported a statistically significant reduction in mean MBL for women treated with TXA.78,81 Among women in the modified intent -to-treat population receiving TXA for six menstrual cycles , one study reported a reduction in MBL of 69.6 ml compared with a reduction 49 of 12.6 ml in the placebo group; t he attributable reduction for TXA was 57 ml (p<0.001). The calculated least -squares mean reduction in MBL in the modified intent -to-treat population receiving TXA (66.3 ml) was greater comp ared with those receiving placebo (17.8 ml ); the attributable reduction for TXA was 48.5 ml (p<0.001).78 The effect size for TXA (standardized observed effect) was 0.67 based upon the modified intention to treat analysis and the standard deviation. The eff ect size was 0.49 based upon the least squares mean change analysis and the standard deviation.78 The effect size for TXA compared with placebo is large. In the larger fair quality study that compared high- dose (3.9 g/day) and low -dose (1.95 g/day) TXA to placebo, the mean reduction from baseline for the intent -to-treat population was 65.3 ml and 46.5 ml, respectively, while the placebo group had a small insignificant decline of 3.0 ml. The low -dose group did not meet the authors predetermined threshold of at least 50 ml per cycle reduction in MBL from baseline, but both groups treated with TXA did achieve a reduction in MBL from baseline that exceeded the threshold determined by authors to be meaningful to women (36 ml/cycle). 81 A small fair quality trial that compared TXA with norethisterone reported a statistically significant reduction in mean MBL occurred among women receiving TXA for two treatment cycles compared with those receiving norethisterone: 79 ml reduction (95% CI, 62 to 108 ml reduction) compared with 34 ml increase (95% CI, 2 to 64 ml reduction). 80 A trial that compared TXA with ethamsylate and with mefenamic acid reported that the pretreatment MBL in the TXA group ranged from 143 to 178 ml, and over three treatment cycles the mean MBL was 72 to 77 ml, a mean reduction in MBL of 89 ml (range , 24 to 214 ml , p<0.001) . For the ethamsylate group, the pretreatment MBL ranged from 157 to 185 ml, and over three treatment cycles the mean MBL was 161 to 185 ml, a mean increase of 8 ml (range, 280 to 103 ml). For the mefenamic acid group, the pretreatment MBL ranged from 159 to 199 ml, and over three treatment cycles the mean MBL was 138 to 168 ml, a mean reduction in MBL of 43 ml (range , 82 to 179 ml ; p<0.001). 66 Head -to-head comparisons of the results of treatment on absolute changes in blood loss showed that TXA reduced the mean loss by 97 ml more than with ethamsylate (95% CI , 54 to 140 ml , p<0.001) and by 56 ml more than with mefenamic acid (95% CI , 2 to 90 ml , p<0.05). 66 A small crossover trial that compared TXA with flurbiprofen reported that over two treatment cycles the mean reduction in MBL from baseline for TXA was 140 ml (SD \u00b1 33 ml , p<0.01), compared with 72 ml (SD \u00b1 44 ml, p<0.01) for flurbiprofen.71 Table 18.

In the good quality study , mean hemoglobin levels were unchanged from baseline for women taking TXA (0.02 \u00b1 1.10 g/dL) while the placebo group had a statistically significant increase (0.34 \u00b1 0.66 g/dL) that was not considered clinically signific ant. 78 The post treatment hemoglobin levels were similar (estimated difference 0.2 g/dl, 95% CI, 0.5 to 0.9) in the TXA (12.9 g/dl) and norethisterone groups (12.6 g/dl).80 Hemoglobin levels rose significantly from baseline for women taking TXA (p=0.0003) and women taking MPA (p=0.02).79 The small crossover trial did not find differences in mean hemoglobin during the control cycles (127.4 \u00b1 3.7 g/l) compared (127.2 cycles. 71 Treatment Success One placebo -controlled trial reported a statistically significant difference (p<0.001) for achieving a MBL below 80 ml (standard definition of heavy menstrual bleeding) in the modified intent -to-treat population between women receiving TXA (43%) compared with those receiving placebo (17%) for six menstrual cycles. 78 This same study reported that 69 percent of cycles in the TXA group achieved a predetermined MBL reduction of at least 36 ml , representing a blood loss reduction considered meaningful to women.78 In the three -arm placebo controlled study, women receiving the higher (3.9 g/day) and lower (1.95 g/d) dose of TXA achieved a reduction in MBL from baseline that was perceived as meaningful to participants; however, only participants receiving the higher do se of TXA (3.9 g/day) achieved a mean reduction in MBL that exceeded 50 ml per cycle. 81 Quality of Life One placebo -controlled trial reported a statistically significant (p<0.001) difference in social or leisure activities, and in physical activity, favoring TXA .78 Women taking TXA has significant improvements in quality of life as assessed by the Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire. 81 Head -to-Head Comparisons TXA Versus Norethi sterone and MPA The trial that compared TXA with norethisterone reported a statistically significant (p<0.0001) reduction in mean MBL for women receiving TXA for two treatment cycles compared with no reduction for women receiving norethisterone.80 Expresse d as percentage , the change in MBL for TXA was a 45- reduction (95% CI, 23% increase to 93% reduction; p<0.0001 vs. baseline) compared with an increase of 20 percent (95% CI, 114% increase to 62% reduction; p=0.26 vs. baseline) for norethisterone ; expressed as a measure of volume, there was a reduction in MBL of 79 ml (95% CI, 62 to 108 ml reduction) for TXA compared with an increase of 34 ml (95% CI, 2 to 64 ml reduction) for noresthisterone .80 51 In a trial that compared T XA with oral MPA, both groups experienced significant reductions in MBL compared with baseline; the effect of these interventions was comparable (p=0.78). 79 TXA Versus Mefenamic Acid, Ethamsylate, and Flurbiprofen, TXA reduced the mean blood loss by 97 ml more than with ethamsylate (95% CI, 140 to 54, p<0.001) and by 46 ml more than with mefenamic acid (95% CI, 90 to 2 ml, p<0.05) .66 The trial that compared TXA with flurbiprofen reported that the reduction in MBL during treatment with TXA was significantly (p<0.01) greater than the reduction reported during treatment with flurbiprofen .71 Combined Oral Contraceptives Key Points In two medium -sized RCTs , treatment of affected women with estradiol valerate and dienogest led to improvement in a range of AUB symptoms, including both over all complete response and effects on relevant laboratory values (e.g., hemoglobin, ferritin). In one small RCT and one small randomized crossover study of combination therapy with ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel and one small RCT assessing therapy with ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone acetate, COC treatment was associated with significant reductions in MBL as compared with baseline. Detailed Synthesis We identified five RCTs that explored the effects of therapy with COCs on the incidence and severit y of a bnormal cyclic uterine bleeding including two studies examining estradiol valerate dienogest ,82,83 two studies examining ethinyl estradiol plus levonorgestrel,59,68 and one study examining the combination of norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estr adiol (Table 19) .61 All five studies were industry -sponsored.59,61,68,82,83 Three were multicenter RCTs, involving Australia and Europe,82 the United States and Canada,83 and Canada,61 and two were academic single center studies, one conducted in Egypt59 and one conducted in Australia.68 Two of the studies included seven 28- day cycles of therapy with the primary response rate determined after 90 days of therapy,82,83 while one examined outcomes after 6 months68 and two assessed outcomes after 12 months .59,61 Two studies employed a placebo comparison group,82,83 two compared COCs to LNG -IUS,59,61 and one included randomized crossover comparison of a COC to mefenamic acid.68 52 Table 19.

G1 participants had significant improvements vs. baseline in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin values; no similar change in G2. Jensen et al., 201183 Australia, Europe Good G1: Estradiol valerate and dienogest (120) G2: Placebo (70) Full resolution of qualifying abnormal menstrual symptoms during the first 90 days of treatment observed in 43.8% of G1 vs. 4.2% of G2 (p<0.001). Mean reduction in MBL was 353 ml (64.2%) G1 vs. 130 ml (18.7%) in G2 (p<0.001). G1 participants had significant improvements vs. baseline in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin values; no similar change in G2. estradiol (56) G2 associated with significant reduction in MBL at 12 months vs. baseline from 274.3 \u00b1 142.6 ml to 118.2 \u00b1 75.0 ml (p<0.001). Reduction in MBL at 12 months was significantly greater in the G1 vs. G2. Significant improvemen ts in patient assessment of overall health noted in G1 and G2. Endrikat et acetate and G2 experienced a significant decreased in MBL at 12 months compared with baseline. Mean decrease of 68% in MBL for G2 (p<0.001). Median MBL in G2 decreased from 290 ml at baseline to 72 ml at 12 months. Fraser et al., 199168 Australia Poor MBL observed during the COC treatment cycles (43%) as compared with baseline. (p<0.001). At least 20% reduction in MBL as compared with the preceding baseline cycles was observed in 10/12 patients during mefenamic acid treatment and 9/12 COC = combined oral contraceptive aCrossover study . All studies assessed measures related to changes in MBL, including use of the alkaline hematin method59,68,82,83 and the pictorial blood loss assessment chart.59,61 Other outcomes included number of sanitary items used, a composite outcome of menstrual bleeding- related factors,82,83 and related hematologic parameters (i.e., hematocr it, hemoglobin, and/or serum ferritin).59,61,82,83 One study also assessed potential impact on health -related quality of life15 and one described effects on a menorrhagia symptom severity score.61 None of the studies assessed any potential effect modifiers . Among the five studies of COC therapy, two were good quality82,83 and three were poor quality.59,61,68 Details of quality scoring for individual publications are included in Appendix I. 53 Description of Results Estradiol Valerate and Dienogest Two multicenter RCTs with the same industry sponsor assessed the utility of estradiol valerate and dienogest in treatment of women with AUB , defined as prolonged, frequent, and/or heavy bleeding. The first RCT82 was conducted in Australia and Europe and comprised 231 women, randomized at a 2:1 ratio after a 90- day run- in period to receive estradiol valerate and dienogest for seven 28- day cycles. The study drug regimen included estradiol valerate 3 mg on days 1 to 2, estradiol valerate 2 mg and dienogest 2 m g on days 3 to 7, estradiol valerate 2 mg and dienogest 3 mg on days 8 to 24, estradiol valerate 2 mg on days 25 to 26, and placebo on days 27 to 28. Complete response, defined as full resolution of qualifying abnormal menstrual symptoms during the first 9 0 days of treatment as compared with the 90 -day run -in phase, was observed in 29.5 percent of the estradiol valerate and dienogest group, as compared with 1.2 percent of the placebo -treated patients (p<0.0001). Treatment with estradiol valerate and dienoge st was also associated with significant reductions in volume of MBL (p<0.0001), days of bleeding (p=0.02), and number of sanitary protection items used (p<0.0001) as compared with the placebo group. The estradiol valerate and dienogest -treated patients als o experienced significant improvements versus baseline in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin values; similar improvements were not observed in the placebo- treated group. The second RCT 83 was conducted at centers in the United States and Canada, employing the same dose and randomization schema and including 190 women with AUB . Complete response, defined as full resolution of qualifying abnormal menstrual symptoms during the first 90 days of treatment as compared with the 90- day run- in phase, was observed i n a significantly greater proportion of the estradiol valerate and dienogest group (35/80, 44%) as compared with the placebo group (2/48, 4%, p<0.001). The mean reduction in MBL was also greater in the estradiol valerate and dienogest ( 353 ml or 64% vs. loss during run -in phase) when compared with the placebo group ( 130 ml or 19% vs. observed run- in loss, p<0.001). Individuals in the estradiol valerate and dienogest group also experienced significant improvements in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin values as compared with the run- in phase, while similar improvements were not observed in the placebo group. Ethinyl Estradiol and Levonorgestrel Two randomized controlled trials assessed the utility of an ethinyl estradiol (30 mcg) and levonorgestrel (150 mcg) combination in women with menorrhagia.59,68 One of these trials was a single center RCT involving 112 women with Efficacy data from the LN G- IUS arm of the study is discussed further in the LNG- IUS section of this report. In this trial, the COC regimen was associated with a significant reduction in MBL as assessed by the alkaline hematin method at 12 months as compared with baseline, from 274.3 \u00b1 142.6 ml to 118.2 \u00b1 75.0 ml (p<0.001); however, the overall reduction in MBL was significantly greater in the LNG -IUS group as compared with the COC group. Significant improvements in patient assessment of overall health and reduction in physically ill days were noted in both treatment groups. The other trial assessing the use of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel was a crossover study in women with menorrhagia, with one arm comparing outcomes of 12 women treated sequentially with mefenamic acid (500 mg every 12 hours from first sign of menses until 24 hours after usual duration of heavy bleeding) and COCs for two cycles each in random order, 54 with a two -cycle washout period between treatment cycles.68 Additional efficacy details for mefenamic acid and for another treatment arm in this study inv olving naproxen are further discussed in the NSAIDs section of this report. A significant (p<0.001) reduction in mean MBL as measured by the alkaline hematin method was observed during the COC treatment cycles as compared with baseline (43%); the reduction in mean MBL during the mefenamic acid treatment period was not significantly different than the COC treatment period. A response of at least 20 percent reduction in MBL as compared with the preceding baseline cycles was observed in 10 of 12 patients during mefenamic acid treatment and in 9 of 12 during COC treatment. One patient responded to COCs but not to mefenamic acid, and two patients exhibited a response to mefenamic acid but not to the COC regimen. Ethinyl Estradiol and Norethindrone Acetate One mul the combination of ethinyl estradiol (20 mcg) and norethindrone acetate (1 mg) to use of a levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine system (LNG -IUS) over 12 months in 39 women with idiopathic menorrhagia.61 Effica cy data from the LNG -IUS arm of the study is also discussed further in the levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine system section of this report. The LNG -IUS arm included 17 women and the COC arm included 12. Both arms experienced a significant (p<0.001) decrease in MBL at 12 months as compared with baseline, with a decrease from a median MBL of 290 ml at baseline to a median of 72 ml at 12 months observed in the COC group (mean decrease 68%). The decrease in MBL, however, was significantly greater in the LNG -IUS group versus the COC group (p=0.002). Treatment success, defined as MBL less than 100 at 12 months, was observed in a significantly (p<0.009) greater proportion of the LNG -IUS participants (80%) as compared with the COC group ( 37%). Menorrhagia symptom severity scores were also significantly lower in the LNG -IUS group at 6 months as compared with the COC group (p=0.05). No significant changes in hemoglobin concentration were observed in either group during the study. Use of Decision Aids in Treatment o f Menorrhagia Key Points Three RCTs evaluated decision aids to assist patients with menorrhagia. All were of poor quality due to lack of blinding of participants and care providers. Improvements in general health status, the primary outcome for 2 studies, were not associated with decision aids. One study reported lower use of hysterectomy among women who had an interview prior to their consultation while another study did not show differences in hysterectomy rates after 1 year. Two studies did not report di fferences in treatment outcomes after 6 months or 1 year. Detailed Synthesis Decision aids are interventions to inform patients of their treatment options when more than one option exists. A recent Cochrane review of RCTs of decision aid94 found that decis ion aids are beneficial in increasing patient knowledge of treatment options, help to clarify benefits and harms associated with therapeutic choices, and increase patient participation in decision selection. They have been shown to reduce elective surgery and have no apparent adverse effects on patient outcomes or satisfaction. 94 55 We identified three RCTs with four publications85-87,95 about medical decision aids in women with menorrhagia (Table 20) . All of the studies used a written decision aid booklet; one study evaluated a computerized decision aid in conjunction with the pamphlet and one study also mailed participants a videotape and conducted an interview prior to clinical appointment. Diagnosi s of menorrhagia was determined from medical records and not quantified in any of the studies. Length of followup ranged from 6 months to 2 years. Two studies were conducted in the United Kingdom 86,87 and one was conducted in Finland.85 These studies were all of poor quality. The largest study (n=894), conducted in England, randomized women to receive booklet and videotape with interview, materials without interview, or standard practice groups.86 General health status improved significantly and menorrhagia severity decreased in all three groups. Treatment rates were similar in all groups after 2 years. Women in the interview group had a lower rate of hysterectomy and reported greater satisfaction with treatment results. A medium sized Finnish study evaluate d the effectiveness of a mailed information booklet on treatment outcomes and general health status after 1 year. 85,95 More women who received the decision aid were less likely to receive newer treatment methods including minor surgery or LNG -IUS (16% vs. 26%, p=0.03). Most of the measured health outcome scores improved after 1 year for both groups with no significant difference in patient satisfaction, knowledge, anxiety or sexual satisfaction. A small English study 87 conducted from 2003 to 2005 evaluated a computerized decision aid in conjunction with a patient leaflet. Women in the intervention group had significantly less decisional conflict at 2 weeks and higher knowledge scores at 6 months. There were no significant group differences in anxiety or trea tments received after 6 months. Although decision aids do hel p to increase patient knowledge, t here are some methodological limitations in these studies, including low participation rates, large number of drop outs, and lack of blinding. The diagnosis of m enorrhagia was not quantified and no effect modifiers were examined in any of these studies . Information on harms was not reported in any of the decision aid studies. 56 Table 20. Primary outcomes of decision aids for abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding Author, Year Country Quality Comparison Groups ( n) Outcomes Results Protheroe et al., 200787 United Kingdom Poor G1: Computerized decision aid and information leaflet (74) G2: Information leaflet only (72) Primary: total score on Decisional Conflict Scale Secondary: anxiety, quality of life, knowledge, treatment preferences Decisional conflict was significantly reduced in G1 vs. G2 (adjusted difference 16.6 95% CI, 21.5 to 11.6, p<0.001). Anxiety declined slightly for both groups (p=NS). Quality of life and knowledge scores improved in both groups but more in G1 as compared with G2. Vuorma et al., 200485,95 Finland Poor G1: Information booklet (184) G2: Usual care (179) Primary: Planned treatment at 3 months and actual treatment at 1 year General health status measured by RAND -36 Secondary: knowledge of treatment methods, satisfaction with communication anxiety and sexuality Fewer women in G1 received newer treatments (minor surgery or LNG -IUS) (p=0.03); hysterectomy rates were similar in both groups. Most health status measures improved for both groups. At 3 months 18% of women in G1 and 8% in G2 had received prescription for oral medication (p=0.007). There were no differences between groups in anxiety, satisfaction, knowledge or sexual satisfaction. Kennedy et al., 200286 United Kingdom Poor G1: Interview and information booklet (300) G2: Information booklet only (296) G3: No intervention (298) Primary: general health status measured using SF - 36 Secondary: treatments received during followup, severity of menorrhagia, patient satisfaction Health status measures improved for all 3 groups . Treatment rate (81%) during study was similar for all 3 groups (p=0.17) but women in G1 were less likely to have a hysterectomy (OR 0.60 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.96). G1 were more satisfied in taking part in treatment decision and with results compared with G3. CI = confidence interval; OR = odds ratio; NS = nonsignificant KQ2. Harms of Interventions for Management of Abnormal Bleeding Description of Included Studies and Sources of Information Capturing useful information about potential harms of treatment for reproductive -age women that is specifically applicable to interventions for abnormal bleeding is a challenge. A wide range of interventions are used to treat abnormal bleeding. Twelve interventions relevant to the primary care setting were identified for this report. They range from medications that are exceptionally familiar to providers such as NSAIDs to potentially less familiar or newer medica tions like exenatide (an injectable diabetes agent). Interventions also include those with widespread use and many indications, like oral contraceptive pills or acupuncture, as well as those specifically for the indication of abnormal bleeding like TXA. 57 To pare down the scope of the material, w e took a four step approach to structuring this KQ about harms. Summarizing harms detected within clinical trials included in this review. This has limitations since many of the studies are small, with a range in size of 14 to 894 and a median total study population of 80. Thus they are not well -suited to detecting events that are rare but may be serious or affect a specific subgroup of women. Compiling the key content of FDA documents and package inserts for specif ic products addressed in this review. This however lacks specificity as many of these products have multiple indications and the concerns may not be as applicable to the population of women with AUB or to the dose and duration of use for treating AUB. Furt hermore symptoms and harms are reported in these documents that may not be statistically, meaningfully different between the active agent and the placebo. Searching for surveillance studies that aimed to examine risk of harm in large populations of individuals ( i.e., 1600 or more ) using the specific intervention. This last step was done using a separate search described in greater detail in methods. We restricted summarizing results from harms surveillance studies to : metformin, exenatide, progestogens, cabergoline, LNG -IUS, contraceptive vaginal ring, and TXA. Providing information about existing contemporary reviews and guidance on harms for common medications with broad indications. Like the second approach it is important to note that these extant literature reviews reflects varied indications and populations that may not be directly applicable to use for AUB. The organization of this chapter includes evidence about harms from these sources in the following order: Harms identified in randomized trials included in this review. Harms flagged in FDA package inserts and regulatory proceedings. Harms investigated in large surveillance studies of metformin, exenatide, relevant progestogens, cabergoline, LNG -IUS, contraceptive vaginal ring, and TXA . Contemporary reviews that include review of harms . We present this summary of harms in the same order of KQs and intervention methods as the results for our KQs. Interventions for irregular uterine bleeding are present before those for abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding. Key Points for Harms of Reviewed Treatments Metformin is associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and abdominal pain. Symptoms can be reduced by slowly increasing the dose. Severe harms including lactic acidosis, ser ious hypoglycemia, and liver failure, studied among populations of adult diabetics, occur at incidence rates below 1 in 10,000 and may be as low as 1 in 100,000 person- years of exposure. Progestogens are associated with a number of common side effects of hormonal preparations including weight gain, fluid retention, abdominal pain, nausea, change in mood, and change in appetite. Abnormal uterine bleeding is itself a common side effect of progestogen only interventions. COCs have commonly recognized side eff ects that include edema, breast tenderness, nausea, headache, and skin changes. Known contraindications, including advancing age, smoking, and high risk of thrombosis, apply when considering use of COCs for irregular 58 bleeding. Selected COC formulations may have lower risk of deep vein thrombosis than others. Cabergoline has few known distinct harms ; however, data is inadequate to assess risk in young women without elevated prolactin. LNG -IUS has few serious harms after insertion . Irregular bleeding, espec ially early after insertion is the most common ly reported side effect . Painful insertion occurs in roughly 1 of 100 procedures; 3.2 of 100 insertions are technically difficult, and uterine perforation occurs in 0.9 to 2.6 cases per 1,000. The LNG -IUS is no t associated with increased deep vein thrombosis risk. NSAIDs have common harms that include abdominal pain, nausea, gastritis, and lightheadedness/dizziness. Gastrointestinal bleeding is a serious side effect related to total dose and duration of use ; however , even short -term use can increase risk . The risk of gastrointestinal bleeding from low -dose, intermittent NSAID use is poorly characterized. TXA use is associated with headache, nasal and sinus symptoms, back pain, and abdominal pain in more than 10 percent of those taking the drug. Joint pain, muscle cramps, migraine, anemia and fatigue occur in more than 5 percent. Rare events are less well characterized and may include thrombosis, anaphylaxis, and visual disturbances. TXA is contraindicated in those with higher risk of thrombosis. Contraceptive vaginal ring has similar side effects to COCs including breast tenderness, nausea and headache. Ring users also experience local pro blems including leuc orrhea, vagin itis, and ring -related events including expulsion, foreign body sensation, and coital problems. The contraceptive vaginal ring is not recommended for use in cigarette smokers over age 35. Other than COCs, progestogens, and the LNG -IUS, the available data may not apply well to populations of young women using these treatments. Detailed Synthesis Harms Related to Metformin Information about Metformin from Included Trials Metformin was investigated in two placebo controlled trials51,52 and in two arms of a three- arm trial in which two arms included metformin:53 one metformin alone and another with combined oral metformin and exenatide weekly injections. Doses used in these studies, after an initial 1 week dose ramp up were 850 mg twice a day, 51 500 mg 3 times daily ,52 and 1,000 mg twice daily .53 Combined, the three RCTs, with four total metformin arms, administered the drug to only 77 women, 20 of whom were also receiving another agent.51-53 This provides insufficient power to detect events that occur at the level of 1 to 5 percent or l ower that are typically of concern for harms. It also provides insufficient power to conclude that specific symptoms were statistically more common among those treated than among the 33 women who received placebo in two studies. 51,52 Women receiving metfor min did report gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea at higher absolute numbers than those in the placebo or exenatide only groups, 52,53 and the study reporting withdrawals51 documented 3 times as many women on the active drug withdrew from the trial for side effects (15 /45 vs. 5/ 47; p<0.05). 59 Information About Metformin From FDA Documents and Package Inserts Increased gastrointestinal complaints are consistent with the documented side effects listed in the package insert for metformin which include: diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, indigestion, and abdominal discomfort as events that are the most common and expected to occur in more than 5 percent of those who initiate the drug. 96 Of note, it is recommended that the dose be increased gradually over 1 week or more precisely because these effects are common and can be reduced by gradual introduction of the drug. The most serious known side effect of metformin is lactic acidosis which occurs when lactate accumulates in t he blood and decreases blood pH. The package insert includes a boxed warning for this concerning effect. 96 Little is known about how common lactic acidosis might be among reproductive -age women , with PCOS and not type 2 diabetes, similar to those in the study or for whom the intervention might be considered as part of primary care management of irregular uterine bleeding. Information About Metformin From Large Datasets Our literature search aim ed at identifying publications designed to investigate harms, required more than 1,600 exposed individuals, or for case -control analyses, case identification consistent with a base population of more than 1,600. We identified four publications focused on metformin harms. 97-100 The Toxic Exposure Surveillance Sys tem database of the American Association for Poison Control Centers provided data from 1996 through 2000 for accidental and intentional over ingestion and unintentional misuse of metformin for 4,072 cases . 97 Fifty -nine percent were women and the majority was adults. Children under 12 had few serious side effects and no deaths. Among adults, harms were evenly distributed across ages with a trend for more serious outcomes in the elderly. In all groups lactic acidosis was rare (1.6%) and hypoglycemia at 2.8 percent was more common that previously reported. Given all individuals had unintended or higher tha n therapeutic doses, they also observed elevated creatinine levels, an increased anion gap, hypotens ion, and coma among those hospitalized. The first publication focused on harms of intended use was published in 2003 to assess incidence of serious acute liver injuries in patients on hypoglycemic agents. 98 The population comprised the 171,264 members of f ive health maintenance organizations receiving oral diabetes medications. They identified 35 cases of acute liver failure, not known to be attributable to another cause. Incidence per 1 ,000 person -years of use was not statistically meaningfully different b y medication used, after adjusting for other comorbidities and confounders. Overall occurrence was roughly 1 case per 10,000 person- years in this population of all adult diabetics. 98 In 2008, an analysis using the U.K. General Practice Research Database u ndertook an analysis of the risk of lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia among 50,048 type 2 diabetics using oral medications. 99 The average age of patients included in the analysis was 60.7 \u00b1 11.7 and 54.8 percent were women. They determined the incidence rat e of lactic acidosis was 3.3 per 100,000 person- years among metformin users and 4.8 per 100,000 person- years among those on sulfonyl ureas. The adjusted odds ratios for both lactic acidosis and severe hypoglycemic episodes were significantly higher for those on sulfonyl ureas than metformin with a more than 2- fold elevation in risk. However this analysis also did not include individuals taking metformin for indications other than diabetes. A retrospective cohort of more than 44,169 diabetic patients in a pr epaid health plan followed for an average of 4.2 years evaluated use of endoscopy. 100 The exposure of interest was defined by prescription of specific diabetes medications and the outcome of interest was lower 60 gastrointestinal tract endoscopy including fle xible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. The analysis was undertaken in part out of concern that therapy with metformin, with attendant risk of gastrointestinal side effects, could increase use of lower tract endoscopy. Forty -seven percent of participants were women with an average age of 66. The authors found that rates of endoscopy were higher among all groups of diabetics on medications, including those using insulin. Taking into account the precision of the estimates, there was no evidence that metformin le d to excess use compared with other medications either in the window immediately after initiation or with chronic use. Over all, the higher use of endoscopy may simply reflect greater screening and prevention vigilance among these patients with a chronic di sease. No comparison is offered to rates among diabetics controlled with diet and exercise alone. Information About Metformin From Systematic Reviews Estimates for withdrawals related to inability to tolerate the drug in included trials are consistent with the meta -estimate in a recent systematic evidence review on management of obesity. The AHRQ Screening and Management of Obesity in Adults101 evidence review reported a risk ratio of 3.92 (95% CI, 1.23 to 12.57) for withdrawals in metformin- treated groups compared with placebo in trials aimed at weight loss and not diabetes management.101 The report likewise found excess complaints of gastrointestinal symptoms but was not able to quantify risk and noted that evidence about harms is insufficient to inform ca re. 101 Similar to the surveillance data, a Cochrane pooled analysis of comparative data from 347 trials found an upper limit of 4.3 cases of lactic acidosis per 100,000 patient -years among metformin -treated diabetic patients .102 The analysis indicated no s ignificant difference in mean treatment levels or net change from baseline for lactate for metformin users as compared with users of other therapies represented in the included trials.103 This review also notes that the only evidence for lactic acidosis as sociated with metformin use is based on approximately 330 cases reported in the literature.102 The 2011 AHRQ comparative effectiveness review (CER) Oral Diabetes Medications for Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: An Update104 included 140 trials with a meta -analysis. Across all data sources in their review, the reviewers concluded there was high grade evidence that metformin alone and in combination with other diabetes medications was associated with greater occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects than with o ther agents alone or in combinations that did not include metformin. Nonetheless the overall safety profile and effectiveness of metformin led to the conclusion that metformin was the first -line agent for initial management of type 2 diabetes. The authors take care to point out that even among trials for a chronic condition like type 2 diabetes, longer term surveillance for harms does not exceed 2 years. As in diabetes, women with abnormal bleeding might wish to consider chronic treatment and the literature to assess safety of continued use for any indication is scant. Within a number of reviews of oral diabetes agents 105,106 metformin is typically found to have a favorable safety profile when compared with other medications and is often noted to be first - line therapy in part for this reason. Relative safety in the context of other options for treating diabetes is not directly applicable to use for improving menstrual cycle regularity, however there are no physiologic reasons to expect that younger individua ls without diabetes would experience greater risk. 61 Harms Related to Exenatide Information About Exenatide From the Included Trial A single RCT in this review investigated exenatide, finding that alone it was less effective than metformin, but that when combined the results were superior to either agent alone for improving cycle regularity in women with PCOS.53 Exenatide is injected weekly and is generally administered as a second agent among those with diabetes that is insufficiently controlled on a single agent. The trial included in this review allocated women with PCOS to three groups: 1,000 mg of metformin twice daily, exenatide 10 mcg per day, or both. 53 Nausea, diarrhea, and bloating were more common in the arms taking metformin. No harm was more co mmon in the exenatide group except injection site pain or bruising which was de facto restricted to groups using exenatide. Comparisons across groups of 20 are underpowered to detect differential harms across groups or to detect more rare and potentially s erious harms. Information About Exenatide From FDA Documents and Package Insert The package insert for exenatide notes that hypoglycemia is a common adverse effect but does not specify what proportion of those prescribed the drug might experience low blood sugar. 107 Events that occurred in 2 percent or more of new users of exenatide when added to a regimen with metformin or a sulfonyl urea include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, feeling jittery, dizziness, headache, dyspepsia, asthenia which is a lack of stren gth or energy, gastroesophageal reflux, and increased sweating. Postmarketing experience includes reports of: ratio with concomitant warfarin use sometimes associated with bleeding; nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea resulting in dehydration; altered renal function, including increased serum creatinine; renal impairment; worsened chronic renal failure or acute renal failure (sometimes requiring hemodialysis); kidney transplant and kidney transplant dysfunction; and alopecia (Byetta Package Insert, 2011). 107 Information About Exenatide From Large Datasets Surveillance studies have all focused on acute pancreatitis which is suspected of being a rare but important side effect. Two analyses in large patient pools did not identify an association,108,109 while a third publication with data from the FDA post marketing surveillance database did see increased risk for both exenatide and another drug with similar but not ident ical mechanism, sitagliptin.110 The two claims -based analyses relied on large databases of health plan enrollees: The Ingenix Research Datamart108 and the Normative Health Information database.109 The first examined 27,966 individuals who began exenatide a nd 16,276 who started sitagliptin.108 During 1 year of followup, acute pancreatitis occurred in 0.13 percent of those on exenatide and 0.12 percent of those on sitagliptin. In adjusted models, relative to comparison cohorts within the health plan the relat ive risk of acute pancreat itis was 1.0 for both groups with confidence bounds from 0.6 to 1.7 and 0.5 to 2.0 respectively. The second analysis included 25,719 new users of exenatide compare to 234,536 new users of other diabetes medications. 109 The groups differed in important ways including more obesity and concomitant diabetes medications among those using exenatide. In adjusted models to control for these and other factors, there was no increase in use 62 for current or recent use but an elevation in risk f or past use. This was compared with a matched case- control analysis that found no association for any category of current, recent, or past use. This is compatible with those with past use having unknown additional comorbidity or discontinuing use because of other serious health events. The authors conclude overall there was not increased risk of pancreatitis among those taking exenatide. The FDA surveillance data compared adverse events for exenatide to those for other drugs in the database. 110 They found t he odds of being on exenatide were more than 10- fold higher than the control drug for pancreatitis . Pancreatic cancer was almost 3- fold higher. The sole control for confounding was the use of those on other drugs in the registry as a comparator. The author s note that the FDA data is limited by incomplete data and reporting bias ; notably they lack information about obesity and individual behaviors such as alcohol use and the risk models are not adjusted for these confounders. Information About Exenatide From Systematic Reviews Systematic reviews of diabetes medications (including the AHRQ report above on obesity treatment101), a detailed CER conducted by the United Kingdom's National Health Service, and a Cochrane analysis including exenatide, reveal gastroin testinal issues, particularly nausea and vomiting, and hypoglycemia as the most commonly observed side effects observed in those initiating therapy with this agent. 101,111,112 Harms Related to Progestogens Information About Progestogens From Included Tria ls A single RCT included in this review investigated progest ogen use for improving cycle regularity.49 The two agents used in this comparative effectiveness trial were 20 mg of oral dydrogesterone, each day for 10 days, or 90 mg of micronized progesterone gel vaginally every other day for 10 days. The authors' intent was to demonstrate that both oral and vaginal administration improved cycle control which was the case compared with baseline. However power calculations did not indicate the equivalence band d esired and the overall study was small (n=69). They report the only adverse events experienced were in the micronized vaginal progesterone gel group and included one episode each of groin pain, ovarian cyst, and 5- kg weight gain. These events were too rare given the small study size to meaningfully assert comparability or excess of harms between groups. Six patients in each treatment group withdrew from the study (reasons not give n), suggest ing there was not a large discrepancy in willingness to stay on study drug. Eight studies of treatments for abnormal cyclic bleeding (KQ1B) included a progestogen as a comparator. MPA was a comparator in three studies, 60,62,79 one of which included DMPA as a third comparison arm.62 Five studies compared LNG -IUS, TXA, an NSAID, or the contraceptive vaginal ring to norethisterone64,70,74,80,84 and one of these studies also included a third arm using the progesterone -impregnated intrauterine coil as a comparator.74 Harms reported with this class of drug include: breakthrough secretions; cholestatic jaundice, breast tenderness and rrhea; skin of urticaria, pruritus, edema and generalized rash; acne, alopecia and hirsutism; studies reviewed were small and 63 did not systematic ally compare adverse events across interventions groups. In all but one case , progestogens were a comparator that was hypothesized and found to perform less well tha n the intervention under study. The one exception was a direct comparison of two routes of delivery discussed above.49 We consider COCs and the LNG -IUS in their own section. Information About Progestogens From FDA Documents and Package Inserts We have summarized information for progest ogen only methods included in this review. The label for Crinone, the progesterone vaginal gel, reports adverse events seen in the three clinical studies for secondary amenorrhea in women taking either 4- percent or 8 -percent strength Crinone along with estrogen and occurring in 5 percent or more of women.114 These are given as: abdominal pain (5% in patients taking 4% strength, 9% in patients respiratory tract infection (5%, 8%); and pr uritu s in genital area (2%, 6%). 114 The package insert for vaginal progesterone gel includes a warning that \"physicians should be alert to the earliest manifestations of thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis, cerebrovasc ular disorders, pulmonary embolism, and retinal thrombosis).\" 114 This profile of complaints is similar among smaller groups of women who receive the drug as part of treatment for infertility care. One of the specific agents studied among women with irregul ar menses, dydrogest erone, is not available in the United States. This compound has been associated with risk of onset of acute porphyria. Porphyria is a genetic condition in which individuals have a range of severities of defects in the enzyme pathways th at produce heme. The insert advises prescribing only for compelling reasons. Our review team does not find evidence that other progestogens are associated with acute onset of porphyria symptoms. The DMPA label 115 includes a warning to women who may become pregnant while using the drug or find themselves exposed to the drug during the first 4 months of pregnancy regarding the risk of hypospadias; the risk of hypospadias, usually 5 to 8 per 1,000 male births in the general population, may be approximately doubled with exposure to these drugs. 115 Additionally, there have been undesirable effects at the site of injection, such as residual lump, change in skin color, or sterile abscess. 115 Information about Progestogens from Large Datasets The specific compounds used for irregular uterine bleeding or abnormal cycle bleeding were not addressed in large surveillance studies or in systematic review that compiled information about harms separate from their inclusion in COCs with the exception of DMPA and norethindrone in progestin- only pills . As noted, we did not attempt to review the surveillance literature related to harms of oral contraceptives or specific progestogens in COCs. We did however seek large scale primary studies related to harms of progest ogen -only form ulations such as DMPA. Four studies, one conducted in Europe, one in Turkey, and two in Africa, described harms associated with DMPA. 117-120 A single cross -cutting study of contraceptive risks included norethindrone -alone pills.121 A Danish case- control s tudy that included 64,548 women with fractures indicated an association with DMPA use ( OR=1.44; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.06) ; this however was not adequately controlled for factors that may confound the relationship, such as the potentially increased use of 64 DMPA among smokers or those with lower body mass index which are both also associated with fracture risk.118 A study in South Africa evaluated bone density in 3,487 black, reproductive -age women using injectable progestogens as contraception and reported decrea sed bone density by measurement of heel bone density; this effect was reversible within 2 to 3 years of discontinuing the injected progestogen across age categories of users.119 These findings are compatible with data from smaller studies which they review well in their publication. DMPA has been associated in observational studies with deep venous thrombosis .117 However, other work comparing those who use medications for menorrhagia has documented increased risk among women who use TXA, mefenamic acid, an d norethisterone, suggesting that the increased risk of thrombosis may be an example of confounding by indication. Such confounding suggests that the reason for which the medication is administered itself increases risk of the adverse outcomes. 122 In a com prehensive study of 9,262 DMPA users in Turkey conducted between 1996 and 2004, deep vein thrombosis was not observed.120 The most common adverse effects reported were menstrual disturbances (80%), weight gain (10%), bloating, breast pain, headache, mood c hange, and sexual difficulties (each reported by more than 1%). More than one -third of women discontinued the method with the most common reasons for discontinuing other than desiring to conceive being irregular menses and side effects. A 2012 publication about hormonal contraceptive methods and risk of thrombotic stroke and myocardial infarction, estimated risk based on person- years of exposure to specific contraceptive methods in a cohort of 15 years duration. 121 In a total of 85,874 women- years of observ ation, norethindrone progestin- only pills were not statistically significantly associated with increased risk of either stroke or myocardial infarction. Information About Progestogens From Systematic Reviews A Cochrane review examining the use of progestog ens for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding found that progestogens had a generally better side effect profile than danazol, with lower incidence of side effects such as headache, weight gain, and skin changes; however, breast changes were relatively more common in the progestogens group. 123 In the context of evaluating progest ogen- only pills for contraception, another Cochrane review found inter -cycle bleeding and cycle irregularity to be some of the most common reasons for treatment discontinuation represented in included trials. 124 Harms Related to COCs Information About COCs From Included Trials Our review included six RCTs examining COC use in women with abnormal uterine bleeding.50, 59, 61, 68, 82, 83 Due to the low power of these three medium sized RCTs and three small RCTs for detecting adverse events, reports of potential harms in these publications are largely limited to descriptive text rather than quantitative comparisons. Among women with irregular menses only (KQ1A), one study treated patients with COCs. Davis and colleagues 50 assessed a triphasic pill in which the estrogen was ethinyl estradiol and the progestogen was norgestimate. Their trial randomly assigned 201 women to the oral contracepti ve arm or a placebo. Authors do not provide detailed description of adverse events, noting that the incidence was low and comparable between the two groups. Four women in the COC group and three in the placebo group discontinued use after adverse events. S ixteen percent 65 of those on active drug and 19 percent of those receiving placebo withdrew prior to completion of the trial. Two trials assessing the use of estradiol valerate and dienogest in women with abnormal cyclic uterine bleeding (KQ1B) each found t hat 9 to 10 percent of women discontinued therapy with the COC regimen due to side effects.82,83 The type and incidence of adverse effects noted in these two studies of estradiol valerate and dienogest are similar to those noted in the package insert for t his combination. 125 The trial examining therapy with ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone acetate reported that five women discontinued the study due to adverse events (approximately 25%), noting that the most comment events included intermenstrual bleeding , menstrual disorder, and headache. 61 The two studies involving use of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel did not describe potential harms associated with treatment failure, other than noting the incidence of treatment failure. 59,68 Information About CO Cs From FDA Documents and Package Inserts The package inserts are similar for all combined estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive pills. The warning for combined pills notes : Cigarette smoking increases risk of serious cardiovascular events from combined oral contraceptive (COC) use. This risk increases with age particularly in wome n over 35 years of age and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COC's should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke. 126-128 Other serious harms associated with COCs include thrombophlebitis and hypertension, gallbladder disease and benign liver tumors. A complete listing of package insert adverse events for this and other oral contraceptive s reviewed in this report is included in Appendix N . Package inserts do not generally include information about the expected population incide nce of these harms. The majority of primary care providers and many women are aware of the most serious risks of COCs and of more common side effects such as edema, nausea, vomiting, skin changes, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Among more common side effec ts are also changes in cycle characteristics themselves including spotting/breakthrough bleeding, lack of menses, and change in characteristics of menstrual flow. Adverse events for specific COCs studied for heavy menstrual bleeding in this review include Nordette -28 \u00ae (0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel). The package insert reports based on data from case control studies, the relative risk for superficial venous thrombosis is three times higher in users of the COC compared with nonusers; the risk of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism is 4 to 11 times higher, and 1.5 to 6 times higher in women predisposed to venous thromboembolic disease. 127 The incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulm onary embolism for users of low -dose (i.e., less than 0.05 mg ethinyl estradiol) COCs is up to 4 per 10,000 woman- years compared with 0.5 to 3 per 10,000 woman- years for nonusers, although this risk is less than the risk associated with pregnancy ( 6 per 10,000 woman- years).127 A large postmarketing study noted that the Nordette label information reports a relative risk of thrombotic strokes ranging from 3 for normotensive users to 14 in women with severe hypertension. The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for 66 nonsmokers using oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users, and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension . 127 Label information on estradiol valerate and dienogest (Natazia\u00ae) reports two cases of myocardial infarction and two cases of rupture ovarian cyst from clinical trials, along with known serious risk of other cardiovascular events, vascular events, and liver disease (the estimated attributable risk of liver adenomas is 3.3 cases per 100,000 COC users). 125 In clinical studies of the drug, 11.4 percent of women discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, most commonly: menstrual disorder (metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, menstruation irregular, genital hemorrhage, vaginal hemorrhage, dysfunctional uterine bleeding ; 2.3%); mood changes (depression, mood swings, mood altered, depressed mood, dysthymic disorder, crying ; 1.2%); acne (1.1%), headache (including migraines ; 1.1% ), About COCs From Large Datasets More than a hundred publications about harms (and preventive effects) of COCs are available and full review w as beyond the scope of this review. The systematic review s featured below include contemporary pills formulations and their harms. Information About COCs From Systematic Reviews Two recent systematic reviews have identified significant increased risk of de ep venous thrombosis among users of oral contraceptives, though the size of risk varied significantly among different COC regimens and appeared lowest for agents containing levonorgestrel or norgestimate. 129,130 One Cochrane review has evaluated the potent ial association between COC use and weight gain, finding insufficient evidence to make conclusions and noting the likelihood that there is no large association between COCs and increased weight during therapy. 131 Other Cochrane reviews have assessed the relative efficacy and safety of various oral contraceptive regimens; these reviews note variability in the type and incidence of adverse events among included studies and comment that adverse event reporting among these studies was generally of lower quality than expected, recommending better tracking of side effects in future studies as well as systematic capture of patient reasons for treatment discontinuation. 132-135 One of these reviews found that the incidence of discontinuation due to side effects was l ower in triphasic - treated patients as compared with their monophasic -treated counterparts.134 The one Cochrane review assessing the use of COCs in the setting of heavy menstrual bleeding identified only one small crossover trial, which did not include desc ription of adverse events. 36 Harms Related to Cabergoline Information About Cabergoline From Included Trials A single exploratory study, with 29 participants among whom 14 had PCOS and 15 were normal controls, randomly assigned 16 women to cabergoline and 13 to placebo for 4 months.55 The authors did not report adverse events and all women completed the trial. 67 Information About Cabergoline From Package Insert The package insert for this drug intended to treat elevated prolactin levels provides data about the risk of side effects in comparison to placebo in a 4- week study and compared with bromocriptine which is another medication for prolactinoma treatment.136 In Table 21 we summarize the incidence of cabergoline side effects that occurred in more than 5 percent of those on the drug, as well as 4 week experience of side effects among individuals on placebo. We did not identify large dataset analyses aimed at sur veillance for harms. Table 21. Side effects reported in cabergoline trials Side Effect (% participants experiencing) Placebo at 4 Weeks Cabergoline at 4 Weeks Cabergoline at 8 weeks Nausea 20 27 29 Headache 25 26 26 Dizziness 5 15 17 Asthenia 10 9 6 Constipation 0 10 7 Abdominal pain 5 5 5 Somnolence 5 5 2 Fatigue 0 7 5 Depression 5 3 3 Hot flashes 5 1 3 Dyspepsia 0 2 5 Information About Cabergoline From Large Datasets One harms surveillance study using the U .S. Adverse Event Reporting System Database 137and two analyses done with data from the UK General Practice Research Database 138,139 have linked drugs typically used to treat Parkinson's disease, including cabergoline, to risk of harms. Comparing cabergoline , an ergot derived drug, to nonergot derived drugs, or no medication, these descriptive studies report new cardiac valve regurgitation occurred almost 5 times more often among those receiving cabergoline in the UK case control study 137 and more than 100- fold more often in the U nited States adverse events registry.137 The latter publication followed the former which may have raised awareness and amplified reporting. The research team using United S tates data also reported increased odds of other forms of noncardiac fibrotic reaction in the pleura, retroperitoneal spaces, and lungs. Most recently, cabergoline in the UK database was link with doubling of heart failure risk. 139 Notably these populations are substantially older and highly likely to have a specific comorbidity (Parkinson's) which may also modify risk and which makes estimation of risk in other groups infeasible. No direct surveillance data is available to inform estimation of risk in reproduct ive-age women . Information About Cabergoline From Systematic Reviews Several systematic reviews have explored the safety and efficacy of cabergoline for treatment of a range of conditions. Two Cochrane reviews on ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and restless leg syndrome, respectively, each assessed a small pool of available trials, finding no significant difference in overall incidence of adverse events between cabergoline and comparators. 140,141 A meta -analysis use among indi viduals with Parkinson's disease found a relative risk of 6.38 (95% CI, 3.17 to 12.81) for moderate to severe valvular regurgitation 142; a similar analysis of cabergoline use in hyperprolactinemia also found a significant increase in risk of valve regurgit ation, though this echocardiographic finding in this 68 patient population was clinically asymptomatic in all patients and participants were certain to be older and more frail than women who would use the treatment for irregular uterine bleeding.143 Harms Related to Lifestyle and Behavioral Interventions Information Across Sources for Diet and Exercise The single RCT of diet and exercise intervention was conducted in teens with irregular menses and did not identify adverse effects.56 One acupuncture trial included 34 women randomized to a walking regimen who reported no adverse events or injuries.57 However it is important not to assume that lifestyle and behavioral interventions such as diet and exercise are without risks. The U.S. P reventive Services Task Force report on Screening and Management of Obesity in Adults 101 provides a clear and succinct description of the potential harms stating: Possible harms that could accrue from [these] interventions include bone loss and increased fracture risk, injuries from increased physical activity, decreased self-esteem from being labeled as obese or failure to lose weight, use of extreme or unhealthy dietary approaches, and weight cycling. 101 Harms Related to Acupuncture Information Across So urces for Acupuncture One study of acupuncture, that compared two strategies for selecting placemen of needles, did not discuss harms or withdrawals.58 The other RCT reports only local redness or hematomas occurring in 10 percent of those receiving acupunc ture in 14 sessions over 16 weeks.57 Two of 33 women in the acupuncture group reported other side effects which were dizziness and nausea, while the exercise and no intervention control group did not report any events. A number of Cochrane reviews have ex plored the use of acupuncture for treatment of a variety of women's health issues, ranging from dysmenorrhea to endometriosis -related pain to induction of labor; across the board, these reviews found that potential harms of acupuncture have not been well s tudied and are often omitted from trial reports completely, noting that investigation of possible adverse effects is an important consideration for future research involving this therapeutic approach. 144-147 Harms Related to LNG -IUS Information About LNG -IUS From Included Trials One trial did not provide any information about harms or adverse effects.59 Two trials stated that there were no serious adverse effects related to either treatment.64,65 In one trial with 39 participants, one participant discontinued LNG -IUS therapy (5%) and five participants discontinued cyclic COC (26%).61 One trial reported side effects in a table without comparative statistics.63 One trial (n=165) reported that no deaths or drug -related serious adverse events occurred during the study.60 Six participants in the LNG -IUS group (7%) and two in the oral MPA group (2%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events.60 The LNG -IUS was expelled in four participants (5% ); two other participants had the LNG -IUS removed due to adverse effects.60 No uterine perforations or pregnancies were observed during the study.60 Other treatment -emergent 69 adverse events reported during the study and occurring in at least 5 percent of women in any treatment group were reported in a table with out comparative statistics. One trial reported 242 adverse events among 51 participants , with 158 in the LNG -IUS group and 84 in the mefenamic acid group.63 The LNG -IUS was expelled in two participants (8%); one of these had chlamydial endometritis.63 Information About LNG -IUS From FDA Documents and Package Insert In October 2009, the prescription label for the LNG -IUS available in the United States was updated though a process with the FDA.148 This revision was made for the new indication: treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding for women who choose to use intrauterine contraception as their method of contraception.149 According to the package insert, the most common (i.e., more than 10 percent ) adverse reactions reported in clinical trials of uterine/vaginal (12.8%), and ovarian cysts (12%). 148 The data provided reflect the experience with the use of Mirena brand LNG -IUS in th e adequate and well -controlled studies for contraception (n=2,339) and heavy menstrual bleeding (n=80). For the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding indication (n=80), the subjects included women aged 26 to 50 with confirmed heavy bleeding and exposed for a median of 183 treatment days of Mirena (range, 7 to 295 days). The adverse reactions seen across the two indications overlapped, and are reported using the frequencies from the contraception studies. The less common (i.e., between 5% and 9% of users) adverse (4.9%), and IUD expulsion (4.9%). Other relevant adverse reactions occurring in fewer than 5 pe rcent of subjects include nausea, nervousness, vulvovaginitis, dysmenorrhea, back pain, weight increase, decreased libido, cervicitis/Papanicolaou smear Information About the LNG -IUS From Large Datasets Large scale surveillance for harms provides important information to patients to assure informed decisions about risks. This data inc ludes information about complications with insertion. In the New Zealand monitoring system which includes 3,519 insertions, difficult insertions occurred in 3.6 percent of procedures and w ere not well predicted by nulliparous status of noncontraceptive use of the IUD. Pain on insertion occurred for 1 percent of patients and 0.5 percent of attempts to insert could not be completed. 151,152 Uterine perforation rates in three large datasets ranged from 0.9 to 2.6 cases per 1,000.151,153,154 Authors of each of t hese studies, as well as those of another report from four national pharmacovigilance centers in Europe confirm, that perforations may not consistently be associated with painful insertions and that only a small portion (less than 10%) are recognized at the time of the insertion. 155 In surveillance data, the LNG -IUS in not associated with increased risk of deep vein thrombosis ,117 including in more than 8 million women- years of observation among Danish women.156 The anecdotally reported complaint of hair loss is supported by a single study in New Zealand by surveying women in the national registry. They found five cases of alopecia (two recovered, one not, and two still unknown) and estimated incidence to be 1.8 per 1,000 users. 153 70 A 2012 publication about hormonal contraceptive methods and risk of thrombotic stroke and myocardial infarction, estimated risk based on person- years of exposure to specific contraceptive methods in a cohort of 15 years duration.121 In a total of 184,875 women- years of observation, the LNG -IUS was not statistically significantly associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, and appeared, relative to women not using hormonal methods, to offer protection from stroke (RR=0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.98). Information About the LNG -IUS From Systematic Reviews Systematic reviews report adverse events similar to those noted in the package insert,148 with weight gain, bloating, acne, nausea and breast pain as the most commonly observed side effects . These systematic reviews also comment on the risk of spontaneous device expulsion, reporting an incidence of 5 to 16 percent .157-159 Harms Related to Contraceptive Vaginal Ring Information About Contraceptive Vaginal Ring From Included Trials The vaginal ring was used in a single study in this review as a treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding and was found to be similar in effectiveness to oral norethisterone.84 The contraceptive vaginal ring provides a steady release of 15 mcg of ethinyl est radiol and 120 mcg of etonogestrel daily and is used vaginally for 3 weeks per cycle and then removed for 1 week. Following three cycles of treatment, this study reported that the incidence of nausea, headache, and breast tenderness was comparable in both treatment groups. The contraceptive vaginal ring users were less likely to report breakthrough bleeding than the women taking norethisterone. No ring expulsions were reported. Local events, including vaginal discomfort, vaginitis, foreign body sensation an d coital problems were reported more frequently in ring -users, but no one discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Information About Contraceptive Vaginal Ring F rom FDA Documents and Package Insert The package insert lists the most common harms reported by 5 to 14 percent of women in clinical trials including vaginitis, headache, upper respiratory infection, vaginal secretion, sinusitis, nausea, and weight gain. 160 The adverse events leading to discontinuation of trea tment in 1 to 2.5 percent of women include device -related events (e.g., foreign body sensation, coital problems, and expulsion), vaginal symptoms, headache, emotional lability, and weight gain. The package insert also warns against use of the vaginal contr aceptive ring in cigarette -smokers over age 35. Information About Contraceptive Vaginal Ring From Large Data Sets We identified three studies reporting data on harms from large studies of contraceptive vaginal ring users.121,161,162 A 15 -year Danish cohort study that included over 38,000 person- years of vaginal ring use reported an elevated adjusted relative risk of 2.5 (95% CI, 1.4 to 4.4) for thrombotic stroke and 2.1 (95% CI, 0.7 to 6.5) for myocardial infarction compared with wom en (over 9 million person- years) who had not used hormonal contraception. 121 In an observational study of over 2,500 Swiss women, 20 percent (n=539) of contraceptive vaginal ring users reported 753 adverse events. The most common harms were changes in mens trual bleeding pattern (2.3%), vaginal discomfort (2.2%), leucorrhea (2.1%), mood disorders (2.0%) 71 and headache (1.9%).161 This profile is similar to data from a German open label study of the acceptability of the contraceptive vaginal ring in which 431 of 5,823 (7.4%) of women discontinued use for side effects over six cycles of use. In the full cohort, 9.9% of women experienced symptoms classified as adverse events with the most common being bleeding pattern, headache (including migraine),and acne. 162 The research team reports 19 women (<0.3%) has serious adverse events each of which was an isolated event, other than dizziness which was reported by two women. Information About Contraceptive Vaginal Ring From Systematic Reviews A recently published review of the contraceptive vaginal ring summarized adverse events from three large trials.163 The number of women using the contraceptive vaginal ring in these three studies ranged from 499 to 2,322. Over one half of the women (58 to 66%) reported at least one a dverse event and 29 to 38 percent of these were possibly related to the contraceptive. The most frequent complaints were headache (5.8 to 7.2%), ring -related (4.4 to 6.8%), vaginitis (3.9 to 5.6%), (3.2 to 4.8%), and nausea (0.8 to 3.2%). Betwee n 11 and 14 percent of women discontinued use of the contraceptive vaginal ring due to adverse events. Two women in one study had deep vein thrombosis. Hypertension was reported in four women (0.8%) in a single study. A study that investigated the effects of the device on lipid profiles reported increases in triglycerides and sex hormone binding globulin levels but total cholesterol was unchanged. Another systematic review of COCs and bone health included one small cohort study of contraceptive vaginal ring users, noting no change in bone mineral density from baseline for the vaginal ring users compared with an increase in bone density among the control group of nonhormone users. 164 A recently published systematic review examining thrombotic risks of oral contraceptives included data from studies of the contraceptive vaginal ring.165 The risk of venous thromboembolism for the contraceptive vaginal ring was elevated and similar to COCs containing ethinyl estradiol and gestodene (5.6-fold or ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone (6.3 -fold increase). 165 Harms Related to NSAID s Information About NSAIDs From Included Trials Three trials did not provide any information about harms or adverse effects.68,73,74 Two trials reported there were no serious side effects.75,77 Another trial reported treatment discontinuation among one person receiving mefenamic acid and one person receiving norethisterone after the third cycle. 70 A table of adverse events was presented in this study with no comparative statistics, though abdominal pain was reported in 18 percent and 20 percent of both mefenamic acid and norethisterone groups. In one trial , 63 there were 242 adverse events noted wi th 158 in the LNG -IUS group and 84 in the mefenamic acid group. There were two significant adverse events in this study, one with hypertension in a patient with a history of hypertension, and one with chlamydia endometriosis resulting in LNG -IUS expulsion. Of note, a smaller proportion of patients reported abdominal pain with mefenamic acid (7.7%) compared with LNG -IUS (32 .0%), though significance was not reported in the table of adverse events. 72 In another trial ,66 a total of 18 patients stopped treatment including three of 23 taking mefenamic acid due to poor efficacy or an unwanted event such as nausea, headache , and dizziness. One trial77 reported nausea and gastrointestinal disturbances in nine (16.4%) and eight (14.5%) and leg cramps in seven (12.7%) and 12 (21.8%) cases among those receiving TXA and TXA with mefenamic acid, respectively. One small crossover trial reported no treatment discontinuations,71 however, patients receiving TXA reported nausea, dizziness, numbness, restless legs , and headache . Vomiting and difficulty swallowing was reported by three women in the TXA group. Patients receiving flurbiprofen reported tiredness, stomach pains , and nausea. In one trial ,67 one person discontinued mefenamic acid due to severe skin rash and itching and in another trial ,69 one person on mefenamic acid complained of gastritis. In another trial ,72 one patient had epigastric distress and four patients had nausea and vomiting on m eclofenamate. However, the severity of dysmenorrhea (p<0.006), backache (p<0.02), and headache (p<0.002) were significantly less for patients taking meclofenamate than placebo . There was no difference in nausea or vomiting. One trial75 reported any side ef fects in 18 patients taking naproxen and in 15 patients taking mefenamic acid . Thirteen patients taking naproxen experienced gastrointestinal symptoms ( i.e., nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and anorexia) compared with six taking mefenamic acid. Central nervous system symptoms ( i.e., light headedness, dizziness, tiredness, and headache) were reported by patients receiving mefenamic acid (n=6) and naproxen (n=5) . One trial76 reported no significant differences in nausea, depression, breast symptoms , and other symptoms between mefenamic acid and placebo. However there was significant reductions in abdominal pain (p<0.001), headache (p<0.001) , and diarrhea (p<0.008) among those taking mefenamic acid compared with placebo. Information About NSAIDs From F DA Documents and Package Inserts As a class, NSAIDs carry a risk of serious harms from cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal effects, and hepatic effects, along with gastrointestinal ulceration, bleeding and perforation. Al l drugs in this class have a boxed warning for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risk. Upper gastrointestinal ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1 percent of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 t o 4 percent of patients treated for 1 year, with trends continuing with longer duration of continuous use. 166-168 Labels note that even short -term therapy is not without risk with this drug class. In general, NSAIDs have been commonly associated with harms including edema , abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia/heartburn, elevated flatulence, gastrointestinal bleeding , nausea, vomiting , body weight changes , headache, nervousness and other manifestations of central nervous system stimulation (e.g., anxiety, insomnia, increased reflexes, tremor) , symptoms associated with central nervous system inhibition (e.g., amnesia, asthenia, depression, malaise, vision, , tinnitus , and signs and symptoms suggesting urinary tract infection. More harms information on specific drugs is limited in the package inserts, for many of the reasons given in the above discussion. In controlled studies of meclofenamate, approximately 4 percent of the patients had diarrhea severe enough to require discontinuation of the drug . 167 See Appendix M for more complete information from individual package inserts. 73 Information About NSAIDs From Systematic Reviews A pooled analysis of trials in a systematic review of NSAIDs fo r the treatment of dysmenorrhea found that mild neurological and gastrointestinal adverse events reported at significantly greater frequency by those receiving NSAIDs as compared with those receiving placebo. 169 Another recent review underscores the risk of various gastrointestinal complaints and notes that the cardiovascular effects of the traditional NSAIDs are poorly unders tood and warrant further research;103 an increased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction was also observed in a recent systematic review and meta- analysis.170 Harms Related to TXA Information About TXA From Included Trials Within studies included in our review, similar numbers of participants withdrew from TXA and placebo or other treatment groups .78,79 No thrombotic events were reported in the participants treated with TXA and no deaths occurred during the study. Serious adverse events reported in the TXA groups of trials included allergic reactions, headaches, and other symptoms such as tachycardia, acute bronchitis, hypoglycemia, and posttraumatic stress disorder, the la tter judged to be unrelated to study treatment. There was no significant difference in the percentage of side effects rep orted, comparing TXA to placebo. In particular, the frequency of gastrointestinal- related adverse events was similar between groups. In another trial ,66 a total of 18 patients stopped treatment including four of 26 taking TXA due to poor efficacy or an unwanted event such as nausea, headache , and dizziness. One included trial had no withdrawals or side effects reported ,71 another reported no serious adverse effect s.80 Information about TXA from FDA Documents and Package Insert The companies , Xanodyne Pharm aceuticals and Ferring Pharmaceuticals, that manufacture TXA (Lysteda\u00ae) received FDA approval after submitting research findings and other data in 2009. The manufacturer conducted two placebo -controlled randomized trials; the second of which has been published.78 The first trial randomized 304 women and compared two doses of TXA (1 ,950 mg and 3,900 mg daily for up to 5 days during each menstrual period) versus placebo over three cycles .171 The data provided to the FDA for safety included these two pragmatic cluster RCTs and two uncontrolled phase three trials, and a single QT -interval phase two study. In total, these five studies described 12,169 treatment cycles, but among them only 234 women received the current recommended therapeutic dose of the medication. 172 Overall, the nature and number of adverse events did not raise any significant safety concerns. There were no venous thromboembolic events in subjects taking TXA . There were no adverse effects on vision or ocular safety concerns. There was no effect on the QT -interval. No drug- drug interactions studies were conducted. The total number of subjects in clinical trials who received TXA was considered low for evaluation of harms and drug safety. The FDA also reviewed evidence from a database for a different formulation of TXA that included 40 cases of possible venous thromboembolism over 5 years (none in the United States), with 40 percent of these events occurring with intravenous use of the drug, and for indications other than heavy menstrual bleeding. 171 The review utilized by the FDA also documented associated instances of retinal venous and arterial occlusion and ligneous conjunctivitis.171 In April 2011, the prescription label and package insert for the formulation of TXA available in the United States was updated.171 According to the current label, the most common adverse 74 reactions reported in clinical trials of TXA were headache (50.4%), n asal and sinus symptoms (25.4%), pain (19.8%), musculoskeletal (6%), anemia (5.6%), and fatigue (5.2%); comparative statistics between active drug and p lacebo were not provided. 171 Information About TXA From Large Data Sets We identified a single large surveillance study using the General Practice Database from the United Kingdom.122 The case- control analysis of deep vein thrombosis reported increased od ds of TXA use among cases (OR =3.20; 95% CI , 0.65 to 15.78) and note lack of precision of the estimates based on sparse use of the medication. This report , examining drugs used for heavy menstrual bleeding , found that all common treatments for menorrhagia w ere associated with deep vein thrombosis risk and raised the question of confounding by indication, meaning that characteristics of the women being treated (abnormal bleeding patterns) rather than the drugs themselves might be the causal component. 122 Based on U nited States and worldwide postmarketing reports, the following have been reported in patients receiving TXA for various indications: nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; allergic skin reactions; anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reactions; impaired color vision and other visual disturbances; dizziness; and thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute renal cortical necrosis, and central retinal artery and vein obstruction). 171 There postmarketing reports of venous and arterial thrombotic events included women who had used TXA concomitantly with combined hormonal contraceptives. In consideration of the information reviewed, the FDA issued contra -indications and precautions for TXA use, advising cli nicians not to prescribe TXA to women known to have the following conditions: active thromboembolic disease (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or cerebral thrombosis); a history of thrombosis or thromboembolism, including retinal vein or arte ry occlusion; intrinsic of thrombosis or thromboembolism thrombogenic valvular disease, thrombogenic cardiac rhythm disease, or hypercoagulopathy). Four precautions are noted: ( 1) concomitant therapy with tissue plasminogen activators may decrease the efficacy of both medications; ( 2) the risk of venous thromboembolism and arterial thromboses may increase further when hormonal contraceptives are administered with TXA, of particular concern in women who are obese or smoke cigarettes, especiall y smokers over 35 years of age; ( 3) TXA is not recommended for women taking either Factor IX complex concentrates or anti -inhibitor coagulant concentrates because the risk of thrombosis may be increased; ( 4) patients should be instructed to report visual a nd ocular symptoms promptly and the medication should be stopped pending a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including dilated retinal examination, to exclude the possibility of retinal venous or arterial occlusion. 171 Information About TXA From Systematic R eviews A 2012 review of the efficacy of TXA in treating heavy menstrual bleeding is compatible with this review, finding mild to moderate adverse effec ts reported in included studies .173 Gastrointestinal effects were most common , and there were no reports of thromboembolic events in the 10 studies evaluated.173 A Cochrane review conducted a combined analysis of the efficacy and safety of TXA and ethamsylate as antifibrinolytics used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding; emphasizing the short duration of the included studies, they comment that no increase in adverse events was observed with use of these agents. 174 Two systematic reviews of TXA use in orthopedic surgery recently found no increased risk of thrombotic events in their pooled data 75 analyses.175,176 It is important to note that the trials included in these reviews are similar to those in this review in that they are underpowered to detect rare but impor tant harms. Harms Related to Decision Aids There are no harms associated with using decision aids other than time invested by patient and clinician if the decision aid does not effectively inform patients about important care options. Summary Pharmaceutical agents, procedures and devices, and even diet and exercise have potential complications. While contraceptive methods have typically been well -characterized in the broadly applicable population of reproductive -age women, there may be characteristics assoc iated with abnormal bleeding that modify the risk profile of these interventions when restricted to women with indications related to AUB. Women and their care providers will need to weigh individual risk profiles, desire for contraception, and treatment s trategies in order to balance symptom management with minimization of risk, especially when choosing medications that are less well -studied in this population, such as those used for diabetes management. 76 Discussion Key Findings State of the Literature We identified 1 ,775 nonduplicate publications through the search process, with 219 proceeding to full -text review (Figure 2). We included 41 publications that reported on 39 separate randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) and 12 types of interventions. These s tudies evaluated the levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine system (LNG -IUS; 7 studies ),59-65 the vaginal ring (1 study),84 nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs ; 13 studies ),67-70,72-76 acid (TXA ; 7 studies),66,71,77-81 combined oral contraceptives ),50,59,61,68,82,83 changes ( 1 study ),56 and patient decis ion aids (3 studies )86,87,177 using at least one comparator or placebo arm. A number of these studies compared the intervention of primary interest to a progestogen, such as medroxyprogesterone (MPA).49,60,62,64,70,74,79,80 These studies were not considered important contributions to evidence about the effectiveness of progestogens for treatment since in each case the hypothesis was that the progestogen would be inferior or equivalent to the intervention being studied. Though we report the outcomes for progest ogen comparisons to other interventions we have not separately summarized the effectiveness of progestogens. One trial evaluated two routes of progestogen and was treated as a study evaluating progest ogen for symptom management. 49 The quality of the included studies tended to be fair (10 studies)51,58,60,64,67,75,76,80,81,84 or poor (23 studies ).49,52-54,56,57,59,61-63,65,66,68-71,73,74,77,79,86,87,177 In part , this followed from the difficulty of blinding participants to intervention status. For instance , no LNG -IUS studies included sham insertion or a sham LNG -IUS string placement in the endocervical canal along with placebo medication in both groups, though t his would be required to achieve complete masking of intervention groups. Likewise it can be challenging to mask outcome assessors to group status when women and providers assess outcomes. An unmasked participant is counted in the scoring as an unmasked as sessor when the outcome is self -reported or self -collected. While this is rigorous and appropriate in the evaluation of risk of bias in RCTs, it may be an inappropriately strict criterion to apply for studies in which menstrual products are collected for m easurement of blood loss or in which biological markers such as hemoglobin or hematocrit levels are also assessed. Understanding this context can inform interpretation of the literature. Effectiveness of Interventions for Abnormal Bleeding Key Question 1A (KQ1A) . Management of Irregular Uterine Bleeding A number of available interventions suitable for use in primary care have preliminary evidence of effectiveness for improving the regularity of menses. Only metformin has demonstrated effectiveness in more t han one RCT with a total of 175 women with polycystic ovaries participating in each of three studies . One study suggests adding exenatide to metformin treatment can enhance effectiveness. No head -to-head comparison trials are available to inform choices am ong medication types for management of irregular uterine bleeding. 77 Progest ogens Vaginal micronized progesterone (8% gel) and oral dydro gesterone were studied in a single trial among women clinically classified as having dysfunctional uterine bleeding.49 In this RCT , both vaginal and oral administration improved cycle regularity with 92 percent and 85 percent of participants , respectively , achieving regular bleeding by the third cycle of use. Effects were comparable, but the trial was not powered to show equivalence or noninferiority. COCs A triphasic oral contraceptive was also studied in a single RCT among women with irregular uterine bleeding.50 This trial included women with both short and long intervals between bleeding episodes and with both heavy and normal amounts of bleeding. The outcomes are provided in aggregate and not presented by initial bleeding characteristics. Overall , 68 percent of women taking the COC achieved excellent or good cycle control compared with 26 percent of those receiving a pl acebo. Metformin and Exenatide Metformin was an active treatment arm in four RCTs conducted among women with polycystic ovari an syndrome (PCOS), two comparing outcomes to a placebo group,51,52 one comparing metformin with N -acetyl -cysteine,54 and one comparing metformin only, exenatide only, and both.53 In each case, metformin was effective for improving the regularity of bleeding over a number of months compared with baseline or placebo . When combined with exenatide the effect was greater than either alone in the study of 60 women with PCOS that compared all three approaches. 53 Cabergoline In a very preliminary investigation of this drug indicated for treatment of prolactinomas, cabergoline was associated with return of regular menses in three of eight women in the treated group compared with none of the six receiving placebo.55 All women in the study had PCOS and normal prolactin levels. Behavioral and Lifestyle Interventions Among adolescents with PCOS, both a low -fat, calorie -restricted diet and a carbohydrate - restricted diet in conjunction with 30 minutes of aerobic activity 3 days a week resulted in more regular menses among those who lost weight. 56 This single small study did not present outcomes by the diet group to which participants we re randomized. Presumably , there was not a clear difference, meaning there is no evidence to guide choice of dietary intervention. A single trial of acupuncture also included an exercise control group at the same intensity as the diet and exercise trial. 57 This group experienced a 42-percent improvement in regularity of menses. We did not find evidence comparing diet to exercise directly. Complementary and Alternative Medicine Two studies of acupuncture with different underlying hypotheses and different met hods (conventional acupuncture and low -frequency electroacupuncture) found benefit for a specific style of acupuncture when compared with no intervention or alternate placement of acupuncture needles.57,58 By 32 weeks in the trial of electroacupuncture for PCOS, women who received acupuncture had a 121 -percent improvement in cycle regularity while those who exercised only 78 had a 42- percent improvement which w as statistically comparable in this small trial.57 Both acupuncture and exercise were superior to placebo in this trial. In the trial of two differing placements of needles, women who received treatment for \"mind tranquilizing and menstruation promotion\" had greater improvements (no treatment failures among 21 women) compared with those receiving traditio nal placement (n= 16) for \"delayed menses\" among whom 19 percent did not have improvements. 58 KQ1B. Management of Abnormal Cyclic Bleeding The LNG -IUS, various NSAIDs , TXA, and COCs are effective for reducing the amount of menstrual bleeding and in some instances have been shown to have additional benefits . Each category of intervention is described below. LNG -IUS All seven studies of the LNG -IUS demonstrated that the intervention effectively reduced heavy menstrual bleeding.59-65 Evidence suggests the de vice reduces the volume and duration of bleeding, improves iron status, and is an acceptable alternative to hysterectomy for s ome women . In direct comparisons , the LNG -IUS was superior to COCs and NSAIDs at reducing menstrual blood loss (MBL). We did not f ind any studies that compared the LNG -IUS to TXA. Our analysis of LNG -IUS is consistent with prior systematic reviews. A 2001 systematic review of five RCTs reported mean MBL reductions were between 71 and 96 percent.178 A 2005 systematic review identified 10 RCTs comparing LNG -IUS with surgery or pharmaceutical treatments.157 The odds ratio for the proportion unwilling to continue with treatment was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.67) in favor of LNG -IUS. The odds ratio for proportion of women satisfied with tre atment was 2.13 (95% CI , 0.62 to 7.33).157 Contraceptive Vaginal Ring One study investigated the contraceptive vaginal ring finding that it was similar in effectiveness to norethisterone when taken orally three times a day for 21 days of each cycle. Overall more women were satisfied with the contraceptive vaginal ring and chose to continue use compared with women taking oral norethisterone . NSAIDs In a total of 13 studies, NSAIDs including mefenamic acid, naproxen, meclofenamate, and flurbiprofen, given at the onset of menses for up to 5 days reduce MBL by 20 to 49 percent.63,66- 77 Studies have evaluated use over one to six menstrual cycles. Our ana lysis of NSAIDs is consistent with a prior 2007 systematic review ; NSAIDs were more effective than placebo at reducing bleeding, but less effective than TXA or LNG -IUS.34 There were no differences in reductions between NSAIDs and oral progest ogens , COC, and an older progesterone - impregnated intrauterine system (Progestasert\u00ae). There were no differences seen between individual types of NSAIDs, specifically mefenamic acid and naproxen. The most recent study found similar reductions in pictorial blood loss ass essment chart scores when NSAIDs were combined with TXA compared with TXA alone. NSAIDs reduce MBL , but do not consistently reduce MBL to clinically meaningful levels (i.e., less than 80 ml) in all patients . There was considerable variability in response. Some patients had an increase in blood loss during treatment. NSAIDs do not regulate the pattern of menstruation nor provide contraception. NSAIDs do provide relief of dysmenorrhea. Therefore, for patients who desire both reduced 79 MBL and relief from dysmen orrhea, but not contraception, and who do not have contraindications, NSAIDs can be considered for up to five days during menses. TXA All seven RCTs of TXA demonstrate effectiveness of improving heavy bleeding .66,71,77-81 TXA at a dose of 1.95 to 4.5 g rams per day for 4 to 5 days from onset of bleeding meaningfully reduces MBL by 40 to 60 percent in studies lasting up to 1 year. Both biologic and self -reported symptoms of bleeding severity are improved. Our analysis of TXA is consistent with prior systematic reviews of another formulation of TXA. A 1995 systematic review pooled results from seven trials and found a reduction in MBL of 46.7 percent (95% CI, 47.9% to 51.6%) with TXA. 179 A 2004 systematic review and meta -analysis of two RCTs of TXA versus place bo reported a mean MBL difference of 93.96 ml (95% CI, 151.43 ml to 36.49 ml) in favor of TXA treatment.174 COCs Though the volume of RCT literature examining use of COCs in women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is somewhat small relative to the fr equency with which these agents are used as a first-line therapy in women presenting with AUB symptoms, our analysis indicates these agents are associated with decreases in AUB among treated women. All five RCTs of COCs for the indication of heavy cyclic m enstrual bleeding found benefit for reducing volume of menstrual bleeding . 59,61,68,82,83 Two studies also identified improvements in related laboratory values such as hematocrit and ferritin , 82,83 and one study also found significant improvement in patient rating of overall health.59 These findings are consistent with the 2010 American Co ngress of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommendations , which note that com bined hormonal contraceptives are a \"reasonable option for initial management of menorrhagia.\"21 In the two head -to-head comparisons between COCs and LNG -IUS,59,61 reductions in heavy menstrual bleeding were documented in both treatment groups , with a somewhat greater benefit for LNG - IUS users . Decision Aids Three studies investigated decisions aids to assist women seeking treatment for heavy cyclic bleeding in making informed decisions about care .86,87,177 The study results suggest that decision aids increase patient knowledge and enhance satisfaction w ith care but do not affect disease symptoms in directly measure able ways. One study found fewer women who received the decision aid ultimately chose surgical referral and hysterectomy.86 However this decision cannot be linked to improvement in bleeding symptoms. Since there are no known harms associated with using decision aids, they may help patients evaluate treatment options and feel secure in their choices. Applicability Applicability describes the extent to which results observed in published studies from this this review are likely to reflect the expected outcomes when an intervention is applied to broader populations in real -world conditions . Studies for this review were intended to provide information to inform primary care management of AUB , whether irregular or cyclic. In shaping the methods for this review, we have engineered the report so that the included research is applicable to primary care of women in the United States. O ur stricter criteria, narrowing 80 findings to only symptomatic populations of reproductive -age women with chronic complaints of abnormal bleeding, comes at the cost of fewer studies being addressed. However, it assures that those studies that are included we re explicitly designed to examine the effectiveness of the treatments for improving the outcomes of interest in the populations of interest. Applicability of the findings is therefore high. For each intervention, it is important to note the following provisions. The results of this review apply for women: Who are reproductive age and state they have an irregular pattern of menstrual bleeding or heavy cyclic menstrual bleeding. Without abnormal findings on pelvic exam or on ultrasound report (fibroids, poly ps). Without an intrauterine device ( IUD) in place, and who are not pregnant or lactating, Who are healthy, and without renal impairment, hepatic impairment, intestinal disease, thyroid disease, abnormal cervical cytology, noncyclic bleeding, history or pr esence of significant medical problems (e.g., thromboembolic disease, coagulopathy, subarachnoid hemorrhage, endocrine disorders, or eye disease). For whom any additional clinically determined diagnostic and screening tests have be completed to rule out these and other causes of abnormal bleeding. Does not have any of the contraindications found in the Food and Drug Administration sources discussed in the main document and do not have risks of drug -drug interactions if they take multiple prescription medi cations. Our review w as not designed to guide evaluation of women with abnormal bleeding, rather to address what treatments have evidence of effectiveness once the diagnosis is established an d primary care management is to be initiated. Applicability of Literature About Interventions for Irregular Uterine Bleeding (KQ1A) The literature about management of irregular uterine bleeding applies to women in primary care settings in the United States. Ten RCTs, three conducted in the United States, two in Italy, two in Turkey, and one each in China, Sweden, and the United Kingdom provide evidence about seven types of intervention. Enrolled populations were narrowly defined and had either a clinical diagnosis of irregular uterine bleeding, or met research criteria for PCOS. As a result the findings are strictly applicable only to these groups of women. We describe the agents study within the two populations in which the research was conducted. Use for Irregular Uterine Bleeding (KQ1A) Progest ogens The study comparing vaginal micronized progesterone (8% gel) with oral dydrogesterone for a 10- day time period is applicable to primary care in the United States, as both routes are used in standard care in the United States to provide progesterone in order to organize a withdrawal bleed that will typically occur within days of completing the progestogen. The oral agent in this trial, dydrogesterone, is not available in the United States . This study is therefore a surrogate for oral versus vaginal administration of s imilar progestogen formulations such as MPA that are widely used in the United States for this purpose ; however it does not provide direct evidence to support use of other agents. The outcome of interest for this review was regularity of bleeding after treatment which was provided for three menstrual cycles. Both groups had improvement 81 however applicability for chronic use is unclear as no long -term followup of symptom control is available. Progesterone is often used in management of specific causes of abno rmal bleeding such as PCOS however this study does not directly apply because the population was not addressed in this study. Progesterone can be used by women who wish to conceive. COCs The single study, conducted in the U nited S tates, is directly applica ble to primary care in the United States. The study population of 201 women is representative of the spectrum of complaints that may accompany chronic irregular uterine bleeding including menses that are widely separated in time whether light, normal, or heavy with regard to heaviness of bleeding, and includes women with closely space and unpredictable bleeding also without restriction on heaviness of bleeding. The intervention is a common version of triphasic COC (Ortho Tri - Cyclen \u00ae) that provides direct ev idence for its effectiveness and indirect evidence for other triphasic pills with similar dosing profiles. The evidence is less direct but likely applicable to monophasic pills of similar estrogen and progest ogen content. It does not apply to progest ogen - only formulations or to pills with estrogen doses lower than 0.035 mcg as used in this study. Comparison to placebo provides definitive evidence of benefit but does not provide information about how COCs compare to other strategies that might be used such a s LNG- IUS or progestogens. The outcomes included those that are a priority of women seeking treatment for uterine bleeding and included cycle regularity, incidence of excessive bleeding, and overall rating of symptom improvement. 50 Harms and contraindicati ons, as discussed in KQ2, are well - known to care providers and often to women themselves, and COCs are not applicable as a long-term strategy for women who wish to conceive. Management of PCOS (KQ1A) Metformin and Exenatide The four trials that investigated use of metformin are applicable to care in the United States and were conducted in the United States, Turkey, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The study in the United States compared metformin, to exenatide or both. These studies enrolled women with PCOS and fewer than expected normal menses. They investigated doses of metformin that are available in the United States (500 mg and 850 mg, administered by mouth twice daily). None of the studies used an extended- release form which is now available so evidence related to that formulation is indirect. The outcome of interest for this review was menstrual frequency which was improved compared with placebo in 2 trials. One head -to-head comparison was metformin compared with exenatide or both. Both were superior to either alone for cycle control. Another trial compared metformin to N -acetyl -cysteine. The most common side effect which is gastrointestinal symptoms was identified in these studies and thus would be expected to apply to this typically younger group of women who do not have diabetes. Metformin can be used by women who wish to conceive and is safe for use in pregnancy. Based on other literature, it may enhance fertility. Little is known about exenatide and fertility and safety in pregnancy , however it does not have contraceptive effects. Diet and Exercise The applicability of the single trial of diet and exercise is limited. It enrolled 24 adolescents with PCOS, 16 of whom completed the study and evaluated a low -fat, calorie- restricted diet or a carbohydrate- restricted diet along with 30 minutes of anaerobic exercise 3 days a week. The trial 82 did not provide an intention to treat analysis, comparing arms but did report that weight loss in either group improved cycle regularity. Behavioral changes can be applie d in many populations and would be expected to have benefits . Thus evidence is insufficient to advise which dietary pattern is superior. Another arm of a single study found exercise 30 minutes each day, 3 days a week, was more effective than no intervention and as effective as acupuncture in improving cycle regularity. Acupuncture Two trials, one conducted in Sweden and one in China, assessed acupuncture. Depending on the availability and the skill of acup uncturists available in communities, this intervention may not be broadly applicable in the United States. Both tradition acupuncture and electroacupuncture improved cycle regularity but this was assessed in essentially unblended trials. The outcomes examined were relevant to patient symptoms however were very poorly - described in one study in which the investigators applied categories like \"cured\" without clear definitions. Overall, literature is absent to inform choice of any of these modalities over another. Applicability of Literature to Management of Abnormal Cyclic Bleeding (KQ1B) Twenty -nine studies contributed evidence about interventions for management of abnormal cyclic bleeding focused predominantly on effectiveness for reducing the amount of blee ding among women with heavy menstrual bleeding. Overall these RCTs are applicable to primary care in the United States. F ive were conducted in the United States (including two multi- country trials) , eight studies were conducted in the United Kingdom, four studies were conducted in Canada (including two multicenter studies), three studies were conducted in Australia (including one multicenter trial), and two each were conducted in Finland, Egypt, and India. A single study was conducted in each of the followi ng countries: Netherlands, Sweden, and Turkey. LNG -IUS Overall, the study findings for LNG -IUS from this review apply to women in the primary care settings in the United States. One trial was conducted in three countries (United States, Canada, and Brazil ), two trials were conducted in the United Kingdom , and the others were conducted in Egypt, Canada, Turkey, and Finland. The settings are not substantially different from a primary care setting in the United States. However , a limitation is that adolescent women and women with obesity were not included in the RCTs populations , so direct applicability to their care is lacking. Enrolled populations met our inclusion criteria and like others used direct measures of volume of bleeding that would be replaced in c linical care with patient self -report. The LNG -IUS is available in the United States. The intervention dosage was the same for all seven trials and is that currently marketed (52 mg levonorgestrel, initial release rate 20 mcg per 24 hours) . The LNG -IUS must be inserted by a provider. The details of the insertion procedure must be understood and practiced to safely provide this treatment in a primary care setting. The comparator differed among the seven trials; two trials compared LNG -IUS to a COC trials a progestogen ( oral or intramuscular route ), one trial used an NSAID as a comparator , and one trial assigned the patients in the control group to continue with their existing medical treatment for excessive uterine bleeding or symptoms of dysmenorrhea, or both. None of the trials compared LNG -IUS with TXA. 83 The primary outcome of the trials was change in blood loss which directly addresses the primary symptom for which women typically seek treatment. One study used t he proportion of women who cancelled their prior decision to undergo hysterectomy as the primary outcome measure. Timing of assessment of outcome varied among the trials: one trial reported after 1 menstrual cycle, three trials reported after 3 menstrual c ycles, four trials reported after 6 menstrual cycles, and two trials reported after 12 months. The latter are more informative for a device intended to be in place for 5 years. Contraceptive Vaginal Ring The contraceptive vaginal ring is available in the U nited States, and the group of women enrolled in the only study available is comparable in symptom profile to those in other studies in this CER. MBL reduction between the contraceptive vaginal ring users and the comparison group receiving norethisterone 3 times daily was similar. Women in the contraceptive vaginal ring group were more satisfied with treatment, however, it is important to note that comparison of the ring to an agent dosed 3 times each day may not be applicable to typical practice patterns in the United States when selecting a progestogen to prescribe for AUB. NSAIDs The 13 RCTs examining NSAIDs and included in this review are applicable to United States populations. The studies were conducted in seven countries including Australia ( 2 studies ), Canada ( 1 study ), India ( 2 studies ), the Netherlands ( 1 study ), Sweden ( 1 study ), the United Kingdom ( 5 studies ), and the United States ( 1 study ). In some trials, women were excluded who were on hormonal medications, had menorrhagia related to an IUD , or who were taking NSAIDs or steroids. Therefore, results of these studies are applicable to women with no contraindications to NSAIDs including underlying hepatic, renal, or thyroid disease, stomach ulcers, or asthma , and no drug sensitivity. The specific NSAID administered to participants varied and included mefenamic acid (11 trials ), naproxen (2 trials ), flurbiprofen (1 trial) , and meclofenamate (1 trial) . One trial evaluated mefenamic acid in conjunction with TXA. For each NSAID, dose and duration did not vary greatly, with usually up to 5 days duration of use. The most commonly used dose of mefenamic acid was 500 mg 3 times a day starting at the onset of menses. One trial initiated mefenamic acid 5 days prior to onset of menses through cessation of bleeding. Another trial used 500 mg at onset of menses followed by 250 mg every 6 hours for 3 to 5 days. Mefenamic acid at a dose of 250 mg 3 times a day from onset menses for 5 days was used when combined with TXA in one trial. Naproxen was evaluated with initial loading doses of 500 to 550 mg then 250 to 275 mg every 6 hours for 5 days or until 24 hours after cessation of heavy bleeding. Meclofenamate was studied at a dose of 100 mg 3 times a day from onset of menses f or duration of 6 days or until cessation. Flurbiprofen was studied at a dose of 100 mg twice a day from onset of menses for duration of 5 days. Each of these doses is available for prescription in the United States. Notably , the literature lacks RCTs about ibuprofen which is likely the most common prescription and over -the-counter NSAID used for heavy bleeding and dysmenorrhea. Outcomes for the trials in this review included documentation of objective blood loss. This is not applicable in routine clinical care and subjective assessment of MBL is nearly always used as the criteria for initiating and determining success with NSAIDs . NSAIDs are also effective in reducing dysmenorrhea, and therefore patients with both heavy cyclic menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea or headaches may desire NSAIDs. 84 TXA The literature about TXA for management of abnormal cyclic bleeding applies well to women in primary care settings in the United States . Two trials were conducted in the United States, three were conducted in Europe , and one took place in India. Enrolled populations met inclusion criteria and reviewed studies implemented exclusion of part icipants as described in the methods for this review. Because women with comorbidities are systematically excluded from these trials, we must note the studies apply to healthy women with heavy cyclic menstrual bleeding. While studies quantified the amount of bleeding at baseline, this is typically not feasible in clinical populations and the patient's statement that menstrual bleeding is heavy would be more likely to be used as a criterion for consideration of this therapy. The formulation of TXA (Lysteda \u00ae) used in the included studies is the same that is currently available in the United States. The intervention dosage differed among the five trials but was in the range of 1.95 to 4.5 grams per day for 4 to 5 days. Treatments compared with TXA in these trials did not include LNG -IUS or COC regimens. This modestly limits applicability since these would be among the usual interventions considered in real -world clinical settings. The primary outcome of the TXA trials was change in blood loss which is typically the most pertinent symptom for women. The timing of assessments of outcomes varied among the trials but was generally short: two trials reported after two menstrual cycles, four trials reported after three menstrual cycles, one trial rep orted after six menstrual cycles. No trials reported outcomes for use of TXA for 1 year or more of therapy. This limits understanding of applicability for long- term use of this agent. Reporting of adverse events was not adequate for an assessment of harms and in the context of short followup in trials, this prevents consideration of risks. COCs The findings of this review are applicable to women visiting a primary care setting for management of heavy, cyclic uterine bleeding. The included RCTs were conducte d in the United States ( 1 study ), Canada ( 2 studies ), Australia ( 1 study ), multiple sites in Europe (1 study ), and Egypt ( 1 study ) in outpatient clinical care settings. Known contraindications to use of COCs and abnormal findings during diagnostic work- up (e.g., fibroids or other endometrial pathology) were commonly employed as exclusion criteria in the identified studies and these diagnostic exclusions are applicable in the general primary care setting as well. Study participants were all older than 18, and had normal range body weights so no evidence directly informs symptom management or safety in younger adolescents or obese patients. COCs were compared with placebo in three studies and with LNG -IUS in two studies. Both participants in the COC group and LNG -IUS had improvements from baseline, but the LNG -IUS was superior to COC. In comparison to mefenamic acid, COCs were superior. The outcomes assessed were those of high relevance to patients and included MBL , blood counts and iron reserves, and participa nt and clinician assessment of symptoms. Decision Aids Use of decision aids is increasingly common and promoted in U.S. health care settings especially in clinical contexts in which patient preference plays a strong role in selection of the treatment and prioritization of outcomes. Three studies of decision aids are included in this review. Two were conducted in the United Kingdom and one in Finland. They are somewhat applicable to care in the United States but may not directly apply given differences in payment structures for care and prescriptions as well as potential differences in clinical care norms. All 85 three studies used information booklets mailed to patients prior to their appointments and one added a computerized decision tool. The studies assesse d outcomes like general health status, quality of life, and decisional conflict, as well as secondary outcomes like anxiety. Study populations included women older than 30 and 35 respectively in the two that reported, so findings do not generalize to younger women. None found benefit which may or may not reflect how similar approaches would be received in a U .S. health care context or across a broader age span of women. Final Comments on Applicability Overall applicability of this literature to providing care was high. However, often women who are in trials do not reflect the full range of those with abnormal bleeding seen in primary care and, as we have noted, groupings of participants do not correspond directly to newer classifications of s ub-types of AUB. 9 Study participants were more likely to be normal weight, nonsmokers, with few, if any concomitant conditions. The interventions (except in the case of specific comparators as noted) are available in the same doses and formulation in the U nited States. Outcomes such as measured blood loss, self -reported symptom severity and days of bleeding are of direct relevance to women with abnormal bleeding. Our findings are sparse for outcomes which can be considered essential for a condition like AUB that are defined by symptoms. Important outcomes include satisfaction with response to treatment, definitive assessments of whether or not the women considered their complaint resolved, and whether they wished to continue the same treatment or add additional treatments. Followup in general was brief, so they findings may not apply well to management of a chronic condition like abnormal bleedings. This makes findings about assessments of harms challenging since use of interventions over extended periods may have different risk profiles from short timeframes like one to six cycles. Summary of Strength of Evidence and Findings Overall the evidence to answer KQs about the management of AUB, did not reach standards for high strength of evidence for any intervent ion. This was particularly true in the literature relevant to treatment of women with irregular uterine bleeding. Combined oral contraceptives, as represented in a single good quality placebo controlled trial with a total of 201 participants, documented ef fectiveness. The treatment effect was large with improvement in bleeding patterns reported for more than 80 percent of women taking COC compared with 45 percent for the placebo group. Combined, these factors provided moderate evidence of benefit. Use of metformin is supported by low strength of evidence predominantly related to small trials with somewhat limited quality. For the remainder of the interventions investigated for management of irregular uterine bleeding, there is insufficient evidence that follows from single or lower quality studies, or both. The strength of evidence tables (Table 22 and Table 23) that follow summarize the total number of studies and within those studies the number of women who received the specific intervention. The tables al so provide the assessment of the risk of bias, consistency of findings across trials, directness of the evidence that treatment improves the symptom, and precision of the estimated provided by the literature. The complete scoring is found in the Appendix J . For KQ1B, risk of bias associated with blinding of patients, personnel and outcome assessment was most likely to compromise overall assessment of study quality. For KQ1A, risk of bias 86 associated with blinding of patients and personnel and incomplete outc ome data was most likely to compromise overall study quality. Table 22.

For management of heavy cyclic bleeding the literature was more robust. C ombined oral contraceptives are supported by high strength of evidence for the purpose of decreasing MBL. The LNG -IUS, various NSAIDs, and TXA are also effective for reducing the amount of measured menstrual bleeding and are each supported by moderate strength of evidence. Of note, in head -to-head comparisons with statistically significant differences, the LNG -IUS has one trial each showing superiority to NSAIDs, two showing superiority to COCs, and two showing 87 superiority to progestogens. COCs were superior in one trial compared with an NSAID. TXA was also superior to an NSAID, and when combined with an NSAID was superior to TXA alone. Most of these interventions have been shown to have additional positive effects, typically including shorter duration of bleeding and improvement is sy mptoms when participants used standardized scoring systems to report on treatment response.

Implications for Clinical and Policy Decisionmaking This review highlights the variety of options that can be effective for management of abnormal bleeding. We hope it serves to encourage care providers and women to consider the full range of potentially helpful interventions. This review may help to unders core the fact that contraceptive options like LNG -IUS and COCs are a proven option, while widening consideration to include agents like metformin for women with PCOS and TXA for those with heavy bleeding. Clinicians may be also be alerted to the some of th e constraints of the literature for these specific populations and proceed with more information to guide decisions and to discuss likely side effects and potential harms. Since these conditions are not typically life -threatening but are chronic, problema tic, and can be embarrassing and costly in terms of lost productivity, the primary health system and policy challenge is to recognize that failure to address AUB is unnecessarily diminishing women's quality of life and function. 1,8 Cost differences are unl ikely to drive choices among many of these interventions, though initial costs of long term treatments like the IUS can be disincentives if up - front or maintenance cost s to the patient are high.180-183 Likewise for newer drugs, like TXA, decisions about el igibility and copays could influence uptake and continued utilization of an effective medication. All the interventions described, with the exception of exenatide, cabergoline, and acupuncture, are likely to be covered by most payors for these indications. For the treatments noted that have not yet proven effectiveness in large well -conducted studies this will need to be addressed with high quality research before policy decisions can be recommended. 89 Limitations of This CER In this review we focused tightly on primary care interventions for two specific patterns of abnormal bleeding (irregular and cyclic). While this approach was identified by our team, K ey Informants , and the Technical E xpert P anel (TEP) as an area of the literature that would benefit from evidence synthesis, our focus does prevent comparison to second line therapies that may be used by subspecialists for women who have failed primary care treatment and prevents examination of how these medications fa re when compared with surgical options. T he latter category of study is fairly small, and for broader perspective, there are a number of reviews within the last 5 to 10 years that provide more sweeping information about these interventions. For the reader's convenience , Appendix M lists these rev iews and related practice guidelines and summarizes the conclusions that are relevant to the focus of this review. Existing literature cannot uniformly be related to more recent updates in classification of AUB that have potential to drive greater uniform ity in research and greater thoroughness in clinical evaluation. At present the inclusion and exclusion criteria of trials, the operational definitions of the condition under study and the level of screening of participants to document conformity with the FIGO 2011 classifications is lacking. As a result this literature synthesis is constrained to groupings that are less specific. Nonetheless we have organized the findings into groupings that are clinically recognized presentations and this evidence does apply for the scenarios described. We restricted this review to publications in English. Based on review of abstracts (generally available in English) and on the expertise of our team and TEP, we do not feel that this biases the review for assessment of the LNG -IUS and medications because few studies were omitted, and larger, higher quality trials are typically published in the English language literature. The sole domain that may be fundamentally under -represented because of this strategy is complementary and alternative medicine which includes interventions such as herbal remedies, acupuncture, and massage therapy. We also restricted interventions to those that had been studied in randomized trials. This limits the degree of context that we can provide from observational studies about factors such as predictors of treatment success or effect modifiers. However, it is uncommon for observational studies to meet criteria sufficient to influence the assessment of strength of evidence when there are trials available, so this restriction is unlikely to have influenced the overall findings of this review. Limitations of the Evidence Base Throughout the report we endeavored to point out limitations specific to the included populations, comparisons, and quality of the literature. Recent improvements in unifying nomenclature and formalizing consensus definitions for the clinical groupings of bleeding abnormalities 9 will likely continue to have a positive influence on the ability to properly interpret the findings of individual studies, to identify groups of studies with comparable methods and to aggregate results. Though we did not systematically review literature a bout pathophysiology, normative patterns for bleeding, natural history of AUB subtypes, or health systems influences, we comment here beyond the need for specific trials in order to encompass other forms of research that could enhance the design and conduc t of effectiveness studies as well as filling important gaps in knowledge that hinder research. 90 Methodologic Limitations Recurring methodologic recommendations include a need for: Larger RCTs, appropriately powered for direct head- to-head comparisons of treatment options in which loss of participants i s minimize d and intention- to-treat analyses are uniformly conducted. Detailed attention to operational criteria for defining the bleeding pattern under study and for methods used to define inclusion and exclus ion. Conformity with FIGO PALM - COIEN sub -types may be desirable. Study of the validity and reproducibility of classification of women presenting with problem irregular and cyclic bleeding using the PALM -COIEN groupings or other approaches is needed to unde rstand the diagnostic properties of clinical classification systems. Clear and definitive operational definitions of outcomes that include, indeed prioritize, patient -reported, condition- specific quality of life and satisfaction measures over durations of time compatible with treatment of a chronic condition. This should include assessments of whether the woman herself considers her bleeding problem resolved. Study populations that match the characteristics of those who present with AUB in primary care sett ings. This includes teens, perimenopausal women, heavier women, and women with common comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. More effective mechanisms of masking participants, researchers, and providers to intervention status. This may include ne ed to develop sham procedures to mimic IUD insertion and to provide a sham \"string\" to confirm placement should a patient or provider check status. (Of note the IUD is effective without a string and string -less insertion is also an option for research wher e placement can be confirmed by ultrasound.) Studies designed to assess treatment trajectory and cost. Such studies could randomize women to distinct treatment pathways and track the rate of conversion from one treatment to another for inadequate symptom c ontrol or sequence addition of measures, so that the effectiveness of combining multiple intervention methods can be assessed. An overall shift towards effectiveness from efficacy, moving beyond the level of proof of concept that is required for drug and device approval to a deeper level that can better inform care, cost considerations , and policy. Ongoing Research We identified four ongoing studies that may add to our understanding of the relative safety and efficacy of different regimens for treatment of AUB (additional details provided in Appendix P). Two currently funded trials are exploring the effect of a pretreatment regimen, one employing misoprostol and one using norethindrone acetate, on short and long term bleeding outcomes among women undergoing placement of an LNG -IUS for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding. A large postmarketing surveillance study of the Mirena \u00ae LNG -IUS is also underway in Kazakhstan, with a planned enrollment of 1,700 participants, potentially contributing additional safety i nformation to this body of literature. The utility and safety of new investigational agent, a selective progesterone receptor modulator (CDB -2914) that has shown promise for reducing bleeding in studies involving women with fibroids, is also currently bein g assessed in a study involving women with AUB . 91 Future Research Needs While the number of informative studies that could be designed is likely limitless, we list examples, grouped by indication and intervention, of types of studies that could resolve curre nt and pressing gaps in knowledge. Irregular Uterine Bleeding Development of a body of literature that examines benefits of exercise and weight loss focused on improving bleeding patterns in women with irregular bleeding that results from failed , mistimed , or poor -quality ovulation. Continued investigation of the role that insulin sensitizing and glycemic control agents like metformin and exenatide have on improving irregular bleeding patterns. Carefully controlled trials of complementary and alternative m edicine interventions like acupuncture for improving menstrual regularity. RCTs specifically designed to assess both the heaviness and the interval of bleeding in women with irregular bleeding, which could include approaches shown to have benefit for heavy cyclic bleeding. Abnormal Cyclic Uterine Bleeding Investigate the epidemiology and natural history of heavy menstrual bleeding in representative primary care populations in order to better understand the boundaries of what constitutes normal bleeding patterns and to document the trajectory of AUB. This would for instance, contribute data about what factors predict severity and whether a proportion of cases are self -limited. Determine whether harms reported to be associated with treatments for heavy bleeding result because a causal contributor to the heavy bleeding is also related to the harm. For instance abnormalities in coagulation may enhance risk of DVT and be associated with heavy menses. Analyses for such confounding by indication may better as sess risk of harms and predictors of response. Across specific interventions, additional research and analysis is needed to determine which individuals are most likely to respond to which interventions. This could develop from personalized medicine approac hes, from better understanding of the mechanisms underpinning AUB, or from predictive modeling in large datasets. Assess the acceptability and cost -effectiveness of various treatments in the primary care setting in the United States including LNG -IUS, NSAI D, COCs and TXA. Determine the most valid and accurate indirect measures of MBL that can be used in primary care settings and that correlate with objective direct measures. Progesterone Containing IUDs Including the LNG -IUS Establish a registry of LNG -IUS users in the United States for extended followup of potential harms and preventive effects (e.g., reduced risk of endometrial cancer, anemia). Extend postmarketing surveillance to assure safety when used in teens and nulliparous patients. Examine costs in light of whether the treatment simultaneously resolves bleeding complaints and provides contraception. 92 NSAID s Directly compare classes of NSAIDs including commonly available over -the-counter preparations. Conduct long -term effectiveness studies to determin e if treatment effects are durable or wane over time. Model the costs of treatment with varied NSAID dosing strategies. Determine if \"pre -loading\" in the days before onset of menses significantly reduces menstrual bleeding alone and in combination with NSA IDs after onset of menstrual bleeding. COCs Conduct direct comparisons of COCs with other AUB management strategies to better understand the relative merits of treatment options. Examine costs in light of whether the treatment simultaneously treats complaints and provides contraception. TXA Establish a registry of TXA users and exploit existing large payer datasets to examine long-term followup for both effectiveness beyond 6 months and incidence of rare/uncommon adverse effects. Conclusions Women who have problematic irregular or heavy cyclic menstrual bleeding have a number of treatment options available that are supported by systematic review of the research literature. These include high strength of evidence that COCs can improve menstrual regularity fo r women with irregular bleeding patterns. Metformin is supported by moderate strength of evidence for improving cycle regularity especially among women with PCOS. This provides both a contraceptive and a noncontraceptive option for irregular menses. Other interventions like progestogens are associated with statistically and clinically meaningful improvements from baseline patterns, however the overall evidence is insufficient from well -designed, larger studies with ability to directly compare treatment arms rather than only pre -post measures within groups. Multiple interventions for heavy cyclic bleeding are supported by evidence that they reduce MBL . These include strong evidence that COCs are effective and moderate strength of evidence that LNG -IUS, NSAIDs , and TXA reduce bleeding relative to baseline, decrease total volume of bleeding when comparisons are made across treatment groups, and when measured, decrease days of bleeding. In direct comparisons , LNG -IUS is superior to NSAIDs. TXA is superior to NSAI Ds and TXA combined with an NSAID was superior to TXA alone. Results from COC and NSAID comparisons suggest comparable effectiveness. Not all women who are treated with any of these interventions that can be effective will improve. Across agents data are s parse to evaluate long -term improvements and risk of harms. Limitations include a predominance of small, short trials lacking standard terminology and diagnostic criteria for identifying and including women with AUB . Tools for collecting outcome data are crude (collection of sanitary products) and may contribute to a high rate of attrition. Biologic outcomes, like measured blood loss and hemoglobin or hematocrit levels, may neglect the importance of patient -reported outcomes that assess whether symptoms ar e considered 93 resolved by women themselves. Nevertheless, the variety of effective options suggests many women can achieve symptom relief and will have available to them choices that address both symptoms and contraceptive or fertility desires, as well as p otentially improving other symptoms like menstrual cramping. 94 References 1.

Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool Use the modified Cochrane Collaboration tool to assess risk of bias for randomized controlled trials. Bias is assessed as a judgment (high, low, or unclear) for individual elements from five domains (selection, performance, attrition, reporting, and other) .

Handling of incomplete outcome data was complete and unlikely to have produced bias Insufficient reporting of attrition/exclusi ons to permit judgment (e.g., number randomized not stated, no reasons for missing data provided) High Low Unclear G-1 Appendix G . Cochrane Risk of Bias Criteria Criteria for judging risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Toola Bias Judgment Criteria RANDOM SEQUENCE GENERATION Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate generation of a randomised sequence. 'Low risk' of bias. The investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as: Referring to a random number table; Using a computer random number generator; Coin of lots; Minimization*. *Minimization may be implemented without a random element, and this is considered to be equivalent to being random. 'High risk' of bias. The investigators describe a non -random component in the sequence generation process. Usually, the description would involve some systematic, non- random approach, for example: Sequence generated by odd or even date of birth; Sequence generated by some rule based on date (or day) of admission; Sequence generated by some rule based on hospital or clinic record number. Other non- random approaches happen much less frequently than the systematic approaches mentioned above and tend to be obvious. They usually involve judgement or some method of non- random categorization of participants, for example: Allocation by judgement of the clinician; Allocation by preference of the participant; Allocation based on the results of a laboratory test or a series of tests; Allocation by availability of the intervention. 'Unclear risk' of bias. Insufficient information about the sequence generation process to permit judgement of 'Low risk' or 'High risk'. ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate concealment of allocations prior to assignment. 'Low risk' of bias. Participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: Central allocation (including telephone, web- based and pharmacy -controlled randomization); Sequentially numbered drug containers identical appearance; Sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. 'High risk' of bias. Participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection bias, such as allocation based on: Using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); Assignment envelopes were used without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or nonopaque or not sequentially numbered); Alternation or rotation; Date of birth; Case record number; Any other explicitly unconcealed procedure. 'Unclear risk' of bias. Insufficient information to permit judgement of 'Low risk' or 'High risk'. This is usually the case if the method of concealment is not described or not described in sufficient detail to allow a definite judgement - for example if the use of assignment env elopes is described, but it remains unclear whether envelopes were sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed. SELECTIVE REPORTING Reporting bias due to selective outcome reporting. 'Low risk' of bias. Any of the following: The study protocol is available and all of the study's pre- specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way; The study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports include all expected outcom es, including those that were pre- specified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon). G-2 Bias Judgment Criteria 'High risk' of bias. Any one of the following: Not all of the study's pre- specified primary outcomes have been reported; One or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre- specified; One or more reported primary outcomes were not pre- specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpect ed adverse effect); One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta- analysis; The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for suc h a study. 'Unclear risk' of bias. Insufficient information to permit judgement of 'Low risk' or 'High risk'. It is likely that the majority of studies will fall into this category. OTHER BIAS Bias due to problems not covered elsewhere in the table. 'Low risk' of bias. The study appears to be free of other sources of bias. 'High risk' of bias. There is at least one important risk of bias. For example, the study: Had a potential source of bias related to the specific study design used; or Has been cl aimed to have been fraudulent; or Had some other problem. 'Unclear risk' of bias. There may be a risk of bias, but there is either: Insufficient information to assess whether an important risk of bias exists; or Insufficient rationale or evidence that an identified problem will introduce bias. BLINDING OF PARTICIPANTS AND PERSONNEL Performance bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by participants and personnel during the study. 'Low risk' of bias. Any one of the following: No blinding or incomplete blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; Blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken. 'High risk' of bias. Any one of the following: No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken, and the outcome is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding. 'Unclear risk' of bias. Any one of the following: Insufficient information to permit judgment of 'Low risk' or 'High risk'; The study did not address this outcome. BLINDING OF OUTCOME ASSESSMENT Detection bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by outcome assessors. 'Low risk' of bias. Any one of the following: No blinding of outcome assessment, but the review authors judge that the outcome measurement is not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; Blinding of outcome assessment ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken. 'High risk' of bias. Any one of the following: No blinding of outcome assessment, and the outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding; Blinding of outcome assessment, but likely that the blinding could have been broken and the outcome measurement is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding. 'Unclear risk' of bias. Any one of the following: Insufficient information to permit judgment of 'Low risk' or 'High risk'; The study did not address this outcome. G-3 Bias Judgment Criteria INCOMPLETE OUTCOME DATA Attrition bias due to amount, nature or handling of incomplete outcome data. 'Low risk' of bias. Any one of the following: No missing outcome data; Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias); Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups, with similar reasons for missing data across groups ; For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes not enough to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size; Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods. 'High risk' of bias. Any one of the following: Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention groups; For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk enough to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention effect estimate; For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or standardized difference in means) among missing outcomes enough to induce clinically relevant bias in observed effe ct size; 'As-treated' analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention received from that assigned at randomization; Potentially inappropriate application of simple imputation. 'Unclear risk' of bias. Any one of the following: Insufficient reporting of attrition/exclusions to permit judgement of 'Low risk' or 'High risk' (e.g. number randomized not stated, no reasons for missing data provided); The study did not address this outcome.

Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. The Cochrane Collaboration; 2011. H-1 Appendix H. Thresholds for Quality Assessment Quality assessment thresholds for Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) Tool : There are three categories for describing the quality of studies: \"Good\", \"Fair\", and \"Poor\". In order to assign a study to a category, we need to establish the threshold between good and fair quality studies and between fair and poor quality studies. Coch rane Collaboration uses strict criteria for the quality ratings. Cochrane Collaboration criteria for quality ratings: A good quality study must meet all criteria (Low RoB). A fair quality study does not meet, or it is not clear that it meets, at least o ne criterion, but it has no known important limitation that could invalidate its results (Moderate RoB). A poor quality study has important limitations and/or at least one criterion is not met (High RoB). Modifications of criteria for quality ratings: If all criteria are rated as \"low\" = Low RoB = Good Quality If one criterion is rated as \"high\" or 1 -2 criteria are \"unclear\", and the assessment is that this was unlikely to have biased the outcome, and there is no known important limitation that could inv alidate the results = Low RoB = Good Quality o Example: not blinded, but blinding was not possible and based upon design and outcomes, it is unlikely that the lack of blinding could have affected the outcome measure or other factor that would introduce bias If one criterion is rated as \"high\" or 1 -2 criteria are \"unclear\", and the assessment is that this was likely to have biased the outcome, and there is no known important limitation that could invalidate the results = Moderate RoB = Fair Quality o Could be poor , if the factors were considered to combine to important limitations If one criterion is rated as \"high\" and 3 are \"unclear = Moderate RoB = Fair Quality o Could be poor , if the factors were considered to combine to important limitations If two criteria ar e rated as \"high\", and all other criteria are 'low', and the assessment that this was unlikely to have biased the outcome, and there are no known important limitations that could invalidate the results = Moderate RoB = Fair Quality If two criteria are rate d as \"high\", and all other criteria are 'low', and the assessment that this was likely to have biased the outcome, and there are important limitations that could invalidate the results = High RoB = Poor Quality If three or more criteria are rated as \"high \" = High RoB = Poor Quality If four or more criteria are rated as \"unclear\"= High RoB = Poor Quality Low RoB criteria High RoB criteria Unclear RoB criteria Rating 7 0 0 Good 5-6 0-1 0-2 Good or .

Harms from Package Inserts for Drugs Included in Review Drug (Route; Brand Name) Adverse Reactions / Effects Notes and References Levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine system (LNG -IUS; Mirena\u00ae) Warnings and Precautions: If pregnancy should occur with Mirena in place, remove Mirena. There is increased risk of ectopic pregnancy including loss of fertility, pregnancy loss, septic abortion (including septicemia, shock and death) and premature labor and delivery. Group A streptococcal infection has been reported; strict aseptic technique is essential during insertion. Before using Mirena, consider the risks of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Bleeding patterns become altered, may remain irregular and amenorrhea may ensue. Perforation may occur during insertion. Risk is increased in w omen with fixed retroverted uteri, during lactation, and postpartum. Embedment in the myometrium and partial or complete expulsion may occur. Persistent enlarged ovarian follicles should be evaluated. Serious: Ectopic pregnancy - Incidence in clinical trials excluding women with risk factors for ectopic was 0.1% per year. Intrauterine pregnancy - \"As of September 2006, 390 live births out of an estimated 9.9 million Mirena users had been reported.\" Group A streptococcal sepsis (GAS) - \"As of September 2 006, 9 cases of Group A streptococcal sepsis (GAS) out of an estimated 9.9 million Mirena users had been reported.\" Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Embedment Perforation Breast cancer - \"Spontaneous reports of breast cancer have been received during postmar keting experience with Mirena... Two observational studies have not provided evidence of an increased risk of breast cancer during the use of Mirena.\" Most common (23.4%) \"The provided reflect the experience with the use of Mirena in the adequate and well -controlled studies for contraception (n=2,339) and heavy menstrual bleeding (n=80). For the contraception indication, Mirena was compared to a copper IUD (n=1,855), to another formulation of levonorgestrel intrauterine system (n=390) and to a combined oral contraceptive (n=94) in women 18 to 35 years old. The data cover more than 92,000 w oman- months of exposure. For the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding indication (n=80), the subjects included women aged 26 to 50 with confirmed heavy bleeding and exposed for a median of 183 treatment days of Mirena (range 7 to 295 days). The frequencies of reported adverse drug reactions represent crude incidences.

Tranexamic acid (oral; Lysteda\u00ae) Warnings and Precautions: The risk of thrombotic and thromboembolic events may increase further when hormonal contraceptives are administered with Lysteda, especially in women who are obese or smoke cigarettes. Women using hormonal contraception should use Lysteda only if there is a strong medical need and the benefit of treatment will outweigh the potential increased risk of a thrombotic event. Do not use Lysteda in women who are taking more than the approved dose of a hormonal contraceptive. Concomitant use of Lysteda with Factor IX complex concentrates, anti-inhibitor coagulant concentrates, or all -trans retinoic acid (oral tretinoin) may increase the risk of thrombosis. Visual or ocular adverse effects may occur with Lysteda. Immediately discontinue use if visual or ocular symptoms occur. Cerebral edema and cerebral infarction may be caused by use of Lysteda in women with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Ligneous conjunctivitis has been reported in patients taking \"Lysteda safety derived from two randomized, double - blind, placebo- controlled studies on treatment of heavy menstru al bleeding.

Cohort studies have shown the relative risk to be somewhat lower, about 3 for new cases and about 4.5 for new cases requiring hospitalization. The approximate incidence of deep- vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in users of low dose (<50\u00b5g ethinyl estradiol) combination oral contraceptives is up to 4 per 10, 000 woman-years compared to 0.5 to 3 per 10,000 woman-years for non- users.

Naoulou et al., 20121 Systematic review of 10 studies (5 double-blind RCTs; 2 RCTs; 1 prospective study) Tranexamic acid \"Available evidence indicates that tranexamic acid therapy in women with idiopathic menorrhagia resulted in 34 -54% reduction in menstrual blood loss. Following tranexamic acid treatment, patient's quality -of-life parameters improved by 46 - 83%, compared with 15- 45% for norethisterone treatment. When compared with placebo, tranexamic acid use significantly decreased the blood loss by 70% in women with menorrhagia secondary to an intrauterine device (p<0.001). Limited evidence indicated potential benefit in fibroid patients with menorrhagia. No thromboembolic event was reported in all studies analyzed.\" Tranexamic acid therapy for heavy menstrual bleeding. Lumsden and Wedisinghe, 20112 Systematic review Tranexamic acid \"Although several treatment options are available for HMB, tranexamic acid is particularly useful in women who either desire immediate pregnancy or for whom hormonal treatment is inappropriate. Tranexamic acid is a well -tolerated, cost - effective drug that reduces menstrual blood loss in the range of 34-59%. It improves the health -related quality of life in women in HMB.\" Effective treatment of heavy and/or prolonged menstrual bleeding without organic cause: pooled analysis of two multinational, randomised, double- blind, placebo- controlled trials of oestradiol valerate and dienogest. Fraser et al., 20113 Pooled analysis of 2 RCTs (421 women in ITT population) Estradiol valerate / dienogest Mean blood loss reduced in women with heavy and/or prolonged menstrual bleeding, and the effect is seen at the first withdrawal bleed after initiation of treatment. The effect is consistent across a larger and more diverse population of women. \"Although not directly comparable, the median decrease in MBL achieved by treatment cycle 7 with E2V/DNG treatment (88%) appears to approach that achieved with the LNG -IUS (median 95% and 96% reduction) over six cycles in two studies that also used the alkaline haematin method to objectively assess blood loss in women with heavy menstrual bleeding.\" Cost-effectiveness and quality of life associated with heavy menstrual bleeding among women using the levonorgestrel - releasing intrauterine system. Blumenthal et al., 20114 Review LNG-IUS \"Treating heavy menstrual bleeding with the LNG -IUS was found to be cost -effective in various countries and settings. Moreover, irrespective of the measuring instrument used, health-related quality -of-life outcomes were found to be improved to a degree similar to that achieved with endometrial ablation or hysterectomy. In some cases, the LNG -IUS appeared to be more effective and less costly than the surgical options.\" Systematic review highlights difficulty interpreting diverse clinical outcomes in abnormal uterine bleeding trials. Rahn et al. , 20115 Systematic review Includes medical and surgical interventions \" Many interventions for abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) are tested in clinical trials, but the large number and diversity of outcomes reported limit the ability to compare treatments across trials... There is a dearth of standardized outcome measures in AUB that identify symptoms of importance to patients.

Marret et al., 2010 6 Clinical practice guidelines \"In idiopathic AUB, the first -line treatment is medical, with efficacy ranked as follows: levonorgestrel IUD, tranexamic acid, oral contraceptives, either estrogens and progestins or synthetic progestins only, 21 days a month, or NSAIDs. When hormone treatment is contraindicated or immediate pregnancy is desired, tranexamic acid is indicated. Iron must be included for patients with iron-deficiency anemia. For women who do not wish to become pregnant in the future and who have idiopathic AUB, the long- term efficacy of conservative surgical treatment is greater than that of oral medical treatment. Placement of a levonorgestrel IUD (or administration of tranexamic acid by default) is recommended for women with idiopathic AUB.
