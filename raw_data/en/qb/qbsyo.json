Routine vaccination of each US birth cohort prevents approximately 20 million cases of illness and 42,000 deaths. Vaccination results in net savings of nearly $14 billion in direct costs and $69 billion in total societal costs in United States. 385%86%87%88%89%90%91%92%93%94%95% 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 LAC Kindergarten CA KindergartenPercent of Kindergarten Enrollees up -to-date\u00b6with Immunizations, Los Angeles County (LAC) and California (CA), 2002 -2014 \u00b6 up -to-date: Kindergarten (or physician -documented Varicella Disease).

Parents' social, economic , and cultural backgrounds , and their access to medical care for their children, impact their concerns and attitudes about routine childhood vaccination.40Recapture A lower percentage of parents who spoke mainly Asian languages and other European languages thought it was safe to vaccinate an infant. A lower percentage of parents who spoke Spanish believed it was acceptable for a child to experience mild side effects after immunization. English -speaking parents were more likely than Spanish -speaking parents to report that children should be allowed to attend school even if they are not immunized. 41Recapture -2 Parents who reported easier access to medical care for their children had less concern about vaccination safety and side effects. A higher percentage of white, highly -educated, and high -income parents understood that mild reactions to vaccination are normal in children. A higher percentage of white, highly -educated, and high -income parents also thought that children should be allowed to attend school without immunizations. 42Limitations Self-reported data Does not represent persons living in group quarters Low response rate Limited sample sizes for some subgroups Weighting based on the distribution of children, not parents43 44Thank You "}
