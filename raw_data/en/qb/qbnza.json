Recent research has reported that the traditional Ayurvedic medicine Bacopa monnieri may improve cognitive outcomes in adult populations; however, few studies have investigated its benets in younger cohorts. The aim of the current review is to system- atically assess and critically summarize clinical trial outcomes and safety of Bacopa and its effects on the cognition and behaviour in children and adolescents. Method: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Google and CINAHL were searched up to August 2015 for trials investigating Bacopa monnieri in child and adolescent populations. There were no restrictions in study design. Cognitive and behavioural outcomes were grouped into validated constructs and effect sizes were calculated for all signicant data to allow for direct comparisons. Results: Five studies met inclusion criteria for this review. The results demonstrated signicant consistent improvements in the language behaviour cognitive domain and in a number of the memory sub-domains. Signicant improvements were also seen in hyperactivity and attention-decit domains. Overall outcome data demonstrated small to medium effect sizes (mean d = 0.42). Safety and tolerability data was well reported for 80% of studies with only 2.3% of all participants reporting mild side-effects. Conclusion: This review highlights the safe use of Bacopa monnieri in child and adolescent populations for improving elements of cognition as well as behaviour and attention-decit domains. However, there is a signicant need for replicated study designs and stringent statistical analysis to validate these outcomes. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction Clinicians utilise empirical research to enhance their knowl- edge of viable treatment options when prescribing standard and alternative therapies for children with developmental disorders. Yet parents of children with these disorders can choose to make use of the wide variety of alternative options if they feel advised pharmaceutical options are unsuited to their child.1,2Despite the aura of safety associated with the natural medicinal world, the unrestrained use of supplements poses health concerns for prac- titioners and raises doubt and uncertainty in the minds of the consumer. As an example, the Dietary Supplement Health and Edu- cation Act (DSHEA) in the United States allows supplements to reach consumers before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved them or veried their safety.3With this in mind, there is a need for increased scrutiny in the eld of natural medicine to ensure the benets and risks of every vitamin, plant extract, and natural compound have been adequately assessed in stringently controlled clinical trials. Complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) have been widely used throughout history. After 3000 years of practice, the Ayurveda medicinal system is one of the oldest health care systems in the world, promoting a holistic view of health and prescribing individualized treatments.4One common CAM treatment deriv- ing from the Ayurveda medicinal system is Bacopa monnieri , or \"Brahmi \", from the plant family Scrophulariaceae . It is a perennial creeping herb that thrives in damp soils and marshes throughout the subcontinent and is classied as a nootropic (i.e. a cognitive enhancer).5Early in-vivo studies investigating the effects of Bacopa demonstrated signicant improvements in the areas of learning, memory and memory retention.6-8More recently, the memory and learning enhancing effects of Bacopa have been demonstrated in healthy adult populations.5,9-12 The isolated active constituents of Bacopa are denoted bacoside A and bacoside B,13-15and have demonstrated safety and tolera- bility in human adult volunteers.16Hypothesized mechanisms of action on the central nervous system (CNS) the possible benets of Bacopa on age-related cognitive decline and as a possible treatment for Alzheimer's dementia.20 In clinical settings, Bacopa polyherbal formulations has demon- strated improvements in attention, cognition, intelligence, and behaviour in children diagnosed with Attention-Decit Hyper- activity Disorder (ADHD), potentiating the use of Bacopa as an alternative treatment for the disorder.21-24Research has demonstrated that chronic intervention with Bacopa has yielded consistent efcacy in terms of cognitive benets,5,12,20,25-28as well as having anxiolytic capabilities.29-32Observations from acute studies have shown mixed results with some indicating positive cognitive and mood outcomes at the standard adult dose (320 mg per day)9,33whereas others reported no effects of treatment on cognitive performance.10Given the mixed results of acute studies, majority of research has focused on chronic administration with an average administration period of 12-weeks.15Despite encouraging results in healthy adults,5,9,11,12,15,20very little research has focused on the efcacy of Bacopa within child and adolescent populations. The aim of current review was to systematically summarize and critically assess the ndings from clinical trials of Bacopa and its effects on the cognition, memory and behaviour of children and adolescents in clinical and non-clinical populations. Each trial involving Bacopa in single extract form was examined in terms of its dose, intervention time period and the population of chil- dren and adolescents on which its effects were assessed (clinical or non-clinical group). The primary outcome of the review was a summary of the current evidence for the efcacy of Bacopa on cog-nition, behaviour, learning, and intelligence outcomes. Secondary outcomes investigated the safety and tolerability of Bacopa and its viability as an alternative treatment in clinical populations. 2. Method Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and CINAHL were searched up to August 2015 for trials with child and adoles- cent populations examining the cognitive, behavioural, and mood effects of various extracts of Bacopa monnieri . There were no restric- tions in terms of study design. The following terms and truncations were searched: cognit *, executive function , neurocognit *, memory, intelligence , behaviour , and attention. These terms were searched following: Bacopa monnieri, Bacopa monniera, or brahmi . The reference lists of any relevant papers were also examined for trials with a similar design. Investigations into the efcacy of the extracts were detailed and any safety and tolerability informa- tion or data was collated. Websites promoting extracts containing Bacopa monnieri were explored in order to discover what research meeting inclusion criteria of this review had been listed as evi- dence for the efcacy of the product in the child and adolescent population including any published or unpublished materials. The following inclusion criteria were used: Inclusion criteria: 1. Investigating a Bacopa monnieri extract alone (with no other ingredients). 2. Sample consisting of children or adolescents (aged 4-18). 3. Participant were not taking any other intervention during study period. 4. Sample size 20 (10 if a cross-over study). 5. Duration of intervention 1 month. 6. Have measurable outcomes on attention, cognition, behaviour, intelligence or mood. 7. Disclosed medical evaluations or safety reporting for any adverse events. 8. Full paper in English. 2.1. Effect size For each study, Cohen's d effect size calculations were performed on signicant data and were reported in one of two ways. The rst utilised the signicant differences between treatment groups (ES) at study end (e.g. treatment vs. placebo). The second calculated a treatment effect size (TES) where only change scores were available (Bacopa baseline vs. Bacopa study end). Effect sizes were not calcu- lated for non-signicant results or where data was not appropriate to perform calculations (ES: N/A). To enable direct comparison of the studies, the total amount of Bacopa for each study, per partici- pant, per day was calculated. 2.2. Behavioural data Behavioural outcomes were grouped into constructs based on the ADHD framework, as described and validated by the Diagnos- tic and Statistical Manual 5th edition (DSM-5) .34These behavioural domains comprise of symptoms that have been the subject of conrmatory factor analyses.35These symptoms include Hyper- activity - described as difculty remaining seated, dgeting with hands or feet, excessive running or climbing/always on the go; Inattention - described as losing things, difculty organizing work, easily distracted, difculty sustaining attention, difculty following instructions, doesn't listen and doesn't tasks; Impulsivity - described as difculty waiting and interrupts, engages in dangerous activities without considering consequences, blurts out answers, 58 J.D. Kean et al. / Complementary Therapies in Medicine 29 (2016) 56-62 acts before thinking35; Peer relations - described as no friends, loses friends, does not make friends, doesn't get invited, feels inferior.36 Symptoms of specic learning problems were described as dif- culty with reading or writing, problems with math skills, difculty remembering, problems paying attention, trouble following direc- tions, poor coordination, difculty with concepts related to time and problems staying organized.37Conrmatory factor analysis of the DSM-IV ADHD rating scales has previously indicated increased variance in teacher and parent rated behaviours.38In order to address this variance, any teacher and parent reports of behaviour were assessed separately. 2.3. Cognitive data Any cognitive testing was assessed in terms of its true cognitive ability as described by Carroll.39These are outlined in Pase et al. (2012)15and include reasoning - incorporating general, quantita- tive, syllogistic and verbal reasoning as well as induction; language behaviour - incorporating vocabulary, spelling ability, phonetic coding and verbal comprehension; memory - associative memory, free recall, visual memory and memory span; visual perception - incorporating gural relations, closure speed and perceptual speed; auditory perception - incorporating pitch discrimination; number facility - incorporating the ability to compute basic numerical oper- ations; mental speed - processing speed and simple reaction time; and idea production - incorporating abilities in producing words, ideas and gural creations such as originality and word fluency.15 3. Results Five studies were identied as investigating the benets of Bacopa in child and adolescent populations using single extract interventions.40-44See Fig. 1 for a flow chart of the included study trial search. Three studies were randomised controlled trials40-42 and two were open-label trials.43,44None of the included stud- ies matched treatment groups for age or sex. One included study was an unpublished report conducted by the Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) of Lucknow, India of a standardised Bacopa mon- nieri extract (SBME).42Study designs were similar in that they each investigated cognitive and behavioural outcomes, with the main variance in population samples which included healthy children,40 ADHD children,41,42,44and those children with a low intelligence quotient.43Age range was 4-18 years (mean age 8.57 \u00b1 1.48). Bacopa doses ranged from 100 mg to 1050 mg per day. The overall average dropout rate was 13%. See Table 1 for detailed description of each study and effect sizes for each outcome measure. In order to quantify the strength of a signicant result, Cohen's d effects sizes were calculated for any study that reported treatment group scores (mean and standard deviation) at baseline and nal visit. A variation of the Cohen's d effect size was carried out on those studies who reported signicant change scores in Bacopa treated groups only (treatment effect size). Effect size calculations were conducted on two out of the ve studies (range 0.13-0.81)41,42; treatment effect size (TES) calculations were conducted on one study (range 0.66-1.43)40; two studies reported data that was unable to be used for effect size calculations.43,44 Table 2 outlines signicant improvements in true cognitive abilities. Cognitive outcomes were assessed and categorized by two authors (JDK and LAD) and behavioural outcomes were assessed and categorized by a single author (JDK). Three studies examined and reported improvements in the language behaviour domain.41-43Two of the three studies to include mental speed domains reported signicant outcomes.42,43Four studies inves- tigated benets of Bacopa on aspects of memory40-43; three of these studies reported signicant improvements in the mem-ory span sub-domain40,42,43; two studies reported signicant outcomes in both visual memory42,43and meaningful memory sub-domains39,40; whereas there were single reports of improve- ments in free recall memory,42associative memory41and auditory memory.43One study examined and reported improvements in visual perception.40There were no reports of signicant improve- ments in the reasoning cognitive domain. Table 2 also details the effects Bacopa has within behavioural domains; these mea- sures were present in two studies investigating the benets of Bacopa extracts in children with ADHD.42,44Both studies presented data collected from parental sources only; no data was collected from the school-teacher perspective. Both studies found signicant improvements in the hyperactivity and attention domains.42,44 Only one study found signicant improvements in terms of impulsivity and learning problems domains44; there were no improvements in peer relations. Two studies captured data at multiple time-points, providing possible indications for early onset improvements.41,42One of the current review authors (JDK) analysed the raw data from one study to determine the level of improvement, if any, at each time-point against placebo.42This study employed a Mann-Whitney U test for treatment group comparisons at baseline and study end. At week 4 there were signicant improvements in the language behaviour (p < 0.05), mental speed (p < 0.05), and associate memory (p < 0.05) cognitive domains. At week 8 there were signicant improvements in language behaviour (p < 0.01), mental speed (p < 0.01), memory span (p < 0.01), and free recall memory (p < 0.05) against placebo.42 Only one group recorded behavioural outcomes at multiple time points and reported signicant improvements in hyperactivity (p < 0.05 at four weeks; p < 0.01 at eight weeks), and inattention (p < 0.01 at four weeks) against placebo.42There were no improve- ments in impulsivity at any stage of this study. The same two groups included a placebo run-out phase in which all participants consumed only placebo for four weeks at the end of the study.41,42Both studies reported sustained improvement (p < 0.05) in the language behaviour, free recall memory and visual recall cognitive domains.41,42One of the studies demonstrated additional sustained improvements at four weeks post treatment in the number facility (p < 0.01), mental speed (p < 0.01), associative memory (p < 0.01), memory span (p < 0.01), and meaningful mem- ory (p < 0.01) cognitive domains.42These were complemented by the sustained improvements in attention (p < 0.01) and hyperac- tivity (p < 0.01) up to four weeks post Bacopa. All post-treatment improvement scores were veried by one of the review authors (JDK) using non-parametric Mann Whitney U test against change scores42and a t-test calculator against reported means and stan- dard deviations.41 Safety and tolerability data was well reported for 80% of studies with only 2.3% of all participants reporting side-effects involving stomach upset that subsided within days. In one study, medi- cal check-ups were conducted as a basis for inclusion into the trial, however, no safety or tolerability data were reported.40Two studies utilised the Dosage Record Treatment Emergent Symp- tom scale (DOTES)45to monitor safety and tolerability.41,42This symptom checklist monitors behavioural, neurological, autonomic, cardiovascular, and other symptoms such as weight (gain or loss), appetite and headaches. Neither study reported any adverse effects of the Bacopa treatment. The remaining two studies monitored for adverse effects during the intervention period and parents were asked to report any adverse reactions to investigators.43,44 Only one of these studies reported adverse symptoms of stomach upset and vomiting, which subsided after three days and partic- ipants were thereon able to continue in the trial.43Participant dropout rate was low overall (13%) with only one study having zero dropouts.40This study utilised powdered Bacopa in pineap- J.D.

Discussion This review investigated the efcacy of the Ayurvedic medicine Bacopa monnieri in children and adolescents in both clinical and non-clinical populations. This is the rst systematic review of its kind to investigate the benets and safety of this herb in a younger cohort. The outcomes of the included studies demonstrate signi- cant consistent improvements in the language behaviour cognitive domain,41-43and in a number of the memory sub-domain par- ticularly in memory span .40,42,43Signicant improvements were seen in both studies that measured behavioural outcomes,42,44 with improvements in hyperactivity and attention-decit domains consistent across both trials. ADHD is one of the most common psy- chiatric illnesses in the world with an estimated 8-12% school-aged children being diagnosed with the disorder.47These and simi- lar developmental disorders need structured, multi-dimensional forms of treatment for the best possible academic, social and mental health outcomes for children and adolescents.48Singh and Dhawan,7Stough,5,12Roodenrys,25Barbhaiya,26Calabrese,27 Nathan,10,11and most recently Morgan20and Downey9have investigated the benets of a single-extract of Bacopa on human cognitive function in adult populations. Despite these encourag- ing results, limited research has examined the benecial effects of Bacopa in children and adolescents. The studies contained within the scope of this review indicate that Bacopa monnieri has poten- tial to thrive as a natural and safe option for treating symptoms associated with childhood mental health disorders.41-44 Complementary and alternative medicines are fast becoming viable standalone or adjunctive treatment preferences in place of pharmaceutical treatment for a range of developmental disorders. Child and adolescent health is being targeted by alternative treat- ment companies on the grounds that natural intervention measures can treat a variety of common mental health and medical con- ditions within this population. Without crucial safeguards, some treatments may end up doing more harm than good. In the context of Ayurveda, practitioners prescribe Bacopa on a patient by patient basis, so it is rare that a single extract would suit all individuals.4 The strength of this review is that a rigorous systematic investiga- tion was conducted and detailed analysis of each included study was undertaken. The use of the Carroll framework in this review allowed the authors to consolidate distinct outcomes into true cog- nitive abilities.39Previous work by Pase and Stough emphasizes the use of the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence to sup- port the clear understanding of cognitive processes across multiple studies in nutrition research.49Future systematic reviews would benet from utilising this model to understand what impact nutri- tional treatments may have within the cognitive framework. A weakness of this review is that only studies published in English were included. Bacopa is native to India and following 3000 years of its use in the Ayurvedic medicinal system, studies in languages other than English must exist. In addition to this, the authors did not access the Digital Helpline for Ayurveda Research Articles (DHARA), which allows researchers to search for Ayurveda specic articles; upon inspection there were no further articles that required inclu- sion into this review. Furthermore, the inclusion of an unpublished report may weaken the overall outcomes of the review. Lead author (JDK) statistically analysed the raw data from the report and veri- ed its outcomes; however, this data would best serve the scientic community as a peer reviewed publication. In the current review, Bacopa monnieri was investigated in terms of its use in child and adolescent populations with focus on its use as an individual extract. The ve studies included in this review continue to support the hypothesis that Bacopa mon- nieri improves elements of human cognition.5,9,11,12,15,20Further to this, the current review provided some of the rst evidence of the use of Bacopa in behavioural and attention-decit disorders,such as ADHD.42,44This unique area of research requires stronger more focused trials investigating the benets of Bacopa monnieri on elements of mental health and within the context of devel- opmental dysfunction. Two of the trials included in this review employed signicance testing on only those who responded to the treatment in open-label designs.43,44Replicating these results is difcult due to the imprecise understanding of what constitutes a treatment-responder. Furthermore, the lack of a control group from these two studies weakens the cognitive43and behavioural44 improvements reported following Bacopa supplementation. Stan- dardized, easily replicated trial designs in clinical and non-clinical child and adolescent populations are essential to ensure the out- comes of Bacopa administration on behaviour, cognition, attention, memory and intelligence are reliable and valid. Clinical signicance Bacopa monnieri is a plant based nootropic that may provide cog- nitive and behavioural improvements in children and adolescents. Conflicts of interest None declared.
