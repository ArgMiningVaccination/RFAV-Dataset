His mother had been suffering from a serious cough and bronchial ailment, and he searched high and low to find a cure. Finally, he met a famous Chinese physician who gave him a secret formula for a cough syrup that helped cure his mother. Years later, before passing away, Yang Xiaolian's mother told him to reproduce this magical cough syrup and make it available for everyone. He named it Nin Jiom, which means \"in memory of my mother\". From this story came the inspiration for the Nin Jiom logo that stresses the important virtue of filial piety. Thereafter, in order to avoid the escalating war, Yang's descendants moved across the border to Hong Kong and entrusted the business to Mr. Tse Siu Bong. In 1946, Mr. Tse founded Nin Jiom Medicine Manufactory (Hong Kong) Limited in Hong Kong, prospered the business, then went on to research and develop a wide range of well-qualified Chinese herbal products.
