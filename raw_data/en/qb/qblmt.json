Acupuncture has been around for thousands of years in China. It is based on an energetic model of the human body, and believes that energy, called Qi (pronounced \"chee\"), flows thru the body on a complex inter-connected network of energy pathways called meridians. When qi is blocked, it becomes stagnant, and causes pain. Disease may result when an organ is not getting enough energy to function properly. Acupuncture is the practice of inserting extremely fine needles into the body at specific points that have been mapped on these energetic pathways. Experience has shown that each point has a specific action in the body to ease pain or to improve the functioning of the vital organs in the body, by facilitating the smooth flow of energy. How does Acupuncture work? In Eastern medicine if you balance all then energy in the body then you will in turn ease the pain and improve the functioning of the body to heal itself. Western medicine cannot yet completely explain how acupuncture works. More and more research is being conducted that confirms the effectiveness of the action of the points. In some studies, magnetic imaging has shown changes in the brain when certain points are stimulated. We do know that acupuncture improves circulation, reduces inflammation and can boost the immune system. Acupuncture has a powerful effect on both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and hence can regulate the whole body. Does Acupuncture hurt? Acupuncture needles are thin and flexible. Generally you feel a little \"pinch\" as the needle pierces the skin and then nothing. Sometimes you might feel a heaviness, achiness, warmth or tingling around the needle, which is normal. What can Acupuncture Treat? The World Health Organization has recognized over 40 common health problems that acupuncture can effectively treat. Most people are aware that acupuncture treats pain, but many do not know the wide range of painful conditions that are commonly improved with acupuncture. Acupuncture treats pain anywhere in the body, including but not limited to: back pain, frozen shoulder, carpal tunnel syndrome, TMJ, trigeminal arthritis, fibromyalgia, sciatica, plantar shingles pain and migraines. Acupuncture can also treat digestive disorders such as nausea, acid reflux and irritable bowel syndrome. It is commonly used to treat asthma and sinus problems. Acupuncture is also very effective in treating gynecological problems including PCOS, menopausal symptoms, endometriosis and even infertility. How many treatments will I need? This depends a lot on the condition you are presenting with, how long you've had it, and how well you respond to energy work. Everyone is different so it's difficult to give a precise time. Most people will begin to see some change in some system of their body within 3-7 treatments. Treatments are generally more frequent in the beginning, and then space out as you improve. Do I need to do anything special to be treated? No you do not. Generally the points used in our treatments are on your arms, legs, and head. Of course if you are complaining of a specific problem, for instance a shoulder or hip, then we will most likely need access to the area to insert needles. Bring loose clothing to wear and generally everything works fine.
