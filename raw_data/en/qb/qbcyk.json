If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn more. Regardless of the season, dry hands are a very common condition that you can experience, whether it's due to constant hand washing for hygiene or exposure to dry environments. You can have dry hands for various reasons, some of which include aging, working with harsh chemicals, having the oils stripped from your skin (typically due to long showers or baths, frequent hand washing, or drying hot water), or from health conditions such as diabetes, psoriasis, or eczema. All of this can lead to sensitive and dehydrated skin and, in some cases, broken and peeling skin and hands. Not to mention harsher and more extreme temperatures can impact the prevalence of dry, cracked hands as well. That's why it's important to stay moisturized and have lotion on hand. Since dry hands can be extremely uncomfortable, irritating, and at times painful, we're testing hand creams and lotions in a continuous search for the absolute best hand creams and lotions for dry, cracked hands. Before searching for the best lotion for dry, cracked hands, David N. Lortscher, MD, a dermatologist from San Diego, California, recommended, \"You should generally choose an unscented lotion that is free of alcohol and other common irritants.\" Essentially, the best lotions for dry, cracked hands should have moisturizing ingredients, such as shea butter, cocoa butter, and oils, which retain water at the skin's barrier, which means the skin stays moisturized, and they typically range between $4 to $30. To find the best lotions for dry, cracked hands on the market, we're researching dozens of lotions for a two-week time period. We are continuously researching dozens of lotions and evaluating them from reviews, personal active ingredients, compatibility with sensitive skin, consistency, and price. We rated them on a scale of 1 (would not recommend) to 5 (highly recommend) for consistency, absorbency, moisturizing properties, and fragrance.

We found ourselves re-moisturizing constantly with multiple hand creams and ointments throughout the day, which shifted once we started using this hand cream from L'Occtaine. The consistency is perfect for us because it's not too thick and/or sticky but is still super rich and creamy. It absorbed super well and still felt incredibly light without being watery. Infused with shea butter, honey, almond extracts, and coconut oil, this non-greasy, long-lasting hand cream moisturizes dry hands and restores moisture to the skin, which is why we chose it as our top pick. It has a subtle, powdery fragrance and is quickly absorbed into the skin, which makes it pleasant to use in addition to being effective at moisturizing dry, cracked hands. While it's not a cheap option, only a little of the lotion is needed for long-lasting relief, and that little bit goes a long way. We found that consistent use made our hands feel more moisturized and softer even when we weren't using the cream. Our skin's appearance also improved. Dry flakey textures reduced, softened up, and became smoother. It's not fragrance-free, but it's also not heavily scented, and we were enamored with the subtle natural cherry blossom scent. It made the experience feel more natural and good for the skin. We highly recommend this product. Price at time of publication: $30 Active Ingredients: 20% shea butter | Size: 1 ounce, 5.2 ounces | Scented: Yes Best Cruelty Free Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Touch Hand Cream 5 Sephora View On Amazon View On Harveynichols.com View On Kohls.com Pros Doubles as a cuticle cream Bottle is 100% recyclable Cons Scent doesn't last long Vegan and made without mineral oils, phthalates, or parabens, Sol De Janiero's Brazilian Touch Hand Cream won us over for Best Cruelty-Free Hand Cream. With a soft and subtle warm and spicy vanilla scent, Sol De Janiero's Brazilian Touch Hand Cream left our hands feeling supple, moisturized, hydrated, and amazingly soft. Breaking down the ingredient list, this hand lotion is created with cupua\u00e7u butter which is rich in fatty acids, polyphenols, and antioxidants that benefit your skin's natural oil barrier and aid in plumping up the skin, giving a younger, more youthful appearance, brazil nut selenium which helps the skin protect itself against dryness and squalene which replenishes the skin's moisture when your hands have gotten dry. We found that this hand cream was extremely lightweight and absorbed almost instantly without feeling greasy and immediately left hands feeling hydrated and moisturized. A pea-sized amount went a very long way, and we didn't feel the need to reapply for hours, which is rare for a hand lotion. Our favorite part was that there was no film after either. Bonus tip: You can use this lotion as a cuticle cream as well, and the bottle is completely recyclable. Price at time of publication: $21 Active Ingredients: Cupua\u00e7u Butter, Brazil Nut Selenium, Squalan 1.7 ounces | Scented: Yes Best for Eczema CeraVe Therapeutic Hand Cream 4.2 Amazon View On Amazon View On Walmart View On CVS Pros National Eczema Association Seal of Acceptance Made with ceramides Cons Product may be too thin for extremely cracked hands This non-greasy, fast-absorbing hand cream is ideal for chafed, dry, and cracked skin. We like how this hand cream is gentle and non-irritating to the skin while also being water-resistant and fragrance-free. The hyaluronic acid and niacinamide formula, together with three essential ceramides, provides long-lasting moisture for our hands. Additionally, CeraVe Therapeutic Hand Cream has received the National Eczema Association seal of acceptance, which sets it apart as being specially approved for use on sensitive skin or eczema. Price at time of publication: $11 Active Ingredients: Hyaluronic Niacinamide, and Ceramides ounces | Scented: No What are ceramides? Ceramides are fats found in the top layers of our skin that form half of the natural skin barrier. They help seal in moisture by preventing evaporation. People with eczema have fewer ceramides in the top layer of their skin, so using moisturizers that mimic the role of ceramides in the skin is a way to improve hydration and the skin's barrier. The 10 Best Ceramide Moisturizers to Buy in 2023 Best Natural Grown Alchemist Hand Cream Vanilla Orange Peel 4.9 Amazon View On Amazon View On Walmart View On Anthropologie Pros Certified and verified toxic free Completely cruelty free Cons Pricier Grown Alchemist Hand Cream Vanilla and Orange Peel is 100% vegan, 100% cruelty-free, certified and verified toxic-free, and won us over for the best natural lotion for dry, cracked hands. After testing it out for two weeks, this plush, lightweight, and moisturizing lotion left our hands feeling hydrated and healthy, especially in the harsh arid winter months. Using only a dime-sized amount, as instructed, we saw that the cream didn't absorb immediately as others did. Instead, it felt more like a lotion on our hands for about 30 seconds before it truly absorbed, but the scent was so dreamy, and the texture felt incredible, so it didn't bother us. The first thing we noticed was the pleasing fresh (versus artificial) orange citrus scent. The sophisticated aroma gave us a little pick-me-up as aroma therapy whenever we caught wind of it throughout the day. Rosehip oil makes this hand cream super hydrating, while camellia (yes, the flower) helps the hydration last long and penetrate the skin. Seabuckthorn berry and wheat germ work towards rejuvenating and regenerating the hands' natural moisture, using free radical antioxidants that protect the skin and fight the effects of aging. One thing to be aware of is that this is a thicker texture, so if you're averse to thicker hand creams, this may not be the best option for you. However, we feel that due to how moisturizing and lightweight it is, it's more than worth it. Price at time of publication: $34 Active Ingredients: Rosehip oil, camellia, | Size: 2.19 ounces | Scented: Yes Best for Working Hands Benton Shea Butter and Olive Hand Cream 5 Amazon View On Amazon View On Sokoglam.com View On Yesstyle.com Pros Great travel size tube No discernable scent Cons Can take a while to dry down When we tested this body butter, our hands were rough due to excessive workouts. After using Benton Shea Butter, our hands felt nourished, hydrated, and healthy even though we kept working out, powerlifting, and putting our working hands to use. It's because of that we give this shea butter the best for working hands superlatives, and it came in a close second for the best lotion for dry, cracked hands for fitness and athletes as well. Benton Shea Butter is dermatologically tested and full of hyaluronic acid, which is great at hydrating acid to hydrate the skin. It also has 10% shea butter and 2% olive oil which moisturizes, prevents dryness, and locks in moisture which was evident since our hands felt less \"crusty\" even though we continued our lifting and working out. We felt that the lotion was lightweight. It did take a while to dry down (1-2 minutes), but it still wasn't too overwhelming, even with the immediate post-greasy feeling that instantly went away. A little goes a long way. We coated our entire hands with only a dime size amount. The consistency was perfect without it being too thin or too thick, and at no point did our hands feel sticky. We also didn't notice any discernible scent, and it was very gentle. Price at time of publication: $11 Active Ingredients: Shea Butter, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil | Size: 1.76 ounces | Scented: No The 9 Best Lotions for Psoriasis of 2023 Best SPF Protection Supergoop! Handscreen SPF 40 4.2 Dermstore View On Walmart View On Bloomingdales View On Cosbar.com Pros Reef-friendly SPF Fragrance-free Super silky texture Cons Expensive We tested Supergoop!'s handscreen, and it lived up to the very innovative name, which is why we selected it as the best SPF protection hand lotion for dry, cracked hands. Sunscreen has a known tendency to leave a strange unsavory film on hands, which we put up with in the past because we wanted to protect our skin from the harsh rays of the sun that can damage our skin. This hand lotion has SPF 40, is derm-tested, and is clean and reef friendly, which made using this product guilt-free in every possible way. We noticed that it does smell slightly like sunscreen, but it faded fairly quickly and didn't bother us. Sun damage is known to worsen and intensify dry skin, so ensuring that you use a high-protection sunscreen lotion is important, particularly when you spend quite a bit of time outdoors and exposed to direct sunlight, which is why we love this one that we tested. Using seabuckthorn fruit extract, which is rich in omega-7 fatty acids, it's hydrating, nourishing, and fights off harsh environments and factors such as (of course) sunlight but also cold weather. This reef-friendly formula packs broad-spectrum SPF40, as we mentioned, and protects against UVA and UVB rays without octinoxate. Since it is a sunscreen, we do suggest that you use it as directed for maximum sun protection\u2014apply generously and evenly 15 minutes before sun exposure and be sure to reapply every two hours (unlike other hand lotions where you apply largely after washing hands or when needed). Oh! It also comes in multiple sizes, so you can carry one to go and have one at home, so you're always prepared and protected. Price at time of publication: $14 Active Ingredients: Sea buckthorn extract, argan oil | Size: 6.7 ounces | Scented: No The Best Sunburn Relief Gels and Lotions To Soothe Inflamed Skin Best for Diabetes Fenty Skin Hydra'Reset Intensive Recovery Glycerin Hand Mask 5 Sephora View On Fentybeauty.com View On Kohls.com View On Sephora Pros Overnight mask Great for winter months Cons Packaging can make product hard to dispense We loved testing this hand mask for dry, cracked hands because not only is it a super hydrating and luxurious feeling product, but it also aids in specific skin care needs that people with diabetes may prioritize. That's why we give Fenty Skin Hydra'Reset Intensive Recovery Glycerin Hand Mask the best lotion for dry, cracked hands for people with diabetes. Diabetes can cause different skin conditions and ailments, such as blisters and rashes, but can also result in dry, cracked skin. When testing this lotion, the lightweight gel-like cream spread around our hands like butter, and after about two minutes, the gel was completely absorbed into the hands. We didn't feel any residue, and our hands weren't oily after either. Our hands felt extremely moisturized post application, which we're attributing to the glycerin, which is a humectant (something that binds and locks in moisture found in the external environment), panthenol that penetrates the skin, conditioning and soothing it, and murumuru and mango butters which hydrate, nourish, and soften it. Also, it's important to note this is more of a mask best used overnight than a traditional hand cream you apply during the day. That way, it can soak in the skin without the constant need to reapply throughout the day, and you won't have the fear that it'll get wiped off. This is great for people with diabetes because it gives the hands time to rest and absorb as much moisture as possible. Also, due to the nature of humectants and how it draws moisture from the air, it means your hands will be absorbing moisture even after application. There's a very faint tropical fruit and floral scent, but it wasn't super noticeable to us. It also comes in two sizes, as well as a standard size and a smaller one best suited for travel or small spaces. Price at time of publication: $29 1 2.5 ounces | Scented: Yes Best for Babies Eucerin Baby Eczema Relief Body Cream Amazon View On Amazon View On Walmart View On CVS Pros Gentle on baby eczema Provides 24-hour protection Cons Babies must be 3 months or older to use It's common for babies to have skin conditions, such as eczema, due to having such sensitive skin. The discomfort that comes with dry, chapped, and cracked skin is enough to make an adult emotional, so it's that much more important to have a lotion that can soothe and address a baby's irritated skin. We love Eucerin's Baby Eczema Relief Body Cream because it addresses those skin conditions while also protecting and moisturizing the baby's skin. Colloidal Oatmeal is a well-known skin protectant and is commonly used in lotions and creams formulated for sensitive skin and eczema. Combined with ceramide-3 and licorice root extract, this tried and trusted, clinically proven body cream provides 24-hour moisturizing for dry and eczema-prone skin. This product is ideal for babies 3 months and older. Price at time of publication: $9 Active Ingredients: Colloidal oatmeal, ceramide 3 | Scented: No What is colloidal oatmeal? A skin protectant often used to treat dry, sensitive skin conditions, colloidal oatmeal is finely ground oats. The oats become emollient in this finer texture, which makes them easier for the skin to absorb. Studies have found colloidal oatmeal to be effective in repairing the skin barrier among those with atopic dermatitis. The ingredient is clinically proven to improve skin dryness. The 10 Best Lotions for Eczema of 2023, Tested and Reviewed The Best Lotions for Dry Skin and Ingredients to Look For Best for Frequent Hand Washing Perricone MD Cold Plasma Plus+ Hand Therapy 4.6 Dermstore View On Amazon View On Dermstore View On Lordandtaylor.com Pros Thin and matte formula Works quickly Cons No safety seal on product We tested Perricone MD Cold Plasma Plus+ and felt that it was the best lotion for frequent hand washing-induced dry, cracked hands. Prior to testing this lotion, our hands were extremely dry, especially in the winter. Prior to this, we mainly moisturized our hands at night and throughout the day when our hands felt dry but noticed that we were still incredibly ashy, in pain, and uncomfortable. The first thing we noticed when using Perricone MD Cold Plasma + Hand Therapy was that it's a very matte, lightweight, thin formula, and it absorbed super quickly into the skin. The hand cream glides easily over the skin, making our skin feel noticeably softer immediately. On top of making our dry, cracked hands feel immediately more moisturized, the formula also targets dark spots, veins, and discoloration as well with the best results being after you apply liberally morning, night, and whenever you feel is needed throughout the day. Price at time of publication: $4 Heading Active Ingredients: None listed | Size: 4 ounces | Scented: Not listed Best Dermatologist Recommended Eucerin Advanced Repair Hand Cream Target View On Walmart View On CVS View On Farmandfleet.com Pros Neutral scent Not too sticky Cons Dried down texture can feel slippery Eucerin Advanced Repair Hand Creme won over our hearts and is the best pick for dermatologist-recommended lotion. This hand creme is extremely beneficial for dry, cracked hands due to the fact that it's enriched with ceramide-3 and natural moisturizing factors, including amino acids, much like the ones that are already naturally found in your skin. That means it softens skin and seals in moisture, delivering long-lasting hydrating results. Price at time of publication: $5 Heading Active Ingredients: Amino acids and ceramide-3 | Size: 2.7 ounces | Scented: No Best for Sensitive Skin Soap & Glory Original Pink Hand Food 4.5 Ulta View On Amazon View On Walmart View On Target Pros Easy to use dispenser Quick relief Cons Very strong scent; not suitable for all sensitivities We tested Soap & Glory's Original Pink Hand Food, and it's our pick for the best lotion for dry, cracked, sensitive skin. We found that this lotion was thick, creamy, rich, and moisturizing without being greasy. Using shea butter and natural oils, Soap & Glory's Original Pink Hand Food is easy to spread and aids dry, cracked hands with a formula that locks in moisture, which is pivotal. There aren't many listed ingredients, and it's designed and derm-tested for all skin types, including people like us, with very sensitive and even temperamental skin. We found ourselves using this product three to five times a day because we were obsessed with how moisturized and nourished our hands felt after. Also, after two weeks of use, we still had a substantial amount in the tube, which shows a little goes a long way. Price at time of publication: $8 Heading Active Ingredients: Shea butter | Size: 4.2 ounces | Scented: Yes How We Selected and Tested the Best Lotions for Dry, Cracked Hands Our recommendations were built from a blend of home testing and expert guidance. We consulted with dermatologists such as David N. Lortscher, MD, to find out what you should look for when choosing a hand lotion. For two weeks, we followed the manufacturer's directions on some of the top hand creams and lotions for dry, cracked hands on the market. Before using the cream or lotion, we made sure our hands were completely clean and free of any grit, grime, or other substance that would shift the results of our test. We followed this routine for two weeks to come back with personal, genuine results so you can have options for great hand lotions for dry, cracked hands that we personally love and use. Within this time period, we noted how quickly the lotion spread, how thick it was, how the lotion fared against the elements, how moisturized our hands felt compared to how our hands felt before, any notable fragrances or scents, and how restorative or healing the lotion was. We consider products based on their ingredients, dosage, and whether or not they were formulated specifically for hands. We selected a range of formulations, from lotions to balms, and ones that can treat a variety of conditions, including conditions like diabetes and eczema. While each product meets a different need, we believe that they all address dry, cracked hands and skin. We also based our suggestions based off of research surrounding different health conditions as well to make sure the symptoms would be properly addressed. What to Look for in a Lotion for Dry, Cracked Hands Ingredients When seeking a lotion to treat dry, chafed, chaffed, or cracked skin, look for products that provide moisturizing ingredients such as colloidal oatmeal, ceramides, and natural oils. Look for products that are dermatologically tested or clinically proven to be effective for dry skin. David N. Lortscher, MD, suggests: Oil-based ingredients, including occlusive agents like petroleum or mineral oil to help seal in moistureSoy, which contains active components that helps restore skin barrier function and replenish moistureSilicones: When used in moisturizers, Dr. Lortscher says they act as lubricants and reduce frictionCeramides: Helps decrease dry skin and irritationAloe: Known for skin soothing and healing propertiesHyaluronic acid (HA): It's a humectant, meaning it binds water and holds moisture in the outermost layer of the skin. Sun Exposure Dry and sensitive skin is only further damaged and sensitized when exposed to the sun, so be sure to use a lotion containing sun protection or to apply sunscreen in addition to any moisturizing lotion. Consistency Lotions come in varying consistency, from watery and thin to thick and creamy. When addressing dry, cracked skin, it's important to find a consistency of lotion that's going to help lock in moisture (often found in thicker creams), but that's also still wearable and comfortable for you. Disclaimers for Prolonged Use Some products are not recommended to be used regularly or on an ongoing basis. Read the directions for use and seek medical guidance if in any doubt. Scented vs. Unscented When it comes to scented lotions, an unscented version can limit the risk of additional irritation to the skin. \"For dry, cracked hands, you should generally choose an unscented lotion that is free of alcohol and other common irritants,\" says Dr. Lortscher. Frequently Asked Questions Can you use hand lotion on other areas of the body? Unless specifically stated on the product, you should avoid using hand lotions on other areas of the body, especially the face. According to Dr. Lortscher, \"While hand creams and hand lotions are both kinds of moisturizers, lotions can be a bit drying if they have higher water content. In general, hand creams tend to be more occlusive than hand lotions, meaning they provide a restorative layer of oil on the skin's surface that helps slow down water loss, which is a good defense against cold, dry air.\" How often should you reapply moisturizing lotion? If you're experiencing dry and cracked skin, you should apply hand lotion as frequently as you feel is needed. Dr. Lortscher says he'd recommend applying and reapplying any time the skin feels tight or dry. What causes dry, cracked hands? Dry, cracked hands are typically caused by harsh weather (severe cold winters especially), frequent hand washing or long showers or baths, aging, or health conditions such as eczema and diabetes. When selecting a lotion or hand cream, it's important to keep the potential cause and symptoms of your dry hands in mind so you can find a product that addresses your needs properly. How can you prevent dry, cracked hands? You can prevent dry, cracked skin by applying moisturizing hands lotions and creams daily, after washing, or before going outside and facing weatherly elements. If your dry, cracked hands are the result of a health condition, it's always recommended to keep your health condition's symptoms and traits in mind when selecting a cream or lotion. It's also wise to talk to a medical professional as well. How much should I expect to spend on a hand lotion or cream for my dry, cracked hands? Most hand lotions and creams range from $3 to, on the higher end, $30. Product size and ingredients largely impact lotion price. While our best overall pick L'Occitane's Hand Cream, comes in at $30, you can still find a great product at a much lower cost.
