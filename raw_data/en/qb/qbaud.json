The ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2023 update presents 144 individual topics on allergic rhinitis (AR), expanded by over 40 topics from the 2018 document. Originally presented topics from 2018 have also been reviewed and updated. The executive summary highlights key evidence-based findings and recommendation from the full document. Methods: ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2023 employed established evidence-based review with recommendation (EBRR) methodology to individually evaluate each topic. Stepwise iterative peer review and consensus was performed for each topic. The final document was then collated and includes the results of this work. Results: ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2023 includes 10 major content areas and 144 individual topics related to AR. For a substantial proportion of topics included, an aggregate grade of evidence is presented, which is determined by collating the levels of evidence for each available study identified in the literature. For topics in which a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention is considered, a recommendation summary is presented, which considers the aggregate grade of evidence, benefit, harm, and cost. Conclusion: The ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2023 update provides a comprehensive evaluation of AR and the currently available evidence. It is this evidence that contributes to our current knowledge base and recommendations for patient evaluation and treatment.

KEYWORDS I.AIntroduction The International Consensus Statement on Allergy and Rhinology: Allergic Rhinitis 2023 (ICAR-Allergic Rhini- tis 2023) was developed as an update to the original ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 20181document. The goal of this document is to summarize and critically review the best evidence related to allergic rhinitis (AR). Through a systematic approach including literature review, semi- blinded stepwise iterative review process, and consensus and oversight by associate editors, all steps of doc- ument development have been rigorous and of high quality. ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2023 is not intended to be a clinical practice guideline, meta-analysis, or expert panel report. The ICAR authors have carefully reviewed all relevant literature and determined the strength of the availableevidence.Baseduponthisevidence,whereappli- cable, recommendations are made for various diagnostic and treatment options in the realm of AR. A secondary goal of this document is to identify updates in the field as compared to the previous ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2018 document and highlight advances in our understanding ofAR,aswellasitsdiagnosisandtreatment.Throughthis in-depthinvestigation,wearealsoabletoidentifyareasin whichfurtherworkisneeded. Since the publication of ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2018, therearenumerousnewhigh-levelpublicationsinvarious aspects of AR. There have been updates in levels of evi- dence and recommendations. These findings, along with a comparison to the ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2018 avail- ablepublications,andlevelsofevidence,areshowninthe tables in this executive summary. Still, several important areasoffutureinvestigationremain.I.BMethods In the ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2023 update, there were a total of 144 individual topics assigned to 87 primary authors.Amultidisciplinarygroupofexpertauthorsfrom aroundtheworld,oftenwithanotablepublicationrecord in the field, were invited to contribute to both author- shipanditerativepeerreviewaspectsoftheICARprocess. Topics were assigned as literature reviews, evidence- based reviews without recommendations, or evidence- based reviews with recommendations, depending on the availableliterature,strengthofevidence,andtypeofinter- vention.Topicsthathadsufficientevidencetosubstantiate clinical recommendations were assigned as evidence- basedreviewswithrecommendations,basedonthework ofRudmikandSmith.2 For each section, authors were instructed to perform systematic reviews, which included the Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Review ieswerepresentedintableformat,indicatingthelevelof evidence.Systematicreviews,meta-analyses,andrandom- izedcontrolledtrialswerenotedasprovidingthehighest levels of evidence. An aggregate grade of evidence was determinedforeachtopic,andanevidence-basedrecom- mendationwasmadeconsideringbenefit,harm,andcost foreachtopic,whereappropriate.4 Each section then underwent a stepwise review in a semi-blinded fashion by two additional experts. Consen- sus was reached after each stage in the iterative review process.Thereviewprocesswasoverseenbyanassociate editortoensureadherencetotheICARmethodologyand assist in resolution of any concerns. Following comple- tion of all topics, the individual sections were collated into major content areas (e.g., Evaluation and Diagnosis, 20426984, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

ThefinalICAR-AllergicRhinitis2023documentwasthen compiledandreviewedbyallauthorsforconsensus.

In these cases,anexhaustivelistoflower-levelstudiesmaynotbe providedintheevidencetables. I.CResults I.C.1Definitions,classification,and differentialdiagnosis AR is primarily driven by an immunoglobulin E (IgE)- mediated type 1 hypersensitivity response, due to an allergen exposure. Classically, seasonal AR was thought to be associated with outdoor allergens and perennial AR with indoor year-round exposure to allergens. How- ever,climatechangeandpolysensitizationmaymakethese classifications challenging. Intermittent defined as symptomsforlessthan4daysperweekorlessthanfour consecutiveweeks.PersistentARisdefinedassymptoms formorethan4daysperweekforatleast1month.Sensi- tization to allergens may be identified on skin or in vitro testing which assesses the presence of allergen-specific IgE (sIgE). However, many people that are sensitized do notexhibitallergysymptoms,socorrelationwithclinical symptoms upon allergen exposure is critical. Classic AR symptomsincludesneezing,rhinorrhea,andnasalconges- I.C.1). I.C.2Pathophysiologyandmechanisms Shortly after IgE receptor stimulation, mast cells secrete proteins due to stimulated gene transcription. Multiple cytokines and chemokines are released, which recruit inflammatory cells such as eosinophils, basophils, neu- trophils,macrophages,andTcells. Variousinflammatoryprocessesoccuratdifferentstages of AR. These processes are driven by the type 2 immune response. Considering the pathophysiology soluble mediators, mechanisms, histologic and epithelial changes, epithelial barrier alter- ations, association with vitamin D, alterations in nitric oxide and the microbiome, as well as the unified airway concept.Section VIoftheICAR-AllergicRhinitis2023doc- umentdiscussesARpathophysiologyandmechanisms. I.C.3Epidemiology The prevalence of AR has been reported from 5% to 50% worldwide. Prevalence reporting is dependent on the method of diagnosis and age of participants studied, whichmayexplainsomeofthevariabilityinreportedAR prevalence.Therehavebeenincreasedattemptstoprovide moreuniformityintheterminologyanddiagnosticcrite- ria for AR.

Over 40 new top- ics have been added to this evidence-based assessment since the initial ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2018 publica- tion. In many individual topic areas, numerous addi- tional studies were identified and evaluated. In certain cases, the recommendation level changed. While these advances in our current literature are exciting, there are several knowledge gaps that remain - and there is still work to be done to further our understanding of various aspects of AR pathophysiology, epidemiology, disease burden, diagnosis, management, and associated conditions. 20426984, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

Since the publication of ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2018, the AR literature has continued to grow. We previ- ouslyreportedthattherewere8212publicationsrelatedto AR between 2010 and the final writing of researcher, or medical professional with a reference document that contains useful, relevant information.GiventherecentexpansionoftheARlitera- ture,anupdateoftheoriginalICAR-AllergicRhinitis2018 documentwasdeemedappropriate.When evaluating a scientific publication, it is impor- tanttocriticallyassessthestudymethodsandpresentation of results, as these contribute to the evidence levels and ultimaterecommendationsforpatientcare.ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis2023aimstoincorporatenewhigh-levelevidence intoanupdateddocumentandutilizesthisevidence,along with assessment of benefit, harm, and cost to determine recommendations for AR diagnostic and management strategies,whereappropriate.ICAR-AllergicRhinitis2023 follows previously developed methodology that has pro- duced multiple evidence-based reviews with recommen- dations(EBRR)2intheInternationalForumofAllergyand documents, includ- ingthosecoveringtopicsofAR,rhinosinusitis,endoscopic skullbasesurgery,andolfaction.1,6-9 ICAR-AllergicRhinitis2023wascreatedbyconducting systematic literature searches on 144 individual AR top- ics, by 87 primary authors and 40 additional consultant authors.

ThroughouttheICAR-AllergicRhinitis2023document, itisevidentthatmanyARtopicshavegrowninliterature citations compared to 2018. This may be noted by a sim- ple increase in the number of publications; however, the reader will also recognize that many topic areas contain new systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRMA) that have been published since ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2018.

The clinician should continue to evaluateandtreateachARpatientindividually,usingan evidence-based foundation combined with clinical acu- men/expertise and consideration of patient values and principles. Recommendations in ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2023, as in previous ICAR documents, do not define the standardofcareormedicalnecessity,nordotheydictate thecareofindividualpatients. Through the ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2023 process, sev- eral gaps in knowledge have dencegradeshavechangedsince2018,andweanticipate thatwewillcontinuetoseeevidencegrowandevolve aims toevaluateexistingliteratureoneachARtopic,gradethe evidence, and provide literature-based recommendations whereappropriate. To complete ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2023, the subject of AR was initially divided into 144 individual topics, representing 41 additional topics compared to ICAR- Allergic Rhinitis 2018. A primary author who is a rec- ognized expert in allergy, rhinology, or the designated topic was assigned to evaluate each topic. Authors were initially selected via online literature searches for each ICAR-AllergicRhinitis2023topic.Authorsofhigh-quality publications in each topic area were invited as ICAR contributors. Other invited authors included experts in the EBRR process, experts in education on specific AR topic areas, and those with knowledge of the systematic review process. The invited primary author was able to choose a secondary/consultant author for each section if desired. Certain topics, such as those providing background or definitions, were assigned as literature reviews without evidence grades or recommendations. Some topics were not appropriate for clinical recommendations and were assignedasevidence-basedreviewswithoutrecommenda- tions (EBRs). Topics that had evidence to inform clinical recommendations were assigned as EBRRs. For topics included in ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2018, the author was instructedtoperformanewliteraturesearchandinclude updatedevidencesincethepreviousICAR-AllergicRhini- tis document as well as any other relevant studies pre- viously published. Aggregate grades of evidence and recommendationssummarieswereupdatedaccordingly. CreationofthecontentforeachindividualARtopicarea began with a literature search. Authors received instruc- tions to perform a systematic review of the literature for each topic area based upon Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) best supported by high quality evidence, the search 20426984, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

Reference lists of all identified stud- ies were examined to ensure all relevant studies were captured. If the authors felt that a non-English study should be included in the review, it was instructed that the paper be appropriately translated to minimize the riskofmissingimportantdataduringthedevelopmentof recommendations.3 To optimize transparency of the evidence, all included studies in EBR and EBRR topic sections are presented in a standardized table format and the quality of each studywasevaluatedtoreceivealevelbasedontheOxford LOEs(level1-5,Table IV.A.-1).11Adjustmentsweremade totheLOEduethequalityofeachstudybasedonaccepted standards, with specific changes often highlighted in the text or evidence tables.12At the completion of the sys- tematic review and research quality evaluation for each EBR or EBRR topic, an aggregate grade of evidence (A- D) was produced for the topic based on the guidelines fromtheAmericanAcademyofPediatrics(AAP)Steering Committee on Quality Improvement and Management4 (TableIV.A.-2). For AR topics that addressed a support formulation of a recommendation, the AAP guidelines for recommendation development werefollowed,thuscompletingtheEBRRprocess4(Table IV.A.-3). Each evidence-based recommendation was for- mulated with consideration of the aggregate grade of evidence,benefit,harm,andcost.AsummaryoftheEBRR topicdevelopmentprocessisprovidedinFigure IV.A. It is important to note that assignment of LOE for each publication is not always straightforward. In some instances, individual studies do not fit neatly into one of the Oxford LOE categories. Also, Oxford LOE grading has changed over time, adding complexity to the evi- dence grading when undertaking updates such as this one. This becomes even more difficult when evaluat- ing certain documents that employ advanced systematic evidencesearchestoformulateguidelines,practiceparam- eters, position papers, and recommendation documents (e.g.,ClinicalPracticeGuidelines,ICARstatements,Euro- peanPositionStatementsonSinusitis).Intheseinstances, evenmethodologicalexpertsmaydisagreeonevidencelev- els - some seeing the document as a systematic review 20426984, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

Furthermore, these documents often containmultiplesubsectionsthatvaryintheamountand qualityofavailableevidence.Therefore,whenthesetypes of documents are included in individual topic areas, the assignedLOEsmaydiffer. Throughout the ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis process, when a single publication was cited in multiple sections with differingLOEsinitiallyassigned,thiswasreturnedtothe authors/reviewers of each section for collective discus- sion.Insomecircumstances,thediscussionresultedinthe group deciding to revise the LOE to a consistent assign- mentacrosssections.Inothercases,thegroupssupported their initial LOE assignment with appropriate reasoning - and the original LOE assignments remained.

The prevalence of AR ranges from approximately 5%- 50%worldwide,withthehighestincidenceinthepediatric population.15WhilethisrangeofARprevalenceiswide,it isimportanttorecognizethatpublishedstudiesmayvary intheirdefinitionofARandsomemaydefineARassen- sitization to allergens. (See Section VII. Epidemiology of AllergicRhinitisforadditionalinformationonthistopic.) AR is essentially absent in infants and typically develops in school age children. Since sensitization takes years to develop, it is unlikely to manifest before 2 years of age. This is likely secondary to the rapidly evolving immune systeminherentinachild'searlydevelopment.ARoften results from an overactive response of T helper (Th)-2 lymphocytesandinitiationofasystemicIgE-drivenreac- tion, which can dominate a child's immune system until completelymature. In the atopic individual, exposure to allergens may prompt allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) production. Subse- quent exposure triggers both early and late-stage reac- tions, leading to the clinical manifestations of AR. The early-stage reaction typically occurs within min- utes after re-introduction of the sensitized allergen, pro- ducing rapid onset of nasal itching, congestion, and rhinorrhea.16The late-stage reaction often occurs dur- ing the 4- to 8-h period after allergen re-introduction and results in congestion, hyposmia, increased anterior andposteriorrhinorrhea,andnasalhyper-responsiveness.

For example, seasonal ARmaypersistforlongerperiodssecondarytotheeffects of climate change, with resultant prolonged elevations in pollen counts. Seasonal AR may also continue across multipleseasonssecondarytopolysensitization.Further- more, manifestations of perennial allergy may not occur throughouttheentireyear.Thisisparticularlythecasefor patients allergic to HDM, who may demonstrate mild or moderate/severeintermittentAR.17-20 Because of the priming effect on the nasal mucosa introduced by low levels of pollen exposure,21-26and minimal but persistent nasal inflammation in patients with \"symptom-free rhinitis,\"19,27,28symptoms may not occurentirelyinconjunctionwithallergenexposure.This may result in non-specific exacerbations. Additionally, airpollutionmayalsocontributetovariationsinallergen sensitivity, by symptoms occurring more than4daysperweekforatleastfourconsecutiveweeks.31 Additionally, it was demonstrated that the previous cat- egories of seasonal and perennial AR cannot be used alongwiththenewclassificationofintermittent/persistent AR, as they do not represent the same stratification of the disease state. As such, intermittent AR and persis- tentARarenotsynonymouswithseasonalandperennial classifications.32-35 The ARIA guidelines have likewise proposed another stratificationofseverity(mildandmoderate-severe)with respect to these disabilities.18AR can result in problem- atic symptoms, including sleep disturbance; impairment of daily, leisure, or sport activities; impairment of school orwork;ortroublesomesymptoms.ARisconsideredmildif none of these occur. If one or more of these symptoms exist,ARisclassifiedasmoderate-severe. V.A.2Sensitizationversusclinicalallergy Atopic diseases comprise of a range of linked conditions presentingasmultipleheterogeneousclinicalphenotypes ranging from single organ to multi-system disease.36,37 Currently used taxonomy is largely organ-based and does not fully take into account the mechanisms lead- ing to symptoms.38For example, the 2016 Melbourne epidemic thunderstorm asthma event saw a dramatic increaseinasthma-relatedhospitalizationsand10deaths over a 30-h period.39Interestingly, most patients hospi- talized with severe asthma attack did not have a diag- nosis of asthma. They did have a diagnosis of AR40and allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) appeared to offer protection.41It can be postulated that these patients suf- feredfromasingleIgE-drivenconditionwithaclearpatho- physiological mechanism, for which there are available biomarkers (e.g., sIgE) and mechanism-based treatment (e.g.,AIT).42 Although patients with AR and allergic asthma are by definition sensitized, many individuals with allergic sen- sitizationdonothavesymptomsofallergicdisease,43and in a proportion of patients with AR and allergic asthma, sensitization is not related to the presence or severity of symptoms.38Furthermore, the reliability of skin testing dependsgreatlyonallergenextractsandmethodsused.44 Thus,cliniciansfaceaproblemthatsensitizationonstan- dardallergytestsdoesnotprovethatsymptomsarecaused by allergy. Some subtypes of allergic sensitization are benign and not associated with clinical symptoms, while others are pathologic and lead to a spectrum of disease from single-organ disease to allergic multi-morbidity.42 (See Sections XI.D.11.a.ii. Multi-allergen Immunotherapy andXI.D.11.b.ii.Polysensitizationandforadditionalinfor- mationonthistopic.) Better ways of differentiating clinically significant sen- sitization are needed. Quantification of sensitization through standard diagnostic tests (i.e., sIgE titer, size of skintestwheal)canincreasethespecificity,bothinterms of diagnostic accuracy and the capacity to predict the persistence of symptoms.45-48However, the problem of false-positivetestresultsremains.48Currently,nasalaller- genchallengesisthemostaccuratewaytoconfirmclinical allergy.

V.B.3Occupationalrhinitis Occupational rhinitis is an inflammatory disease of ofnasalcongestion,sneezing,rhinorrhea,itching,and/or variablenasalairflowobstructionduetocausesandcondi- tions attributable to aparticular work environment.124,125 While many social activities or hobbies can result in overlappingsymptoms,stimulithatareencounteredout- side the workplace are not considered occupationally related.126The pathophysiological mechanisms of occupational rhinitis are the same as other forms of chronic rhini- tis although symptoms may be intimately tied to work exposure.1,124,126Occupationalrhinitismaybeclassifiedas allergic, resulting from an immunological exposure to a sensitizinghighmolecularweightprotein(HMW or sometimes subdi- vided into annoyance (e.g., perfumes), irritant-induced (e.g., formaldehyde or smoke), or corrosive rhinitis (e.g., ammoniaoracids),thelatterofwhichmayincludeperma- nent inflammation of the nasal mucosa, ulcerations, and perforationofthenasalseptum.1,124 Cross sectional studies of various workers show a widerangeofoccupationalrhinitisprevalencerates(3%- 87%),124,126,129although rates are higher for HMW agents compared to lower for LMW agents.126Occupations and commonly implicated agents are reported in Table V.B.3.130-135Pre-existing AR or allergic asthma, baseline totalIgE>150kIU/L,oroccupationswithfrequentexpo- sure to animals have been shown to be risk factors for occupationalrhinitis.136,137 Occupational rhinitis tends to be three times more prevalentthanoccupationalasthma,129butthetwodisor- ders are often associated (up to 92% of cases).126In most cases, work-related nasal symptoms develop onset of bronchial symptoms.124,138Conse- quently,occupationalrhinitismaybeconsideredamarker ofthelikelihoodofdevelopingoccupationalasthma.Previ- ouspracticeparametersandconsensusdocumentssuggest that workers in certain high-risk occupations be periodi- callymonitoredbysurveyand/orskinpricktesting(SPT) sothatriskmitigationstrategiescanreducesensitization, and potentially limit progression of occupational rhinitis orthedevelopmentofoccupationalasthma.1,139,140 The clinical presentation of occupational rhinitis does notdifferfromthoseofnon-occupationalchronicrhinitis. Diagnostic assessment must include a thorough clini- cal and occupational history, aimed to investigate the type of symptoms and work-related temporality, and to collect information on specific occupational exposures. Documentation of noxious compounds in the workplace should include examination of available Material Safety DataSheets.124Thepresenceofalatencyperiodbetween beginning of occupational exposure and symptom onset (monthsorevenyears)suggestsanimmunologicmecha- nism.

However, irritant triggers,LMWagents,anddelayedtypereactionsareoften not easily identified by NPT49,124,146,149,150(FigureV.B.3). Validated clinical assessment tools such as the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) or and/or sneeze counts administered pre-and-post exposure may aid in quanti- fying the severity of the response. At some institutions, rhinomanometry is also available to obtain additional quantitativedata.If NPT is negative, further evaluation of work-related changes in nasal parameters at the workplace is rec- ommended, especially in the presence of a highly sug- gestive clinical history.151When possible, a formal site visit may allow the technician to directly observe the workplace environment, symptomatology, and Material Safety Data Sheets, and suggest specific workplace mod- ifications. Due to the strict relationships between upper and lower airways, spirometry and exhaled NO assess- ment should be performed in patients with occupational rhinitis.1,126 The primary treatment of allergic occupational rhini- tis is avoidance or reduction of culprit exposures.126 Pharmacologictreatmentdoesnotdifferfromthatofnon- occupational rhinitis, although medications alone may beinsufficientgiventheintensityandfrequencyofmany workplace exposures.152In allergic occupational rhinitis due to HMW sensitizers, AIT may be considered when validated extracts are available.153However, AIT may havelimitationsinthoseindividualswithcontinuedhigh workplace exposure; therefore, simultaneous mitigation andavoidancestrategiesareessential. Occupational rhinitis has both medical and socioeco- nomic implications,154and may be the cause of leaving work.155Sinceoccupationalrhinitisisacknowledgedasa riskfactorforthedevelopmentofoccupationalasthma,the preventionandearlyidentificationofoccupationalrhinitis of exposed workers may provide an excellent opportu- nitytopreventthedevelopmentofoccupationalasthma.156 (See Section XI.A.6.

These responses are typically non-IgE-mediated by a reflex response which is often termed neurogenic inflammation.159A subset of these individuals involved in single exposure incidents maydeveloppersistentandchronicsymptoms.Thisphe- nomenon has been described as reactive upper airways dysfunction syndrome when only rhinitis symptoms are present,andreactiveairwaysdysfunctionsyndromewhen asthma-likesymptomsarepresent.160,161 Chemicals known to cause respiratory inflamma- tion and in some cases, allergic sensitization includediisocyanates, acid anhydrides, some platinum salts, reactive dyes, and many cleaning products that are used in hospitals and in the pandemic era including glutaraldehyde, quaternary ammonium compounds, and chloramine.134,162-164There is still debate concerning the exactmechanismbehindsensitizationtothesechemicals. However, smaller chemical compounds must associate with larger protein molecules in order to induce an immuneresponse.Asaresult,evaluationofsensitization through skin testing and/or evaluation of sIgE can be helpfulandinthefuture,immunoassaysbasedoncellular responses may serve as better biomarkers of exposure to chemicals.165,166 V.B.5Smokeinducedrhinitis Tobacco smoke exposure is associated with chronic rhinitis and CRS.167-169Other smoke exposure sources besides conventional cigarettes, cigars, and pipes include electronic cigarettes, vaping, and cannabis.

In individuals who reportahistoryofsmokeinducedrhinitis,only briefsmoke exposure (45 parts per million [ppm] for 15 min) leads to increased nasal resistance as measured by posterior rhi- nometry (although there were no significant increases in histamine levels noted).181However,prolongedexposure to moderate levels of smoke (15 ppm for 2 h) induced a congestive response lasting for an hour or longerin both individualswithandwithoutahistoryofsmoke-induced rhinitis.178While objective response may be short lived, patients reported symptoms lasting hours to days follow-ing exposure. Since significant symptom overlap exists, a thorough history and allergy testing can help further differentiate smoke-induced rhinitis from other types of rhinitis. V.B.6Infectiousrhinitis Infectious rhinitis is a very common diagnosis in gen- eral practice. Differences in onset and pathogenic cause lead to various pathophysiologies and forms. Common conditions in general practice are acute viral and bac- terial rhinitis. Nasal symptoms discharge, nasal obstruction, postnasal drip, cough, and facial pressure depending on the etiology. These symptoms may also be present in non-infectious rhinitis; most commonly AR. This diagnostic distinc- tion is important to avoid inappropriate treatment and diagnostic procedures. Distinctive clinical characteris- tics suggestive of AR are sneezing, nasal or ocular itching, the presence of an obvious allergic trigger, and the presence of recurrent seasonal-related symp- toms - these symptoms are less frequent in infectious rhinitis.31,182 Rhinitissymptomsaretheresultofnasalmucosaand/or sinusinflammation.Themucosaofthenoseandsinuses are contiguous.

This leads to the stimulation of the parasympathetic efferent nerve sup- ply to the submucosal glands in the nasal mucosa.224,226 It is additionally possible that interactions between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system could leadtouninhibitedactivityoftheparasympatheticsystem with resultant rhinorrhea.226For example, the chemical capsaicin is known to cause gustatory rhinitis.

Elevation of these cytokines correlated with the ratio of nasal symptom scores/percentage of eosinophils in NARES patients, where of nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, hyposmia, sneezing, and itch- ing were each measured using a 3-point scale.246Sev- eral studies from European cohorts have found a lack of nasal mucosal IgE in NARES patients.247,248More recent studies of Chinese cohorts of NARES patients havefoundincreasedexpressionofCharcot-Leydencrys- tals which correlated with severity eosinophilia.249Elevated cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin SN was also observed loss of sense of smell.250Neuropeptide mediated eosinophil chemotaxis, including substance P, CGRP, and chole- cystokinin octapeptide, has also been described as a contributing factor to the symptomatology in NARES patients.251 NARES may occur in isolation, but it can be asso- ciated with (and may be a precursor for) AERD.235NARES has also been identified as a risk factor for the induction or exacerbation of OSA252and has been associated with increased tendency for lower airway hyperresponsiveness.253 The treatment of non-allergic rhinitis centers on decrease neutrophil and reducemastcellandbasophilmediatorrelease,andresult analysis of three double-blind, randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled studies of 983 patients (309 of whom were classified as NARES) demonstrated a positive treatment effect using INCS with improve- ment in symptoms of nasal and congestion.152,257-259 V.B.10 Non-allergicrhinopathy Non-allergicrhinopathy/rhinitisisachronicrhinitismade by a diagnosis of exclusion of other etiological factors.

Findings included increased blood flow to the olfactory cortex, leading to the hypothesis of an altered neurologicresponse.268,269 Medical management of non-allergic rhinopa- thy includes topical nasal sprays that have variable responses which have been used alone or in combi- nation: INCS,256,270topical azelastine,271and IPB.272 or lavage, especially with tenacious post nasal drip.264 For severely symptomatic patients refractory to medi- caltherapy,surgicalapproachestargetingthevidiannerve and its branches have been shown to result in symp- tom control.229,273These include botulinum toxin injec- tions which result in temporary symptom improvement, endoscopicvidianneurectomy,endoscopicposteriornasal neurectomy,andcryoablationoftheposteriornasalnerve.

A questionnaire distributed to a cohort of adults in Pittsburgh demonstrated that 33% of the younger age group respondents ( n=76, mean age 19 years) regularly reported clear anterior nasal drainage as compared to 74% of the older age group respondents (n=82, mean age 86 years).281It is known that auto- nomic function declines with age as andreceptors become less sensitive.

The worldwide growth of both the aging population and allergic disease has caused an increase in the prevalence of AR in the elderly,278with the prevalence estimated to be around 5%-10%.290,295 However, epidemiologic data is overall lacking and AR in the elderly population is likely under-diagnosed and under-treated. Although there is symptomatic overlap between age-related rhinitis and AR in the elderly, AR is a type I hypersensitivity IgE-mediated reaction,296,297 whereas age-related rhinitis is more similar to vasomo- torornon-allergicrhinopathy/rhinitisinthatallergensdo notplayaroleintheaforementionedphysiologicchanges of the aging nose. AR in the elderly should be treated similarly to AR in the younger population, with INCS, oral and topical antihistamines,290,298and AIT.299For age-related/non-allergicrhinitisrhinorrhea,salinelavage and topical anticholinergics may be therapeutic.277How- ever, both conditions can be concomitantly present in the elderly population, presenting as a \"mixed rhinitis,\" and should be considered in elderly patients who are refractory to typical medical management for a singular disease.

Therehasbeenwelcomeprogressinthediagnosisand treatment of ENS in the past decade. In addition to a history of nasal surgery and abnormally expansive uni- lateral/bilateral nasal airway IT tissue loss, thickened central nasal septum mucosa has been shown to be present in longstanding ENS.323The val- idated patient reported outcome measure Empty Nose Syndrome 6-item Questionnaire (ENS6Q) can be used to quantify the severity of six cardinal ENS symptoms on a 5-point Likert scale. A score 11 indicates ENS.320Place- ment of a cotton plug in the inferior meatus to simulate turbinate bulk (the cotton test) has been validated as an office-based tool to assess/alleviate ENS symptoms.335 A positive blinded cotton test both confirms the ENS diagnosis and informs candidacy for possible treatment interventions.335 ENS has historically been a challenging disease to effectively treat due to debilitating nasal symptomsand, in a minority of patients, concerning psychiatric overtones.336-340Pasttherapieswereconfinedtoreducing the daily burden of ENS symptoms via nasal mainte- nance strategies including moisturizers CPAP [continuouspositiveairwaypressure]use),andpsychiatric interventionslikecognitivebehavioraltherapy.341,342 Currentpublished focus on restoring tis- sue volume to the truncated ITs or statistically significant short351and long352 term the ENS6Q and the Sinonasal Out- comeTest(SNOT)-22.Mechanistically,comparingcompu- tationalfluiddynamicsairflowmodelingpre/post-surgery, thecottontestandIMAPproceduresbothnormalizedis- ordered vectors of ENS airflow,353highlighting a novel function of the turbinates in guiding and/or enhanc- ing nasal airflow.

Treatment includes corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents to induce remission. Cyclophosphamide and rituximab are often used for induction and maintenance. Patients can be transitioned to other immunosuppressive agents (e.g.,azathioprine,mycophenolate,ormethotrexate)with fewer potential side effects when disease remission obtained.363 Eosinophilic granulomatosis with eosinophil-rich, necrotizing granulomatous inflamma- tion involving the respiratory tract.

Careful consideration of these symptoms and environmental triggers may help guide clinicians to thecorrectdiagnoses.

Anatomical conditions, such as septal deviation, turbinate hypertrophy, or nasal valve collapse, over- lap with AR largely by causing nasal obstruction.381Septaldeviationsoftenhaveanasymmetry in airflow, with one side being more obstructed than the other.382-384Nasal valve collapse is often associated with obstruction on inspiration or during exercise.381,382,385 Some congenital anatomical abnormalities such as piri- formaperturestenosisorchoanalatresiaalsocausenasal obstruction,whichtypicallyresultsinlifelongsymptoms, whichmayormaynotbeidentifiedinchildhood.386The majority of these structural conditions should evident onaphysicalexaminationincludingnasalendoscopy.

AR has traditionally been thought of as resulting from an immune response leading to systemic IgE production.439,440The classic example of systemic reac- tivity in AR is the cutaneous reaction VI.A.3 directinformationregardingthetarget-organimmunolog- ical response.265,442-444Studies in recent decades support the concept of local IgE production. LAR is character- izedbyallergicnasalsymptomsinpatientswithnegative systemic allergy testing. However, in these patients, pos- itive NPT and/or detection of nasal sIgE and/or positive basophil activation test (BAT) demonstrate a localized allergicresponse.265,443,445-449 Local IgE production has been demonstrated in patients with AR450-453and LAR.454-463In LAR, sIgE in nasal secretions has been confirmed natural exposure,455,456after controlled exposure to aeroaller- gens by NPT,456,458-460,464and also during periods of non-exposure to aeroallergens.455,456It is theorized that in LAR individuals, sIgE produced at the mucosal level can be enough to sensitize nasal effector cells, but not to reachskinmastcellsortobedetectedinthefreestatein serum.465The immunopathology of local sIgE production in LAR is not completely understood.

Nasal epithelial cells bear TLR nasal epithelium to IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP, which in turn activate dendritic cells, T cells, and type 2 ILCs. ILCs are key players in the pathogenesisofTh2typediseaseslikeAR,CRSwNP,and asthma.489-491Three have been defined basedontheirphenotypeandfunctionalsimilaritiestoTh1 (ILC1),Th2(ILC2),andTh17(ILC3)cells.Thereleaseofthe cytokinesIL-25,IL-33,andTSLPbyepithelialcellsdirectly then they produce the prototypical type 2 cytokinesIL-5andIL-13.492 Allergen challenge in AR subjects anti-IL13 has shown significant reduction of AR symptoms,498pointingtotheimportantroleoftheinnate immune system in the development of symptoms and signs of disease. AIT reduces ILC2's and increases IL-10- at different ARstages,includingsensitization,exacerbations,remod- eling, and remission. Different mediators orchestrate a type 2 immune response.500Most commonly a type 2 inflammatory environment is observed with Th2 cells, M2 macrophages, eosinophils, and type 2 ILCs playing important roles.501Other patterns with mixed type 2 and type 3, or even type 1 may arise depending on the aller- gen protease activity and the microbial and inorganic environments.502,503Asitisvirtuallyimpossibletodefine oneinflammatorypattern,endotypinginARseemshighly importanttodrivepersonalizedmedicine.504 B cells, regulation of eosinophilia by IL-5, and enhancement of type 2 inflammation by IL-9.

Yet, mast cells seem to infiltrate the mucosa and inflammatory cells during thelatephase.535Thisallowsforfurtheraccumulationof cells promoting remodeling with upregulation of matrix metalloproteinasesandangiogenicfactors.536 VI.DCytokinenetworkandsoluble mediators The pathophysiology of AR involves IgE-mediated inflammation which is a type 2 immune response. IgE crosslinking results in mast cell activation and release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, tion of IgE synthesis, upregulation of IgE production, and production of other cytokines and chemokines from epithelial cells which results in the mucosal recruitment of inflammatory cells.537-539Numerous cell types actas sources for type 2 cytokines including T cells, nasal epithelialcells,ILC2s,mastcells,andeosinophils. Nasal epithelial cells secrete inflammatory cytokines and IL-33.540TSLP is a critical upstreamcytokineforILC2s,mastcells,dendriticcells,T cells,andbasophils.541-543IL-25,IL-33,andTSLPsecreted by epithelial cells act on surrounding cells resulting in the release of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 which recruit addi- tional inflammatory cells leading to a type 2 response.544 Nasal epithelial cells are also a source for IL-1, IL-6, IL- 8, and TNF- , and through these signals, play a role in themigrationandactivationofeosinophils,basophils,and Th2cells.545 ILC2saretissueresidentcellsthatcanbestimulatedto secrete cells plays a role in mast cell-induced local IgE synthesis by B cells, which in turn upregulate FcRIexpressiononmastcells.553AlongwithIL-4andIL- 13,TNF-,aproinflammatorycytokineproducedbymast cells, enhances the production mastcellsandepithelialcellsinpromotingandregulating theallergicinflammatorycascade.

These cells are also a major source of inflammatorycytokinesincludingmacrophagemigration inhibitoryfactor,eosinophilperoxidase,andnervegrowth factor.557,558 Finally, Th17 cells may play an important role in AR.

VI.ENeuralmechanisms The pathophysiology of AR is heavily influenced by sen- sory neurons, axonal reflexes, and neurotransmitters.560 Thetrigeminalsensory,sympathetic,andparasympathetic nervous systems work in concert to form a protective barrier in the upper airway mucosa and regulate epithe- lial,glandular,andvascularprocesses.561Branchesofthe trigeminal nerve innervate blood mucous the nasal cavity. The trigeminal nerve has nociceptive A and C fibers that are stimulated by physical and chemical ligands as well as products of allergic reactions.562Inflammatory mediators (e.g., bradykinin, histamine, acetylcholine, and capsaicin) are capable of activating sensory neurons in the trigeminal nerve, largely through TRP ion channels.563-566Through repeated depolarization, lasting changes develop in TRP channels as demonstrated for the TRP cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) and subfamily A mem- ber 1 (TRPA1). This leads to hyperexcitability of neurons in AR patients through changes in stimulation thresh- old and membrane potentials.565,567Studies investigating treatmentwithintranasalcapsaicin,theprototypicligand for TRPV1, have demonstrated significant improvement in nasal congestion, sinus pressure, pain, and headache within 5 min after administration in patients with non- allergic and mixed rhinitis but not clearly in AR.568Fur- thermore,treatmentwithazelastinenosespray,approved bytheFDAfortreatmentofARandnon-allergicrhinitis, hasbeenshowntodownregulateTRPreceptors.563,564 Depolarization these sorynervesleadstothereleaseofneuropeptidesincluding substance P, CGRP, and neurokinin-A.564Substance P receptors are located on nasal epithelium, glands, and arterialandvenousvessels,andsinusoidalvessels,which leads to glandular secretion, increased vessel perme- ability, edema, vasodilation, and further activation of inflammatory cells.562,566,567Substance P has been rec- ognized as a short acting vasodilator while CGRP is a long-acting arterial vasodilator found in increased con- centrations in AR patients compared to controls.567,569,570 Substance P and CGRP also activate mast cells to releasemore inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, that further propagate the hypersensitivity reaction.565Neu- rokinin A, a tachykinin that acts similarly to substance P, causes increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, bronchial smooth muscle contraction, ingbradykininantagonistsandTRPreceptorcalciumion channelblockers.567 Parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves also play a central role in the neural response to allergens. Acetyl- choline and vasoactive intestinal peptide are released parasympathetic response leading to mucous cell secretion, vasodilation, and epithelial cell activation via muscarinic receptors found on the nasal epithelium, vessels.566,567Sympathetic nervesrespondtoneurokininYleadingtovasoconstriction andnasaldecongestion.567Awidelyacceptedmechanism of non-allergic rhinitis has been an imbalance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic response leading to parasympathetic overactivity and manifests as The neuropeptides to peripheral sensitization ofnervefiberswhichcansubsequentlycausecentralsen- sitization a lowered threshold for a given stimulus.569 Neuralgrowthfactor(NGF)isaneurotrophinthatleadsto survivalandgrowthofneuronsthatexpressanNGFrecep- tor.

In that impair mucosal integrity, the epithelium releases alarmins and other DAMPs or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that initiate repair mechanisms and induce protective inflammation.434,584The epithelial inflamma- tory response to allergens is a key feature of AR. The histological characteristics of airway inflammation are commonlygobletcellhyperplasia,mucushypersecretion, basal membrane thickening, and airway smooth muscle hyperplasia.585Thisinflammatoryresponsetranslatesinto mucosaledema,increasedmucosalsecretionsandhyper- responsivenesscommoninAR.Allergens(e.g., Alternaria and HDM) are shown to enhance the chemical mediator productionfromnasalepithelialcells,andtheseallergens may induce not only a type 2 inflammatory response but alsoother,forexample,type1,inflammatoryresponsesin the nasal mucosa.586Nasal epithelial cells of AR patients showed increased expression of pro-inflammatory and IL-1 family cytokines at baseline and under stimulation, which could contribute to a micromilieu which is favor- ablefortype2ofinflammation.587Whetherrobusttype2 inflammation contributes to the development of airway remodeling in AR remains controversial. One study demonstratedthatafterrepeatednasalallergenchallenge, no differences were observed in epithelial integrity, reticular basement membrane thickness, glandular area, expression of markers of activation of airway remodeling including -smooth muscle actin (SMA), samples from patients with ongoing grass pollen AR showed distinct gene expression profiles andfunctionalgenepathwayswhichreflecttheiranatom- icalandfunctionalorigins.589Mucinproduction,regulated by the mucin genes MUC5AC and MUC5B in particu- lar,isupregulatedbyallergens.590Gobletcellhyperplasia in allergic airway inflammation is partially due to high expression of CD44v3, a surface marker for intermediate progenitor cells from basal cells.591AR may be associ- ated with increased epithelial permeability or defective epithelial barriers as a result of decreased expression ofthe TJ proteins occludin and zonula occludens (ZO)-1.485 Impairment of ZO proteins are observed in AR patients and dysfunction of ZOs allows allergens to pass into the subepithelium.592This may also be mediated by various factors such as deacetylase activity593and defi- ciency of the MUC1 gene.594Some as Der p 1 in HDM, have protease activity and can directly compromise the epithelial barrier.427Dysfunction of the epithelial barrier and allergen entry into the submucosa maytriggertheinflammatorycascadeobservedinAR.(see SectionVI.G.EpithelialBarrierAlterationsforadditional informationonthistopic.) VI.GEpithelialbarrieralterations The epithelial barrier consists of different layers that defend against airborne pollutants, allergens, and pathogens, while maintaining homeostasis within the subepithelial compartment. Over 40 years ago, epithelial barrier leakiness was described in AR.595A defective epithelial barrier may facilitate allergens and pathogens peptides(includingmucins)arefound,mainlyprotecting against pathogens, but also more, a large part of the nasal microbiome is found within this layer. However, improperly cleared bacteria and fungi may lead to colonization and activation of the adaptive immune system, accentuating the cycle of inflammation. Proinflammatory cytokines Microbial derived short chain fatty acids also impact the epithelial barrier. Sodium butyrate leads to blocking of histone deacetylase, restoring defective deacetylase inhibitors show strong antiallergic effectsinaHDM-sensitizedmousemodel.593 The epithelium itself creates the main barrier. Inter- cellular junctions are prerequisites of an intact barrier.

This may contribute to the recently observed increase in allergies worldwide.605The cause and consequence of a defective epithelial barrier in AR remains open for additionalresearch.

VD3 is obtained from two distinct sources, diet andultraviolet-mediatedsynthesisintheepidermallayer of the skin.608In the skin, ultraviolet rays promote bio- chemical reactions converting 25-VD3 to 1,25-VD3. The liver and kidneys also play important roles in 1,25-VD3 synthesis. The active form of VD3 binds to vitamin D receptors (VDR), ultimately modulating gene transcrip- tionandexpression.609VDRsarepresentinseveralorgan systems including bone, skin, intestines, kidneys, brain, eyes, heart, pancreas, and immune cells.610VD3 is an important immune mediator influencing T cell activa- tion, cytokine production, and B lymphocyte inhibition.

Recent systematic reviews have demonstrated somesupportforVD3inreducingasthmaexacerbations, but further well-designed studies are required.615,616This hasledtomorerecentinvestigationsintotherelationship betweenVD3andAR.

Similarly, the data on VD3 supplementation for AR is inconclusive. Multiple RCTs looking specifically at children with AR have demonstrated symptom improve- ment following VD3 supplementation.620,621However, a recent systematic review concluded that there is insuffi- cient evidence to support VD3 supplementation for AR prevention.619Given the widespread prevalence of VD3 deficiency and its impact upon a spectrum of health aspects,physiciansshouldconsiderevaluatingVD3levels, especiallyinchildren. In summary, VD3 has critical immunomodulatory effects and has been implicated in other allergic disease processessuchasasthma.Thereappearstobeastronger association between VD3 and AR physiological homeosta- sis and regulation of airway inflammation628,629through the expression three isoforms: neuronal NO synthase (eNOS), and inducible NOsynthase(iNOS).630 NO is a key molecular player in the primary host defense and its cytotoxic effects are essential to pre- ventpathogeninfection.631-634However,thebacteriostatic or bactericidal effects of NO may be species-specific.635 Recent studies demonstrate that bactericidal activities could elicit bitter taste receptor-activated downstream responses, enhancing the production of NO.636-638NO has also shown antiviral effects against DNA and RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, by partially inhibiting virus replication.639-641Moreover, NO is an important modulator of epithelial ciliary beating - important for the clearance of pathogens - through activation of the sGC-GMPc-PKG pathway.642-645Based on these findings, NO plays a protective role against a variety of microbial infections631,646-650and has been considered an impor- tant mediator in pathophysiological events underlying inflammatoryairwayresponses.651,652 NO also causes disruption of Treg cell-mediated tol- erance. Accordingly, NO derived from iNOS and eNOS affects the differentiation of helper T cells and the effec- torfunctionsofTlymphocytes.653,654ThefunctionofTcell mediated immunity can be regulated by endogenous NO various concentrations.655-657NO secreted by activated dendriticcellsplaysacomplicatedroleinrestrictingTcell activity,byinducingdendriticcellstimulatorycapacityon Tcells.658-663Therefore,NOmighthave potentialimpact in the regulation of inflammatory responses through its interactionwithTregcells.

ICAR-AllergicRhinitis2018presentedanumberofstud- ies that linked the gut microbiome to the development ofallergicdisease,specificallyinchildren.686-691However, differing methodologies, sample sizes, and culture tech- niques used in each study made it difficult to interpret resultsanddrawconclusions.1Intheyearssincethen,the roleofthemicrobiomeinthedevelopmentofARhasbeen furtherinvestigated. In an analysis of gut microbial composition of adults withARcomparedtohealthycontrols,Wattsetal.692con- cluded that the AR reduced overall microbial diversity,withmoreabundant Bacteroidetes anddecreased Firmicutes phyla. Similar results were reported by Zhou et al.693in a smaller patient series and by Hua et al.694inanevaluationoftheassociationofthegutmicrobiome and self-reported allergy utilizing data from the Ameri- can Gut Project. The Firmicutes phyla is associated with butyrate production, which is an important regulator of the intestinal barrier via TJ modulation. It is hypoth- esized that decreased butyrate may lead to increased pro-inflammatorymolecularactivityinthesubmucosa.692 in of patients with AR, CRS, and a control group, Gan et al.696did not find a significant dif- ference in microorganism richness or diversity between the groups. Similarly, in a study evaluating the role of AIT on the nasal microbiome of patients with AR, Ben- der et al.697showed no difference in the nasal microbial richnessbetweenpatientswithARandcontrols,although they did conclude that AR patients have more similar microbiomestoeachotherthantocontrols.Ganetal.696 identified an association between Spirochaetae and AR, ahigherabundanceof Pseudomonas andPeptostreptococ- caceaeinAR,andlowerabundanceof Lactobacillus inAR.

Interestingly, the differentially detected microorgan- ism species in the adult population studied by Watts et al.692were not always consistent with those found in reports that included children.698The reason for this is unclear.Nonetheless,themicrobespresentininfancycan- not be extrapolated to adults. However, there is evidence that altered DNA methylation patterns in upper airway mucosal cells during infancy contributes to the develop- ment of AR into childhood.699Longitudinal studies to understand shifts in the microbiome of AR patients over timewillberequired. While it seems apparent that microbiome biodiversity is associated with microbiome fitness and alterations are associated with disease states, including AR, there are studies that contradict this assertion.700Specific mech- anisms of the microbe-host relationship are not well understood.Futureresearchshouldprovideamorecom- plete understanding of the dynamic human microbiome during all ages and at all anatomic sites and its impact on AR.

Mechanisms proposed for the interaction between upper and lower airway dysfunc- tion include altered breathing patterns, nasal-bronchial reflex, and uptake of inflammatory mediators in the sys- temic circulation.724Most convincingly, AR may result in nasal blockage and the preference for oral breathing, which is associated with asthma.725Additionally, small molecules such as molds and cat dander - which may pass through the upper airway into the lower airway - are associated with an increased risk for asthma; larger m o l e c u l e ss u c ha st r e ea n dg r a s sp o l l e na r ep r i m a r i l y associatedwithupperairwaysymptoms.726Theevidence supporting other hypotheses are weak.

VIIEPIDEMIOLOGYOFALLERGIC RHINITIS VII.A Epidemiologyofallergicrhinitis inadults To assist in concretely defining the prevalence of AR in adults,recentliteraturehasattemptedtoprovidemoreuni- formityintheterminologyanddiagnosticcriteriausedto identify it. The International Study of Asthma and Aller- gies in Childhood (ISAAC), ARIA, the European Com- munity AR definitions affect prevalence estimates. Incidence of physician-diagnosed AR, which entails the precondition of being diagnosed or informed of AR affliction, poten- tiallyunderestimatesAR,asreflectedintheSouthKorean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data from 2008 to 2012 (35.02% according to questionnaire responses and ARIA guidelines; 14.89% when \"diagnosed with AR by a medical doctor\").738 Likewise, the inclusion of at least one allergen test reac- tion (e.g., positive reaction to SPT) resulted in a lower prevalence estimates for AR in a Danish study in 2010 (AR,39.0%;ARwithSPTreaction,25.9%),aChinesestudy in 2018 (AR, 32.4%; AR with SPT reaction, 18.5%), and KNHANESdatafrom2008to2012(currentAR,35.02%;AR based on allergy tests: 17.56%).738-740Identification of AR according to ICD codes from databases generally yielded lower estimates for AR (German AOK Saxony database study,6.2%).741Conversely,estimatesforlifetimeARwere slightly higher than that of current AR, which was often definedasoccurringwithin12months;thiswasobserved in the Troms\u00f8 Study Fit Future 2, an expansion of the Troms\u00f8Study(currentAR,26.0%;everAR,28.9%).742-744 Additionally,agerangesofgivenstudysamplesmayalso capture subjects at different stages of the putative atopicmarch.745KNHANES identified a falling AR prevalence from21.1%in20-to29-year-olds,to5.4%inover60-year- olds.746Considering all age ranges, AR prevalence in a Swedish study of 18- to 65-year-olds was 24%, and 27.2% in an Iranian study of 20- to 65-year-olds.747,748Although timeofyearandstudylocationmaypotentiallyaffectthe presence of allergens and manifestations of AR, this dis- crepancycanoftenbeobviatedbyincludingthetemporal rangeofanytime\"inthelast12months.\" Notably, studies spanning longer periods of time have notedchangesintheprevalenceofAR.AFinnishstudyof conscripts' medical data identified a 100-fold-increase in ARprevalencefrom1966to1993,andreachedanapprox- imate plateau around 10.7% in 2017.749Similarly, in Italy, prevalence of AR increased estimates put AR prevalence at around 25%. Variations in the prevalence were likely due to dif- ferences in participants' age, and thus the corresponding stageoftheatopicmarch.Regardless,consideringthedata available, the worldwide prevalence of AR likely ranges between5%and50%. VII.BEpidemiologyofallergicrhinitis inchildren Several studies have attempted to describe the incidence and prevalence of AR in the pediatric population. AR symptoms have been shown to manifest in children as young as 12 months of age.752A separate study children from ages 4 to 8 years old.755 Most studies regarding AR prevalence in children are cross-sectionalindesign,ofwhichthePhase1andPhase 3 ISAAC remain among the largest undertaken to date. 20426984, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

In the 13-14-year age group, the lowest prevalence was in Northern and Eastern Europe (9.2%), and the high- est regional prevalence rates were recorded in Africa (18%) and Latin America (17.3%). Several follow-up stud- ies of similar design have been performed on smaller scalesinseveralcountriesacrosstheworld.Forinstance, such survey-based epidemiologic studies have been per- formed in children from Costa Rica (42.6% prevalence), Japan (18.7% in 6-8-year-olds, 26.7% in 13-14-year-olds), Nigeria (19.4% in 6-17-year-olds), Brazil (range of 45.3%-35.4% in children over 10 years of age), and Ecuador (48% in 3-5-year-olds).760-765These stud- ies also indicate an overall increase in AR prevalence with age into young adulthood. Recent Chinese stud- ies have estimated an AR prevalence averaging 28.6% in 6-12-year-olds in Wuhan and 28.9% in 5-18-year-olds over-orunderestimatingprevalenceofARbecauseofdis- paritiesinrespondereducationandresearcherdefinitions of AR.769Also, one must consider differences accounted for by measuring point prevalence and lifetime preva- lence of AR. Pols et al.770investigated AR prevalence by usingphysician-diagnosedandtreatedatopicdiseaseina primary care database consisting of 478,076 children and found the peak point-prevalence of AR to be 5.7% at 18 years.Thelifetimecumulativeincidenceinthisstudywas much higher at 16%-22.5%. A separate study conducted by Kurukulaaratchy et al.771in the Isle of Wight birth cohort (1456 participants) performed SPT to define AR and observed prevalence from 5.4% at 4 years to 27.3% at 18years.Inaseparatelongitudinalstudycomprising5471 childrenfrombirthto10years,deJongetal.772estimated a prevalence of allergic sensitization to be 32.2% when usingskintestingresultsand12.4%whenusingphysician diagnosis. Taken together, the available evidence indicates that the prevalence of AR in children increases with age into youngadulthood.Moreover,theprevalenceofARhaspre- viously been reported to be increasing across the globe. Itshouldbenoted,however,thatrecentlypublisheddata indicate that this trend of increasing AR prevalence may notpersistintothefuture,althoughsubstantialgeographicdifferencesexist.773Theunderlyingfactorsthatdetermine prevalence are complex, multifactorial, and reviewed in detailinthesectionsthatfollow. VII.CGeographicvariationandeffect ofclimateonprevalenceofallergicrhinitis The prevalence of AR varies significantly based on geo- graphic location. However, other factors such as popula- tion density (urban vs. rural) can further alter AR rates withinthesamelocale.Oneimportantchallengeinmean- ingfully comparing AR rates between locations is the variability created by differences in study subject recruit- mentandmethodofdiagnosingAR.Forexample,Bauchau andDurham,17whodiagnosedpatientsviaserologicalIgE testingafterapositivetelephonescreen,reportedthatBel- gium had an AR prevalence of 28.5% (the highest of the European countries he evaluated). On the other hand, Bousquetetal.,774whoskintestedrandomlysampledsub- jects,reportedarateinBelgiumof16.4%,oneofthelowest of15countriesexamined. Given the difficulty in standardizing AR prevalence studies across different locations, there have been major internationaleffortstoexaminenationalprevalencerates of AR using standardized methods (i.e., ECRHS and ISAAC).Thesestudiesshowmarkedgeographicvariation with a higher prevalence of AR in \"English speaking\" countries (i.e., United Kingdom [UK], Australia, New Zealand), a higher rate in Western Europe than in East- ern Europe, and a higher prevalence in countries with higher rates of asthma and sensitization to seasonal allergens.775,776However, these studies have evaluated nationalratesfromonlyoneorafewcenterswithineach country,andsubstantialintra-countryvariationmayoccur. For example, the prevalence of AR varies from 9.6% to 23.9%in18majorcitiesinChina.777 Geographic variation in AR prevalence may also be impacted by climate change, which has an association withlengtheningpollenseasons,increasingpollencounts, andbroadening/alteringthetypicalvegetativespeciesfora location.778Climatechangehasbeenestimatedtobeasso- ciated with increased seasonal pollen exposures, and as a result, sensitizations are anticipated to more than dou- bleinthenextfewdecades,particularlyincolderclimates thatpreviouslyweresparedfromhigherratesofseasonal AR.779Additionally, this increased environmental expo- sure has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of AR as well as patient symptoms of atopic nasal diseases.780,781 When assessing geographic variations associated with AR, differentiating between seasonal and perennial AR is also an important consideration not examined in the ECRHS or ISAAC studies.

In addi- tion,gene-environmentinteractioneffectsandepigenetics studiesarebrieflycovered.1Singlenucleotidepolymorphisms(SNPs) associatedwithallergicrhinitis Genome-wide association studies. GWASs, with their unbiased approach that includes hundreds of thousands of common variants, have successfully identified impor- tant genes for complex diseases over the past decade (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/ ). Thirty-four GWASs involving AR (or seasonal AR/hay fever) have been published up to November 2021, of which nine (one exome-sequencing project) reported hits (Table VIII.A). 32) have been strongly associ- ated with AR in five of the GWASs,791-795as well as with asthma,792,796eczema,793,797and other allergy-related co- morbidities.791,796,798LRRC32 is known to regulate T cell proliferation,cytokinesecretion,andTGF- activation.799 These associations support the concept of shared genetic mechanisms for AR and other allergy-related diseases. This concept is further supported by a GWAS on self- reported cat, dust mite, and pollen sensitization (as well as AR), which revealed 16 shared susceptibility loci with strong association ( p<5\u00d7108;TLR-locus top hit).792 Strong overlap between top loci for sensitization and self-reported allergies also are found in two of the larger GWASs.792,800In a recent GWAS specifically designed to evaluate pleiotropy between asthma, eczema, and hay fever, a total number of 136 SNPs were identified at the genome-wide significant level (including 73 novel at the time), of which only six SNPs showed evidence for disease-specificeffects.801Inafollow-upstudy,additional novel loci for comorbid allergic disease were identified by applying a gene-based test of association.802The only larger exome-sequencing study published to date identified rare variants in IL33, a well-known gene asso- ciated Asexpected,largerstudieswithbetterpowerallowfor improvedabilitytoaccuratelydetectnovellociandpoten- tiallynovelAR-relateddiseasemechanisms.Recently,very largeGWASswereabletoconfirmmanyofthepreviously identified Candidategenestudies.

For example, SNPs in genesinvolvedinantigenpresentation(e.g., HLA-DQA1 ), pathogen (e.g., TLR2,7,/eight.LP), IL signaling, and pro-inflammatory signaling (e.g., IL13,IL1/eight.LP,TSLP)h a v e been highlighted.804-810However, many of the candi- date gene study findings have not been well-replicated across studies and populations.811,812This could be due to lack of power from small sample sizes, inconsistent phenotype definition, or lack of true disease associa- tion. 2Gene-environmentinteractionsand epigeneticeffects Epigeneticmechanisms,definedaschangesinphenotype orgeneexpressioncausedbymechanisms(e.g.,methyla- tion)otherthanchangesintheunderlyingDNAsequence, have constitute a link between genetic andenvironmentalfactors.RecentstudiesshowthatDNA methylation in children is very strongly influenced by well-known risk factors for allergic diseases, such as tobaccosmoking/maternalsmokingduringpregnancy,813 air pollution exposure,814and length of pregnancy.815 However, it is not currently known if these methylation changesarepartofacausalpathwayinthedevelopment of AR (and asthma), or if these epigenetic biomark- ers are simply markers of exposure. Still, several studies haveconvincinglylinkedmethylationprofilestoAR816-818 and IgE-related outcomes.819,820Recently, methylation signatures in nasal epithelial brushes were shown to be strongly associated with AR (and also asthma).821 Also, epigenetic studies have highlighted shared molec- ular mechanisms underlying asthma, eczema and AR pathophysiology.822 In summary, a family history of AR remains one of the strongest risk factors for disease development, and strong associations with genes involved in anti- gen presentation (e.g., HLAgenes), T cell activation (e.g.,LRRC32), and innate immunity (e.g., TLRs)h a v e been identified. Shared genetic mechanisms for AR and other allergy-related diseases clearly exist. These novel findings lend insight into mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AR, as well as comorbid atopic con- ditions, and may aid drug discovery efforts for novel disease targets. With increasing evidence for the role of epigenetics in AR, future research should also focus on investigating mechanisms, thereby providing a func- tional explanation for the link between genetics vari- ants, environmental exposures, and disease develop- ment.Riskfactors-genetics Aggregategradeofevidence: C (Level 3: 8 GWASs and 1 exome sequencing study.

It has also been observed in several studies that expo- sure to early-life farming may protect against childhood allergic diseases particularly, exposure to farm animals and stables.1017-1027In a recent meta-analysis by Camp- bell et al.,1017the risk of sensitization measured by sIgE or SPT in childhood or adulthood was 40% lower among children who had lived on a farm during the first year of life. Further, a 2017 US case-control study showed farm exposure in utero provides even greater protection against sensitization in adulthood.1018While an isolated exposure to bacterial endotoxin was claimed to have asimilar protective effect, the results thus far have been inconclusive.1028,1029 Increased diversity in the gut and skin micro- biome has been associated with a protective effect on atopy.686,689,691,694,1030-1032Recently, three large cohort studies have reported that reduced bacterial diversity in the infant's intestinal flora within the first 6 years of life predisposes them to a higher risk of developing AR.687,691,1033Notwithstanding this, a meta-analysis of 29 trials did not find supplementation of probiotics to preg- nantmothersorinfantsbeneficialinpreventingatopy.1034 A publicly available American Gut Project questionnaire and database was used in a study to determine the fecal microbiotarichnessandcompositioninadultswithAR.694 They found an imbalance (dysbiosis) of gut flora with higherBacteriodes and reduced Clostridia taxa in this population.

There has been a trend toward use of disease specificQOLmetrics,especiallytheRQLQ.1048Asthishas become more accepted, the use of general health related QOL metrics such as Short Form 12 and 36 (SF-12/36) has decreased.1049,1050A measure of QOL used in CRS, theSNOT-22,hasnowbeenstudiedinAR.1051Thisstudy showed SNOT-22 was able to assess QOL and response to treatment in AR. Olfaction, an objective measure of QOL also typically used in CRS, has also been studied in AR recently. Olfactory dysfunction was identified in 44% of patients with AR.1052The use of SNOT-22 and objectivemeasuresofolfactioncouldsimplifyimplemen- tationofQOLmonitoringforbothdiseasesfromaclinical standpoint(Table availability of disease specific QOL instru- ments, many studies continue to rely on unvalidated methods to assess QOL. This leads to difficulty com- paring outcomes between some studies. A recent SRMA evaluated the outcomes of medical therapy with INCS, oral antihistamines, or AIT for AR. Treatment with oral antihistamines and AIT had a statistically signifi- cant impact on QOL. Despite near universal acceptance of INCS for the treatment of AR, meta-analysis of the impact of INCS on QOL could not be performed due to a lack of available data.1043There are numerous individual RCTs evaluating the effect of INCS,1053oral antihistamines,1054-1057and AIT.1058-1061The overarching findingsintheseindividualRCTsisthatthesetreatments improveQOL.

As expected, these studies show impacts on QOL in this population. More surprisingly, they show impacts on parental QOL as well.1064-1067In one study, parents overestimate their children's QOL.1068This focus on assessing QOL in children and adolescents with AR was built on prior work measuring general QOL in chil- drenwithinstrumentssuchasKINDL.1069Disease-specific instruments(PediatricRhinoconjunctivitisQualityofLife Questionnaire [PRQLQ] and RhinAsthma now been developed to measuretheimpactofARonQOLinpediatricandadoles- centpopulations.1064,1070Inchildrenandadolescentswith persistent AR, those with nasal obstruction secondary to septal deviation or turbinate hypertrophy have the worst QOL.1067Nasalendoscopyshouldbeconsideredinpatients in this population not responding to therapy to ensure nasalobstructionisnotcontributing. VariationsinQOLinARpatientshavenotbeenprospec- tively studied over time. Most studies are either cross- sectional or have short follow-up periods with few time points at which QOL is assessed. Control groups from RCTs and meta-analyses of RCTs can provide insight into long-term variation in QOL in AR, however. Two RCTs have studied the effect of oral antihistamines with afollow-upperiodofatleast6months.1056,1057TheseRCTs showthatboththeplaceboandtreatmentgroupsexperi- enceclinicallyandstatisticallysignificantlyimprovements in generic and disease specific QOL, but the improve- ment is greater in the treatment arm. A more recent meta-analysisofacombinationINCSandintranasalanti- histamine showed short-term but not long-term QOL improvement with this treatment.1042This latter finding, however, was based on a single study.1071AIT RCTs have longerfollow-upperiods(12monthsto3years)andshow similar results, with placebo patients either remaining at baseline or improving to a lesser degree than the treat- mentarms.1058,1059,1061Asexpected,patientswithseasonal AR have worse QOL during seasons in which they are exposed to allergens and improved QOL outside of these seasons.1072 20426984, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

AR results in 3.5 million missed workdays and 2 million missed school days.1189However, indirect costsaccountforalargerproportionoftheburdenofAR than the direct costs.1178In the US, AR has been shown to contribute to greater than $5 billion (US) in lost pro- ductivity yearly.1190These costs include absenteeism, but health impairments of AR are often not severe enough to cause absenteeism. AR symptoms can interfere with cognitive functioning, resulting in fatigue and impaired learning, concentration, and critical thinking leading to presenteeismorreducedproductivitywhileatwork.1191As such, presenteeism accounts for the majority of reduced productivityrelatedtoAR.1192-1194 In the US, AR is the most prevalent condition among the workforce, and accounted for 52 symptomatic days per year with a mean productivity loss of $518 (US) per employee per year.1195In the UK, impaired productivity and/or missed work occurred as a result of AR in 52% of patients.1183InIndia,37%percentofsurveyedpatientswith AR endorsed presenteeism and TheNetherlands,indirectcostswereestimatedtobe\u20ac3681 perpatientannually,andpresenteeismaccountedforthe majorityoflostproductivity.1179InaSpanishstudy,presen- teeism made up 95% of the loss in productivity and was estimated\u20ac1772peryear.1192 Additionally, there are indirect economic losses that comefromcaregiversmissingworkwhileachildisabsent from school.

In addition, patients may complain of other symptoms associated with comorbidities including ocular pruri- tis, erythema, and/or tearing (allergic conjunctivitis), oral cavity or pharyngeal pruritis (allergic pharyngitis), throat clearing, and wheezing or cough (reactive airway 20426984, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

Ziade et al.1214studied a prospective cohort of adult patientswithARsymptomsandskintestingconfirmation, showing that mucosal edema and bluish discoloration of the ITs were highly predictive of the severity of AR dis- ease(p<0.05)whencomparingpatientswithmildversus moderate/severeAR.Conversely,earlystudiesbyJareon- charsrietal.1215andErenetal.1216evaluatedapopulation ofadultsandchildrenwithARconfirmedbyallergytest- ing, not provideareliablediagnosisorcorrelatewithspecificnasal symptomsofAR. Additionally, Ameli et al.1217evaluated a large cohort of children with suspected AR and confirmed with skin testing, reporting that endoscopic findings of IT or MT septal contact as well as pale mucosa and large adenoid volume were highly predictive for AR. Notably, there were conflicting results in a previous study by the same group that reported no predictive role of pale mucosa as an endoscopic sign for AR.1218The possible explanation could be related to the smaller sample analyzed in the previousstudy. Polypoid change of the MT has also been correlated with the diagnosis of AR as shown by White et al.,1219 who described 16 patients with polypoid changes/polyps of the MT, all of which had positive allergy testing.

In this technique, 0.02-0.05mlofdilutedallergenextractisintroducedinto the dermis with a needle. The dilutions used are 100- to 1000-fold less concentrated than those used for SPT. The response is measured at 10-15 min after injection. A sig- nificantwhealandflarereactionsuggeststhepresenceof preformed IgE bound to the surface of cutaneous mast cells,andthusatype1hypersensitivitytothetestedaller- gen.Intradermaltestingisconsideredtobemoresensitive thanSPT,butnotnecessarilymorecapableofidentifying clinically relevant allergy.1246Intradermal testing may be usedasaprimarydiagnosticmodalityanditsperformance for some allergens, such as Alternaria, may be similar to SPTorinvitrotesting.1259Amorecommonapproachisto perform intradermal testing after a negative SPT to iden- tifylowerlevelallergicsensitivity.Someallergistsalsouse intradermal testing in a titrated fashion (using multiple allergendilutions)withthegoalofmoreaccuratelyquanti- fyingallergicsensitizationorasameanstoselectastarting dose for AIT.1260Intradermal dilutional testing (IDT) is roughly equivalent to SPT in the diagnosis of inhalant allergy,1253and IDT endpoint correlates with SPT wheal singleintradermaltestsrelativetoSPT.1262 As skin testing should beperformedinconjunctionwithappropriatepositiveand negativecontrols.Anegativecontrolshouldincludeappro- priately diluted test solutions (e.g., glycerin for aqueous extracts). A positive control should contain dilutedhistaminebase(e.g.,10mg/ml).1246Measurement ofthewhealandflareresponseisusedtodetermineaposi- tiveresult;however,thresholdsforapositivetestmayvary because studies have not been performed to standardize test grading. A wheal size 2-4 mm larger than the neg- ative control is often used as the threshold for a positive test.1246,1262 Assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of intra- dermal testing is hampered by multiple variables in the published studies. These include the concentration and volume of allergen injected, the definitions of a positive test, variation in allergens tested, and the \"gold stan- dard\" comparator used for analysis.1263As a stand-alone diagnostic for AR, using studies with nasal provoca- tionasthereferencestandard,estimatesforsensitivityfor intradermal testing range between 60% and 79%, is in the range of 68%-69%.143,1253In compari- son,ameta-analysisofSPTtrialshadpooledestimatesof 88.4%sensitivityand77.1%specificityforSPT,1264suggest- ing superiority of SPT as a stand-alone allergy diagnostictest. Nevertheless, intradermal tests are still used when a highly sensitive skin test is desired. This may be par- ticularly important when testing with non-standardized allergenextracts(e.g.,molds,trees)(Table X.B.2). Intradermal tests are also employed when SPT is neg- ative but history strongly suggests an allergic sensitivity, andmaybeparticularlyusefulinpatientswithlowerskin sensitivity.1246Negativeintradermaltestingmaybehelpful inrulingoutIgE-mediateddisease.1262Ontheotherhand, the addition of intradermal testing in the setting of SPT negativitymayresultin20%morepositiveallergyskintest- ingresults,andtheclinicalsignificanceoftheseresultsis an important question that adding intra- dermal testing to SPT only increased the sensitivity from 87%to93%forTimothygrassallergywhennasalprovoca- tion was used as the comparator.

Thus, while about 30% of patients with a clear clinical history of cat allergy had a positive cat allergen challenge despite a negative SPT, the addition of an intradermal test did not improve the diagnosticaccuracyofskintesting.

X.B.3Blendedskintestingtechniques The combined use of SPT and intradermal testing for a specific allergen is referred to as \"blended\" allergy testing.1261,1274,1279One example, originally described byKrouse and Krouse1280as a method to establish an \"end-point\" for a specified allergen, was described as \"modified quantitative testing\" (MQT) and serves as an example of a blended technique. MQT involves an algo- rithm where SPT is used initially to apply an antigen. Depending upon the SPT result, an intradermal test may or may not be applied.1261,1274,1279,1280With these results, the algorithm is used to determine an endpoint for each antigen tested.1261,1274,1279,1280The endpoint is con- sidered to be a safe starting point for AIT.1280Other protocols may combine the use of SPT and intrader- mal testing but not for the purposes of establishing an endpoint.1273,1281Instead, an intradermal test may be used following a negative SPT to determine allergen sensitization.1273,1281 AITbasedontheresultsofMQThasshowntobesuc- cessfulandtoinduceimmunesystemchangesinlinewith other skin testing techniques.1280However, Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

From the literature, roughly two study approaches to determine the role of tIgE are identified: population- based studies (e.g., birth cohorts, school health surveys, or general population approaches) and hospital-based studiesincludingpatientsvisitingotorhinolaryngologyor allergy clinics. Data from the first approach show con- flicting evidence.

X.C.6Componentresolveddiagnostic testing The implementation of molecular allergy diagnostic approach, or PAMD@, is increasingly entering into rou- tine clinical care.1330Although PAMD@ may initially appear complex to interpret, with increasing experience, the information gained is relevant and allows improved management of allergic diseases. By measuring sIgE to purifiednaturalorrecombinantallergens,PAMD@allows clinicianstoevaluateallergensensitizationattheindivid- ualproteinlevel,thusallowingpotentialidentificationof disease-elicitingmolecules. Inadditiontopotentiallyimprovingdiagnosticaccuracy, molecular diagnostics also aid in distinguish- ingcross-reactivityphenomenafromtrueco-sensitization and resolving low-risk markers from high-risk markers of disease activity. When compared to diagnosis based on sIgE determination and/or SPT with raw commer- cial extracts, MD may improve the identification of disease-causing allergen sources and the prescription of AIT.1330,1409-1412Changes in AIT prescriptions as a result of MD have demonstrated cost-effectiveness.1413Ar e a l - life study showed that although SPT was less expensive, MD allowed a more precise prescription of AIT, which substantially reduced treatment costs and the combinedcosts for diagnosis and treatment.1414MD may also aid with risk stratification by identifying certain patterns of sensitization to pollen allergens that are at higher risk of adverse reaction during AIT.1415,1416Clinicians should keep in mind that all in vitro test results should be eval- uated in context of the clinical history since allergen sensitization does not necessarily imply clinical symp- toms. Patients with a broader polymolecular IgE sensitiza- tion pattern to mites, epithelia, and pollen allergens have a trend toward more severe disease and more comorbidities.51,1417ThepresenceofIgEantibodiesagainst allergenicmoleculesmaybedeterminedusingasingleplex ormultiplexmeasurementplatform(ISAC,Thermofisher- Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden; Alex2MacroArray Diagnos- tics, Vienna, Austria).

(See Section X.D.1. Environmental Exposure Chambers for additional information on this topic.) NPT canbeadministeredbyseveraldevices:syringes,droppers, sprays, or disks, each with limitations.1532Positive NPT can be assessed by symptom scales, rhinometry, inflammatory include acute rhinosinusitis,recentARexacerbation,historyofanaphy- lacticreactions,severegeneraldiseases(cardiopulmonary diseases with reduced lung capacity), and pregnancy.1534 Reported sensitivities and specificities of NPT range between83.7%-93.3.%and72.7%-100%,respectively(Table X.D.2). A standardized NPT, suggested by Gosepath et al.,1534has been defined by the EAACI position paper, although NPT utilization for AR diagnosis may decrease due to emerging tools like molecular allergy diagnostics andBAT.1389,1535-1537 The characteristics and safety of NPT were investi- gated in 518 children and 5830 adults by Eguiluz-Gracia etal.,49with11,499challengesandonlyfourlocaladverse reactions noted. Reproducibility, positive and negative predictive values of three consecutive NPT in 710 sub- jects were 97.32%, 100%, false-positive results. Comparison between NPT and EEC in patients with cat allergy resulted in similar clini- calandimmunologicalresponses.Theauthorssuggested thatselectingaspecificallergenchallengemethodshould depend on the study objectives and costs when investi- gating cat allergy.1538Regarding HDM, Wanjun et al.1539 studied the relationship between the severity of AR and various diagnostic tests noting that NPT, SPT wheal size, and serum sIgE correlated with each other; only NPT was associated nasal symptom severity. Joo et al.1540evaluated the EAACI NPT protocol, concluding that standardized NPT could help diagnose AR caused by HDM. Finally, Xiao et al.1541found that, in assess- ing HDM allergic patients' candidacy for AIT, NPT is valuable and safe for confirming the diagnosis before treatment, especially in Der p 1-positive or low sIgE patients. NPT is crucial in diagnosing occupational rhinitis and LAR. Occupational rhinitis diagnosis requires \"objective demonstration of the causal relationship between rhini- tis and the work environment through NPT with the suspected agent(s).\"1542Occupational rhinitis diagnosis is challenging and should be suspected in patients with adult-onsetrhinitis;NPTisthegoldstandardfordiagnosis whenimmunologicaltestsareunavailableorunreliable.128For LAR, the SPT and serum sIgE are negative and diagnosis requires the measurement of local IgE in nasal secretions or a positive NPT.469Measuring local sIgE in theclinicisnotreadilyavailableorpractical,makingNPT critical.Ofnote,NPTwithHDM,pollens,and Alternaria was positive in 100% of 22 adults with previously diag- nosed LAR1543; however, in 28 childrenwith non-allergic only 25% of subjects.474In anotherstudyinvolving62symptomaticpatientswithneg- ativeSPT,theprevalenceofLARtoHDMwas24.2%,with sneezing noted as a more dominant symptom in LAR versusnon-allergicrhinitis.1544 CPT is generally performed by instilling 20-30 lo f an allergen solution into the inferolateral quadrant of the conjunctiva, using a control diluent in the con- tralateral eye.1530A positive CPT response results in a reaction 5-20 after testing with ocular itch- ing/pruritis, tearing, redness/conjunctival erythema, and possibly edema. A study of 20 children with seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis tested three times with CPT reported goodreproducibility.1545CPTsensitivityandspecificityin HDM-allergic patients were reported as 90% and 100%, respectively.1546A systematic review contributed to the EAACI guidelines for the practice of CPT with grade B evidence for identifying the allergen trigger.1547It was concluded that allergists should be more familiar with CPTduetoitssimplicity.However,symptomscalesneed to be validated, allergen extract standardization should be improved, and CPT indications in patients with non- allergic conjunctivitis remain uncertain. Only one recent trial has been published which assessed a group of chil- dren monosensitized to Can f 5 from dogs. Interestingly, reference SPT and CPT demonstrated different reactions to male and female dog extracts, suggesting tolerance to femaledogs.1548 Localallergenchallengetesting(provocation testing) Aggregategradeofevidence: C (Level 2: 1 study, level3:7studies;Table X.D.2) Benefit: May assist in confirming diagnosis of AR in specific cases when immunological tests are unavailable or unreliable.

There- fore, objective measures of nasal obstruction have beendeveloped which measure physiologic parameters (e.g., peaknasalinspiratory/expiratoryflow[PNIF/PNEF],air- flowresistanceorrhinomanometry)andnon-physiologic parameters(e.g.,nasalcavitycross-sectionalareaandvol- ume, or acoustic rhinometry).

X.HUseofvalidatedsubjective instrumentsandpatientreportedoutcome measures Validated clinical outcome surveys (VCOS) are simple, effective tools that may be used to evaluate and screen patientswithsuspectedorknownAR.Theycanbehelp- ful in establishing a diagnosis of AR, assessing severity, or evaluating treatment response. Typical survey ques- tions inquire about symptoms such as congestion, rhi- norrhea, and sneezing; the questions may be referring to that instant, or to a time period of days or weeks. Although objective testing such as allergy skin testing and sIgE serology can help confirm or rule out the diagnosis, clinical history is indispensable in the evalu- ation of AR.1668In resource-poor settings, SPT, serologic testing,orotheradvancedtechnologiesmaynotbeavail- able to confirm the diagnosis.143,1331,1384,1669Furthermore, VCOS offer a more structured and standardized means of obtaining the clinical history and assessing treatment response.These PROMs focus on varying aspects of AR.1670 They may primarily be symptom severity surveys such as the TNSS, or health-related QOL questionnaires such as the RQLQ. Surveys of medication usage (Daily Med- ication Score), disease prediction (Respiratory Allergy Prediction [RAP]), and disease control (Rhinitis Con- trol Test) are also available. VCOS can be cross-validated with more objective tools such as NPT and SPT. These instruments are routinely utilized in clinical trials as objective, standardized measures to assess the efficacy of AR medications and are widely accepted in the aca- demicallergyandrhinologycommunity.1671-1676Recently, VCOS have been adapted for use in smartphone cations that track AR symptomatology and medication use.1677-1682 TableX.H.-1lists several frequently used VCOS, outlining the targeted disease, number of questions, score range, symptoms, and/or medication questions included, and the context in which each is typically employed.1064,1094,1099,1683-1698The TNSS is typically administered as a daily survey comprised of only four questionsfocusingonrunnynose,nasalitching,sneezing, and congestion. Some studies have used the TNSS as a reflective score calculated as the average of both the 12-h nighttime and 12-h daytime average (rTNSS). The TNSS canbecombinedwithquestionsaboutrescuemedication use to yield the Daily Combined Score and the Total Combined Rhinitis Score. Both have been used in many therapeutic intervention studies.

Pet removal is a commonly cited strategy without high-quality out- comes evaluation and is associated with extremely poor compliance.1706,1735-1737One study evaluated compliance of 288 sensitized patients with pet removal recommen- dations; only 4% of those with direct exposure to home animals adhered to removal recommendations.1735How- ever, pet avoidance has shown benefit in the secondary preventionofasthmaamongpreviouslysensitizedindivid- ualsandcurrentasthmatreatmentguidelinesrecommend pet removal from a sensitized individual's home1738,1739 (TableXI.A.3).

Avoidance of workplace rodent exposure. Removal of rodent exposure is a management option for AR and asthma in those that are sensitized; however, as expo- surecanoccurinvariousenvironments,comprehensively accomplishing this is challenging. When exposure pri- marily occurs at the workplace (e.g., laboratory worker handling rodents), reduction of allergen exposure can be accomplished by changing jobs or roles, use of personal protective devices, maintaining ventilation systems, and properstafftraining.140,1750 R o d e n t sa sp e t so rp e s t s . As various rodents can be kept as pets, many sensitized individuals or their care- givers are reluctant to remove the rodent from the livingspace, similar to other furry animals.1735,1751Conversely, individuals are generally willing to comply with recom- mendationstoremovethingstheyconsiderpests.Rodent predatorssuchascatscanreducerodentpopulationsbut areunlikelytoeliminateaninfestation.Oneobservational inner-city study showed that the number of cats and cat allergen levels are inversely correlated with mouse aller- gen levels.1752No clinical outcomes this study.Norecommendationscanbemadeatthistime,but theriskslikelyoutweighpotentialbenefitduetothehigh reportedco-sensitizationrateforcatandmouseallergens, whichcouldleadtoworseningofallergicsymptomswith catintroduction.1752 Integratedpestmanagementforrodentinfestation.

Intervention : Avoidance likely improves rodent- specific allergen exposure, especially when the interaction can be eliminated such as when it is work-related or with a pet rodent. Inte- grated pest management should be considered in select patients, such as pediatric inner-city patients that suffer from asthma and are mouse sensitized. XI.A.5 Pollen For pollen sensitized patients, avoidance or environmen- tal control measures are often the first recommended intervention to decrease exposure and symptoms.31This approach is derived from the experience in which nasal or inhalational allergen challenges induce inflammatory changes and clinical symptoms after exposure.152Edu- cation and avoidance measures often involve personal behavior changes, particularly when pollen counts are elevated. While complete avoidance of pollen triggers is rarely achievable, it also has undesirable consequences suchasavoidingtheoutdoors.1753Amorerealisticgoalis a reduction in exposure to pollens rather than complete elimination1754Further,evidencesupportingsuchrecom- mendationsisoftenlimitedtoexpertopinionandclinical experience. Dominant aeroallergens may vary significantly by geographical location, climate, and season.

This combined with local pollen data can guide when a patient may be most likely exposed to a particular allergenand,therefore,whenavoidancemeasuresmaybe most effective.Localpollen countscanbe Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

Practical interventions for pollen avoidance include keepingwindowsinhomesandcarsclosed,dryingclothes indoors, and staying inside when possible.1755Cabin air filters in cars, pollen screens, eyeglasses, and mouth- nose covering masks may reduce exposures.1756Pollen counts tend to be higher on sunny, windy days with lowerhumidity.31HEPAfiltersinairpurifierscandecrease exposure and, when studied in Artemisiapollen sensi- tized patients, led to decreased allergy symptom scores compared to placebo filters.1757For individuals able to change immediate landscaping, choosing entomophilous or insect pollinated plants may be helpful in addi- tion to selecting plants less likely to induce allergic symptoms.1758While allergen avoidance is endorsed by national and international guidelines,182,1759the clinical efficacy of these interventions has not been rigorously evaluated. Thepreviouslymentionedpollenavoidanceapproaches apply more generally to one's surroundings. There have also been attempts with physical barriers in direct or closecontactwithmucosalmembranesurfaceswherepol- lens may adhere and cascade immune responses. One studyenrolled70individualswithseasonalAR(primarily to grass) or polysensitized individuals without peren- nial provided wraparound glasses had improved ocular and nasal symptoms, in addition to improved RQLQ compared to medical therapy alone. Nasal filters have also been used as an avoidance tool to prevent symptoms of AR. In a randomized, double- blindplacebo-controlledcrossovertrial,65grasssensitized adults were monitored in a natural exposure setting at a park while either wearing a nasal filter or placebo.1761 Patients wearing nasal filters had significantly reduced TNSS scores compared to placebo. Other barrier protec- tion measures have been assessed, including cellulose powder applied to the nose, pollen blocker cream, and microemulsion.Inasystematicreview,15RCTsinvolving data of these measures from 1154 patients were assessed with subgroup analysis according to the type of barrier protection studied.1762Compared to placebo, the barrier protection methods assessed each had improved symp- tom control by meta-analysis without increased adverse events (of note, nasal filter was not analyzed by meta- analysis due to insufficient data). Most of the included studiesweresmallwithheterogeneousstudydesigns,but overall barrier methods may offer non-pharmacologic, symptomatic improvement to motivated patients (Table XI.A.5).Allergen avoidance on strategy.

Similarly, a separate Finnish cohort of 119 patients was diagnosed with occupational rhinitis (expo- suresincludingflour,animalproteins,storagemites,latex, flowers or indoor plants, dried egg powder, organic acid anhydrides with human serum proteins, abache wood dust, human dandruff, and enzymes) with an average of10 years since diagnosis. Health-related QOL for those no longer exposed to occupational allergens was sim- ilar to healthy controls, while it was impaired among thosewithcontinuedexposures.1767Thus,completeavoid- ance appears to improve rhinitis symptoms and QOL, and when feasible, may be the best approach (Table XI.A.6). However, if complete avoidance is not able to be achieved, there can be benefit to treatment approaches including decreased levels of exposure. In a group of 36 patients with latex-induced occupational asthma and a median follow up time of 56 months, 20 subjects with reduced exposure had improved asthma severity along with reduced rhinitis symptom severity scores.1768The other 16 patients without ongoing exposure (defined as latexglovesneverusedintheworkingenvironment)also hadimprovementinasthmaandrhinitissymptomsever- ity but had more loss of income and work disability.

Alternatively, occupation-specific interventions to decrease expo- sure may offer benefit to patients when complete avoidance cannot be accomplished. Further character- ization of levels of exposure and most effective means of decreasing exposure is needed.

With this in mind, a summary of the highest grade of evidence published is provided (Table XI.B.1.a.-2). There are several published guidelines regarding the use of oral antihistamines for the management of AR. In 2004 the ARIA group and EAACI released recom- mendations regarding the pharmacological criteria that commonly used AR medications should meet.

However, not all data regarding com- bination therapy has been conclusive with other studies finding no improvement in nasal airflow with the addi- tionofanH 2antihistamine.1802,1803Moreover,theclinical significance of these objective measures remain unclear (TableXI.B.1.b). Alternatively, several studies have investigated the impact of H 2antagonism on symptoms by employing PROMs. Subjects were asked to report some combina- tion of congestion, blockage, itch, drainage, sneeze, eye symptoms, and asthma with a categorical severity mea- sure. Three of the four studies examined symptoms after nasal allergen challenge, and none of these demon- stratedefficacyofH 2antihistaminesindiminishingaller- gic symptoms, either alone, or conjunction with an H 1 antihistamine.1800,1802-1804The majority of RCTs investi- gating the efficacy of H 2antihistamines are within the context of pre-treatment of a patient prior to a nasal histamine or allergen challenge.

Carpenter et al.1804randomized 23 subjects with known late-summer AR to receive alternating 2-week courses of either chlorpheniramine plus placebo during the season, or chlorpheniramine plus cimetidine.

The data existing on the use of H 2antihistamines in AR is limited in scope and quality, with very little addi- tion to the literature in the past decade. The objective findingsofimprovednasalairwayresistancesuggestthat the H2histamine receptor does modulate nasal tissue response to histamine.1798-1801However, the clinical sig- nificance of this mechanism is not clear, particularly in thecontextofmoderntreatmentalgorithms.1800-1804Given the relatively manageable side effect profile and costs of H2antihistamines, they may offer patients with other- wise recalcitrant AR symptoms an additional treatment option.

Intranasalantihistamines Two formulations of intranasal antihistamine are cur- rently available in North America for use as a topical spray, azelastine hydrochloride, and olopatadine hydrochloride. The English-language literature was systematically reviewed for clinical trials of either of these formulations for the treatment of AR. A total of 44 papers were identified that reported results of RCTs of intranasal antihistamine monotherapy. This included 24 studies with an active treatment com- parator arm1479,1805-1827and 29 studies with an inactive placebo arm.1808,1809,1812-1814,1816,1818,1820,1822,1824,1825,1828-1845 Monotherapy with azelastine was reported in 37 studies1479,1805,1806,1808,1810-1816,1818-1828,1831-1836,1840-1848 while monotherapy with olopatadine was reported in 10 studies.1807,1809,1829,1830,1833,1835,1837-1839,1847Some studies utilized multiple active treatment arms of antihistamine and/orcorticosteroid(Table XI.B.1.c).

Some studies evaluated the effect of corticosteroids in patients with both asthma and AR. Profita et al.1926 randomized children with rhinitis and asthma to either nebulized beclomethasone (administered via face mask breathing through mouth and nose) or placebo twice daily for 4 weeks. Compared to baseline, concentrations of nasal IL-5 were significantly decreased, and nasalpH levels were significantly increased after beclometha- sone treatment. Nasal symptom scores showed a signif- icant reduction in obstruction, sneezing, and rhinorrhea after treatment with beclomethasone dipropionate, but no change after placebo.

Corticosteroid injection into the nasal turbinates has also been studied for the management of AR; however, thisrouteislesswidelyutilizedthanpreviouslyobserved. Several early reports detailed significant improvement in symptoms of AR in a large proportion of patients who received intra-turbinate injections of various steroid formulations.1946-1950A placebo-controlled, single-blind RCT showed that intra-turbinate injections of botulinum toxin A or triamcinolone in patients with perennial AR resulted in improved control of nasal symptoms, includ- ingnasalcongestion,comparedtoisotonicsaline,although botulinum toxin had the longest duration of clinical effect.1951 Enthusiasm for intra-turbinate steroid injection has but deposi- tion.Complicationshaveincludedtransientvisuallossand diplopia1952; blurred vision and temporary blindness1953; and temporary distorted vision, decreased visual acu- ity, and paresis of the medial rectus.1953Martin reported on the rapid onset of ocular pain, blurred vision, and decreased visual acuity after an intra-turbinate injection oftriamcinoloneacetonide.1954Symptomswerecausedby embolization is likely related to retrograde flow from the anterior tip of the IT to the ophthalmic artery, followed by anterograde flow with the particles lodging in the end arteries of the choroid and retinal vessels. Larger particle size steroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) are thought to present higher risk than smaller sized particles (e.g., triamcinolone).1954 Moss et al.1956reported on personal experience with 152 turbinate and 85 intra-polyp injections of triamcinolone acetonide, noting one transient subjective decrease in visionafterintra-polypinjection.Theyreviewedtheliter- pituitaryaxis,growth,osteoporosis,glycemiccon- trol,andothersystemicadverseeffects,forvaried periodsoftimeafterinjection.Intraturbinatecorti- costeroidshaveasmallbutpotentiallyseriousrisk of ocular risk of significant systemic adverse effects, the risk of serious ocular side effects, and the availability of effective alternatives (e.g., INCS), injectable corticosteroids on adren- ergic receptors, which leads to vasoconstriction of small bloodvessels(suchasthoseinthenasalmucosa),result- inginreliefofnasalcongestionsymptomsinARpatients.

Our review of the literature found 12 studies that evaluate the use of oral decongestants in AR and are summarized in Table XI.B.3.a. Individual studies eval- uating the effect of oral decongestants in AR patients as monotherapy during allergy season have shown that pseudoephedrine monotherapy led to improved symptom scores (total nasal symptom and individual symptomscores)comparedtobaseline.1960-1964Onestudy also compared pseudoephedrine monotherapy against placebo and found that pseudoephedrine monotherapy is more effective in reducing total nasal symptom and nasal stuffiness scores than placebo.1959With regard to the comparison of 20426984, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

XI.B.8 Intranasalsaline Nasal saline is a frequently utilized therapy in the treat- ment of AR. The term \"nasal saline,\" however, encom- passes a wide variety of therapeutic regimens. These can include differences in solution characteristics, such as salinity (hypertonic versus isotonic/normal saline) and buffering (buffered versus non-buffered), and differences infrequency,volume,andmodeofadministration.

Oral decongestants such asphenylephrineorpseudoephedrine,whicharetypically sympathomimetic drugs that target -1 receptors causing blood vessel constriction, cause more pronounced nasal decongestion. Oral antihistamines can thus be combined with oral decongestants to reduce histamine-mediatedsymptoms of AR while concomitantly improving nasal airflow.296,1488,2120,2121 RCTs have desloratadine- pseudoephedrine, cetirizine-pseudoephedrine, loratadine-pseudoephedrine, AR symptoms including rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing when compared to placebo.1477,1492,1959,1960,1962-1964,1968,1970,2121-2130Combi- nation oral antihistamine-oral decongestant medications have also been shown to reduce nasal congestion symp- toms versus oral antihistamine alone or versus oral decongestant alone.1477,1492,1959,1960,1962-1964,1968,1970,2121-2130 Studies have also demonstrated that once daily dosing of combination oral antihistamine-oral decongestant med- ications are statistically equivalent to twice daily dosing with regard to symptom relief2131,2132and that different antihistamine-decongestant combinations are statisti- cally equivalent in improving symptom scores.2132-2136 In some studies, oral antihistamine-oral decongestant combination medications are reported to be superior to INCSwithregardtoimprovingARsymptoms,particularly nasal congestion.1488,2137,2138In contrast, Oralantihistaminesmaycausesedationanddrymouth, in the case as doxylamine and jitteriness, and dry mouth. Oral decongestants or oral antihistamine-decongestant combinations are typically not recommended by their manufacturers in patients under 12 years old, while oral antihistamines other than cetirizine are typically not recommended in patients under age 2.296,2120Over-the- countersalesoforaldecongestantsandoralantihistamine- oral decongestant combinations are typically monitored or restricted given their potential use in the illicit manu- factureofmethamphetamines.Oraldecongestantsshould be used with caution in pregnant patients and patients withcardiacarrythmias,hypertension,orbenignprostatic hypertrophy.

XI.B.10.b Oralantihistamineandintranasal corticosteroid A combination of an oral antihistamine with INCS is a commonly used treatment option for patients with AR. First-generation antihistamines include diphen- hydramine, deslorata- dine. Typically, second-generation antihistamines are preferred given their improved safety profile compared to first-generation antihistamines. INCS reduce inflam- matory and hyperresponsive effects to antigen challenge. INCS have an excellent safety profile and low systemic absorption.

Valuejudgments: Adding oral antihistamine to INCS spray has not been demonstrated to confer additional benefit over INCS spray of oral antihistamine-LTRA in the treatment of AR was reviewed as a therapeutic option in the previous ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2018 consensus statement.1An updated systematic search revealed three additional systematic reviews and two RCTs,1983,1985,2153-2155giving a total of 17 studies meeting criteriaforlevel1or2evidence(Table XI.B.10.c). Combinationoralantihistamine-LTRAhasbeenshown tobesuperiortoplaceboinmultipleRCTs.Recentstudies have sought to clarify the comparative efficacy of combi- nation therapy against monotherapy with either LTRA or oral antihistamines in improving daytime and nighttime symptoms of AR, as well as ocular symptoms. AdditionalsystematicreviewsbyLiuetal.2154andWei1985 areconcordantwiththesefindings. There have been no new studies comparing combi- nation oral antihistamine-LTRA therapy to monotherapy with INCS. Previous evidence suggests that combina- tion therapy is equivalent to, or less effective than INCS alone for reduction of symptoms and nasal eosinophil counts.1893,2144,2156,2157Comparingdifferentantihistamines LTRA, Mahatme et al.2155found that fexofenadine added to LTRA led to a greater decrease in symptoms, although the combination with levocetirizine was more cost-effective.

Although the combination of LTRA and oral anti- histamineswaspreviouslyfoundtobewelltoleratedwith minimalconcernsfordruginteractions,1recentconcerns regarding the safety of LTRA have been raised, with the US FDA now requiring a boxed warning for serious neuropsychiatriceventsonmontelukast.1997 Overall,thecombinationoforalantihistamine-LTRAis an effective therapy option when compared to placebo.

Five RCTs, varying in size from 23 to 705 partic- ipants, showed that combination therapy with INCS and INDCwassignificantlymoreeffectiveinimprovingnasal symptom scores compared to INCS alone.2192-2196Three of these studies also reported no rhinitis medicamen- tosainpatientsreceivingcombinationtherapy.2193,2194,2196 In contrast, Baroody et al,2197in a 2011 randomized cohort with refractory AR, showed that TNSS improved with fluticasone-oxymetazoline compared to placebo or oxymetazoline alone, but not over fluticasone alone. Additionally, while Meltzer et al.2194showed combina- tion therapy to be superior to mometasone alone in their AR cohort, they did not demonstrate a dose- dependent relationship of oxymetazoline as part of the combinationtherapyinreducingnasalcongestion(Table XI.B.10.f).

This meta-analysis included data from a largemulticenterRCT( n=422)demonstratingimprove- ment of seasonal AR with true acupuncture.2208In 2020, a systematic review by Wu et al.2209analyzed 15 RCTs and found acupuncture as a useful adjunct to allopathic standard of care or as monotherapy for AR.

The literature surrounding the role of septo- plasty/septorhinoplasty as a structural treatment for AR has expanded recently. While early evi- dence suggested that AR patients may benefit less from septoplasty/septorhinoplasty than non-AR counterparts,2285-2287mostoftherecentliteraturesuggests the contrary,1093,2288-2296with overall low complication rates.2297,2298Kim et al.2299found that AR patients with septaldeviationthatunderwentseptoplastywithturbino- plasty had greater improvement in nasal obstruction than those that who underwent turbinoplasty alone. Nevertheless, the evidence is low-quality overall, with a preponderance of retrospective case series and no RCTs. 20426984, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

More rigorous studies are warranted to directly compare various IT reduction techniques for optimal and durable outcomes (TableXI.C.-2). Another structural target is the nasoseptal swell body, with newer interventions directed toward volumetric reductiontoimproveairflow.Thoughablationoftheswell body (whether through radiofrequency, laser, or cobla- tion) has shown promise in reducing symptoms,2382-2386 its effectiveness has yet to be tested with an AR-specific cohort.However,theadventofdevicesintendedforoffice use (e.g., Vivaer, Aerin Medical, Sunnyvale, CA) may Rhinorrhea,aspart ofbothARandnon-allergicrhini- arise from overactivity of parasympathetic tomy with permanent most proximally accessiblenervesegmentisapotentialsurgicalapproach to reducerhinorrheain these patients.2386Evidencepub-lished from 2011 onwards provides support regarding its use in AR patients.

It is incorrect to make a generalassumptionthatallformsofAITareeffectivesince thismayleadtotheclinicaluseofproductsthathavenot beenproperlystudied.1 The severity and duration of AR symptoms, as well as coexisting medical conditions such as asthma, should be considered in assessing the need for AIT.2419The decision to initiate AIT depends on a number of fac- tors, including but not limited to patient's preference, adherence, response to avoidance measures, medication requirements,andadverseeffectsofmedications.Patientsshouldbeevaluatedatleastevery12monthswhilereceiv- ing AIT.182While many among patients with AR.2426 Theanalysisalsoexaminedthelongertermriskofasthma development, as well as the ability of AIT to prevent the occurrence of a first allergic disease in sensitized but asymptomatic individuals or to prevent sensitization to new allergens. There were trends toward benefit but inconclusivefindingsregardingthesemeasures. XI.D.3 Contraindicationstoallergen immunotherapy Contraindications to AIT are uncommon but must be reviewed in all patients prior to initiating treatment. For both SLIT and SCIT, the adverse event of greatest sever- ity is anaphylaxis. Therefore, many of the absolute and relative contraindications to AIT are directly related to this risk, including uncontrolled asthma, concomitant -blockeruse,contraindicationtoinjectableepinephrine, andpregnancy.

Measures of an allergen extract may refer to quantity of extracted material in the solution (a con- centration) or be standardized to the biologic activity in allergicindividuals.Thedifferenttechniquesofassessing allergen extracts lead to multiple types of units, which canbegroupedintonon-standardized,standardized,and proprietary. Non-standardized allergen extracts. The majority of allergenextractsavailableintheUSarenon-standardized. Allergen extracts are regulated by the Center for Bio- logics Evaluation and Research (CBER) under the US FDA.2464The FDA requires that allergen extracts list the biologic source, a potency unit, and an expiration date.Thislabelingallowsforsignificantvariationbetween manufacturers and between lots produced by the same manufacturer.There are two US non-standardized units, weight/volume (w/v) and protein nitrogen units (PNU). Weight/volume refers to the ratio of grams of dry raw material to milliliters of extract solvent. An allergen extractlabeled1:20w/vindicatesforevery1gofrawmate- rial (e.g., pollen) 20 ml of extract solvent was used. This does not provide direct information about the amount of allergenicproteinintheextractnoritsreactivityinallergic individuals.However,itimpliesareproducibleextraction methodology was employed.2458PNU is the second most common non-standardized unit currently used in the US. PNU refers to an assay of the precipitable protein nitrogen by phosphotungstic acid that correlates with thetotalproteinintheextract.Whilemostoftheprotein is non-allergenic, the total protein is another method to quantitateanallergenextract'scontent.2458 In Europe, many manufacturers use proprietary units and internal quality controls which must utilize a vali- datedassay.2459ThisEuropeanmanufacturerbasedquality control is known as \"In House Reference Preparation\" or \"IHRP.\"2460However, the European Medical Agency has been developing a standardized framework based on protein homology rather than source species.2465The 20426984, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

If there is a major allergen that correlates strongly with the pop- ulation's clinical reactivity, the manufacturer compares their extract to the CBER's standard by gel electrophore- sis employing monoclonal IgG antibodies to the standardized by major aller- gen,theunitsarelistedin g/ml(Feld1forcat;Antigen EorAmba1forragweed).Forcatextracts,thepresence of Fel d 2 is also required.

Synthetic nanoparti- cleshavebeenprofferedsince1959todeliverahostphys- iologicallyactivesubstancesincludingvaccines.2489,2490A successful recent example of this is the use of liposomes to deliver mRNA encoded spike protein instructions in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. This same approachhasbeenproposedtodelivergeneticinstructions encoding allergenic proteins for immunotherapy. These so-called the to syn- activate TLR receptors while simultaneously encodingallergenicproteins. Naturally occurring adjuvants. Certain naturally occurring immune modulators have been shown to act as potential adjuvants. Nutritional compounds and pro- biotics may be ingested directly or administered subcu- taneously in tandem with allergen.2491,2492One example is VD3 which has been shown to reduce effector T cell stimulation and cytokine production and promote the effect of AIT in both mice and humans.2493-2495One mouse immunotherapy study successfully employed the use of Fel d 1 covalently bound to VD3.2496(See Sec- tionVI.H. Vitamin D for additional information on this topic.) ComponentsisolatedfromGanodermaLucidum,aChi- nese herb contained in Anti-Asthma Simplified Herbal Medicine Intervention (ASHMI), induce levels of IL- 10, IFN-, and Foxp3 in response to environmental allergens.2497Like TLR ligands, ASHMI has shown some limited effectiveness in treating certain allergic diseases byitselfwithoutthepresenceofanallergen.2498However, becauseofitsuniquetolerogeniccytokineprofile,ASHMI andothernaturallyoccurringherbcombinationsmayalso prove to be advantageous when used as an adjuvant for AIT. Insummary,variousadjuvantshavebeenproposedand studiedinanimalmodelsandtestedinhumans,butthere is currently no adjuvant FDA approved for use in AIT.Improvingtheimmunologicprofilesofimmunotherapies while maintaining safety standards remains challenging. XI.D.4.c Modifiedallergenextracts Traditionallythedisease-modifyingcapabilityandpoten- tial for effect of AIT has been accomplished via SCIT or SLIT with native, unmodified extracts. However, reliance on native extracts has lim- itations for widespread use including production costs and availability, as well as consistency and compara- bility among extracts.2499Furthermore, while generally safe, AIT with natural extracts has the potential for inducinghypersensitivityreactionsthatcanrarelybelife- threatening.Theuseofmodifiedallergenextractshasbeen studied as an alternative to native extracts as a means of providing improved AIT efficacy, safety, and reliabil- ity.Thissectiondiscussedseveralapproachesofmodified allergenextracts. Recombinantallergenextracts .Recombinant-derived allergens rely on recombinant DNA technology to pro- duce clones of natural allergens in the case of wild type recombinant allergens, or clones of partial allergen sequences in hypoallergenic recombinant allergens. For wildtyperecombinantallergens,thistechniqueproduces is that as a clone,thereispotentialforinducinghypersensitivityreac- tions. Hypoallergenic recombinant extracts, on the other hand, maintain certain T cell epitopes but may induce lessIgEdrivenresponses.2501Immunotherapytrialsusing recombinantbirchandTimothygrassallergenshavebeen reported.

In addition to improved safety, this may offer ability to decrease the numberofinjectionsrequiredduringabuild-upperiod.2514 While immediate hypersensitivity reactions are reduced, late phase adverse reactions can still occur.2515Allergoid preparationshavebeenevaluatedtoseveraldifferentaller- gens.

However, these data cannot be interpreted as a \"class effect\" that necessarily extends to other aeroallergens. Data supporting the SCIT effi- cacy for dog, cockroach, and mold andCladosporium ) are encouraging, but lim- ited, and additional studies are needed to substantiate the therapeutic efficacy of SCIT for AR related to these inhalantallergens.1206,2419,2530-2533 The majority of RCTs supporting SCIT for AR have been studies of single aeroallergens.2419There have been very few studies of multi-allergen SCIT, which are het- erogeneousandsufferfrommethodologicalshortcomings. Whilemulti-allergenSCITisamainstayofclinicalpractice in the report favorable treatment bene- fits,additionalhigh-qualitystudiesareneededtoprovide rigoroussupportfortheefficacyofmulti-allergenSCITin treatingAR. Safety.SCIT is associated with localized reactions occurring in the majority of patients.2419Evidence indi- cateslocalreactionsdonotreliablypredictoccurrenceof subsequent systemic reactions; dosage adjustment is not typically required after their occurrence.2419While there isalowriskforsystemicreactionsfromSCIT,potentially life-threatening and fatal reactions may occur. Non-fatal systemic reactions occur at a rate of approximately 2 per 1000injectionsinpatientsreceivingSCIT.2419Severegrade 4anaphylacticreactionsoccurinapproximately1permil- lioninjections,andfatalreactionsinapproximately1in23 millioninjectionvisits.2535,2536 Risk factors for systemic reactions from SCIT include poorly controlled asthma, exquisite aeroallergen sensi- tivity, concomitant -blocker use, rush SCIT protocols, prior systemic reaction, high dose SCIT, injection from a new SCIT vial (i.e., higher potency), and dosing error.2419,2535-2537A Cost-effectiveness .Data support SCIT as a cost- effective intervention, in large part due to the potential for reductions in long-term symptom burden, disease complications,diseaseprogression,andmedicationcosts.

Several studies imply SCIT for AR is associated with continued benefit after stopping treatment, including a reducedriskfordevelopingasthma2541,2542andnewaller- gen sensitivities.2543,2544However, data meta-analyzed by Dhami et al.2438are more limited in terms of persistence of benefit in symptoms scores after treatment discontin- uation. Additional studies are required to support this importantanddesirableoutcomeofSCITtreatment. An updated systematic review of RCTs of SCIT for AR was performed from January 1, 2015, through October 1, 2021. All studies did not evaluate clinical endpoints, heterogeneity between studies was significant, and there was variable risk of bias. In general, studies demon- strated significant SCIT treatment benefit across age groups.1671,2545,2546Arroabarren et al.2425evaluated chil- dren 5-15 years old in a prospective study comparing a 3-yearversusa5-yearcourseofSCIT,demonstratinga44% reduction in symptom and medication scores from base- lineafter3yearsoftherapy( p=0.002)anda50%decrease after 5 years of therapy ( p=0.001). Wang and Shi2547 reported 77% reduction in TNSS in children with a sim- ilar decrease in medication scores. In an elderly cohort, Bozek et al.2548evaluated subjects 65-75 years old with moderate or severe intermittent AR, comparing 3 years of grass SCIT to placebo and finding a 41% decrease in combinedsymptomandmedicationscoresversusbaseline (p=0.004).

Summary.ICAR-AllergicRhinitis20181recommended SCIT for AR with an Aggregate Grade of Evidence \"A.\" Recently, evidence has continued to accrue in support of the therapeutic efficacy of SCIT in properly selected patients with AR, across age ranges and with selected standardized allergens.

It should be noted that while SCIT remains the predominant method forAITadministrationintheUS,inthepasttwodecades SLIT became the dominant approach for AIT in sev- eral European countries2551; recommendations for SLIT in Europe include tablet formulations and sublingual drops.2418Additional studies are required to substanti- atethelong-termeffectivenessofSCITforAR,including its potential for reducing risk for future development of asthmaandsensitizationtonovelantigensinmonosensi- tizedpatientstreatedwithSCIT,andthesafetyandefficacy ofmulti-allergenSCIT.

Cost: SCIT is cost-effective, with some stud- ies demonstrating value that dominates the alternative strategy with improved health out- comes at lower cost. Direct and indirect costs of AIT vary based on the third-party payer, the office/region, co-payment responsibilities, and travel/opportunity related costs in being able to adheretothefrequencyofofficevisitsrequired. Benefits-harm assessment:Forpatientswithsymp- toms lasting longer than a few weeks per year and for those who cannot obtain adequate relief with symptomatic treatment or who prefer an immunomodulationoption,benefitsofSCITout- weigh harm. The potential benefit of secondary disease-modifying effects, especially in children andadolescents,shouldbeconsidered. Valuejudgments: A patient preference-sensitive approach to therapy is needed. Comparatively, the potential for harm and burden associated withmedicationsaresignificantlylower,although the potential for benefit is also lower (with no potential for any disease-modifying effect or long-term benefit) as medications do not induce immunomodulation. Logistical issues surround- ing time commitment involved with AIT may be prohibitiveforsomepatients.Thestrengthofevi- dence for SCIT efficacy, along with the benefit relative to cost, would support coverage by third partypayers.

Aeroallergen rush SCIT has demonstrated effectiveness for AR and asthma.2604The majority of double-blind RCTs utilized pollens, Alternaria, cat, dog, and HDM.2087,2594,2597,2607-2611These studies report significant benefit over placebo in clini- cal outcomes (most commonly reported with combined symptom-medication scores), SPT, and provocation chal- lenges(Table XI.D.5.b). Safety remains a limiting factor for aeroallergen rush SCIT due to a greater risk of systemic reactions, which range 15%-100% of patients without premedica- tion for standardized extracts, depot preparations, and allergoids.2604This improves to 12%-38% when using routine premedication.2612Depigmented-polymerized extracts have a significantly better safety profile with systemic reactions occurring in less than 2% of patients.2584,2606,2608,2613Local reactions do not appear to predictsystemicreactionsanddelayedsystemicreactions are reported rarely with rush SCIT.2608Only one double- blind RCT specifically evaluated safety and efficacy of rush versus conventional SCIT.2609In this small Der p 1 trial (n=18), the efficacy was similar, but the rush SCIT group had significantly higher side effect scores without anyseveresystemicreactions.Oneretrospectiveobserva- tional study found an increase in systemic reactions on subsequent doses following initial rush SCIT, although additionalstudiesareneededduetothevariabilityinrush SCITprotocols.2614 Rush,ultra-rush,andmodifiedrush .RushSCIThas traditionally been defined as achieving target therapeu- tic dose within 1-3 days1,2419; however, lack of universal ules.ModifiedrushdesignatesacceleratedSCITprotocols thatreachatargetdosewithin3days,thenfollowamore conventional to reach https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

Due to the increased risk of systemic reactions with ultra-rush, traditional extracts have not generally been used. Depigmented-polymerized extracts, which are approved and commercially available in several regions of Europe, have been utilized via an ultra-rush protocol with good efficacy in adults and children.2584,2606,2608,2613 Local reactions occurred in 21%-70.4% of patients, while systemic reactions ranged 2%-12.7%; all considered non-severe(nograde3or4reactions).

Limited studies specifically evaluated the effects of premedication on aeroallergen rush SCIT.2615,2616Premedication regimens one placebo-controlled study of 22 children undergoing multiallergen rush SCIT over 1.5 days, a significant reduction in systemic reactions was observed in those receiving pretreatment with astem- izole, ranitidine, 73%, respectively).2615A larger non-randomized study involving children and adults undergoing rush SCIT to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus evaluated the effects of phylline) and preventive schedule after local reactions of >1 0c m )o ns y s t e m i c reaction rates.2616The systemic reaction rate declined from 36% of patients with rush SCIT alone to 16% of patientsthatreceivedpremedication.Thisfurtherdeclined to 7.3% when preventive measures were added to the premedicationregimen. Omalizumab has also been investigated as part of a 9- weekpretreatmentregimenforragweedrushSCIT.2087,2607 A five-fold reduction in anaphylaxis was reported for the omalizumab-premedicated group compared to the placebo-premedicated group.

Two meta-analyses of observational studies have assessed cluster SCIT safety.2617,2618When evaluat- ing for local and systemic adverse reactions by number of patients, no difference was found with cluster versus conventional SCIT. The meta-analysis by Jiang et al.2618 showedalowerrateofgrade1systemicandlocaladverse reactions if analysis is done per injection. Additional studies are needed to further explore these findings, as non-randomized studies may favor inclusion of less vul- nerable patient populations in the cluster cohort. High heterogeneitywasnotedwhichlimitsstudyconclusions.A more recent RCT from China and large retrospec- tivestudyofamultiple-physicianpracticeintheUSwith over 2.5 million injections given during the study period showednodifferenceinsystemicreactionsbetweenclus- terandconventionalSCITonaper-patientbasis,butthe retrospective trial did show a slightly increased risk on a per-injection basis.2612,2623M i n i m a ld a t ai sa v a i l a b l eo n delayed reactions with cluster SCIT and no conclusions canbedrawn.2618,2625 Factors that affect systemic reactions with cluster SCIT.Only one RCT specifically assessed the use of premedication in cluster SCIT with standardized pollen extracts.2626Use of loratadine prior to cluster dosing showed a decline in systemic reactions from 79% of patients to 33% for the study duration.2626While no life-threatening systemic reactions occurred, there was a reduction in severity of systemic reactions with pre- medication. Other RCTs and observational studies had high variability in premedication regimens (e.g., oral antihistamines, oral systemic steroids, and leukotriene modifyingagents)andmostdonotproviderelevantinfor- mation.Timingofthepremedicationhasnotbeendirectly studied.2604 Other factors may affect the frequency and severity of systemic reactions during cluster SCIT including dos- ing frequency, extract formulation (standardized, depot, polymerized), number of injections administered during a cluster session, and number of clusters given to reach maintenance.2604Currently there is insufficient data to draw any conclusions, but this should be an area of emphasisforfutureresearch. In summary, cluster SCIT has a similar safety profile as conventional SCIT and fewer systemic reactions than rush SCIT.2612,2618,2622Importantly, the safety of cluster SCITiscomparabletostandardregimensoverallbecause thenumberofinjectionsrequiredforbuildupcanbeless, not because the per injection risk is necessarily lower. Additionally, premedication use appears to be necessary to reach this comparable safety profile for cluster SCIT. Some practices may translate this as the need to observe patientsduringclustersessionsmorecloselyandforlonger periods.Efficacyremainsdifficulttoinvestigateduetothe significantstudyheterogeneitybutdoesappeartobesim- ilartoconventionalSCIT,whichisstronglyrecommended to manage refractory AR. Standardization of cluster pro- tocols through additional large-scale RCTs should be a key area of research as there remain many understud- ied topics including dosing frequency, number of injec- tions per visit, and the optimal duration of the build-up phase. 20426984, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

Intervention : Cluster SCIT can be safely imple- mented in clinical practice and offered to those patients eligible for SCIT that may prefer this protocol compared to conventional build-up pro- tocols due In ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2018,1the joint outcomes of the best quality trials gathered in over two dozen SRMAs on SLIT were presented. Since then, further tri- als have been conducted taking better care to define the exact dosing, focus on specific allergens, and separate the two different sublingual administration routes: aque- ous or tablets. In this section, evidence for SLIT efficacy in general is reviewed, and subsections on aqueous and tablet SLIT follow. SRMAs were primarily analyzed. Sev- eral RCTs that have been published since ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis 2018 were added as well.

Benefit: SLIT improves patient symptom scores, evenasadd-ontreatmentwithrescuemedication. SLIT reduces medication use. The effect of SLIT lasts for at least 2 years after a 3-year course of therapy. In AR patients, there is some evidence thatSLITreducesthefrequencyofonsetofasthma and the development of new sensitizations up to 2 years after treatment termination. Benefit is generally higher than with single-drug pharma- cotherapy;however,itmaybelessthanwithSCIT (lowqualityevidence). Harm: Minimal harm with very frequent, but mild local adverse events, and very rare systemic adverseevents.SLITseemstobesaferthanSCIT. SeeTableII.C. Cost: Intermediate. SLIT becomes cost-effective comparedtopharmacotherapyafterseveralyears of administration. Total costs seem to be lower thanwithSCIT. Benefits-harm assessment: Benefit of treatment over placebo is small but tangible and occurs in additiontoimprovementwithmedication.There is a lasting effect at least 2 years off treatment. MinimalharmwithSLIT,greaterriskforSCIT. Valuejudgments: SLIT improved patient symp- tomswithlowriskforadverseevents. Policylevel: Strong recommendation for use of SLIT grass pollen tablet, ragweed tablet, HDM tablet, and tree in patients (adults and children) with seasonal and/or perennial AR who wish to reduce their symptomsandmedicationuse,aswellaspossibly reduce the propensity to develop asthma or new allergensensitizations.

Administrationschedulesandagerangesofapproveduse varybasedonthespecifictabletprescribed. Since 2017, numerous SRMAs were identified for SLIT tablets (Table XI.D.6.a.-1). Eight reported both aqueous and tablet SLIT,2426,2438,2636,2637,2644,2661-2663 six presented aqueous and tablet SLIT separately,2438,2550,2638,2639,2664,2665a n dn i n er e p o r t e d on tablet SLIT alone.1982,1986,1995,2532,2636,2640,2646,2651,2672 All studies reported outcomes for HDM, grass pollen, and/or ragweed pollen. There were no SRMAs for birch or Japanese cedar pollen tablets. Studies focusing only on SLIT tablets demonstrated safety and efficacy for HDM,grasspollen,andragweedpollen.Improvementin symptomscores,medicationscores,andQOLmetricsare evidentwithminimaladversereactions.

SLIT is generallyusedforpharmacotherapy-recalcitrantpatients, resultinginamoreseveregroupusingSLIT.Additionally, patients often use supplement SLIT with rescue medi- cations, confounding individual comparison of medical treatments. Analysis of pediatric studies demonstrated that HDM SLIT reduced symptoms and medication scores versus placebo,withaslightincreaseinadversereactions.2636A similar study of HDM SLIT tablets in adults2672showed improvement in symptom scores and QOL compared to placebo. Nelson et al.2532published a systematic review of 12 double-blind RCTs for HDM SLIT tablets and con- cluded that efficacy was established with all 12 studies, with statistically significant symptom score improve- ment.

Kim et al.2661 reported a meta-analysis of HDM AIT in mono- or pol- ysensitized patients. Nine studies, five SLIT and four SCIT, revealed no differences for nasal symptom score, medication use, and QOL scores between mono- and polysensitizedpatients.

Local nasal AIT has been established as an effective and well-tolerated approach for the treatment of pollen andHDMhypersensitivityinadults.2757,2758However,high rates of local adverse reactions have been identified in pediatricpatientsandmaylimitpatientcompliance,with one study finding that 43.9% of children abandoned this treatment option within the first year of therapy.2716No high quality studies of inhaled/intra-bronchial AIT exist forthetreatmentofAR,withcurrentstudieslimitedtothe treatmentofallergicasthma.2759 Current evidence suggests limited utility of oral/gastrointestinal, nasal, and inhaled AIT in the treatmentofARduetolimitedefficacy,increasedadverse events, and poor treatment compliance.

Combination therapy with omalizumab reduced symptom load over the two pollen seasons (birch and grass) by 48% over SCITalone( p<0.001).Combinationtherapyalsoreduced the need for rescue medication, days with allergy symp- toms, and symptom severity compared with SCIT alone (p<0.001).Asafetyanalysesofthesedataindicatedthat rednessandswellingattheSCITinjectionsitesappeared significantly more often in the placebo group versus the omalizumab group ( p<0.05) suggesting a positive effect of omalizumab on local reactions induced by SCIT.2761 Subgroupanalysisofgrassallergicpatientsconfirmedthe primarystudyresults.2762 Because omalizumab reduces free IgE resulting in a decreaseinthehighaffinityIgEreceptor,Fc R1,pretreat- ment with omalizumab should allow for safer and more effective AIT.2763,2764Casale et al.2087conducted a three- center, double-blind placebo-controlled RCT in patients with ragweed-induced seasonal AR to examine whether omalizumabgiven9weeksbeforerushSCIT(1-dayrush, maximal dose 1.2-4.0 g Amb a 1), followed by 12 weeks ofdualomalizumabandSCIT,issaferandmoreeffective than AIT alone.

Combination therapy reduced daily symptom load by 39% ( p<0.05), improved control of rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma, and improved QOL, but no significant improvements in SCIT safety were observed.2765,2766 Massanari et al.2767conducted a study to evaluate the efficacyofomalizumabinimprovingthesafetyandtoler- ability of SCIT given to a high-risk population of adults with persistent asthma uncontrolled on inhaled corti- costeroids.

Evennowwithextractionmethodssubjecttoregulatory standards,allergenextractsremainheterogeneous.Today, allergens are still manufactured by extracting mixtures of allergen and other proteins from biological sources. Impurities in source materials may exist, and there is biologic variability in the raw material. While there is inherent variance in the product related to the sourcing and collection of allergenic materials, the extraction pro- cesshasbecomemorestandardizedacrosstheindustry.2768 Extraction typically occurs using Coca solution (phys- iologic saline, bicarbonate buffer, and phenol) with or without glycerin. All allergen extracts must be sterilized and must contain bacteriostatic and fungistatic preserva- tive. In the US, manufacturers typically use phenol at 0.2%-0.5% with or without 50% glycerin. These extracts maythenbeusedunmodified,asisthecasewithmostUS extracts, or they may be treated aldehydes processedwithorwithoutanadjuvant,suchasaluminum hydroxide,asisthecasewithamajorityofEuropeanSCIT extracts.2460,2499 IntheUS,theCBERisresponsiblefortheregulationof manufacturing processes, as allergenstandardization.Theprimarypurposeofallergen standardization is to characterize the biologic potency of allergenextractsinaconsistentmanner.CBERmandates whichtestdefinespotencyandtheunitsbywhichpotency is assigned.

While these novel approachestoallergenpreparationmayultimatelyleadto improvedsafetyandefficacyofAIT,thereiscurrentlyno sufficient evidence to show clear advantage over the use of crude allergenextract in a majority of cases.2469These modifications further contribute to questions regard- ing the impact on efficacy of AIT, as well as allergen standardization and heterogeneity. (See Section XI.D.4. Allergen Extracts for additional information on this topic.) XI.D.11.a.ii Multi-allergen immunotherapy. The approach to treatment of polysensitized patients has been the subject of international debate. In the US, it is commonpracticeforallergiststofirstcharacterizeasensi- tization profile, and subsequently provide multi-allergen immunotherapy, whereby several allergen extracts are administered simultaneously throughout the treatment course. Conversely, a common practice in Europe entails identification of the most clinically problematic allergen followed by single-allergen administration.2419,2769If a 20426984, 0, Downloaded by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

Approximately 58% of these providers used single-allergen immunotherapy while the remaining 42% usedmulti-allergenimmunotherapy.2772 Given that polysensitized patients are not necessarily polyallergic, the overuse and efficacy of multi-allergen immunotherapy has been questioned. Skin testing or sIgE blood tests may be positive but may not correlate with clinical symptoms or disease. Furthermore, positive testing may reflect cross-reactivity with proteins within other allergens that are not associated with symptoms. CRD may play an important role in clarifying the pri- mary sensitizations but is not widely available.1409The multi-allergenapproachisscientificallysupportedbyfour double-blind placebo-controlled RCTs from the 1960s to 1980s (two studies with AR). These trials demonstrated significant improvement in patients who received mix- tures of multiple, unrelated allergen extracts, but these studies were done prior to better standardization of extracts.2773-2776More recent studies based in Spain have also supported multi-allergen immunotherapy.2777,2778A systematic review in 2009 evaluated 13 multi-allergen immunotherapystudies(11SCIT,oneSLIT,andoneboth) and corroborated that co-administration of two extracts is in fact clinically effective.2779Nevertheless, the results werelessclearwhenmorethantwoextractswereadmin- istered contemporaneously, a practice often used by US allergists.Infact,asurveycomprising670patientsacross six US and Canadian practices reported a mean of 18 extractsintheirmixtures.34,2780 Although few prior studies have directly evaluated multi-allergen immunotherapy compared to single- allergen immunotherapy in polysensitized AR patients, there is growing evidence that the efficacy of these two strategies may not differ. Potential limitations in multi- allergenSLITwerehighlightedinapreviousdouble-blind placebo-controlledRCTinwhichefficacyoutcomeswere suboptimal compared to single-allergen SLIT.2669Ortiz et al.2667recently demonstrated that despite significant improvement in allergic symptoms across all subject groups, there was no significant difference observed in efficacy of single-allergen SLIT versus pauci-allergen (threetosixallergens)ormulti-allergenSLITinpolysen- sitizedpatients.Additionally,WangandShi2547concluded thatsingle-allergenSLITresponseiscomparabletomulti- allergenSCITinchildrenwithARsecondarytoHDM.1721 On including a meta- analysisforHDM,havesubstantiatedcomparableefficacyofsingle-allergenimmunotherapyinmonosensitizedand polysensitizedARpatients.1406,2661,2668,2671,2684,2781,2782 Aclearknowledgegapistheneedforfurtherevidence to support the use of multi-allergen immunotherapy in polysensitizedpatients.2769Unfortunately,well-controlled studies in the polysensitized population are difficult to designandconduct.Sensitizationprofilescanvarydrasti- callyamongpatients,resultinginaheterogeneouspopula- tion that is difficult to investigate. immunotherapy versus multi-allergen immunotherapyischallengingaseachuniquepolysensiti- zationprofilecontainsadifferentsingledominantallergen totargetwhichinturnmaybedifficulttodistinguishclin- ically. At the time of this writing, there were 11 active or recruiting clinical trials investigating efficacy of AIT in AR patients (five SCIT, two SLIT, one both SCIT and SLIT, and three ILIT).2783None of the studies compare single-allergentomulti-allergenIT. If multi-allergen SCIT is administered, several con- siderations must be accounted for prior to the mixing process.2771,2784First,onemustbecarefultomaintainther- apeuticamountsofeachallergeninthemixture.Second, thechosenpreservativemustbecompatiblewithallaller- gens in the mixture. Moreover, attention must be paid to the proteolytic activity of fungal and some insect body extracts. When extracts with greater proteolytic activity are mixed with certain allergens susceptible to proteol- ysis such as pollen, mite, and animal dander allergens, theeffectiveconcentrationsintheextractmixturemaybe reduced.2785,2786 Giventhewidelyvariedpracticepatternsandchallenges inherent in the study of polysensitized individuals, the evidencesupportingmulti-allergenimmunotherapyisnot as strong as that supporting single-antigen immunother- apystrategies.Althoughitisdifficulttodirectlycompare multi-allergenandsingle-allergentreatmentstrategies,the literature strongly supports the efficacy of single-antigen immunotherapy even in polysensitized patients, while there remains a need for more careful analysis of the efficacy of multi-allergen immunotherapy.

AIT patients had less asthmasymptoms,improvedmethacholineresponse,and potentialforasthmaprevention.2794,2795SLITusingagrass tablet was shown to have a similar asthma prevention effectintheGrassimmunotherapytabletAsthmaPreven- tion(GAP)trial.2429Similarly,inaretrospectiveanalysisof 1099childrenwithARreceivinggrasspollenSLITtablets were compared with 27,475 rhinitis-control patients only 1.8% of SLIT treated children developed asthma versus 5.3% of control patients.2796A meta-analysis concluded thatAITdecreasestheriskofneo-sensitizationandasthma development (asthma RR 0.40; neo- sensitization RR 0.72), although the long-term benefit is unclear.2426 Safety and tolerability are important considerations in the pediatric population. In a retrospective evaluation of systemic reactions in pediatric and adult patients, the unadjusted systemic reaction rate was higher in chil- dren (0.2%) but not when adjusted for asthma, gender and phase of SCIT.2797In a Chinese population, sys- temic reactions were more common in younger chil- dren (3.28% of injections) compared with adolescents (1.47% of injections) but were treatable without requir- inghospitalization.2798AITisnotcustomarilyinitiatedin infants and toddlers given fears of the child not being able to communicate symptoms, in particular those of systemic reactions, and concerns that injections may be poorly tolerated in very young children.2419Every poten- tial pediatric AIT case merits consideration of balancing the potential benefits versus risks and inviting child and parenttoparticipateinshareddecision-makingtoexpress their values and preferences regarding the trade-offs of AIT, which are likely quite individualized. Similar pro-cesses and considerations are recommended for older adults. XI.D.11.b.ii Polysensitization. Polysensitization, or sensitizationtomorethanoneallergen,iscommoninthe general population, and a factor which potentially chal- lengesAITefficacy.Inanefforttoidentifytheprevalence of sensitization in the general population, a 16.2%-19.6% studiedskinsensitizationtocommonaeroallergensinthe US general population. Among the 10,863 participants 45.7% were not sensitized to any test were monosensitized, and 38.8% were polysensitized.2800 Hence, polysensitization appears to be more prevalent than monosensitization in the general population. More recentevidencesuggeststhatpolysensitizationmaybean entirely distinct phenotype to whether thispolysensitizationrepresentstruepolyallergy.Tohave polyallergy, the individual must have relevant symptoms upon exposure to two or more specific, sensitizing aller- gens. Insomepatientsshowingpositivetestresponsestomul- tiple allergens, this may be cross-reactivity to highlyconservedproteins,orpanallergens.Theserelated proteins, which have highly conserved sequence regions and structures, trigger IgE cross-recognition. Separating theclinicalrelevanceofpositivetestresponsestopollens knowntodemonstratecross-reactivitycanbechallenging becausetheseasonalityofsymptomsmayoverlap.2802New technologies focused on CRD may prove useful in deter- mining whether cross-reactive allergens are the cause of polysensitization,andmayhelptodirectAITdecisions.2803 The issue of whether the polyallergic patient is best treated with more than one (or even several) clinically relevant allergens versus a single allergen deemed most responsible for the patient's symptoms, is a subject of debate, and one characterized by trans-continental prac- ticevariations.ThepredominantapproachintheUSisto treatthepolyallergicpatientwithmultipleallergenssimul- taneously,whiletheEuropeanapproachistofocusAITon one,oratmosttwo,clinicallysignificantallergens.2769 While the published literature comparing the efficacy of single- or multi-allergen immunotherapy in the pol- ysensitized patient continues to evolve, there are pub- lished guidelines which can help to direct practical 20426984, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

Not unexpectedly, these guidelines reflectregionalbias.The2018EAACIGuidelinesonAller- gen Immunotherapy specify that polysensitized patients who are monoallergic receive AIT only for the specific allergen driving their symptoms. The EAACI guidelines further specify that for the polyallergic patient sensitized totwohomologousallergens(i.e.,twograsspollens),asin- gle allergen preparation or a mixture of two homologous allergensmaybeused,andforthepolyallergicpatientsen- sitizedtoallergenswhicharenothomologous,AITshould be limited to one or two of the clinically most impor- tantallergensadministeredseparatelyatdistinctanatomic locations and separated by 30-60 min.2418Similarly, the 2010 Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA2LEN)/EAACIpocketguidedoesnotrecommendthe useofallergenmixturesinAIT.2770ThePracticeParame- ter Third Update guidelines developed by the Joint Task Force2419acknowledges that there have been few stud- ies investigating the efficacy of multiallergen SCIT, and that studies have considerable heterogeneity, informationonthistopic.) XI.D.11.b.iii Adherence to therapy. Adherence to AIT is variable and dependent upon route of administration, SLITversusSCIT,dosingfrequency/regimen,patientchar- acteristics, and AIT-associated adverse events. A review oftheliteratureindicatesnoreportedprospectivedouble- blind,placebo-controlledRCTexaminingand/orcompar- ing the adherence of SLIT versus SCIT as the primary endpoint. However, there are data on the adherence of AIT in prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT ofclinicalefficacy,butthesedataaresomewhatartificial in that adherence is closely monitored and patients are selectedbasedoncriteriathatwouldpromotebettercom- pliancetotherapy.Furthermore,sinceoptimalefficacyof eitherSLITorSCITisnotappreciateduntilaminimumof 2 and optimally 3 years of therapy, adherence rates must be determined over a prolonged period. AIT adherence is reported to be much lower in real-life studies versus clinicaltrials.Forexample,inananalysisofsalesfigures from two SLIT manufacturers in Italy that account for morethan60%oftheItalianimmunotherapymarket,sales decreasedfrom100%atthestarttoapproximately44%in thefirstyear,28%inthesecondyear,and13%inthethird year. This indicates that less than 20% of patients were adherenttotheprescribedSLITregimen.2804 grass-induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis to a 3-year regimen of grass SLIT tablets. The authors found that only 55% of patients completed the 3-year treatment period.2805These data are similar to many retrospective analyses of adherence to SLIT at the end of a 3-year reg- imen, ranging 10%-61%2806-2808and illustrate that even thoughself-administrationofAITcouldbeadvantageous over injections requiring office visits, adherence is a significantproblem. The adherence rate to SCIT regimens have also been studied in retrospective and a few prospective uncon- trolled studies. In a real-world study examining claims data, 103,207 patients were reported to have at least one AIT claim, but only approximately 44% of these patients reached maintenance AIT. There was no follow-up of these patients to determine how many of the 56% that reachedmaintenancecontinuedAITforafull3years.2809 A retrospective cohort analysis of a German longitudinal prescriptiondatabaseindicatedthatattheendof3years, adherence to SCIT was 35%-37%, and higher than that reportedforSLIT(10%-18%).2810Adatamanagementret- rospective study compared adherence to SCIT and SLIT at the end of 3 years and found that SLIT patients had a higher dropout rate (39%) versus SCIT (32.4%).2808In a retrospectiveanalysisofacommunitypharmacydatabase, only18%of6486patientsstartingAITreachedaminimal duration and 7% for SLIT.2717A retrospectiveanalysiscomparedattritionratesinpatients prescribed SCIT or SLIT found at the end of the pre- scribed period, attrition rates were similar, 45% and 41%, respectively.2811Anotherretrospectiveanalysiscomparing SLITversusSCITadherencefoundthatonlyabout30%of patientscompleteda3-yearcourseofeithertherapy.2812 Overall, the strength of evidence is low since most studiesinvolvedretrospectiveanalysesandnonereported efficacy outcomes.

Of note, only seven of the 109 pregnancies initiated SCIT for the first- time during pregnancy. This study supported that SCIT was not only safe during pregnancy, but control of aller- gies and asthma during pregnancy may decrease adverse perinataloutcomes. To date, only one RCT has been performed to demon- strate the safety of starting SLIT in the pregnant popula- tion.Shaikhetal.2451separated280atopicwomen(326total pregnancies)intooneofthreegroups:155patientsreceived SLIT during 185 pregnancies (with 24 patients receiving SLITforthefirsttimeduringpregnancy).Theremaining patients were separated into two control groups, receiv- ing either daily budesonide (group A) or rescue inhaled salbutamol (group B). The study showed no significant differences in perinatal outcomes, suggesting that both initiationandcontinuationofSLITwassafeduringpreg- nancy. Although this study concludes that initiation of SLITduringpregnancyissafe,itisimportanttonotethat only24patients,13%ofthetreatmentgroup,fellintothe initiationarmofthestudy.

It is defined by the history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratoryairflowlimitation .\"2850In addition to the aforementioned respiratory symp- toms, a diagnosis of asthma typically requires evidence of variable obstruction of expiratory airflow, by bron- chodilatorreversibilitytestingorbronchialhyperreactivity tests.2850Inclinicalpracticepatientshaveavarietyofclin- icalpresentations,andwhenpatientsarewell,mosttests show no abnormalities.2851Increasingly, asthma is being recognized as a disease of airway inflammation and dis- orderedimmunology,aswellasaberrantphysiology,with combinationsof\"treatabletraits\"indifferentpatients.2852 Mostpatientshavemildormoderatedisease.Asmallpro- portion(upto10%)hasseverediseasethatisrefractoryto standard inhaled medications.

Recent population-based studies have shown rates between 20.3% and 93.5%.763,2854-2858In one study, AR was found to be an independent determinant of cur- rent asthma among adults (OR 7.72; 95% CI 6.56-9.09, p<0.001).763Some studies have shown that patients withcomorbidARtendtohavepoorerasthmacontrol,a greaternumberofexacerbationsperyear,andmorevisits to the emergency department.2859-2862Interestingly, the association of allergy with asthma weakens with more severeasthma2863(TableXIII.A.2). Non-allergic rhinitis is also commonly associated with comorbid asthma.2864,2865Increasingly, asthma is being considered a multifactorial disease with variable endo- type and phenotype presentations, particularly with regards to aberrant type 2 inflammation, which may or may not be allergic.2866,2867The functional relevance of this upper airway association can be summarized as follows: (i) In line with the unified airway hypothesis, allergen and irritant challenge to the nose and upper airway elicits lower airway inflammation through shared immunologicalandneurogenicpathways.2868 (ii) Nasalobstructionresultsinmouthbreathing,which leads to reduced filtration and humidification of 20426984, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

Aeroal- lergen sensitization may be the most important and has been demonstrated among adults and children across different geographic regions and populations around the world.845,2892,2893Indeed, most inhaled allergens are associated with both nasal and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.2894Occupational rhinitis is also a risk factor for occupational asthma caused by HMW agents.124Genetic polymorphisms common to AR and asthma, such as unique subtypes of deregulated circu- lating microRNAs, may airpollutants,(i.e.,blackcarbon,NO 2,NO,SO 2,CO,CO 2, andPM)mayincreasetheriskofdevelopingbothasthma and AR. Nevertheless, additional studies with improved study designs incorporating confounder variables (e.g., allergens), and standardized definitions of traffic related air pollutants are needed.2896-2898(See Section VIII.B.3.

No benefit was identified for chemi- cal or physical methods to reduce HDM methods in a 2008 Cochrane review examining randomized trials of subjectswithasthma.2923Similarly,singleallergenavoid- ance or elimination plans such as removing or washing pets, mattress coverings, removing carpeting, and use of HEPA filters have not shown strong evidence-based clin- ical benefit for reducing asthma and/or AR symptoms, although there are some exceptions (e.g., acaricides for HDMallergy).152,2923,2924Nevertheless,thereistheoretical benefit of reducing allergen exposure, a paucity of data 20426984, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

Pharmacotherapy Oral H 1antihistamines . Six RCTs were identi- fied that specifically evaluated H 1antihistamines for the treatment of asthma in the context of coexistent AR.2925-2930Cetirizine and loratadine are the two most highly studied second-generation antihistamines used concomitantly in AR and asthma. Elevated histamine levels after allergen challenge are associated with bron- choconstriction responses in acute asthma episodes. Cetirizine also has bronchodilatory effects which are significant both as monotherapy and in combination with albuterol.2931Despite biological plausibility of anti- histamines as effective treatment and improvement in subjective asthma symptoms, objective measures using PFT and PEF have failed to demonstrate significant improvements.2929,2932,2933Antihistamines may also have apreventiveeffectonthedevelopmentofasthmainatopic patients.2934In a subgroup analysis, the Early Treatment oftheAtopicChildtrialfoundanear50%reducedriskof developingasthmaamongcetirizine-treatedpatientswith grass pollen and HDM sensitivities. (See Section XI.B.1. Antihistamines for additional information on this topic.) (TableXIII.A.4.-1). Oral corticosteroids. Oral corticosteroids are commonly used in asthma patients who are inade- quately controlled with bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids.2935Theyarealsoeffectiveforsymptomsofrhinitis.1855Due to the side-effect profile associated with these medications, especially with increasing duration of use,2936oralsteroidsarenotrecommendedfortheroutine treatment of AR. For these reasons, an aggregate grade of evidence and evidence summary table are deferred. (See Section XI.B.2.a. Oral Corticosteroids for additional informationonthistopic.) Intranasal corticosteroids. In the 1980s, INCS were reported to improve asthma symptoms in patients with coexistent AR and asthma.2040,2937Two meta-analyses and 12 RCTs address the potential \"unified airway\" effect of INCS on asthma, and a single historical cohort study evaluates the impact of combination INCS and intranasalantihistamineonasthmaoutcomesinpatients with both AR and asthma.1886,1887,1990,2911,2913,2914,2938-2946 A 2003 Cochrane review evaluated the efficacy of INCS on asthma outcomes in patients with coexistent rhinitis, finding no significant improvement in asthma outcomes with INCS.1886Heterogeneity in study designs may have limited the findings of this meta-analysis and explain the discrepancy of the results compared to high-quality RCTs.Alternatively,a2013SRMAdemonstratedimprove- mentsinasthmaoutcomeswiththeuseofINCScompared to placebo in patients with asthma and AR, although the addition of INCS to inhaled corticosteroids was not associated with improved asthma outcomes.1887Patient educationwasnotedtobeimportantaspatientswithcon- comitant AR and asthma who received training on the proper use of INCS and education on the relationship of AR and asthma demonstrated significant reductions in asthmasymptomsandalbuterolusecomparedtopatients receiving INCS without additional education.2947Finally, intranasal azelastine-fluticasone propionate spray is a known effective treatment for AR alone.

There is relative disease sparing of the peripheral sinus cavities, and studies suggest a strong association with allergy.1222In2014Whiteetal.1219firstdescribedtheasso- ciationbetweenallergyandisolatedMTpolypoidedema, with16/16patientshavingallergensensitization.Hamizan etal.1220foundthatMTedema/polyposishasahighspeci- ficity and positive predictive value for the presence of inhalantallergy,withthehighestgradesofMTedemahav- ing the strongestassociation.

In2017,DelGaudioetal.1222introducedthetermCCAD to describe this distinct variant of sinonasal disease. Fur- ther progression of CCAD results in involvement of the sinuses by lateralization or polypoid changes of the MT causing secondary obstruction of the sinuses in a medial to lateral progression. In a multi-institutional case series including 15 patients, all patients had symptoms consis- tent with AR and allergen sensitization was seen in the 14patientswhounderwentallergytesting.Basedoncom- putational fluid dynamics, the proposed pathophysiology is a local immune response related to antigen deposi- tion in CC structures exposed to inhaled allergens.1222 features that differentiate CCAD from other CRSwNP subtypes, including oblique MT orientation, septalinvolvement,andlowerLund-Mackayscore. While there is conflicting data regarding the associa- tionbetweenallergyandCRSingeneral,thereisevidence to support an association between allergy and CCAD. In a subtype analysis of patients with CRSwNP, Marcus et al.1225reported significantly higher allergy prevalence inpatientswithCCADcomparedwithCRSwNPnototh- erwise specified ( p<0.001). patients with radiologic sensitization compared ( p=0.03).

While no association between CCAD and allergy sensitization was noted in CRS patients in East Asia, patients with CCAD had significantly higher peripheral in MT compared to the non-CCAD group, suggesting an eosinophilic/type2inflammatoryresponse.3016Radiologic featurescanbepredictiveofCCAD,butedema/polyposis of the CC on endoscopy remains the current diagnostic standard.InastudybyLinetal.,3016patientswithminor CCradiologic findingsand essentially normal endoscopy were included in the CC-CRSsNP group, which may not meet the definition of CCAD according to DelGaudio et al.1222While CCAD is a distinct variant of as AERD and respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamar- toma, reporting a positive association with AR.1223,3017,3018 Associatedconditions-centralcompartment atopicdisease Aggregategradeofevidence: C XIII.B.4 Aspirinexacerbatedrespiratory disease AERD is a chronic inflammatory condition that includes thetetradofasthma,nasalpolyposis,eosinophilicrhinosi- nusitis, and a non-IgE-mediated reaction to inhibitors of the COX-1 enzyme.3019Although considered an inflam- matory disease that results from dysregulation of arachi- donic acid metabolism leading to an overproduction of leukotrienes and not a true allergic condition, there are data that suggest an association between AERD and IgE-mediatedallergy.

In a survey of 190 patients with AERD, 86 (45%) of respondents had concomitant AR treated with AIT.3029More than half did not perceive anyclinicalbenefit,andonly8%reportedsignificanteffi- cacy.Thiscontrastswithnon-AERDpatientswithAR,in whom rates of improvement with AIT are greater than 80%.2419ThehighfailurerateofAITinAERDsuggeststhat ameliorationofanyatopiccomponentoftheirsymptoms is overwhelmed by the non-allergic AERD mechanisms.

Insummary,despitethehighrateofconcomitantatopy in AERD, symptoms related to inhalant sensitization are not responsible for the majority of AERD symptoms.

Overall, there is a significant burden of associated AC in patients with AR.

Patients with pollen allergies may have allergic reactions confinedtotheoralcavityafterconsumingspecificfruits, vegetables, nuts, or spices. PFAS symptoms manifest as a result of cross-reactivity of IgE specific for an offend- ing pollen with highly homologous proteins found in a varietyoffruits,vegetables,andnuts.Themostcommon exampleofthiscross-reactivityinWesternpopulationsis birch pollen and apples, which is due to the high degree ofsequencehomologybetweenBetv1(majorallergenof birchpollen)andMald1(majorallergenofapple),lead- ing to IgE-mediated cross-reactivity.3088TableXIII.E.1.-1 lists common pollen allergens with plant-derived foods that may demonstrate cross-reactivity.3089A 2018 review by Carlson et al.3090reported PFAS prevalence ranged from 4.7% to over 20% among children and 13%-58% among adults, with prevalence PFAS is typically established by a detailed history and physical exam that explores a given patient's underlying allergy to pollen and raw foods with sharedhomologousproteins.AspertheJointTaskForce Practice Parameters, sIgE testing to pollens is recom- 10% and 2%-10%,3093,3094 respectively, and such a must be thoroughly elicited.Thegoldstandardforestablishingadiagnosisof PFASisadouble-blindfoodchallenge,butthiscanstillbe confoundedbybiasesinherenttotheappearance,texture, andtasteoffoods.3095Itisimportanttonotethatskintest- ingusingcommerciallyavailablefruitorvegetableextracts maynotbeusefulastheallergensareheatlabile.3096Oral food challenge, SPT, and food sIgE levels have also been usedtodiagnosePFASorfoodallergy.3090,3097-3099Another technique that has also shown promise in accurate diag- nosisofPFASandfoodallergyisCRDutilizingpureand potentiallycross-reactiveallergeniccomponentsincertain foods.3100Thishasbeendemonstratedinrefiningdiagno- sisoftruepeanutallergy,wherethecomponentArah2has beenidentifiedasabetterpredictorofclinicalallergy.3101 The standard recommendation for the treatment of PFAS has been to identify and eliminate offending foods fromthediet.Thereisnoconsensusonwhetherpatients shouldbeprovidedauto-injectableepinephrine.3094Some 20426984, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

It is suggested that AIT is perhaps the only possi- ble disease-modifying treatment for allergic diseases by inducinglong-termtoleranceagainstspecificallergens.3134 AIT prompts the inhibition of early and late-phase aller- gic responses and induction of immunological tolerance of AR and food allergy via diverse mechanisms on T cells (e.g., Th1/2, Treg), regulatory B cells, innate lym- phoid cells, dendritic cells, mast cells, eosinophils, Downloaded https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alr.23090 by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

In addition to experimental evidence suggesting a link between AR and ETD, observational data also supports this association. For example, ET obstruction is observed duringnaturalexposuretoallergensduringpollenseason, evenwithoutsubjectsbeingintranasallyortranstympani- cally challenged.3172,3173Furthermore, in a representative adult cohort from the NHANES data, odds of report- ing allergies was 1.71 times higher in subjects with ETD comparedtothosewithoutETD.3174Similarly,apediatric population study found that significantly more children withARhadabnormaltympanogramscomparedtothose withoutAR.3175Histologically,increasedlevelsofallergic cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and eosinophils have been foundatbothendsoftheET,3161suggestingthatanaller- gic response could be activated at the ET in sensitized patients. However, despite both experimental and observational datasupportinganassociationbetweenallergyandETD, studies have failed to consistently demonstrate improve- ment in ETD and its associated symptoms with allergy treatment.Gluthetal.3176foundnosignificantnormaliza- tion of abnormal tympanometric signs and no improve- ment in ETD symptoms between patients treated with INCSandthoseinplacebogroups,andaclinicalconsen- sus statement found no role for systemic decongestants,antihistamines, nasal topical decongestants, or INCS in the diagnosis or treatment of patients with ETD.3177On the other hand, Pollock et al.3178found that ETD could bepreventedinsensitizedratswhenpre-treatedwithIL-4 receptordecoys,andDereberyetal.3179reportedimprove- ment in the ETD symptom of ear fullness in allergic patients treated with AIT in a retrospective case series (although the presence of reported food allergy in this groupmayconfoundtheresults). Overall, there is experimental and observational evi- dencetosupportacausalroleofallergyinthedevelopment ofETD.However,theexactpathophysiologicmechanism behind this association is unclear since not all patients withETDhaveAR,andtraditionalallergytreatmenthas not consistently shown benefit in reducing symptoms of ETD.

Elevated FeNO may raise suspicion for AR in patients with cough variant asthma or cough predom- inant asthma.3246,3247When AR and chronic cough are both present, FeNO may be able to differentiate between chronic cough due to cough variant asthma or non- asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis from ARandinhalantallergyhavebeenassociatedwithlaryn- gealdisease;however,understandingoftheirpreciserole in laryngeal disease is limited.

Establishing a causal relationship between AR and laryngeal disease has proven difficult, although asso- ciations have been reported. Lee et al.3252found an association between the diagnosis of chronic laryngitis and AR in a Korean nationwide cohort. Subsequently, Wang et al.3253identified a strong association between AR and developing laryngeal pathology in a Taiwanese nationwide cohort. Several studies have reported higher Voice Handicap Index (VHI) scores in AR patients ver- suscontrols.3254-3257Ohlssonetal.3258reportedthatvocal symptoms in those with AR worsen during the allergy season and may be associated with a decrease in speech fundamental frequency. Velickovic et al.3259found that overall AR is common and occurs in 44.2% of profes- sionalvoiceuserspresentingwithdysphonia.Singerswith self-perceived voice issues were 15% more likely to have AR than those without vocal complaints.3260The likeli- hood of AR increased as the number of vocal symptoms increased.3260 TheadverseeffectsofARonvoice-relatedQOLhavealso been reported,3254,3256,3261a n dT u r l e ye ta l .3261supported this association by showing that patients who reported poorrhinitis-relatedQOLalsohadpoorvoice-relatedQOL and increased severity of chronic laryngeal symptoms. Furthermore,increasedallergenloadwasassociatedwith greater severity of vocal symptoms.3257Overall, there is a higher than anticipated incidence of AR in patients with vocaldysfunctionandviceversa.3257,3260-3262 Findings of laryngeal inflammation have largely been attributed to laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), but recent studies have questioned its role as the primary source of laryngeal dysfunction.3256,3263Allergic laryngitis asso- ciated with AR can be difficult to distinguish from other laryngeal inflammatory disorders, including LPR, due to limitations of current diagnostic methods including poor specificity and inter-rater reliability. Patients with clini- cally significant LPR may be more likely to report AR symptoms.3264However, the opposite may be true in professional voice users presenting with dysphonia.3259 Randhawaetal.3263studiedpatientspresentingwithvoice concernsandreportedone-thirdwerediagnosedwithLPR, whereastwo-thirdsofpatientswerediagnosedwithaller- gies.LaryngealfindingsinLPRandallergiclaryngitisand significant the laryngeal mucosa of guinea pigs and found an increase in eosinophilia compared to saline exposure, providingsomesupportforallergenscontributingtolaryn- geal disease. Two studies from the same voice laboratory evaluated direct laryngeal stimulation by nebulized Der- matophagoidespteronyssinus in allergic patients to assess laryngealsymptoms,appearance,andfunction.3251,3270In the first study, Reidy et al.3251did not identify a signifi- cant differencebetweenantigen-and placebo-challenged subjects on any of the evaluated measures, such as VHI, SinusSymptomsQuestionnaire,laryngoscopy,andacous- tic/aerodynamictesting.Inafollow-up,Dworkinetal.3270 used increased allergen concentration for the challenge and noted an increase in endolaryngeal mucus, throat clearing, and coughing. Roth et al.3271performed a sim- ilar study but isolated the larynx by utilizing a nose clip to ensure oral inhalation and eliminated patients with reactive airways based on methacholine challenge, thus demonstrating a causal relationship between aller- gen stimulation and impaired vocal function. Suzuki et al.3272also utilized a nose clip and found more laryn- geal symptoms when patients were exposed to cypress pollencomparedtoplacebo.However,therewerenocorre- spondingobjectivechangesinacousticanalysisorflexible laryngoscopy.3272These studies suggest that in subjects with inhalant allergy there can be laryngeal dysfunction due to direct allergen stimulation of the larynx as well as possible symptoms secondary to the nasal congestion, inflammation,anddrainageofAR. There is increasing evidence suggesting a relation- shipbetweenAR,inhalantallergy,andlaryngealdisease. Although laryngeal findings specific to allergic laryngi- tisarenotconsistentlydemonstrated,thickendolaryngeal mucus should raise suspicion for underlying allergy. AR should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with vocal complaints. Additional studies are needed on the effect of AR treatment on associated laryngealdisease.3251 Associatedconditions-laryngealdisease Aggregategradeofevidence: C (Level 2: Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

Sleep is critical for mood, cognitive function, immune function, and endocrine functions.1104OSA is associated with hypertension, coronary artery disease, cerebrovas- cular disease, arrhythmias, insulin resistance, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and behav- ioral problems in children.3332-3337Further, in children, SDB may negatively impact brain development, impair psychomotor, and cognitive performance, and con- tribute to hyperactivity.3338-3340REM sleep is associated with memory, cognition, dreams, and restorative sleep.1119,1147As the nasal cycle is prolonged, worsen- ing nasal obstruction, people with AR have impaired REM sleep.1119,1147,3341-3343However, as the diagnosis of SDB typically relies upon the measurement of all-night AHI and RDI via polysomnography, many patients with AR and SDB have normal indices by this method. By considering respiratory effort-related arousals, as well as AHI and RDI measured specifically in REM sleep (REM-AHI, REM-RDI), sleep disorders in AR patients willbedetectedmoreoften.1121 CPAP treatment for OSA may present a non-allergic trigger to AR patients with OSA and worsen nasal symptoms.3344Further, persistent nasal symptoms are acommon reason for early CPAP non-compliance.3344-3346 However, correction of nasal obstruction can improve CPAP compliance/tolerance,3347-3349though there is typ- icallynodirectimpactonOSAseverity.3350 It is important to assess AR patients for sleep disor- ders due to their negative impact on health. Numerous instruments are available to assess the impact of AR on sleep. These include the Stanford Sleepiness Score, Jenkins Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Score, Pitts- burgh Sleep Quality Index, University of Pennsylvania FunctionalOutcomesofSleep,SleepScalefromtheMed- ical Outcome Study, Sleep Disorders Questionnaire, The PediatricSleepQuestionnaire,andThePediatricDaytime SleepinessScale. TreatmentofnasalcongestioninARpatientsimproves sleep quality, daytime somnolence, and QOL.3351Numer- ous medical therapies have been investigated regard- ing the link between AR treatment and sleep qual- ity. INCS and isolated nasal surgery have also been shown to improve sleep quality in AR patients, par- ticularly those with moderate-to-severe pre-treatment obstruction.1106,1107,2295,3352,3353INCSmayimprovesleepin patients with AR due to improvement in nasal obstruc- tion, but also due to reduction in local inflammatory cytokines.3319,3320A recent RCT and case series found significant improvements in sleep parameters following AR treatment with HDM SLIT.1095,3354First generation H1antihistamines cross the blood-brain barrier and cause sedation which may exacerbate daytime somno- lence in patients with AR and SDB. Therefore, newer- generation H 1antihistamines are favored, such as fex- ofenadine and loratadine, which are lipophobic and do not cross the blood-brain barrier.1771,3355,3356Although leukotriene antagonists have not demonstrated benefit when added to INCS in the treatment of AR, one RCT foundthatmontelukastwasmoreeffectivethancetirizine inimprovingsleepqualityinchildrenaccordingtopatient do not significantly improve AHI.3358A crossover RCT comparing xylometazoline to placebo in patients with OSA and nasal congestion found that xylometa- zoline did not improve sleep quality and resulted in a transient improvement in AHI at the time of peak effec- tiveness only.3358As these sprays carry the potential for rhinitismedicamentosa,insomnia,andpalpitations,they are not recommended for the treatment of AR in OSA patients.

When case rates were high, it was reasonable to suspend care temporarily, particularly if providers and healthcare facilities were redeployed.1213,3364However, as case rates fell, it was necessary to find ways to evalu- ate patients for AR.3365,3366Telemedicine, using phone or video where available, was rapidly implemented and provided significant access to specialty care while limit- ingexposureforpatientsandproviders.1213,3363,3364,3367,3368However, implementation of telemedicine practices may exacerbate gaps in access for populations already at risk forhealthdisparities.3369 Anotherevidentissuebecamethesimilaritiesinpresen- tation between AR and COVID-19, and it was important to identify ways to differentiate the diseases.3363,3364AR wasnotariskfactorforsevereCOVID-19infection.3370-3377 The consensus from a survey distributed to members of theARIA/EAACIstudygroupwasthatARpresentedwith runny nose, sneezing, stuffy nose, nasal pruritus, ocular pruritis, and redness compared to COVID-19 which pre- sented with more smell and taste dysfunction, dyspnea, and cough.3378Patients scored validated questionnaires like the SNOT-22 and mini-RQLQ differently.3379,3380 SNOT-22 scores were higher in patients with COVID-19 infection (with more frequent cough, dizziness, loss of smell/taste,psychiatric,andsleepdysfunction)compared topatientswithAR(withmorefrequentnoseblowingand sneezing).3379Inpatientswithallergicrhinoconjunctivitis withCOVID-19infection,mini-RQLQscoreswerelowerin COVID-19 infection in theirsymptoms with COVID-19infectioncomparedto typicalallergies.

Because SARS-CoV-2 viral loads are high- estintheupperairway,theseproceduresareparticularly high risk.3366,3395In many cases, if in-person encoun- terswerenotappropriate,diagnostictestingwasdeferred. In vitro serum sIgE was an to evalu- ate for allergen sensitization, although phlebotomy still required healthcare contact.1213Additionally, there was oftennational,regional,and/orinstitutionalguidancefor in person visits and procedures.1210,1213,3366,3395-3399Poli- cies to contain and reduce spread of COVID-19 are still evolving. At the time of this writing, available publica- tions often stemmed from early pandemic practices and expertopinion.Adjustmentstotherecommendationwith changing COVID-19 community transmission levels are ongoing but typically involved phased de-escalation of theserecommendations.3365 For in-person encounters, general considerations included measures to screen for COVID-19 infection, enhancesocialdistancing,andreducetransmission.Early intheCOVID-19pandemic,screeningpriortohealthcare facilityencountersincludedsurveyscreeningofsymptoms suggestive of COVID-19 for patients and staff3364,3365,3400and, in some countries, body temperature screening and epidemiologic tracking via smartphone.3398,3400Social distancing of at least 6 feet was recommended when possible.3364,3398,3401Thiswasimportantinclinicalspaces andthewaitingroom.Visitorlimitations(withoneadult allowed for children and none for adult patients when possible)wereenacted.3402,3403Clinicalcaremodifications included asking patients to fill out health information prior to visits, using telemedicine to obtain history to minimize in person time, and adjusting clinic sched- ule templates to allow for social distancing and room ventilation.3365Finally, measures to reduce transmission included hand hygiene, appropriate personal protec- tive equipment (generally including a mask), removing reading material to minimize indirect transmission, and enhancedcleaningoffacilities.3364,3368,3395,3400,3401 For aerosol-generating procedures, additional action was recommended. There have not been clinical studies of COVID-19 transmission with any allergy or otolaryn- gologic procedures. As stated earlier in ICAR-Allergic Rhinitis endoscopy is an option when evalu- atingtheARpatient,usedprimarilytoevaluatepotential intranasal signs associated with allergy or to rule out alternate causes presenting symptoms. Studies of nasal endoscopy has provided conflicting reports on aerosol generation.3404,3405Initial studies by two research groups using cadaveric heads did not demonstrate aerosol gen- erationduringcoldinstrumentation3406,3407althoughfur- ther studies in live particles.3408,3409Another endoscopy can induce behaviors including sneez- ing, breathing, speaking, and possibly coughing that are aerosol generating.3406,3408,3411However, some modifica- tionsincludingnasalendoscopyusingmodifiedsurgicalor N95 masks could prevent aerosol generation,3406,3408,3409 as well as repositioning at the back of the patient3412or using a tower with camera, screen, and light source.3366 Localanestheticsanddecongestantscouldbeappliedwith actuated pump sprays or soaked pledgets to avoid aerosol generation.3397,3406,3411 supplies were not constrained,rapidandaccuratepre-proceduralscreening forSARS-CoV-2wasalsorecommended.3365Forpersonal protective equipment, the WHO recommended an N95 face mask, full eye protection, and full body protec- tive clothing.3364,3397,3413Techniques to improve donning 20426984, 0, Downloaded by Zentralbibliothek Zuerich, Wiley Online Library on [15/03/2023].

There was specific motivation to control AR symptoms given concern that sneez- ing increased viral spreading and poorly controlled upper airway symptoms serve as a trigger for asthma exacerbations.1210,3366,3387,3414,3417In Beijing, providers made public efforts to develop pollen monitoring net- works, television, and online lectures, and suggested over-the-counter drug recommendations for all patients with AR.3398In addition, AR is not a contraindication to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Patients with AR were able to tolerate COVID-19 vaccination without severe reactions.3418-3420 Asalways,thefirststepinmanagementofARremains allergenavoidance.Thepandemicdemonstratedthataller- gen avoidance could significantly improve symptoms. Practices like face masks and handwashing appear to be mutually beneficial for management of AR and COVID- 19.3387Standard therapies for AR, including INCS, oral and topical antihistamines, montelukast, and AIT, were not identified as increasing susceptibility or severity of COVID-19 infection.3363,3364,3370,3414,3421Systemic corticos- teroids may be a concern although this is not a standard therapyforAR.3422PatientsonINCSwerefoundtohavea lowerriskforCOVID-19relatedhospitalization,admission totheintensivecareunit,andin-hospitalmortalitycom- paredtopatientswhowerenotonINCS.3423Montelukast has also been associated with a reduction in COVID- infection in a small retrospective cohort study of elderly asthmatics.3424 AIT has been shown to improve symptom control with a decrease in respiratory infections and antibi-otic use.3425Prior studies with viral infections including influenza, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and HIV have not shownchangesintheefficacyorsafetyofAIT.3392When COVID-19 cases were high, initiating AIT was gener- ally not recommended. However, consideration for con- tinuing AIT includes lengthening the injection interval which minimizes healthcare visits.1210,1213,3402,3414Con- sensus from one expert panel recommended lengthen- ing the interval to every 2 weeks during the build-up phase and every 6 weeks during maintenance. Therapy should be stopped if COVID-19 infection is suspected or diagnosed, until resolution.3364There was evidence that patients were more likely to be nonadherent and dis- continue AIT during the pandemic leading to higher symptom scores, decreased QOL, and higher medica- tion use than before the pandemic.3367,3426-3429Consid- eration for switching patients to or starting patients on SLIT, both tablet and aqueous forms, may be a preferred therapy since maintenance does not require in-person administration.1210,3368,3414In case of COVID-associated quarantine, an adequate supply of SLIT should be main- tained at home.3366,3392Finally, home SCIT in selected patientswascosteffectiveunderpandemicconsiderations alone.3363,3430Ofnote,thisisnotcurrentlyapprovedandis Finally, anti-IgE therapy has been approved for severe casesofJapanesecedarpollinosis.3414Thereisnoevidence of altered susceptibility or severity of COVID-19 infec- tion with anti-IgE therapy.

Studies have been undertaken to understand the prevalence of AR around the world. These are limited by differing methodology and reporting.

The evidence supporting the relationship between AR and other conditions is often conflicting.

The work on AR and COVID-19 continues to evolve. The following are topics of interest regarding COVID-19andAR: Improvedunderstandingoftheaerosolizationriskdur- ingnasalendoscopy Improved understanding of the risks of AR treatment, includingAIT,duringCOVIDinfection A deeper understanding of the long-term effects of COVIDonallergicdiseasesandtheirdevelopment XVICONCLUSION Inthisdocument,wesummarizedtheavailableliterature forARandcreatedrecommendationsbasedonthehigh- est levels of evidence. Through this, we have identified severalareaswithrobustliteratureandastrongevidence base. There have been many advances in the field since thepublicationofICAR-AllergicRhinitis2018,butnotable knowledge gaps remain. There are several areas of AR research which will be limited based on inherent condi- tions of study design. For example, it is not feasible to blindorrandomizeforsomeARtreatments,andepidemi- ologicalstudiestoevaluateriskfactorsmaybeinherently limitedbytheirretrospectivenatureandconfoundingvari- ables.
