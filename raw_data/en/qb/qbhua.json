Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) aims to treat the whole person - body, mind, heart and spirit - rather than simply treat the disconnected pieces separately, such as just the disease alone, and this is why TCM is truly holistic. TMC's view of the body places little emphasis on anatomical structures, but is mainly concerned with the identification of natural functional entities and their interactions with the outside world. While health is perceived as harmonious interactions which signifies a state of balance, a disease is interpreted as a disharmony in interactions. In South Africa, the Medical Control Council has regulated the use of TCM and strict standards have been maintained. In most cases, there is a NAPPI code assigned to each product in order for patients to claim from their respective Medical Insurance Policies. Through the specialisation in various treatments, Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners will treat the root (cause) and the branch (symptom) to bring upon a feeling of wellness, peace and harmony in the body. A Whole Person Approach Traditional Chinese Medicine will treat both the root (cause) and the branch (symptom) to bring a state of balance and a feeling of wellness, peace and harmony in the body. When the body is in balance you will sleep well, feel well, digest food well and have enough energy to get through your day "}
