What Our Customers Have to Say \"One word: ingenious Between this system and my salt system, I literally haven't messed with my pool for over 6 weeks. I've checked my levels three times now - staying perfect. Adding a pH control system to my pool finally makes feels like it's 2019 and we've actually figured out how to maintain a pool...\" - Tim, Georgia \"Your wonderful product solved my problem. I was having to add acid to my saltwater pool every other day to keep my pH on target. I was so excited when I received your product. It took me less than an hour to completely have the system up and running. Quality product and well engineered made the installation smooth and quick. I calibrated the controller and the next day it was right on. It has been two months and it's still on target. Not having to handle acid any longer is a win-win for me.\" - John, Texas \"Surprisingly easy! Got the CO2 tanks a couple days after receiving the pH controller. I hung the controller on the wall, connected the tubes from there to the tanks and pump, and plugged it in. Took me a few days to adjust it, and now it looks like it's doing the job!\" - Grant, Florida \"I tested my pH after running CO2 for a week and the pH dropped from 7.9 to 7.6. I am really happy and the alkalinity has stayed stable. I had the water tested at the pool shop and the guy was amazed. I just wanted to pass along my gratitude in creating such a great system!\" - Ivan, Australia More Questions?
