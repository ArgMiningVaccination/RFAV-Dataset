Detoxification is a natural process that our bodies use regularly to get rid of substances that are harmful to our health. Detoxification process happens naturally through our skin, sweat, breath, bowels and urine. Exposure to environmental toxins is inevitable. We get these toxins through air pollution, water and land due to society's use of pesticides and sprays, herbicides, additives, preservatives and heavy metals. In addition to this, many of us contribute to our toxic load through personal lifestyle choices, including: consuming alcohol, smoking, taking chemically derived medications, living with stress and lacking proper exercise. Sometimes, even our normal metabolism creates by-products that are toxic if not neutralized or excreted. Body's ability to detoxify properly depends on how efficiently your organs - liver, colon, kidneys, lungs and skin are to eliminate waste. If any one of these organs becomes compromised, proper detoxification cannot occur. When toxins accumulate in our bodies, they can cause a wide variety of symptoms, including: fatigue, unhealthy skin, joint pain and gastrointestinal problems. Long-term exposure increases our susceptibility to infections and can lead to serious chronic illness. Benefits of cleansing There are many benefits of detoxification which are considerable, including: increased energy and vitality, clarity of mind and better moods. Detoxification also improves allergies and weather symptoms, fatigue, skin conditions, chronic stress, gas and bloating, aches and pains, frequent headaches, difficulty sleeping and more. Most people notice a clearer complexion, brighter eyes, and even moderate weight loss. Detoxification will also decrease the toxic load in women before pregnancy so less is passed on to their future child. What will my detox plan include?
