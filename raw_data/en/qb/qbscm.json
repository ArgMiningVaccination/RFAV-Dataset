Some of the best meditation apps out there are designed specifically to show beginners the ropes\u2014and stick with them as they graduate into more advanced meditators. Experts often recommend apps for beginners who have no idea where to [start with meditation](https://www.self.com/story/how-to-meditate) because they provide guided instruction to show you exactly what to do and help you stay accountable. But it's not just the experts who love them\u2014the apps on this list have devoted user bases who swear by them, too. Below, find some of the best meditation apps out there, including both free options and subscription-based models that many people think are totally worth the price.

Don't worry\u2014many of them have free trials for precisely that reason. Alright, ready to start reaping the [benefits of meditation](https://www.self.com/story/mindfulness-meditation-health-benefits)? Let's talk apps! 1. Insight Timer It's not an exaggeration to say that Insight Timer is beloved by its users, many of whom think it's way underrated compared to the Headspaces and the Calms of the meditation world. But with over 260,000 reviews and a 4.9 average rating in the Apple app store, it's gone pretty mainstream and is a top pick for meditation beginners and enthusiasts alike. And it's not difficult to see why. While other leading meditation apps can get pretty pricy, Insight Timer stands out for its expansive free library. Not \"free\" as in \"try your first three meditations free, then have to sign up for premium,\" either. We're talking 70,000 free meditations and music tracks, with new content every day. For beginners, Insight Timer has a [seven-day free course](https://insighttimer.com/meditation-courses/course_learn-how-to-meditate-in-seven-days) that will teach you everything you need to know about how to meditate. You can also track your meditation practice and milestones with free charts that sync up to your other devices. Upgrading to [Member Plus](https://insighttimer.com/member-plus) unlocks more premium features, such as advanced courses, offline listening, and an upgraded audio player.

On top of plenty of basics, Headspace has guided meditations for just about every mood or goal.

Shine Shine was founded by a Black woman and a half-Japanese woman who felt left out of traditional wellness practices.

Calm Another big name in meditation apps, Calm is frequently recommended alongside Headspace as an all-around solid guided meditation app, for beginners and pros alike. You may have to try both to see which is right for you (they have free trials!), but reviewers love Calm for its hallmark nature sounds, music, and meditation retreat vibe. Seriously, Calm's name describes it pretty dang well\u2014the aesthetics make for a soothing user experience.

The Tapping Solution And now for something a little different. If you're someone who wants to meditate in theory but haven't been able to vibe with a practice, you might want to try The Tapping Solution. This app builds meditations around an alternative technique called tapping (also known as Emotional Freedom Techniques, or EFT), which combines elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure therapy, and acupressure with the aim of reducing stress and anxiety, managing [PTSD](https://www.self.com/story/ptsd-domestic-violence), and more. Plenty of reviewers mention their initial skepticism followed by surprise at how well the technique works for them. So hey, might be worth a shot.

All the guided meditations are between two and 10 minutes long. Admittedly, the jury's out on whether this kind of meditation has the same mindfulness benefits as some more traditional practices, but users swear by it\u2014at least as a way to blow off steam and take a moment to breathe.
