In the recent five years I have added psychotherapy. I attained my accreditation in reflexology and spiritual healing in Denmark were I was born, and the rest in Australia. I work intuitively and have always had a keen interest in the body, mind, spirit connection and relation, hence I see the body as a map holding information from all parts of our world. I have worked with many people who suffers trauma or are in an acute crises where I find the holistic approach very effective. Niels Mogensen Holistic Body, Mind, Spirit Healing and Alignment. The holistic treatment combination of massage and healing aligns body, mind and spirit and restores balance. Massage relaxes and releases the physical tension that can be a barrier to the full benefit and depth of the healing energies and experience, and it brings you in touch with your body and yourself. The state of deep peace and sense of inner security created in the safe healing space allows you to see and feel with greater clarity, with deeper compassion for yourself, so you can process issues with gentleness and greater understanding leaving you feeling more centred, light, and strong to live your life with greater clarity and freedom. In this safe space you can also, should you so choose, heal and integrate lost parts of the self, opening forgotten treasures of strength, and recover the joy of life and sense of connectedness that is naturally yours when you discover your wholeness. This healing modality can create both short and long term positive changes, and it is also very helpful and effective if you want to work more directly with deeper issues, such as trauma, or a crisis situation or just want to maintain general wellbeing.
