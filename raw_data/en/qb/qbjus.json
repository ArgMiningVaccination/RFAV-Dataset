That was the sobering mes- sage of the agency's operating plan submitted to Congress in February, which con- cedes there will be a \"temporary degrada - tion\" of services such as help at the national 800 number or getting a decision on disability benefits. The SSA got a 6 per - cent boost to its fiscal year 2023 operating budget to $14.1 billion. But the agency says most of that money is already spent and it doesn't see any improvement in what critics consider a terrible customer service record until fis- cal year 2024 begins in October. \"Approximately 75 percent of the budget increase will be required to cover fixed cost increases, \" SSA spokesperson Nicole Tiggemann says. These include rent for office space and automatic cost-of-living adjust - ments to federal workers' pay. That was frustrating news for advocates who have pushed hard for better SSA service. \"Our first reaction was, this can't be right, \" says Chad Mul- len, an AARP Social Security analyst. \"Last year, SSA stated that this funding would be used to improve customer service. We expect - ed to see SSA talking more about how things would be getting bet - ter, not worse. \" Mullen says AARP is \"espe - cially disappointed\" in project - ed longer waits for callers to So - cial Security's national number. The SSA estimates hold times will increase to 35 minutes amid \"unanticipated delays\" in overhauling its phone system. And \"wait times for a disabil- ity decision ... will continue to grow while we hire and train new staff, \" the agency says. 4Drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk say they will cut prices on some insulin products, an essen- tial medicine for millions of people with diabetes, to bring costs for those with private insurance plans more in line with a $35 monthly cost cap on insulin that took effect for people with Medicare drug coverage this year as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The fall of insulin prices was good news for those who had seen costs soar to $100 a month or more in recent years. Those announcements coincided with a govern- ment report predicting more good news on drug prices. The prescription drug aspects of the IRA will save Medicare beneficiaries $25 billion and cut the federal deficit, says an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO re- port says savings will come from allowing Medicare to negotiate some drug pric- es; drugmaker rebates to Medicare for price increas- es; and changes to the Part D prescription drug plan including a cap on out-of- pocket costs. For more news about pharmacy costs, visit aarp.org/drugprices.Pharma Firms To Lower Insulin Costs EEOC Targets Online Age Bias The federal agency in charge of enforcing laws against age discrimination in the workplace promised to take aim at digital pro- grams that sift through job applica- tions and all too often discard the resume s of older workers.BACON, EGGS, COFFEE. Eating an extra 25 grams of protein a day was linked to a 14 percent reduction in the risk of hip fracture in women, according to research from the University of Leeds cited by Science Daily. An extra cup of coffee reduced the risk an additional 4 percent. More older adults than ever use medication to help them sleep, and some special- ists warn that could come with worrisome consequences. A new report from the Cen- ters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that in 2020, 12 percent of people 65 and older regularly took medicine to help them nod off. That's higher than the total for all adults (8.4 percent), the CDC says. Earlier studies by the CDC show about a third of adults don't get enough sleep, and up to 70 million Americans have chronic sleep disorders. \"These pa- tients are often in the older age groups,\" says Robert Satriale, M.D., a sleep medicine specialist at Temple Health in Philadelphia. For those using medications to aid with shut-eye, special- ists urge caution. Newer sleep medications such (Ambien) and eszopiclone (Lunesta) have a \"somewhat safer\" profile than older drugs, says K. Ashley Garling-Na\u00f1ez, clinical assistant professor at the University of Texas at Aus- tin College of Pharmacy. Still, \"anything that's going to be sedating or make you sleepy is going to put you at risk for diz - ziness, falls, that sort of thing.\" 35 minutes estimated hold time for callers to SSA's national number The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says that for the next five fiscal years, it will focus on automation used to \"recruit applicants, or make or assist hiring decisions,\" and its potential to discriminate. \"We will continue to educate employers ... on the potential for unlawful bias so that these sys- tems do not become high-tech pathways to discrimination,\" EEOC Chair Charlotte A. Burrows said. The potential for automated hiring processes to weed out older Americans has been a concern for AARP and other advocacy groups since that technology became widespread. The digital programs can easily find clues in an applica- tion that indicate a worker's age, and eliminate older job seekers. TROUBLE SLEEPING?

These are the scams playing out right now BY SARI HARRAR 'Oops, Wrong Number!' Texts Seemingly misdirected messages are increasingly the start of a scam- mer's ploy. THE CON: A text message addressed to someone else pops up on your phone. It seems urgent\u2014a rescheduled business meeting, an illness, sometimes even a romantic get-together.

They may eventually invite you to join an adult website to see revealing pictures, so you hand over credit card info and money. \"Scammers are pri- marily aiming to find phone numbers where people are willing to engage, \" says a Federal Communications Com- mission (FCC) spokes- person. \"They might then use that to try to get personal informa - tion or sell or reuse the number as a target for another scam. \" PROTECT YOURSELF: Don't respond to texts from numbers you don't recognize. Simply delete them. Don't click on links in them or respond with \"STOP\" if the messages say you can do this to avoid future messages. Instead, block the phone numbers they come from. Fake Barcodes on Gift Cards That gift card tucked into a birthday card or thank-you note could be worth zero dollars if scammers siphoned off the value first. THE CON: Law enforcement agencies warn that nimble-fingered crooks affix fake bar - code stickers over the real ones on the back of gift cards in stores. When you purchase the card, the cashier scans the fake barcode at checkout\u2014directing your money into the scammer's gift card account. PROTECT YOURSELF: With some gift cards, you can make sure the number of the barcode matches the number on the packaging. Or feel or gently scratch the barcode on a gift card before buying. Don't purchase if the bar - code is on a sticker, or if the package is ripped, wrinkled, bent or looks tampered with, the Better Business Bureau recommends. Crypto Refund Swindles Beware if you've lost money in scam: Phony \"refund and recovery\" compa - nies might come at you next. THE CON: Criminals set up fake \"get your crypto cash back\" websites, including one that looks like it's from the U.S. Department of State. After luring targets, they contact those who respond by phone, email or social media and ask for personal ID information, including account numbers and passwords, plus an advance fee for their services payable by gift card, cryptocurrency or wire transfer. You get nothing, warns the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). PROTECT YOURSELF: Crypto investments aren't insured by the government the way bank accounts are. For the most part, funds lost to crypto scammers are gone. Don't trust anyone who contacts you saying they can get your money back, says Frank McKenna, chief fraud specialist for the fraud detection com- pany Point Predictive. Testimonial Videos Crooks on social media promise to make you whole, but only if you make a video for them. THE CON: After stealing your money in an investment or sweepstakes scheme or tak - ing over your social media account, crim- inals take the scheme to a whole new level by promising they'll return your cash or give you back control of your account if you make a testimonial video saying that you've made money in the fraud and that it's real and trust - worthy, warns Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center. Crooks post the video on your account that they have taken over to scam others, and you get nothing that was promised. PROTECT YOURSELF: Refuse demands to make a video, Velasquez recommends. \"We tell everyone, 'You won't get your account or your money back, '\" she says. \"And it could just further the scam with your friends. \" Fake High School Sports Streaming Sites They claim they'll show the big game, but instead they steal your money and info. THE CON: Popularized during the pandemic, streaming services for high school sports let you watch your niece's or grandson's latest match from anywhere\u2014often for free via a legit outlet aligned with the school. But scam streaming apps flood social media before events, posting messages about streaming the game; often they mention specifics (such as the names of key student athletes) to build credibility. \"Sometimes the athletes resend the messages, not realizing they're scams, \" says Mark Koski, vice president of the NFHS Network, a paid service that streams games from high schools. At game time, you click on the link, enter your credit card number ... and never see the action. But now scammers have your money and your personal ID info. Some even put extra charges on your credit card. PROTECT YOURSELF: Contact the high school before a game and ask how you can stream it, says the Better Business Bureau. Bank Impersonator Racket Criminals are finding a low- tech way around two-factor authentication. THE CON: Let's say you've set up your bank or credit card online accounts so you can access them only with a live code sent from the institution. Then let's say a criminal has your bank or credit card username and password login and wants to steal from you. What would he or she do? In this increasingly common fraud, they call you, claiming to be from your bank and warning about a prob - lem with your account. The caller tells you they're emailing or texting you a \"onetime passcode\" for logging in and asks you to read it back to them for verification. In reality, the scammer's login attempt triggered your bank to send you the passcode. Handing it over gives fraudsters full access to your account. PROTECT YOURSELF: Scammers are so good at impersonating helpful bank or credit card company employees that you can't tell it's a con, warns Kathy Stokes, AARP's direc - tor of fraud prevention programs. Never give your onetime passcode to anyone who calls you. Hang up, find your institution's phone number on a bank statement or on your cred - it card, and call. Ask if there really is a prob - lem and report the con to the bank's fraud department, McKenna recommends. LinkedIn Relationship Fakes Move over, romance scams. AARP is receiving a growing number of complaints about business relationship scams. THE CON: You get a message on LinkedIn, the popular workplace social media site, from someone who claims to be just starting out in the same industry you're in, seeking advice from a more experienced colleague. It's flat - tering and fun to be a mentor, and your guard is down because you're in a legitimate pro - fessional environment, says Amy Nofziger, \"Scammers are primarily aiming to find phone numbers where people are willing to engage. ... They might then use that to try to get personal information ... as a target for another scam.\" CONTINUED ON PAGE 10CONTINUED FROM PAGE 7 available by phone only.* Rated #1 by top product review sites. * *Must purchase annual subscription term for free offer.Scan code with your phone's c amera to view online Help is Onthe Way 3Devices starting at + FREE SHIPPING+ FREE MONTH+ FREE LOCKBOX**$19.95 P ursue what you love with confidence, knowing yourM edical Guardian device protects you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

LIMITED TIME that contain private informa- tion (financial statements, bills, shipping receipts) before putting them out for pickup. Don't want to invest in a good cross-cut shredder? Many communities have shredding events or permanent drop-off sites. Get in the habit of dropping off your accumulated documents once every few months. Routinely check yours (many credit card companies provide it for free; if not, go to AnnualCreditReport.com or 1-877- 322-8228). Watch for unusual activity; if you see any, report it immediately to the appropriate financial institution.Then freeze your credit report. This prevents scammers from opening new credit cards or making big purchases in your name. You can \"unfreeze\" it as needed for legitimate transactions. Visit IdentityTheft.gov for more information.Consider in- stalling a video camera; they are increasingly less expensive, and they're easy to install. If you don't recognize a visitor, don't answer. If you find yourself being pressured to buy or donate, have a refusal script ready (consider taping it near the door) that says, \"I do not do business at my door, please leave me some- thing to review. If I'm interested, I'll call you.\" Be wary of people posing as utility workers who show up unan- nounced. Don't al- low anyone in your house without an appointment.

Sign up at Informed Delivery.usps.com.Pick up mail as quickly as possible after it's delivered, and always take your outgoing mail directly to the post office. A hot fraud now is scammers stealing checks from mailboxes, erasing the ink and using them to steal from bank accounts.MAILBOX CREDIT CARDS Card skimming, in which the criminal affixes a credit card reader on top of a legitimate card reader at a store or gas station, is estimated to cause up to $1 billion in losses annually. When you are paying at a gas station or other point-of- sale location, inspect the device for loose/bro- ken/scratched machinery to make sure someone hasn't tampered with it. If you are unsure, notify the cashier and pay using an alternative method. CREDIT REPORTFRONT DOOR GARBAGEAARP's director of fraud victim support. You get to know each other, and eventually they ask to move your conversation onto a person- al device, then lure you into a scam. PROTECT YOURSELF: A request to contin- ue your chat on a more private channel is a warning. So is talking up crypto. LinkedIn may flag requests to go off-platform as it tries to remove fake accounts. But you should end the conversation and block the scammer. 'I've Got Your Package, Where's Your House?' Hoax Is that text, email, phone call or note on your door from a real delivery driver? THE CON: New package delivery scams in- clude texts and phone calls purportedly from a professional-sounding delivery driver who can't find your house. Didn't order anything? They may try to convince you someone's sent a gift. Or you may receive an email about rescheduling a drop-off or a fake \"package delivery attempt\" sticker on your front door. Their goal? To get you to provide personal information or simply click on a link they provide. That link then downloads malware that will harvest passwords and account info from your computer or dial a phone number with high per-minute fees. PROTECT YOURSELF: Contact the seller or delivery service using a verified phone num- ber, the FCC recommends. Don't use num- bers or links provided by potential scammers. Out-of-Stock Item Scam The email says the company is out of stock for the product you ordered. Where's your refund? THE CON: Scammers often place fake ads on social media sites for products at too-good-to- be-true prices, take your order and payment info, then tell you the item's not available right now. Your refund is on the way, they promise, but it never arrives. And you can't reach anyone at the company about it. PROTECT YOURSELF: Research business- es online before you buy, and only shop on secure websites with a lock symbol in the browser bar and an internet address that be - gins with \"https. \" And pay by credit card, the FTC recommends. That way, you can with- hold payment pending an investigation.\u2014PART 2\u2014 Sari Harrar is a contributing writer to AARP The Magazine and writes frequently for the Bulletin and others on fraud, health and consumer affairs.

Do not open file attachments in emails from businesses or people you don't trust completely. Malware is often planted via email attachments.When typing in a URL, double- and triple-check the spelling to ensure you are on the correct page. Scammers often create a URL with one letter off from the authentic one in hopes you don't catch it. Remove your credit card number and in- formation from restaurant delivery and retail store sites. Pay using an e-payment service that keeps credit card info on a highly secure site.Turn on two- factor authentica- tion for all secure websites you frequent, such as fi- nancial institutions or utility companies (find out how via its online security center).

AARP .ORG/BULLETIN 11SMARTPHONE If you have a newer model, turn on biometric identification (finger print or fa- cial recognition); this will help pre- vent a thief from logging in to your phone. Send calls from unknown num- bers to voicemail (you can en- able this in the phone's settings). Make sure your voicemail is set up and not full, so you can re- ceive legitimate messages. Scammers are sending far more bogus texts, often posing as compa- nies you routinely deal with. Never respond to an un- solicited business text; if you think it might be valid, call the organiza- tion or go online. YOUR BRAIN Learn how to not engage. You are under no obligation in these modern times to respond to calls, emails or texts from strangers\u2014 especially given that so many of them are fraudulent. Learn to say no. Sometimes a caller will get through. Get tough: Say, \"I do not do busi- ness over the phone. Goodbye.\" Then hang up without remorse. Trust your instincts. If something doesn't sound right, run it by someone you trust and take extra time to think about it. Amy Nofziger is the director of fraud victim sup - port with AARP.

COMPUTER SOCIAL MEDIA EMAIL ACCOUNTS ONLINE STORES ICONS BY ELIAS STEINFor discounts on device protec- tion APRIL 2023 12The challenges of fraud in America are in plain sight: Rarely a day goes by in which each of us doesn't re - ceive an illegal email, phone call or text that aims to steal from us. The nation's annual fraud statistics are mind-numbing: billions of dollars lost by consumers, trillions of fraudulent calls and texts to our phones. Less obvious are the efforts going on be - hind the scenes to fight what is arguably the biggest crime wave of all time. But in a wide range of interviews, we discovered a robust mix of activity focused on reducing the threats of fraud for all older Americans. Here are just a few scenes from the front. STATE AND LOCAL INITIATIVES States play a dominant role in the war on fraud, and they are responding with aggres- sive new measures. Some examples: New York in December passed a law to re - quire retail stores that sell gift cards to dis- play warnings to customers about prepaid card scams and instructions on what to do if they spot a scam. New Jersey's 2022 Stop the Fraud law requires retailers that sell gift cards to train employees to identify and re - spond to fraud. In Wyoming, a measure signed into law by Gov. Mark Gordon (R) in February would allow banks and credit unions to put a five- day hold on a transaction they believe is part of a scam and report it to law enforcement. On the enforcement side, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong (D) says that he and his peers in other states have been working in a \"bipartisan, multistate\" way to take on scams across their borders.

Some cities and localities are also active in taking on scams. In the Greater Cleveland area, the Cuyahoga County Department of Consumer Affairs runs a \"scam squad\" that teaches people how to spot and avoid scams, says Sheryl Harris, the agency's director. In Santa Clara County, California, the district attorney's office put together a high-tech task force to trace money stolen in scams involving bitcoin and other cyber - currencies. It turns out that currency can be tracked to an identifiable location and\u2014 more importantly\u2014retrieved. By December, the task force had recovered $1 million. \"It was super successful and great timing, because we were able to get money back to victims right before Christmas, \" says Erin West, prosecutor for the task force. FEDERAL INITIATIVES The federal government has an important weapon against fraud that states lack: regu- latory agencies that can establish nationwide rules for businesses\u2014and enforce them. Here's some of the activity taking place: As usage of peer-to-peer (P2P) money- transfer apps such as Venmo, PayPal and Zelle rises, \"scammers are increasingly targeting older Americans on P2P platforms, \" said Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), chairman of the Senate ag - ing committee. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) wants to force financial institutions to ensure consumers who are defrauded are repaid.

The Fake Goods Scammer Gareth David Long, 43, Las Vegas Long, a British citizen who ran a Las Vegas payment processing busi- ness, made more than $11 million by charging people for goods and services they never purchased. Federal prosecutors say he ripped off bank ac- counts of 375,000 unsuspecting victims\u2014many of them retirees. Pros- ecutors say Long used his business to steal the personal information of vic- tims. Long bought a ranch in Texas, three airplanes, exotic cars and a fire truck with sto- len funds. In 2020, he was sentenced to five years and eight months in federal prison.The Too-Good-to- Be-True Scammer Antonio Carlos De Godoy Buzaneli, 61, Key Biscayne, Florida Buzaneli targeted victims by peddling a bogus investment scheme that prom- ised vast returns. Prosecutors say he drained some victims' entire retirement savings. The scam raised money from inves- tors who were lured by promises of big profits on interna- tional investments, according to court documents. Buzaneli kept the scam going by making Ponzi-style payments to those he duped. Investors lost more than $100 million, federal court records show. In 2019, he was sen- tenced to 20 years in federal prison.The Fake Business Scammer Jennifer Shah, 49, Salt Lake City While starring in the reality television show The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, Shah and a partner ran a lu- crative Manhattan- based scam tar - geting older Amer - icans. For nearly a decade, they operated a nation- wide telemarketing scheme that sold bogus business services and duped victims into fake investments, pros- ecutors say. Shah pocketed millions and hatched plans to move operations to Kosovo to avoid prosecution. In 2022, she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and was sen- tenced to 2\u00bd years in federal prison.The Romance Scammer Dominique Golden, 31, Houston Golden played a key role in a $2.5 million romance scam that targeted older Americans by posing as love inter - ests on dating sites. Court records show that one woman, a 76-year-old widow in Rhode Island, sent more than $660,000 to the group after meeting someone online she believed was a U.S. Army general serving in Afghani- stan. The widow re- financed her home and sold property in Massachusetts in order to send the money. In 2022, Golden pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the scam. She was sentenced to 6\u00bd years in prison early this year. She will also forfeit luxury cars, three Rolex watches and other jewelry. 007-008_010-014_BUL-APR-2023 proposed rules that instruct mobile wireless providers to apply caller ID authentication to text messaging. The rules require wireless providers to block suspicious numbers from sending texts. In the investment area, a regulatory rule that took effect last year allows financial brokers who suspect that an older client is being manipulated by a scammer to pause the transaction so firms and state authorities can in- vestigate potential wrongdoing. That temporary hold is important because \"once the money has left the account, it's very difficult to recover, \" notes Gerri Walsh, senior vice president of in- vestor education at FINRA, the organi - zation that oversees U.S. broker-dealers and that implemented the changes. Regulatory agencies also can get results through the courts. Nearly 40,000 victims of fraud who used MoneyGram have been granted more than $115 million in com- pensation\u2014the full amount of money lost, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service an- nounced in February. MoneyGram, a Dallas- based money-transfer company, paid the funds to settle a federal suit accusing it of, among other things, failing to protect consumers from fraud when crooks would request payment be sent via MoneyGram.

New tax breaks and rebates could lower the cost of big-ticket home improvements Thanks to a fascinating range of new and improved energy systems and equipment, homeowners can in- creasingly tap into the sun on their roof, the air temperature outside\u2014even the stable year-round temperature some 100 feet in the ground below their home\u2014to cool, heat or generate electricity for their home. Most of these technologies are earth- friendly, meaning you can reduce your car - bon footprint substantially. But that's just one of the driving forces behind the surge in en- ergy retrofits among homeowners. \"People want more comfort and lower utility costs, \" says Scott Fischer, managing member of New Jersey company Ciel Power, which installs home insulation and other energy-saving BY DEBORAH BALDWIN upgrades. Though estimates vary, average energy costs easily top $2,000 per year. There's also the game-changing package of tax credits and rebates included in last year's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Those financial incentives make now an excellent time to con- sider big investments to reduce your house - hold's reliance on the established energy grid. These new tax credits include $2,000 a year for any combination of heat pumps, heat pump water heaters and biomass stoves and boilers; if you make investments gradually, you could claim the max each year on your tax return. Clean-energy tax credits for solar, geothermal and wind power systems can go even higher, and unused amounts can be carried forward to benefit you on future tax returns as well. In addition to energy credits, the IRA authorized nearly $9 billion in rebates for upgrades that make homes more energy- efficient or shift reliance away from fossil fu- els and toward electric power. These rebates, which will be administered by states, can go as high as $14,000 for low-income house - holds and cover such things as a new electric stove or a heat-pump dryer. Some crucial details remain unknown: What incentives will utilities offer custom- ers to encourage improvements? How will states, which are to administer the federal rebate programs, deliver them to buyers? Which products will the Department of En- ergy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency certify as qualified for credits? And there's the bottom-line question for homeowners: How long will it take for your lower energy bills to offset your is a licensed insurance sales agent/producer.

That depends on a slew of factors, such as your climate, the amount of energy you use, the heating and cooling systems you have now and utility rates. To help estimate that number, use the DOE's ResStock analysis tool (resstock.nrel.gov/ factsheets). And consult contractors who specialize in energy upgrades, since they can help evaluate potential savings in your area. With that in mind, let's tour the options for some big energy upgrades: SOLAR ELECTRIC PANELS WHAT THEY DO: Convert sunlight into electricity. COST: Rooftop systems run from about $15,000 to $25,000. Storage batteries can add $12,000-plus. In Florida, for example, a solar system plus storage battery ranges in cost from about $21,000 to $61,000. AVAILABLE CREDIT: 30 percent of your in- vestment, with no cap. AVERAGE SAVINGS: About $1,000 or more a year, or between $20,000 and $75,000 over a system's roughly 25-year life span, propo - nents say. Systems that let you sell excess power back to the grid on sunny days can help shorten payback time. Some utilities purchase so-called solar credits from home - owners to meet state sustainability goals. MAKE MOST SENSE FOR: Well-insulated homes with unshaded south-facing roofs or yards, and owners with cash up front or an ability to finance. KEEP IN MIND: Panel placement may be subject to zoning rules and permits. Build - ings and trees can throw shade on your ener - gy farm. Backup power will likely be needed on cloudy days, especially if you don't have a storage battery. You'll occasionally need a pro to wash the panels down. Your utility may buy power from you at a lower price than the one it charges you. AIR SOURCE HEAT PUMP WHAT IT DOES: Working like a two-way fridge or air conditioner, removes heat from the air and blows out cool air in summer; does the reverse in winter. Moving heat rather than generating it, these electrically powered pumps are typically more efficient than con- ventional air-conditioning systems and fur - naces. Systems can be centralized or deliver warm and cool air via individual \"mini splits, \" which allow for more localized control and are better suited for smaller spaces.COST: Between $12,000 and $20,000 for a centralized system. AVAILABLE CREDIT: 30 percent of the total, up to $2,000. AVERAGE SAVINGS: Depends partly on what fuel you'll be switching from. It could be $1,500 a year, for example, if you now have a propane furnace, the DOE estimates. The private research company Carbon Switch says you can save $637 a year in New York and $935 in Pennsylvania. MAKE MOST SENSE FOR: Houses with ag - ing HVAC systems in areas with rising utility rates. The colder the climate, the harder the heat pump has to work, and in some cases you may need backup heat. KEEP IN MIND: Your overall utility bills should go down if you're switching from fos- sil fuel, but your electricity bill is likely to go up. It can be a challenge to find a seasoned installer with expertise in electricity as well as plumbing. You may need ductwork, which will raise the cost. You should make sure your system qualifies for your utility's rebate program before you buy. SOLAR WATER HEATER WHAT IT DOES: Installed on the roof or on unshaded ground nearby, it uses the sun's rays to heat water, which then flows into your regular plumbing. \"Active\" systems couple a collector and storage, and can be more effective in colder climates; simpler \"passive\" tanks work best in sunny climes. In most areas these heaters are fast being eclipsed by hybrid heat pumps (see below). COST: $5,000 to $7,000 on average; up to $13,000, HomeAdvisor says. AVAILABLE CREDIT: 30 percent of cost. AVERAGE SAVINGS: If your backup is an electric water heater, about $280 a year over the roughly 20-year life span of the heater, according to the DOE. MAKE MOST SENSE FOR: New homes, as the heaters can be more easily integrated with plumbing. They work best in areas where temperatures rarely fall below freezing. KEEP IN MIND: In many areas you'll need a two-tank system, or one in which the solar water heater preheats water before it enters a conventional water heater. HYBRID HEAT-PUMP WATER HEATER WHAT IT DOES: Like an air-source heat pump, uses electricity to move heat from one place to another, aided by fans and refriger - Y our Money AARP BULLETIN APRIL 2023 18CONTINUED new equipment\u2014and even if you don't\u2014profes- sionals advise taking some simple measures to make your energy usage more efficient.

It can slash energy use by up to 70 percent compared to conventional gas and electric heaters. COST: Up to $3,000, sometimes more, com - pared to around $1,200 for a tank-style water heater. AVAILABLE CREDIT: 30 percent, up to $2,000. AVERAGE SAVINGS: About $200 to $600 per year. MAKE MOST SENSE FOR: Homes with aging water heaters, and a room at least 1,000 cu- bic feet in size and a constant temperature range of 40 to 90 degrees in which to place the heater. KEEP IN MIND: Requires a drain and a 220- volt electrical source. GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMP WHAT IT DOES: Heats and cools your home, and sometimes your water, using electricity and pumps to tap consistent temperatures of the earth belowground (45 degrees to 75 de - grees, depending on your latitude) or a body of water. An efficient system can generate up to 4.5 times as much power as it consumes. COST: $10,000 to $30,000, in general.AVAILABLE CREDIT: 30 percent, up $2,000. AVERAGE SAVINGS: The systems cut ener - gy use by 25 to 50 percent, compared with fossil fuel systems, and up to 72 percent compared with electric heating and standard air-conditioning. Lasting 20 years or more, the systems can pay for themselves in five to 10 years, depending on where you live and your utility costs. MAKE MOST SENSE FOR: New builds, though homes across the country are being retrofitted with these systems. KEEP IN MIND: Not all sites are geologically conducive; these systems may require drill- ing 100 to 400 feet into the ground. Installa - tion costs vary enormously.

Amazon, Target, Walmart and other websites sell them as purchase add-ons for even cheap stuff like $30 hair trimmers. They seem to offer peace of mind, but I had many questions about them. And I was sur - prised by the answers. What's an extended warranty? A warran- ty is a company's promise to stand behind its product. Most products come with a free man- ufacturer warranty, so, for example, if your toaster breaks within the warranty period (of- ten a year or two) the maker should repair or replace it. Extended warranties provide sim - ilar guarantees for additional years. But they may have different terms than original war - ranties and are often sold by other companies. Why are they everywhere? Simple: They're a huge moneymaker. According to the non- profit Consumers' Checkbook, stores typi- cally pocket 50 to 70 percent of the cost of warranties. They're that profitable because buyers overestimate the chances a prod - uct will break during the coverage period, according to a University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of business study. Are there any alternatives? Most major card issuers provide free extended warranties for purchases made with at least some of their cards; check your card agreement for details, especially exclusions. Another way to get a free extended warranty is to shop at Costco, which provides extra protection on TVs, com - puters, appliances and some other products. How do I assess whether to buy one? First, don't rely on a salesperson's description. Ask for a copy of the policy and study it carefully, along with the manufacturer's warranty and your credit card's protection plan. Look for duplicate coverage, exclusions, deductibles and claim requirements such as having to ship the product to a repair shop. If you can't be bothered or the fine print is too confusing, think twice. USA Today tech columnist Kim Komando advises that rather than spend mon- ey on a warranty, you should apply those dol- lars to a more reliable brand or buy protective cases for your goods and treat them right. But shouldn't I get one for my new car? Maybe, if you're buying a model that's unreli- able or expensive to repair. But you're better off checking reliability ratings and avoiding vehicles that will drown you in repair bills, according to Consumer Reports. And don't let any sneaky salesperson add an extended warranty onto your bill without your OK. Any last red flags? If the warranty is being marketed by aggressive telemarketers or via texts or emails, steer clear. Many of these warranty offers are just \"flat-out scams, \" re - ports the Michigan attorney general's office. As for me, I've decided to skip all extended warranties. I can live with a little risk. 20 BY LISA LEE FREEMANY our Money Live Well for Less Depart as early in the day as possible. Early-morning flights (5 a.m.-8 a.m.) will only shave about 2 per - cent off the cost of your flight, but they're half as likely to be delayed as flights that leave later in the day (after 9 a.m.). That could save you the headache\u2014and the associated expenses\u2014that can come with a delayed flight. Check out the new airlines. Two air - lines\u2014Avelo and Breeze\u2014launched during the pandemic and another, North- ern Pacific Airways, is slated to start flying this spring. New airlines like these often have a strategy of winning market share by offering ultra-low fares. One caution: These airlines tend to highlight base fares for tickets, so make sure you understand the total cost before making the purchase. Check out the competition. As start-up airlines add new routes, established air - lines flying those routes often lower their prices amid the increased competition. Book your group members separately. Airlines often have a certain number of seats available at each pricing level. If they only have three tickets available at $200, and you're trying to buy four seats at once, they won't turn up in your search. Book individually or in groups of two. You could nab the low-price seats. Use your airline card to save on other expenses. In addition to racking up miles, paying for a flight with an airline credit card may offer unexpected sav - ings on travel like a free checked bag or discounts on in-flight food and drink. Make a stop. Direct flights cost, on av - erage, 20 percent more than those with a layover, according to Google Flights. If you aren't pressed for time, you can make a layover more palatable by down- loading apps where you can find things to do at the airport, like shopping tips or restaurant recommendations.

And stress also im- pairs the brain's ability to pluck info from your memory bank. Take this as a sign you need to sleep more and stress less. IT'S PROBABLY ... Just a Blip What likely happened: If you're inattentive or multitasking, your brain may not record where you put your keys. \"So when you go into the file cabinet of your mind to pull out the info again, there's nothing there,\" explains Joel Salinas, M.D., assistant professor of neurology and dementia specialist at NYU Langone Health. It's probably noth- ing, but if this type of forgetfulness grad- ually happens more frequently so that it becomes a pattern, see your doctor for an evaluation, he says.

Something Unrelated Sleep disorders, anxiety, isolation and other physical or psychological conditions can mimic the beginnings of cognitive decline. If you feel as if you're spending a sufficient time asleep in bed but you're still tired during the day, get an evaluation for sleep apnea. If your mood is in decline, talk to your doctor. Lastly, check your meds. A wide array of drugs can pose long- and short-term risks of cognitive impairment. IT COULD BE ...

In a wide-ranging interview, Milken talked about his person- al experience with cancer and his transition from financier to med - ical research funder. What's the impact of CaP CURE and the Prostate Cancer Foundation? Our promise to the medical community was that we would work to double the funding for all life-threatening diseases, not just prostate cancer. The \"Ca\" stood for all cancers, the \"P\" for prostate and the \"CURE\" for all life-threatening diseases. We put on a march in 1998, and President Clinton signed into law the dou - bling of NIH funding, which cul- minated in the work of thousands of people. The PCF today is the largest private funder of pros- tate cancer research. If a person in my condition was diagnosed today, they would tell them they have at least five years to live and probably will not die from pros- tate cancer. There are 3.7 million more cancer survivors today than was predicted when we launched CaP CURE in 1993. After two decades of declines, prostate cancer rates are rising, especially in late stages. What were your thoughts when you heard about that? Every single person should be asking their doctor about can- cer screenings. Had I not asked In January 1993, Michael Milken was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. He was 46. \"The cancer had spread through my body, \" says Milken, author of Faster Cures, a new book about his cancer jour - ney and the research advances it spurred. \"They told me that I had 12 to 18 months to live. \" A urologist advised him to get his affairs in order and find a psy - chologist to help him, his wife and their children process the news. Milken had other ideas. \"I was going to try a few other things first, \" he says. His cancer was treated with hormone-lowering drugs and radiation, while Milken over - hauled his diet\u2014replacing dou- ble cheeseburgers and corned beef sandwiches with soy shakes and raw vegetables\u2014and got se - rious about exercise and medi- tation. And it worked. Yet as he crisscrossed the country meet - ing with leading cancer experts, he wondered, \"Why is this very prevalent disease stuck in the Middle Ages of research?\" Shortly after his diagnosis, Milken started CaP CURE, the forerunner of the Prostate Can- cer Foundation (PCF), the largest philanthropic organization fund - ing prostate cancer research in the world. Known for his headline-grab - bing approach to junk bond in - vesting and corporate takeovers, Milken's Wall Street mindset fueled his assertive funding of medical research. He required re - searchers to collaborate, focused on young scientists and sent fast cash for approved projects. About 30 years later, the PCF has helped fund important drugs for advanced prostate cancer, new multi-cancer blood tests, robotic surgery for prostate can - cer, and understanding of pros- tate cancer growth, genetics, for the PSA test, you would not be speaking to me today. It's an issue of health literacy, of educa - tion. With proper screening and proper treatment, you can sub - stantially reduce the death rate. Since the 1970s, you've donated $1 billion to medical research. And your founda- tions\u2014including the Prostate Cancer Foundation and the Melanoma Research Alliance\u2014 have raised at least that much. What motivated you to write Faster Cures now? What we learned from COVID was that just because you have scientific breakthroughs, peo - ple don't necessarily take them or accept them. There is a gap. We cannot just introduce new products without better medical and health literacy. That's one of the prime reasons why I wrote this book. In the book, you talk about a report projecting zero prostate cancer deaths by 2051 if re- search funding is high enough. Can you elaborate? We're following two broad ap - proaches: First, develop better screening tests that help diag - nose disease early\u2014before it spreads\u2014and urge every man to get tested. Second, we're dou- bling down on research invest - ments to target the specific ways some cancers evade current treatments and lead to death. This is especially important for WAGING WAR ON PROSTATE CANCER Philanthropist Michael Milken talks about the path to zero deaths by mid-century BY SARI HARRARMichael Milken speaking at a prostate cancer fundraiser Prostate Cancer Primer FROM LEFT: JARED is a contributing writer to AARP The Magazine and writes frequently for the Bulletin and other national publications on fraud, health and consumer affairs.patients who aren't screened and then develop advanced disease. How will developments you're funding in prostate cancer and melanoma improve survival in other cancers? Many cancer types share the same molecular driver. Yet there's a tendency to cling to the 19th century classification by organ\u2014breast cancer, prostate cancer, etc. Some prostate can- cers may be molecularly closer to lung cancer, for example, than to other prostate cancers. In fact, more than 70 types of cancer share prostate cancer's molecular profile. We're re - searching how to interfere with the \"master control\" of tumor metabolism across cancer types. What do the top scientists tell you will be the major victories in cancer detection and treat- ment in the next decade? Several areas have great prom- ise. One is to attack cancer cells that researchers used to call \"undruggable targets. \" New drug types destroy those tar - get cells by attaching payloads like radioactive atoms, or tox - ins, or engineered killer T cells. Meanwhile, the revolutionary advances of immunology over the past 25 years\u2014especially against fast-growing cancers like melanoma\u2014are expected to continue and expand to other diseases, saving and extending many more lives. A former director of the National Cancer Institute, Andrew von Eschenbach, has said you changed the culture of medical research. How? When you want to solve difficult problems, you need the best people working in this field. It isn't just retaining them, it's re - cruiting the best and brightest. The highest rate of return we've gotten through our philanthropy over the last more than 40 years has been identifying young re - searchers in their 30s. By fund - ing them, we were able to get many more people focused on cancer over the years. That's one of the reasons we've had such breakthroughs in cancer. At 76, you work more than full- time. What motivates you? I think it was my father's mela - noma diagnosis and death in the early '70s that made me realize that life is fleeting. My father's mother died in childbirth. His father died in an auto accident when he was 11. Because of med - ical advancements, I have the luxury of spending time with grandchildren who hopefully will all see the 22nd century. Every single person should be asking their doctor about cancer screenings. Had I not asked for the PSA test, you would not be speaking to me today. produced by your prostate. High numbers warn of cancer. You don't necessarily need a digital rectal exam. Once a mainstay of prostate can- cer testing, the infamous gloved-finger feel of your pros- tate's size and shape isn't nec- essary for a first-line prostate cancer screening because a PSA is more sensitive, accord- ing to the American Urological Association. APRIL 2023 GUILHERME HENRIQUEY our Life KEEP YOUR OLD COMPUTER RUNNING You should get more than a couple of years out of that expensive machineP. 3 0 Q&A: ADM. WILLIAM M cRAVEN 26When you get a new comput - er, it seems lightning fast. But after a few years, it slows ... and slows. The reasons aren't a mystery: With age, the number of stored programs and appli- cations keeps growing, strain - ing its resources. At the same time, the physical mechanisms in the hardware degrade. But considering that the cost of a decent new comput - er often approaches or ex - ceeds $1,000, you probably want to keep your current one running well as long as possible. The typical life span for a computer is three to five years, but with routine care and maintenance, you can stretch that to seven years or longer. Here's how:BY LEXI PANDELL 1 Treat the viruses. Is your comput- er suddenly much slower, besieged by pop-ups or crashing regularly? Antivirus software scans can clear out malware pro- grams and be set up to run automatically, so this process is reg- ularly done for you. Some popular options include Bitdefender Antivirus, Norton Anti- virus Plus, Kaspersky, and McAfee Antivirus Plus. All run about $60 per year.3Add memory. If you open multiple applications and your computer slows, that may be a sign you need more RAM. Gen- erally, upgrading from 4GB (gigabytes) to 8GB will do the job (about $40). You can add memory by your - self, but it involves opening up the com- puter. (You can't do this with Apple prod- ucts.) Taking your computer to a repair shop should cost about $40 for labor.2 Declutter. Delete applica- tions and files you don't need. Freeing this space helps the machine run faster. \"That's like taking out the trash in your home,\" says Eddie Matos, director of technical support for Dell. \"It's going to give you extra hard drive space.\" Free programs such as CCleaner will scan your computer and tell you if there are temporary files that can be deleted easily.4 Go extreme. \"A clean wipe of the hard drive and a fresh installation of the operating system will breathe new life into the system almost immediately,\" Matos says. But this is an ex - treme option, as it will wipe information off your computer; you'll need to back up data first and reload it later. The new operating system can be down- loaded off the web. You can also search for online tutorials. WHEN YOU NOTICE PROBLEMS Lexi Pandell has written about technology, science and other topics for Wired , The New York Times, Vox , New York magazine and other publications.NEXT TIME, CONSIDER A DESKTOP This bit of advice is offered with the obvious caveat: You must be OK with always using your computer at the same location. Typically, desktops last longer than laptops because their components aren't so jammed together. \"Desktops have a lot of breathability in them, which really helps the life span, because there is so much space for the power supply and the hard drive,\" says Alexe Proctor, a former sales manager with Staples.

It's important to routinely update your computer's operating system. \"Every day, bad guys are working to exploit the operating system, finding holes in the environment and different ways to attack a computer,\" says Roberto Baires of Micro Tech Re- sources in the San Francisco Bay Area. Such viruses can sap your comput- er's strength. Most computers will let you set updates to download and in- stall automatically.2 Keep it cool. \"Overheating starts to physically affect the internal components and will shorten their life span,\" Matos says. Keep your desktop where it won't get regular direct sunlight. Don't use laptops on blankets or pillows, which trap heat. Matos recommends propping them on a computer stand, rather than just setting the unit on a table. \"That's going to ensure you have airflow going all around the system.\" 3 Turn it off. Optimally, computers should be shut down once a day, but \"the very minimum you should be shutting down or rebooting your computer is once a week,\" Baires says. \"Each computer has virtu- al memory and, as it's running, it keeps expanding. As it grows and grows, your computer slows down. You need to reset that virtual memory back to zero. It's like someone staying up all night and not getting any sleep.\" 4 Keep it clean. \"Crumbs, dust and coffee are the enemy,\" Matos says. Debris can stop up the physical components inside computers. Dust restricts the cool- ing fan's movement and airflow. Baires warns that pet hair also can damage computer systems. Set routine times to gently clean your system. \"We recommend com- pressed air for the keyboard and the power supply fan, which, in turn, will help with cooling,\" Proctor says.5 Take care when travel- ing. Keeping your computer physical- ly safe is also im- portant. \"A proper bag, like a laptop bag, will typically have the right cush- ioning,\" Matos says. \"If you just throw it in any old backpack or purse and you've got your keys or sharp metal objects in there, it's going to get dinged up. That'll lower the life cycle of a system.\" Another tip: Before storing a laptop for travel, you should turn it off or put it in sleep mode. BEFORE PROBLEMS ARISE REPAIR OR REPLACE? Parts for older computers can be more difficult to source and may be more expensive than parts for a newer machine, notes Roberto Baires of Micro Tech Resources, an IT support group. Much like a car, computers can be \"totaled\"\u2014which means the cost of repair is greater than the worth of the machine. \"If your computer is five years old and you want it to run as good as new or close to it, based on prices, you're probably bet- ter off getting a new computer,\" Baires advises. In the long run, buying now might be cheaper than repairing and having the computer last another year or two, then buying later, when prices are higher. WHEN THE END IS NEAR What are the indica- tors that your com- puter may be on its last legs? When is it time to let go? Here are several signs, according to Jason R. Rich, author of personal technology books for AARP, and Eddie Matos, director of technical support for Dell. 1. Booting up the computer takes longer than normal. According to Dell, a computer with a solid-state hard drive should boot up in less than 30 seconds, while a unit with a mechan- ical hard drive can take a few minutes. 2. It struggles with software updates. 3. No matter what you've tried, it runs slowly. 4. The hard drive seems to run con- stantly or makes unusual noise, even when the computer is inactive. 5. The computer's fan makes more noise than usual or runs constantly. 6. Unusual or per - sistent error mes- sages appear. 7. The computer or applications crash frequently.431 2 5CONTINUED FROM PAGE 26 Find free classes in computers and technology at seniorplanet.org 026_028_BUL-APR-2023 YL-HOW TO KEEP COMPUTER your its existing zing style selectionSafet y features available* One day completion of remodel will not be possible in s ome instances.

And before I could say anything, Chris asked someone to put up a list of the people who'd been injured in combat the night be - fore. Then he gave me a look, and I knew what it meant. I had a problem, but it paled in com- parison to what these young men and women were going through. That was exactly the right thing to tell me at the time. It helped put my minor problem in perspective. Tell me about guarding Saddam Hussein. Some of the guys who worked for me captured Saddam in 2003, and we had to hold on to him for about 30 days. He was pompous and arro - gant when we captured him, but as the days went on and he no longer had his palaces, his generals and his handmaidens, he just became a pathetic old man. I contrast him with Nelson Mandela, who spent almost 30 years incar - cerated, but because Mandela had this great strength of character he came out of prison as strong and maybe even stronger than when he went in. Bullies like Saddam always seem to collapse when you confront them, but men of integrity like Mandela can withstand the ter - rible inequities of life. Within about four or five days you could tell that Saddam was not a leader. When you take away all the trappings, that's when you find out the character of an individual. You led the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. What did that experience teach you? Leadership lessons from the people I worked with. One was Leon Panetta, the director of You gave a commencement address about making your bed every day that got 100 mil- lion views online. Why is that so important? When I was training to become a SEAL, we got inspected every morning. The instructor would invariably pull out a quarter and flip it into the air to see if you'd pulled the blan- ket and sheet taut enough to make the coin bounce. Finally, I got up the courage to ask a chief petty officer why, and he said, \"Well, it's pretty simple. If you can't even make your bed to exacting standards, how are we ever going to trust you to lead a complex SEAL mission? Learn to do the little things right and you'll learn to do the big things right. \" Do you still make your bed? Every single day. My wife and I have a big king-sized bed, and we used to make the bed together. But after I gave that speech, she said, \"Oh no, big boy, it's all yours now!\" In your new book, The Wisdom of the Bull- frog, you talk about an important lesson SEALs learn: Think first of others. I like to tell the story of Sgt. Maj. Chris Faris, my right-hand man in Afghanistan. One day, I did a Zoom call with my doctor, and she told me I'd been diagnosed with cancer. I needed to go back to the States immediately to have my spleen removed and start chemotherapy. \"Your military career is probably over, \" she added. When I got back to my office, Chris was there, and he noticed something wasn't right. After I told him, he said, \"OK, boss, we've got the morning briefing coming up, and you need to be there. The troops are counting on you. \" \"IT IS EQUALL Y AS DIFFICUL T TO FORGIVE AS IT IS TO BE COURAGEOUS.\"WILLIAM M cRAVEN, THE NAVY SEAL ADMIRAL WHO OVERSAW THE OSAMA BIN LADEN RAID, ON LEADERSHIP AND THE WISDOM OF DOING SMALL THINGS RIGHTQ&A William McRaven 030-031_BUL-APR-2023 YOUR 3:20 PMAARP .ORG/BULLETINthe CIA at the time. The CIA had done an abso - lutely incredible job finding bin Laden, and it could have taken all the credit for getting him. But Panetta knew that my organization was a better fit for the commando raid, so he put his ego aside and made us part of the team. And as one big team, we were all successful. The other person was President Obama. Watching him on this one was a master class in executive leader - ship. He was always willing to hear everyone's position. He welcomed challenging viewpoints. What was the mission's greatest challenge? With this raid, we never knew for certain that it was bin Laden. The president really had to gamble tremendously. The British Special Air Service has a motto: \"Who dares wins. \" Good leaders tend to do things that are safe and rea - sonable, and there's nothing wrong with that. But great leaders take risks. They're not afraid to fail if they think the risk is worth the gain. You had to ask forgiveness from a man whose son was accidentally killed in Afghanistan. The mission was all a horrible misunderstand - ing and as tragic as it gets. We had inadver - tently killed the man's son and maybe one of his daughters. I knew that I owed the family a sincere apology. Before I met with the father, I asked an Afghan general who worked for us how this man would respond if I asked for for - giveness. \"He will absolutely forgive you, \" the general said, \"because it will not only relieve your burden, it will relieve his burden as well. \" How did it unfold? There were about 200 Afghans packed into a long banquet hall, and I was one of only two Americans. The man looked heartbroken and another son was next to him, with hatred in his eyes. I stepped forward and said, \"I'm a soldier, but I also have children. I know how difficult this would be for me if this tragedy happened to my children. \" Then I asked the man for forgive - ness. As I watched him the hatred and tension began to lower. Finally, his son said to me, \"We accept your apology, and we will have no more hatred in our hearts for you. \" That had to be a heartbreaking moment. I don't know if I could have been as forgiving. I often say courage is the most important quali- ty. It guarantees all the rest. But it is equally as difficult to forgive as it is to be courageous. 31 \u2014Interview by Hugh Delehanty Subscribe to the free Veteran Report news - letter at aarp.org/veteranreport. 030-031_BUL-APR-2023 MICHAEL HOEWELER; PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY GREGORY REID AARP BULLETIN APRIL 2023 32Y our AARP Where We Stand A big takeaway from this year's State of the Union speech is the rare dis- play of bipartisan support for Social Security. In the days after the Feb. 7 address, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) joined President Joe Biden in making it clear that cuts to Social Security are off the table in the debt ceiling debate. That's good news for the 66 million Amer - icans who depend on this vital program each month. An overwhelming majority of Amer - icans\u2014Democrats, Republicans and inde - pendents alike\u2014agree Social Security should never be used as a budget bargaining chip. It is an earned benefit and sacred promise that must be kept. Although the program has been a great suc - cess, steps must be taken to ensure its solven- cy for the long term. This is a complex issue that cannot be re - solved by simply raising the retirement age or reducing benefits, as some have suggested. Strengthening Social Security requires an un-AARP will defend your indispensable benefit precedented degree of collaboration between our elected officials and the American peo - ple. There is an old saying: \"Nothing about us without us. \" After working their whole lives and paying into the program with each pay - check to earn their benefits, older Americans and their families deserve a say in any changes to Social Security. AARP is in the thick of this fight, and we have made our position clear. It is hard to overstate the importance and im- pact of Social Security. For most people over retirement age, Social Security is their largest source of income; for 14 percent of those peo - ple, it is nearly their entire income. The aver - age retired worker benefit is $1,779 a month, reflecting the 8.7 percent cost-of-living adjust - ment that took effect in January. As the nation remains mired in a period of high inflation, the need for Social Security is growing. Pric - es for basic necessities continue to rise. Many Americans have little or no savings. People are living longer, and employer-paid pensions are increasingly scarce. In addition, more seniors are single and lack family support. Given these realities, we must keep Social Security strong. Americans should be able to trust that our leaders will safeguard the hard- earned Social Security benefits they have paid into and earned throughout their lives. Young people should have the confidence that they will receive the benefits they're earning now through their hard work, just as their parents and grandparents have done. Social Security has never missed a pay - ment, and AARP will never stop fighting to protect and strengthen this indispensable earned benefit, so you, your family and fu- ture generations of Americans can continue to count on it as millions of Americans have for the past 88 years. BY JO ANN JENKINS, CEO Any process look - ing at Social Secu- rity options should be transparent and provide substan- tial opportunities for input from the public and outside organizations.Any proposals must reflect today's chang- ing workforce and the dynamic economic and demographic shifts that make it harder for workers to save enough for retirement. All legislation to adjust Social Se- curity should go through the regular order of congres- sional business and be done outside the context of debt reduction.We oppose any at- tempt by Congress to \"sunset\" Social Se- curity so it has to be reenacted every few years.

In some locales\u2014D.C. leads the way\u2014the work-from-home trend has led to emp- ty office buildings and deserted lunch spots. Nation- wide, the number of people primarily working from home tripled from 2019 to 2021, to 27.6 million.HOW WE WORKState News DELAWARE Protecting consumers Dela - ware ranked second in the nation per capita in cases of fraud and other reports in 2022, according to Federal Trade Commission data. AARP Delaware is working to change that, with an ongoing campaign to inform state resi- dents about common scams and to share tips on how to avoid them. AARP Delaware is also working with the state attorney general's consumer protection unit to alert people to new threats. That in- cludes the \"arrest scam, \" in which criminals call individuals and tell them a loved one is in jail and needs bail money. Visit AARP's Fraud Watch Network at aarp.org/money/ scams-fraud to learn about other scams related to gift cards, ro - mance, QR codes and puppies. Nationally, the most common scam reported to the FTC in 2022 was identity theft.

By simply dialing or texting \"988, \" you can reach a trained counselor at a local or nation- al crisis center. The counselor will assess the caller's immedi- ate needs and can connect the person with additional mental health services. The federal government launched the new phone number in July. AARP Maryland successfully advocated in Annapolis for fund - ing and resources to roll out the program in the state. The 988 line is an important advance so people struggling with mental health issues can call \"one easy-to-remember number to be rapidly connected to the help they need, \" says Michael B. Friedman, a licensed master social worker based in Baltimore who has consulted with AARP Mary -third Thursday of every month at 11:30 a.m., from May to Sep - tember.

NEW JERSEY Avoiding scams AARP New Jer - sey is hosting a Facebook Live event on Friday, May 5, at noon to discuss common scams being perpetrated across the state and to help people learn how to pro - tect themselves. AARP leaders will be speak - ing with Star-Ledger and NJ.com columnist Karin Price Mueller, who covers consumer affairs and fraud. She will talk about how to avoid becoming a victim of fraud. During the event, you can join live at facebook.com/AARPNJ. Viewers can use the comments section to ask questions. New Jerseyans filed more than 95,000 fraud and other complaints in 2022, with more than $231 million lost to fraud, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Stay apprised at aarp.com/nj.

Not quite. A provision in the Inflation Re- duction Act that passed last August says that beginning in 2023, adult vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are free for Medi- care beneficiaries with prescription drug coverage. This applies to enrollees who have a stand-alone Part D prescription drug plan or who have a Medicare Advantage plan that in- cludes drug coverage. But not every Medi- care beneficiary has such a plan. According to a 2022 report, 9 percent of Medicare participants are not enrolled in a Part D plan. That means 1 in 11 Medicare enrollees might need to pay for certain vaccines. Just a reminder: You may not think you need Part D when you first sign up for Medicare because you don't take many\u2014 or any\u2014prescription drugs. But as with most types of insurance, you get it be- cause someday you might need it. If you don't enroll in a Part D plan when you are first eligible for Medicare, you'll be subject to a late enrollment penalty if you decide to sign up for a plan later. Does Medicare pay for an ambulance? Medicare Part B covers the cost of an am- bulance in emergency situations if the trip meets several criteria: The ambulance is medically necessary. It's the only safe way to transport the patient. It is going to a location approved by Medicare, such as a hospital, skilled nurs- ing facility or back home after care. The transportation company meets Medicare standards. The destination is the nearest qualifying facility that can treat you. Note that original Medicare enrollees will be responsible for 20 percent of the Medi- care-approved ambulance charge. Supple- mental Medigap policies often will cover that. Medicare Advantage plans also cover ambulances; check with your plan to find out what your share of the cost will be.

Due to the volume of inquiries, we can't answer every question. BY CARE Thanks for the March Cover Story [\"Three Years In, How the Pandemic Has Changed Our Lives\"]. No doubt we'll continue to understand more as time goes on. One thing we learned: We can significantly cut poverty and help families directly with tax fairness. The expanded child tax credit actually cut child poverty nearly in half when passed as part of COVID relief. Sadly, it wasn't re - newed, but there is no reason not to ask our members of Congress to do just that. WILLIE DICKERSON SNOHOMISH, WASHINGTON I applaud your excellent reporting but was shocked that long COVID wasn't mentioned. Thousands of lives have been disrupted by the lack of good medical interventions. I've experienced full-body tremors, brain fog and chronic fatigue, among other symptoms. This illness forced me to leave my job after 26 years. Doctors, neurologists and a never-ending stream of various medications have had little impact. DAVID L. SERIFF BLACKSBURG, VIRGINIA PARENTING REDUX Thanks for putting the spotlight on a timely and important issue [\"Called to Parent\u2014Again, \" Your Life]. I'm a retired trauma treatment specialist and was raised by grandparents, so I'm well aware of the challenges these grandparents face. Grand - parents often put their own health at risk. When others care for the grandkids for a few hours or days, it gives the grandparents time to take care of themselves so they may continue to take care of their grandchildren. KATHY PERRY ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO Another resource for grandparents is a program called Parenting a Second Time Around (PASTA). Developed at Cornell Uni- versity, it has expanded to other states. DEB GRANTHAM ITHACA, NEW YORK MANAGING MAIL I just read the very good article \"Mail Thieves\" [Fraud Watch] and its suggestions for keeping checks safe from scammers who \"wash\" them. Another excellent way to pro - tect oneself is to utilize the USPS Informed Delivery option. It's available in most areas. USPS emails a picture of deliveries when- ever you have mail at your address. It's useful when you are waiting for a special letter, like a birthday card with a check, or if physically unable to make frequent mailbox trips. A.
