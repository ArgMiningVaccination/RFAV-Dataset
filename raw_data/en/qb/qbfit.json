What's the ayurvedic recommendation for asthma? I've already been taking [Amrit Kalash](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/amrit-kalash-super-antioxidant-and-queen-of-the-rasayanas), both [Nectar](https://www.mapi.com/products/amrit-nectar-paste-570-g) and [Ambrosia](https://www.mapi.com/products/amrit-kalash-ambrosia), for over three years now and overall I feel much better. Answer Asthma can be related to any of the three primary factors\u2014 [Vata](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/understanding-vata-dosha), [Pitta](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/understanding-pitta-dosha) or [Kapha](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/understanding-kapha-dosha)\u2014that govern all of the functions of the mind and body. When a Vata imbalance is dominant, the throat is aggravated. There is dryness, which shrinks the bronchial trees and leads to poor air circulation. When a Pitta imbalance is dominant, the bronchi are more reactive, which creates toxins (amavisha), clogs the bronchi and generates excessive thirst and interior body heat. Breathing can be difficult. When a Kapha imbalance is dominant, lubrication and moisture balance ( [Shleshaka Kapha](https://mapi.com/blogs/articles/understanding-the-5-subdoshas-of-kapha)) are disturbed and interact with impurities (ama) that clog the system and generate too much mucus. Allergic bronchitis is likely. Each of these three kinds of asthma requires different treatment. A bronchial dilator, from the ayurvedic perspective, treats only the superficial symptoms. Maharishi Ayurveda gets at the root cause of the condition to break out of the cycle of pathogenesis. Diet and lifestyle tips - It's especially important to avoid extreme fluctuations in temperature or the taste of foods. - Take a bit of fresh [ginger](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/ginger-an-ayurvedic-medicine-chest)before meals. - Cook with a moderate amount of [turmeric](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/5-benefits-of-turmeric-ayurveda-s-golden-botanical), [cumin](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/cumin)and [clove](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/clove). - Avoid heavy, cold foods; an excess of sweet-tasting foods; or any foods that have only one extreme taste. - Do a daily oil massage ( [abhyanga](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/5-surprising-benefits-of-abhyanga)) before showering, especially during the winter weather. - Take [Bio-Immune](https://www.mapi.com/products/bio-immune)herbal tablets. - If an allergic reaction is involved, then also take [Aller-Defense](https://www.mapi.com/products/aller-defense). - Regular bowel movements are important. [Herbal Cleanse](https://www.mapi.com/products/herbal-cleanse)capsules may help. Cold Question Recently, after years of not experiencing a head cold, I came down with an exceptionally drippy, sneezy case. I tried an over-the-counter remedy and the symptoms were immediately relieved. Is there a purifying aspect to allowing the cold to throw off this abundance of liquid? Is it harmful to repress the symptoms? D.T., Pennsylvania Answer In Ayurveda, it's commonly considered harmful to suppress symptoms. They are the body's attempt to deal with the imbalance. Drugs can suppress the immune system and the body's efforts to correct the underlying problem. Suppose the cold is due to excess dryness and a [Vata](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/understanding-vata-dosha) imbalance. Then, the mucus is how the body lubricates the system to eliminate the dryness. So the advice is to work with the body to restore balance. In general, the culprits behind colds are digestive impurities (ama) and cold temperatures. Both factors can throw the body's digestive fire [(agni) out of balance](https://mapi.com/blogs/articles/the-maharishi-ayurveda-approach-to-a-light-diet). The digestive fire helps regulate moisture in the body. An imbalance allows mucus to accumulate in the upper body (Shleshaka Kapha), which throws the body's drying mechanism (Vyana Vata) into overdrive. Diet and lifestyle tips - Take a bit of fresh [ginger](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/ginger-an-ayurvedic-medicine-chest)before meals. It helps stimulate agni and reduce ama. - Use [turmeric](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/5-benefits-of-turmeric-ayurveda-s-golden-botanical)in your cooking. It helps check the interaction between ama and lubrication (Shleshaka Kapha). - Follow an [ama-reducing diet](https://mapi.com/blogs/articles/the-ayurvedic-detox-diet). That means lighter, nutritious foods, such as soups. These foods are easy to digest and allow the body to direct more energy toward healing itself. Avoid heavier, fatty foods such as meats and dairy. - Take the [Sniffle Free](https://www.mapi.com/products/sniffle-free)herbal supplement. It helps balance the digestive fire along with lubrication (Shleshaka Kapha) and the drying mechanism (Vyana Vata). It also strengthens the body's natural resistance to cold. - To help you stay healthy, you can take [Sniffle Free](https://mapi.com/products/sniffle-free-set)for about six weeks at the start of the cold season. If you already have a cold, start taking it right away and continue for about six weeks after you've regained your health. Mucus Question It's rare for me to get a cold, but I always have excess mucus in my system. M.C., Hawaii Answer The excess mucus (Shleshaka Kapha) indicates a weakened immunity in the upper respiratory tract. It can be related to excess heat, especially if you live in a hot climate. If it's due to heat, then the body is trying to keep from drying out by generating excess mucus. This type of imbalance can lead to impurities (ama) blocking the circulation of nutrients. The result is weakened immunity. Diet and lifestyle tips - Try an ama-reducing diet. This means fewer leftovers and fewer heavy foods, such as meats and dairy products. - Increase light, well-cooked, nutritious foods. - Avoid cold drinks and foods. - Cook with [turmeric](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/5-benefits-of-turmeric-ayurveda-s-golden-botanical). - Avoid sudden changes in temperature, such as drinking ice-cold water when you've been in the hot sun. Also use cooling products such as drip Question What can I do for postnasal drip and sinus infections? Nothing seems to help. Answer Postnasal drip is a symptom of [Kapha](https://www.mapi.com/ayurvedic-knowledge/doshas/kapha.html) imbalance and slow digestion. Such infections usually develop through a series of reactions in the body: - Poorly-digested impurities. - The amainteracts with Shleshaka Kapha, which regulates lubrication and moisture balance in the body. - This interaction produces a sticky toxin called shleshmathat accumulates in the body cavities such as the sinuses. - The toxic shleshma aggravates Bhrajaka Pitta, which regulates enzymatic changes and the skin. - The aggravation of Bhrajaka Pitta leads to infection. Diet and lifestyle tips - Try an \"ama-free\" diet. That means lighter, easier-to-digest foods. Avoid leftovers and chemical additives. Favor fresh, pure foods. Stop intake of [caffeine](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/high-caffeine-energy-drinks-the-ayurvedic-perspective). - [Sniffle Free](https://www.mapi.com/products/sniffle-free)herbal tablets aid the digestive fire to reduce ama and nourish moisture balance (Shleshaka Kapha). - Take the herbal supplement [Aci-Balance](https://www.mapi.com/products/aci-balance). - Sip warm-to-hot herbal beverages best. - Gargle with salt and hot water. - Add a few drops of [Clear Breathe](https://www.mapi.com/products/clear-breathe)to hot water and inhale the vapors through the mouth and nose. - Add balanced spices to food. - Licorice tea is useful ( [Organic Vata Tea](https://www.mapi.com/products/organic-calming-vata-tea)contains licorice). - Avoid day sleep. - Increase fluid intake to six to eight glasses of water daily. - Avoid diuretics (under medical advice). - Try to avoid stressful, negative thoughts and emotions. General points With postnasal drip associated with allergen reactions or other respiratory issues, you can add the following herbs. - Allergen reactions. [Aller-Defense](https://www.mapi.com/products/aller-defense): One to two tablets after lunch and dinner. - General respiratory health. [Cold Weather Defense](https://www.mapi.com/products/cold-weather-defense): One to two tablets after lunch and dinner. - Nasal issues. [Sniffle Free](https://www.mapi.com/products/sniffle-free): One to two tablets after lunch and dinner. - Breathing problems. [Clear Breathe](https://www.mapi.com/products/clear-breathe)and [Sniffle Free Aroma](https://www.mapi.com/products/sniffle-free-aroma-oil). From an Ayurvedic view, the root of this imbalance is poor digestion and ama. It winds up aggravating [Pitta](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/understanding-pitta-dosha). See below for a more in-depth answer. Kapha postnasal drip The main functions of [Kapha](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/understanding-kapha-dosha) in the body are fluid balance, structure growth and strength. All bodily fluids (tissue fluids), mucus and serous secretions, transcellular fluids (like synovial fluids and pericardial fluids), all the moisture in the cells, the nervous system and respiratory system can be considered as Kapha. An imbalance in Kapha leads to an imbalance in bodily fluids. Kapha in a balanced state is strength to the body. In an imbalanced state it is impurity to the body. The main areas of Kapha in the body are the head, chest and joints. Kapha imbalance will increase Kapha in these areas. Depending on body type and individual exposure to certain imbalances, one of these three main areas receives the Kapha imbalance. Those with Kapha imbalance are prone to certain disorders like cough (kaasa), cold, congestion (peenasam), running nose or rhinitis, allergic rhinitis, hay fever, sinusitis (pratisayam), or asthma (swasa). In all of these conditions, there is excess fluid secretion from the nose. Postnasal drip is one of the main symptoms in these disorders. Although mucus normally is swallowed unconsciously, the feeling that it is accumulating in the throat or dripping from the back of your nose is called postnasal drip. General causes of postnasal drip are: - Low humidity - Sinus or nasal infections - Foreign bodies (especially if the drainage is from one side) - Environmental irritants such as tobacco smoke or smog - Structural problems such as a deviated septum, enlarged turbinates or enlarged adenoids - Advanced age \u2014 the mucus membrane lining the nose can shrink with age, leading to a reduced volume of thicker secretions - Hormonal problems - Drug side effects (e.g. antihistamines) There are three types of postnasal drip \u2014 one for each main ayurvedic body include: - Nasal obstruction - Small quantity of liquid, thin and cold in nature, present behind the throat - Dryness in throat and lips - Sneezing with difficulty - Loss of taste - Pain and hoarseness of voice Maharishi Ayurveda recommendations include: - [PN1 Nasya](https://www.mapi.com/collections/ma-herbs): Two to three times a day lubricates the air passages.

As a result, I suffer from chronic colds, fatigue, headaches and stomach aches. I've tried a number of \"alternative\" approaches, but nothing works. M.D., Illinois Answer Yeast infections are basically due to weak immunity. Here's what happens: - Too many sweets and heavy carbohydrates decrease the digestive fire. - Weak digestion allows impurities (ama) to accumulate. - The digestive impurities aggravate lubrication (Shleshaka Kapha) in a toxic (Bhrajaka Pitta) and circulation (Vyana Vata) are disturbed. This weakens the immune system. - Weak immunity allows the yeast infection to take hold. - [Kapha](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/understanding-kapha-dosha)-type symptoms begin to appear: fatigue; dullness; colds. If immunity is strong, infections aren't a problem. This traditional analogy makes it clear. The body is like a farm. A virus is like a seed. The seed won't grow unless the farm land is fertile and feeds it. Antibiotic drugs are designed to attack the seed. They kill the virus along with healthy bacteria. The drug becomes ineffective when a resistant strain of the virus develops. The Ayurvedic approach is to strengthen your immunity. Digestive impurities (ama) serve as food or fertilizer for the yeast virus. Reduce the ama and the virus will starve. With ayurveda the virus is secondary and your immunity or personal balance is primary. In India, candida infections are rare. The spicy diet helps keep the digestive fire high and ama low. Diet and lifestyle tips - Drink [Organic Kapha Tea](https://www.mapi.com/products/organic-stimulating-kapha-tea). - Avoid heavy, sweet, cold foods. - Increase warm, light, nutritious foods. - Increase [turmeric](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/5-benefits-of-turmeric-ayurveda-s-golden-botanical), [pepper](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/black-pepper)and [ginger](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/dried-ground-ginger). - Take the formula [Elim-Tox](https://www.mapi.com/products/elim-tox)to purify the system and reduce ama. Avoid the flu Question Every holiday season, I tend to fall victim to bugs going around. What can I do to prevent this? S.N., Massachusetts Answer Holiday time also means the dreaded [\"flu season\"](https://mapi.com/blogs/articles/dont-let-influenza-spoil-your-winter) in many parts of the USA, especially areas with colder climates. Something about this time of year appears to make people more susceptible to bugs, though some do manage to stay healthy regardless. According to Ayurveda, sickness primarily results from an imbalance in your physiology that may be compromising your natural immunity. People who stay healthy have a strong immune system and a strong digestion/metabolism. A Shleshaka Kapha imbalance results in a buildup of moisture and phlegm in the lungs. When internal toxins (ama) also builds up in the channels of the respiratory system because of a weak digestion and combines with the aggravated Shleshaka Kapha, the result is shleshma, a type of toxic substance that makes your lungs and respiratory system vulnerable to bugs and infections. Dietary and lifestyle tips - Protect yourself from extreme temperatures, both too hot and too cold. - Avoid iced beverages, because they weaken the digestion. - Eat pure, fresh foods to provide maximum nutrition to the body. Preservative-laced foods and leftovers tax the digestion and are devoid of prana, or life-energy. - Take [Cold Weather Defense](https://www.mapi.com/products/cold-weather-defense)as a preventive measure and to bolster your natural immunity. Starting 45 days before the onset of the season is best. - [Protection Plus Respiratory System](https://www.mapi.com/products/protection-plus-respiratory-system)also provides excellent overall support for the lungs and the respiratory system. Canker sores Question How can I decrease the outbreak of canker sores in my mouth and on my lips? I've tried everything. J.P., California Answer Canker sores are related, from an ayurvedic perspective, to excess [Pitta](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/understanding-pitta-dosha) in the body. Specifically, they result when digestive impurities (ama) interact with Bhodaka Kapha, the subdosha which governs the tongue and sense of taste. We don't offer an herbal formula specifically for canker sores. The approach would be to take measures to decrease the Pitta and ama. Some people with canker sores find they are sensitive to citrus fruits or sour pineapple, which aggravate Pitta. Here are a few tips, but you may want to see an ayurvedic physician for a more individualized program. Diet and lifestyle tips - Detoxify the body. Take [Elim-Tox-O](https://www.mapi.com/products/elim-tox-o)for 45 days. This formula gently cleanses ama from the body without increasing Pitta. - Reduce Pitta-aggravating foods, such as sour-tasting foods, pungent spices and nuts. - Eat lots of sweet juicy fruits\u2014they are both cooling and cleansing. - Soak a handful of [raisins](https://www.mapi.com/blogs/articles/ayurveda-view-on-raisins)in water overnight. Drain and eat them the next morning. - Use [Organic Pitta Churna](https://www.mapi.com/products/organic-pitta-churna-cooling-spice-mix)to season your foods during cooking, and Explore our [Immunity herbal AyurVeda Products International, Inc.
