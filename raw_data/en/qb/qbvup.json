A typical day begins by reviewing your plan and to-do list for the day, checking email and voice mail before heading out for the day,and ensuring you have everything in the car that you will need for the day. The morning is spent calling on physicians, promoting your assigned products, reporting calls and accounting for samples. At noon you check email and voice mail. You spend the afternoon calling on physicians, promoting your assigned products, reporting calls and accounting for samples. At the end of the day you ensure all call and sample activity has been reported for the day, plan the day for tomorrow, prioritize your to-do list for tomorrow, check email and voice mail, and pack your car with the materials you will need for tomorrow. In addition, some days you might have a breakfast meeting, or a lunch meeting, or an evening speaker event to be prepared for. I made it a habit to read about the industry, managed care, a product, a competitive product, or a disease state for 1 hour each night Sunday - Thursday to keep my knowledge strong.

Consrankings and bonuses became primarily based on activity perameters, rather than on productivity perameters (sales). Production roles: good pay / bad shifts - GSK Ware The money is excellent considering that you only need numeracy and literacy to get in the door. Most production jobs start as temp roles, and if you happen to join when they have built a new production line you can get a full-time job quite quickly. Or you can stay as a temp and still get a bloody good wage (typically \u00a311 - \u00a315 per hour plus shift allowance, so say \u00a317 per hour averaged over the shift pattern) I worked there for 17 years, 7 of them as a temp. I think I enjoyed my years as a temp more than the last 10 years, but that might be because I was getting old. However, working shifts for 17 years has really affected my health. My advice for anyone looking to join GSK in the production or warehouse area: volunteer for every additional role you can (e.g. safety assessor, COSHH assessor, work-place trainer) - this shows good attitude, and gives you an excuse to get off line to go to meetings. And then apply for the next shift coordinator job that comes along. Get to production coordinator and you will never have to work a shift that you don't like ever again. I didn't do this, which is why I'm no longer working for GSK. If you can follow straightforward procedures (very very important - you're working with medicine), keep a straight face while listening to pure-grade corporate bollocks on a regular basis, and you can turn up to work on time, the work is very easy and the money is very good. As with any big corporation, there is an over-abundance of middle Trabalhei na GlaxoSmithKline no 5.0 Industrial Placement Student | Stevenage | 11 Feb 2014 Working for GSK as a placement student GSK is an integral part of our society as they provide many key consumer healthcare products and medicines. Having completed an industrial placement with Biopharm R&D my interest in the company grew. I was struck by how dedicated GSK scientists are in developing the next generation of drugs. I am passionate about drug discovery and believe the science carried out at GSK is world leading. I learnt many important laboratory skills and techniques whilst on placement and I also made significant personal gains including a real improvement in my ability to communicate with people, team working skills and confidence. On a daily basis my work involved culturing cells and preparing them for experimentation, including cell lines and primary cells. I would run immunological assays, carry out confocal microscopy and flow cytometry to gather relevant data. Knowing how to use these techniques meant I was able to generate high quality results and decide on the next experimental steps to take. At GSK I was particularly well managed, and was always able to get in contact with my supervisor should I need any assistance. I met with my supervisor and group on a weekly basis to present my findings and discuss what the next steps should be. Teamwork is an essential tool in any discovery project. The ability to listen to, exchange and debate ideas with a group of scientists is a valuable skill and allows a collective thought process to emerge. Being part of a team enabled me to consolidate these s Incompetence is rife! I have been employed by gsk for some 14 years as a lowly scum of the earth production technician in sterile manufacturing. During this time I have endured bullying, discrimination, intimidation and something akin to torture! (Was left on a line for months that caused severe agony to a known pre-existing spinal injury and when I asked for transfer was called a liar and ignored). During my employment my work load tripled beyond my contracted role yet my job description was never updated to reflect this and my salary was NEVER increased to compliment the additional skill set or work load. A history of depression was treated as an inconvenience and disregarded thus causing me to spiral further downhill rather than heal until eventually I became unable to function in a normal life. Payroll made consecutive errors for five straight years claiming that my contract was wrong yet to this day that contract still hasn't been updated. gsk however claim I now owe them thousands of pounds which I have no chance of ever settling. Middle management with no clue of business management or production methods bully teams into achieving the impossible and then penalise hardworking, dedicated teams for not meeting targets while those same managers enjoy all of the trappings of success. Morale is catastrophic across the site but by their own admission the managers don't know how to resolve the issue so they instead choose to ignore it. My mental healt La mia \u00e8 molto importante di le sotto agenzia inter Culture: It's a large organisation with very limited development opportunities, promotions and pay rise. Company claims to want people to be at their best and come to work with the smile yet forces 85% into the no reward box and importantly 5% into underperformance with financial repercussions - the claim pertains to keep efficiency up but really it is about restricting expenses on people performance. This inevitably leads to injustice, employee discouragement and competitiveness. GSK do have a fantastic matrix teamwork culture with organised research units and numerous technology platforms to deliver science, but a fake team spirit is felt which is presumably induced by a hidden culture of fear and competitiveness at least in part. GSK is not an average company it's a leading organisation employing highly skilled staff - everyone should be individually recognised and rewarded to the level of their commitment and successes but it's clearly not the case and often great performance is ignored. Management: It's common place that overall, management at GSK don't really invest in their people by actively committing to develop & champion them. Laziness? Complacency? Lots employees may need to look out for themselves using available intranet tools, mentors etc. \"Employees leave their manager not the company\" is also true at GSK.

To increase trust internally GSK would need to inspire its people through a real ProsAmazing matrix teams and tech hubs, lectures, flex work, passionate staffs ConsBad management, bad reward system Questions And Answers about GlaxoSmithKline What questions did they ask during your interview at GSK?
