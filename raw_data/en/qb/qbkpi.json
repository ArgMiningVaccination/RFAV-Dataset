These symptoms are not only emotionally devastating to patients and their families, but increasingly interfere with functionality and the ability to live independently; as the disease progresses, patients will require significant help with even the most simple daily activities, stripping away agency and placing a heavy burden on caretakers. Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease and death rates are quickly climbing, increasing by 50% over the past two decades. While existing treatments targeted at cognitive and behavioral symptoms may temporarily slow down disease progression, they ultimately fail to reverse the effects of the condition. As such, there is growing interest in methods of treating and preventing Alzheimer's beyond the limits of traditional medicine. By fine-tuning the power of nutrition, researchers are now uncovering new therapies that may help prevent Alzheimer's, improve symptoms, and potentially stall progression more effectively than conventional interventions alone. At Alternative Medicine Review, we are committed to opening up discussions about these emerging treatment modalities in order to foster greater awareness about the possibilities of healing. "}
