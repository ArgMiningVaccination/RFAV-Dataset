Homeopathy is a very safe form of medicine which treats THE WHOLE INDIVIDUAL. It is equally concerned with maintaining good health and aiding recovery from ill-health. Since its development 200 years ago by Samuel Hahnemann, it has benefited millions of people all over the world. The word \"Homeopathy\" (also spelt \"homoeopathy\") comes from the Greek: Homoeo = like Pathos = suffering A homeopathic remedy is one which produces the same symptoms as those the sick person does and when prescribed provokes the body into throwing them off. Homeopathy is a NATUROPATHIC form of medicine - it assists nature using the body's own healing potential - rather than overriding it. Everyone is different and the way we experience illnesses are different. A homoeopath looks at the way YOU experience YOUR symptoms Homeopathy is practiced around the world, with an estimated 500 million individuals receiving homeopathic treatment. "}
