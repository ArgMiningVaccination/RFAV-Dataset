You will be dry brushed, covered in a hydrating, detoxifying seaweed masque, and wrapped for optimum benefit. While you are wrapped, you will receive neck and scalp massage. After the masque is removed, your whole body will be massaged with an emollient lotion, with the intention of stimulating your lymphatic system. Chakra balancing hot oil wrap and scalp treatment (90 min / $155) Inspired by Ayurvedic techniques, the intent of this wrap is to be restorative, balancing, and soothing, while also being deeply moisturizing for the skin of your body and scalp. Olive oil is very easily absorbed, and does not clog pores. After dry brushing the entire body, a specific blend of essential oils for grounding and relaxing, mixed with warm olive oil is worked into pressure points from your feet to shoulders. While you are wrapped in that, soaking it in, you will receive a hot oil scalp massage. Essential oils are blended with the olive oil for your scalp to clarify, heal, and open pores. You leave feeling relaxed, grounded and hydrated, but also refreshed and invigorated. Mind Body Therapy (90 min/ $140) Energy Work comes in many forms. If you have been feeling depleted, overwhelmed, deal with chronic pain or mental health/trauma issues, you would likely benefit from the gentle and intuitive healing of a Mind Body Therapy session. Your therapist will draw from a range of energy work modalities, including Reiki, Polarity, Chakral Balancing, Crystal Therapy, aromatherapy and light touch facilitation. Expect a thorough in person intake to gauge your specific energy state at the time of your treatment, and to be able to speak your desired outcome of your session. This will be a chance to leave the thoughts that consume most of your waking hours and to reconnect with your body soul center, and your whole self, integrating body and mind. Dumping out stagnant and old energy and moving into creating space for new refreshing and invigorating thoughts and feelings. CranioSacral Therapy (90 min/ $140) CranioSacral Therapy (CST) is a gentle, hands-on approach that releases tensions deep in the body to relieve pain and dysfunction and improve whole-body health and performance. It was pioneered and developed by Osteopathic Physician John E. Upledger after years of clinical testing and research at Michigan State University, where he served as a professor of biomechanics. Your therapist will use a light tough to affect superficial and deep restrictions, using the guidance of the cerebrospinal fluid rhythm, and following your body into its restrictions to facilitate release, rather than forcing change. It can be powerful preventive medicine as well. This has been shown to be highly effective in changing the Central Nervous System response to existing pain and disease, and helping the body to facilitate it's own healing. Expect a calming, relaxing and gentle session, and potential dramatic results. Our therapists at Breathe that perform CST are qualified to treat basic issues and overall health and wellness, but we have resources and will refer if more serious issues would benefit from a CST expert. ***Please note we need 24 hours "}
