Course Provider : Western Sydney University Campuses :NSW A remedial massage therapist uses various massage techniques to diagnose and treat biomechanical problems in the body. They use their thumbs, knuckles, and elbows to apply pressure to the muscles and connective tissues, which can provide enormous relief to the patient, and help to resolve issues. From day to day, a remedial massage therapist can find themselves completing the following activities: As a remedial massage therapist, you'll have a number of workplaces to choose from. These are some of the most common. Health and wellness clinics can be found in every city in Australia. They're a popular place for people to relax and unwind, and cure any ongoing health issues that they may have. You'll use a number of massage techniques to help achieve this, and to provide a soothing experience. These clinics also tend to hire other natural therapy practitioners, such as homeopaths, nutritionists, chiropractors, and osteopaths, who you'll have the opportunity to work alongside. Clinical settings like hospitals and aged care facilities hire remedial massage therapists, as a way to help people get through palliative care, and provide relief from chronic illnesses. If you'd like to go it alone, you can start your own business. You'll need to learn and run every component of the company, including marketing, financials, and obviously the massage work itself. Business owners often have to work hard early on while they build their company, but the rewards can be great. In Australia, remedial massage therapists usually complete a Diploma of Remedial Massage through an RTO (registered training organisation).
