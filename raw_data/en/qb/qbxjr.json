Health and wellness retreats have been gaining popularity, offering programs focusing on wellness categories from fitness and nutrition to meditation, yoga, and mental well-being. Wellness retreats often focus on physical activity, eating nutrient-dense foods, and learning about different aspects of health. Some also emphasize specialized activities like yoga, meditation, hiking, or detoxing from electronic devices. Scientific reviews show that participants in wellness retreats improved several health metrics, including abdominal girth, weight, blood pressure, and lipids. Other studies show that retreats, particularly those held in scenic natural settings, can improve psychological fitness, at least in the short term.
