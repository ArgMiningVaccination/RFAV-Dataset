Vaccines cannot protect you from many diseases in Namibia, so your behaviors are important. Food and water standards around the world vary based on the destination. Standards may also differ within a country and risk may change depending on activity type (e.g., hiking versus business trip). You can learn more about safe food and drink choices when traveling by accessing the resources below. [Choose Safe Food and Drinks When Traveling](/travel/page/food-water-safety) [Water Treatment Options When Hiking, Camping or Traveling](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/travel/index.html) [Global Water, Sanitation and Hygiene | Healthy Water](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/global/traveler_health.html) [Avoid Contaminated Water During Travel](/travel/page/water-disinfection) You can also visit the [Department of State Country Information Pages](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages.html) for additional information about food and water safety. [Hide](javascript:void(0);) Bugs (like mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas) can spread a number of diseases in Namibia. Many of these diseases cannot be prevented with a vaccine or medicine. You can reduce your risk by taking steps to prevent bug bites. What can I do to prevent bug bites? - Cover exposed skin by wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and hats. - Use an appropriate insect repellent (see below). - Use permethrin-treated clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks, and tents). Do not use permethrin directly on skin. - Stay and sleep in air-conditioned or screened rooms. - Use a bed net if the area where you are sleeping is exposed to the outdoors. What type of insect repellent should I use? - FOR PROTECTION AGAINST TICKS AND MOSQUITOES: Use a repellent that contains 20% or more DEET for protection that lasts up to several hours. - FOR PROTECTION AGAINST MOSQUITOES ONLY: Products with one of the following active ingredients can also help prevent mosquito bites. Higher percentages of active ingredient provide longer protection. [DEET](http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/chemicals/deet.htm) - Picaridin (also known as KBR 3023, Bayrepel, and icaridin) - Oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or para-menthane-diol (PMD) - IR3535 - 2-undecanone - - Always use insect repellent as directed. What should I do if I am bitten by bugs? - Avoid scratching bug bites, and apply hydrocortisone cream or calamine lotion to reduce the itching. - Check your entire body for ticks after outdoor activity. Be sure to [remove ticks](http://www.cdc.gov/ticks/removing_a_tick.html)properly. What can I do to avoid bed bugs? Although bed bugs do not carry disease, they are an annoyance. See our [information page about avoiding bug bites](/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites) for some easy tips to avoid them. For more information on bed bugs, see [Bed Bugs](http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/bedbugs/). For more detailed information on avoiding bug bites, see [Avoid Bug Bites](/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites). [Hide](javascript:void(0);) If your travel plans in Namibia include outdoor activities, take these steps to stay safe and healthy during your trip. - Stay alert to changing weather conditions and adjust your plans if conditions become unsafe. - Prepare for activities by wearing the right clothes and packing protective items, such as bug spray, sunscreen, and a basic first aid kit. - Consider learning basic first aid and CPR before travel. Bring a [travel health kit](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/pack-smart.htm)with items appropriate for your activities. - Heat-related illness, such as heat stroke, can be deadly. Eat and drink regularly, wear loose and lightweight clothing, and limit physical activity during high temperatures. - If you are outside for many hours in heat, eat salty snacks and drink water to stay hydrated and replace salt lost through sweating. [Protect yourself from UV radiation](http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/basic_info/prevention.htm): use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15, wear protective clothing, and seek shade during the hottest time of day (10 a.m.-4 p.m.). - Be especially careful during summer months and at high elevation. Because sunlight reflects off snow, sand, and water, sun exposure may be increased during activities like skiing, swimming, and sailing. - Very cold temperatures can be dangerous. Dress in layers and cover heads, hands, and feet properly if you are visiting a cold location. Stay safe around water - Swim only in designated swimming areas. Obey lifeguards and warning flags on beaches. - Practice safe boating\u2014follow all boating safety laws, do not drink alcohol if driving a boat, and always wear a life jacket. - Do not dive into shallow water. - Do not swim in freshwater in developing areas or where sanitation is poor. - Avoid swallowing water when swimming. Untreated water can carry germs that make you sick. - To prevent infections, wear shoes on beaches where there may be animal waste. Schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection that can be spread in fresh water, is found in Namibia. Avoid swimming in fresh, unchlorinated water, such as lakes, ponds, or rivers. [Hide](javascript:void(0);) Most animals avoid people, but they may attack if they feel threatened, are protecting their young or territory, or if they are injured or ill. Animal bites and scratches can lead to serious diseases such as rabies. Follow these tips to protect yourself: - Do not touch or feed any animals you do not know. - Do not allow animals to lick open wounds, and do not get animal saliva in your eyes or mouth. - Avoid rodents and their urine and feces. - Traveling pets should be supervised closely and not allowed to come in contact with local animals. - If you wake in a room with a bat, seek medical care immediately. Bat bites may be hard to see. All animals can pose a threat, but be extra careful around dogs, bats, monkeys, sea animals such as jellyfish, and snakes. If you are bitten or scratched by an animal, immediately: - Wash the wound with soap and clean water. - Go to a doctor right away. - Tell your doctor about your injury when you get back to the United States. Consider buying medical evacuation insurance. Rabies is a deadly disease that must be treated quickly, and treatment may not be available in some countries. [Hide](javascript:void(0);) Follow these tips to avoid getting sick or spreading illness to others while traveling: - Wash your hands often, especially before eating. - If soap and water aren't available, clean hands with hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol). - Don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you need to touch your face, make sure your hands are clean. - Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing. - Try to avoid contact with people who are sick. - If you are sick, stay home or in your hotel room, unless you need medical care. [Hide](javascript:void(0);) Diseases can be spread through body fluids, such as saliva, blood, vomit, and semen. Protect yourself: - Use latex condoms correctly. - Do not inject drugs. - Limit alcohol consumption. People take more risks when intoxicated. - Do not share needles or any devices that can break the skin. That includes needles for tattoos, piercings, and acupuncture. - If you receive medical or dental care, make sure the equipment is disinfected or sanitized. [Hide](javascript:void(0);) Plan for how you will get health care during your trip, should the need arise: - Carry a list of [local doctors and hospitals](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health.html)at your destination. - Review your health insurance plan to determine what medical services it would cover during your trip. Consider purchasing travel health and medical evacuation insurance. - Carry a card that identifies, in the local language, your blood type, chronic conditions or serious allergies, and the generic names of any medications you take. - Some prescription drugs may be illegal in other countries. Call [Namibia's embassy](https://www.usembassy.gov/)to verify that all of your prescription(s) are legal to bring with you. - Bring all the medicines (including over-the-counter medicines) you think you might need during your trip, including extra in case of travel delays. Ask your doctor to help you get prescriptions filled early if you need to. Many foreign hospitals and clinics are accredited by the Joint Commission International. A list of accredited facilities is available at their website ( [www.jointcommissioninternational.org](http://www.jointcommissioninternational.org)). In some countries, medicine (prescription and over-the-counter) may be substandard or counterfeit. Bring the medicines you will need from the United States to avoid having to buy them at your destination. Malaria is a risk in some parts of Namibia. If you are going to a risk area, fill your malaria prescription before you leave, and take enough with you for the entire length of your trip. Follow your doctor's instructions for taking the pills; some need to be started before you leave. [Hide](javascript:void(0);) Motor vehicle crashes are the #1 killer of healthy US citizens in foreign countries. In many places cars, buses, large trucks, rickshaws, bikes, people on foot, and even animals share the same lanes of traffic, increasing the risk for crashes. Walking Be smart when you are traveling on foot. - Use sidewalks and marked crosswalks. - Pay attention to the traffic around you, especially in crowded areas. - Remember, people on foot do not always have the right of way in other countries. Riding/Driving Choose a safe vehicle. - Choose official taxis or public transportation, such as trains and buses. - Ride only in cars that have seatbelts. - Avoid overcrowded, overloaded, top-heavy buses and minivans. - Avoid riding on motorcycles or motorbikes, especially motorbike taxis. (Many crashes are caused by inexperienced motorbike drivers.) - Choose newer vehicles\u2014they may have more safety features, such as airbags, and be more reliable. - Choose larger vehicles, which may provide more protection in crashes. Think about the driver. - Do not drive after drinking alcohol or ride with someone who has been drinking. - Consider hiring a licensed, trained driver familiar with the area. - Arrange payment before departing. Follow basic safety tips. - Wear a seatbelt at all times. - Sit in the back seat of cars and taxis. - When on motorbikes or bicycles, always wear a helmet. (Bring a helmet from home, if needed.) - Avoid driving at night; street lighting in certain parts of Namibia may be poor. - Do not use a cell phone or text while driving (illegal in many countries). - Travel during daylight hours only, especially in rural areas. - If you choose to drive a vehicle in Namibia, learn the local traffic laws and have the proper paperwork. - Get any driving permits and insurance you may need. Get an International Driving Permit (IDP). Carry the IDP and a US-issued driver's license at all times. - Check with your auto insurance policy's international coverage, and get more coverage if needed. Make sure you have liability insurance. Flying - Avoid using local, unscheduled aircraft. - If possible, fly on larger planes (more than 30 seats); larger airplanes are more likely to have regular safety inspections. - Try to schedule flights during daylight hours and in good weather. Medical Evacuation Insurance If you are seriously injured, emergency care may not be available or may not meet US standards. Trauma care centers are uncommon outside urban areas. Having [medical evacuation insurance](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html#insurance) can be helpful for these reasons. Helpful Resources [Road Safety Overseas](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/safety/road.html) (Information from the US Department of State): Includes tips on driving in other countries, International Driving Permits, auto insurance, and other resources. The [Association for International Road Travel](http://www.asirt.org) has country-specific [Road Travel Reports](http://www.asirt.org/KnowBeforeYouGo/CountryRoadTravelReports/tabid/171/Default.aspx) available for most countries for a minimal fee. Traffic flows on the left side of the road in Namibia. - Always pay close attention to the flow of traffic, especially when crossing the street. - LOOK RIGHT for approaching traffic. [Hide](javascript:void(0);) Use the same common sense traveling overseas that you would at home, and always stay alert and aware of your surroundings. Before you leave - Research your destination(s), including local laws, customs, and culture. - Monitor [travel advisories and alerts](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html)and read travel [tips](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/checklist.html)from the US Department of State. - Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/step.html). - Leave a copy of your itinerary, contact information, credit cards, and passport with someone at home. - Pack as light as possible, and leave at home any item you could not replace. While at your destination(s) - Carry contact information for the nearest [US embassy or consulate](http://www.usembassy.gov/). - Carry a photocopy of your passport and entry stamp; leave the actual passport securely in your hotel. - Follow all local laws and social customs. - Do not wear expensive clothing or jewelry. - Always keep hotel doors locked, and store valuables in secure areas. - If possible, choose hotel rooms between the 2nd and 6th floors. [Hide](javascript:void(0);) [Hide](javascript:void(0);) Healthy Travel Packing List Use the [Healthy Travel Packing List for Namibia](/travel/destinations/namibia/traveler/packing-list) for a list of health-related items to consider packing for your trip. Talk to your doctor about which items are most important for you. Why does CDC recommend packing these health-related items? It's best to be prepared to prevent and treat common illnesses and injuries. Some supplies and medicines may be difficult to find at your destination, may have different names, or may have different ingredients than what you normally use. [Hide](javascript:void(0);) After Your Trip If you are not feeling well after your trip, you may need to see a doctor. If you need help finding a travel medicine specialist, see [Find a Clinic](/travel/page/find-clinic). Be sure to tell your doctor about your travel, including where you went and what you did on your trip. Also tell your doctor if you were bitten or scratched by an animal while traveling. If your doctor prescribed antimalarial medicine for your trip, keep taking the rest of your pills after you return home. If you stop taking your medicine too soon, you could still get sick. Malaria is always a serious disease and may be a deadly illness. If you become ill with a fever either while traveling in a malaria-risk area or after you return home (for up to 1 year), you should seek immediate medical attention and should tell the doctor about your travel history. For more information on what to do if you are sick after your trip, see [Getting Sick after Travel](/travel/page/getting-sick-after-travel).
