Qigong [pronounced chee-gung], which literally means \"working with the energy of life\", is an integrated mind-body healing method that has been practiced with remarkable results in China for thousands of years. The Chinese have long treasured qigong for its effectiveness both in healing and preventing disease. More recently, they have used it in conjunction with modern medicine to cure cancer, immune-system disorders, and other life-threatening conditions. Now, renowned qigong master and China scholar Kenneth S. Cohen brings the ancient healing power of qigong to Western listeners. The Way of Qigong is filled with solid, practical exercises and guidance, providing an easy-to-follow program for working with our life energy through breathing and relaxation, meditation, visualization, and other natural methods.

It's informative, and the opening meditations are about as simple as it can get. Even guided, that's not to say they're simple - everyone has their own blocks to work past when it comes to learning how to meditate - but this is definitely a \"no fear\" approach for those who are curious to begin and aren't sure how to do so. 10 people found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Anonymous User](/listener/amzn1.account.AH6SXJ6SXZXKTYED3TJ6YBEEORAQ?ref=a_pd_The-Wa_c15_rvlsnl_3&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=FD0G5SVWYDSVNE2WFV5J&pageLoadId=NMiQIzdDRxt9IPaW&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 01-07-18 understanding chi this is an amazing book for those who want to gain an understanding of chi and learn more about chi gong. 8 people found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [](/listener/amzn1.account.AGV5AF3CNWGEBUORPLBDI4QQKXCQ?ref=a_pd_The-Wa_c15_rvlsnl_4&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=FD0G5SVWYDSVNE2WFV5J&pageLoadId=NMiQIzdDRxt9IPaW&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 09-10-16 Simply amazing!
