The insurer or insurance group has discretion regarding the appropriate format for providing the information required by these regulations and may customize the corporate governance annual disclosure to provide the most relevant information necessary to permit the commissioner to gain an understanding of the corporate governance structure, policies, and practices utilized by the insurer or insurance group. 4. For purposes of completing the corporate governance annual disclosure, the insurer or insurance group may choose to provide information on governance activities that occur at the ultimate controlling parent level, an intermediate holding company level or the individual legal entity level, or both, depending upon how the insurer or insurance group has structured its system of corporate governance. The insurer or insurance group is encouraged to make the corporate governance annual disclosures at the level at which the insurer's or insurance group's risk appetite is determined, or at which the earnings, capital, liquidity, operations, and reputation of the insurer are overseen collectively and at which the supervision of those factors are coordinated and exercised, or the level at which legal liability for failure of general corporate governance duties would be placed. If the insurer or insurance group determines the level of reporting based on these criteria, it shall indicate which of the three criteria was used to determine the level of reporting and explain any subsequent changes in the level of reporting. 5. Notwithstanding subsection 1, and as outlined in North Dakota Century Code section 26.1-10.3-02, if the corporate governance annual disclosure is completed at the insurance group level, it must be filed with the lead state of the group as determined by the procedures outlined in the most recent Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners. In these instances, a copy of the corporate governance annual disclosure also must be provided to the chief regulatory official of any state in which the insurance group has a domestic insurer, upon request. 6. An insurer or insurance group may comply with this section by referencing other existing documents (e.g., own risk and solvency assessment summary report, holding company form B or F filings, securities and exchange commission proxy statements, or foreign regulatory reporting requirements) if the documents provide information comparable to the information described in subsection 5. The insurer or insurance group clearly shall reference the location of the relevant information within the corporate governance annual disclosure and attach the referenced document if it is not already filed or available to the regulator. 7. Each year following the initial filing of the corporate governance annual disclosure, the insurer or insurance group shall file an amended version of the previously filed corporate governance annual disclosure indicating where changes have been made. If no changes were made in the information or activities reported by the insurer or insurance group, the filing should so state. History: Effective October 1, NDCC 26.1-10.3 45-03-25-05.

The following standards apply to Medicare supplement policies and certificates and are in addition to all other requirements of this chapter: a.A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall not exclude or limit benefits for losses incurred more than six months from the effective date of coverage because it involved a preexisting condition. The policy or certificate may not define a preexisting condition more restrictively than a condition for which medical advice was given or treatment was recommended by or received from a physician within six months before the effective date of coverage. b.A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall not indemnify against losses resulting from sickness on a different basis than losses resulting from accidents. c.A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall provide that benefits designed to cover cost-sharing amounts under Medicare will be changed automatically to coincide with any changes in the applicable Medicare deductible, copayment, or coinsurance amounts. Premiums may be modified to correspond with such changes. d.No Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall provide for termination of coverage of a spouse solely because of the occurrence of an event specified for termination of coverage of the insured, other than the nonpayment of premium. e.Each Medicare supplement policy shall be guaranteed renewable. 40(1)The issuer shall not cancel or nonrenew the policy solely on the ground of health status of the individual. (2)The issuer shall not cancel or nonrenew the policy for any reason other than nonpayment of premium or material misrepresentation. (3)If the Medicare supplement policy is terminated by the group policyholder and is not replaced as provided under paragraph 5, the issuer shall offer certificate holders an individual Medicare supplement policy which at the option of the certificate holder: (a)Provides for continuation of the benefits contained in the group policy; or (b)Provides for benefits that otherwise meet the requirements of this subsection. (4)If an individual is a certificate holder in a group Medicare supplement policy and the individual terminates membership in the group the issuer shall: (a)Offer the certificate holder the conversion opportunity described in paragraph 3; or (b)At the option of the group policyholder, offer the certificate holder continuation of coverage under the group policy. (5)If a group Medicare supplement policy is replaced by another group Medicare supplement policy purchased by the same policyholder, the issuer of the replacement policy shall offer coverage to all persons covered under the old group policy on its date of termination. Coverage under the new policy shall not result in any exclusion for preexisting conditions that would have been covered under the group policy being replaced. f.Termination of a Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall be without prejudice to any continuous loss which commenced while the policy was in force, but the extension of benefits beyond the period during which the policy was in force may be conditioned upon the continuous total disability of the insured, limited to the duration of the policy benefit period, if any, or payment of the maximum benefits. Receipt of Medicare part D benefits will not be considered in determining a continuous loss. g.(1)A Medicare supplement policy or certificate shall provide that benefits and premiums under the policy or certificate shall be suspended at the request of the policyholder or certificate holder for the period not to exceed twenty -four months in which the policyholder or certificate holder has applied for and is determined to be entitled to medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act, but only if the policyholder or certificate holder notifies the issuer of the policy or certificate within ninety days after the date the individual becomes entitled to assistance. Upon receipt of timely notice, the issuer shall return to the policyholder or certificate holder that portion of the premium attributable to the period of medical assistance eligibility subject to adjustment for paid claims. (2)If suspension occurs and if the policyholder or certificate holder loses entitlement to medical assistance, the policy or certificate shall be automatically reinstituted effective as of the date of termination of entitlement if the policyholder or certificate holder provides notice of loss of entitlement within ninety days after the date of loss and pays the premium attributable to the period, effective as of the date of termination of entitlement. (3)Each Medicare supplement policy shall provide that benefits and premiums under the policy shall be suspended for any period that may be provided by federal 41regulation at the request of the policyholder if the policyholder is entitled to benefits under section 226(b) of the Social Security Act and is covered under a group health plan as defined in section 1862(b)(1)(A)(v) of the Social Security Act. If suspension occurs and if the policyholder or certificate holder loses coverage under the group health plan, the policy shall be automatically reinstituted effective as of the date of loss of coverage if the policyholder provides notice of loss of coverage within ninety days after the date of the loss and pays the premium attributable to the period, effective as of the date of termination of enrollment in the group health plan. (4)Reinstitution of coverages as described in paragraphs 2 and 3: (a)Shall not provide for any waiting period with respect to treatment of preexisting conditions; (b)Shall provide for resumption of coverage that is substantially equivalent to coverage in effect before the date of suspension; and (c)Shall provide for classification of premiums on terms at least as favorable to the policyholder or certificate holder as the premium classification terms that would have applied to the policyholder or certificate holder had the coverage not been suspended. 2.Standards for basic benefits common to Medicare supplement insurance benefit plans A, B, C, D, F, F with high deductible, G, M, and N. Every issuer of Medicare supplement insurance benefit plans shall make available a policy or certificate including only the following basic core package of benefits to each prospective insured.

However, a long-term care issuer may not deny a claim because services are provided in a state other than the state of policy issued under the following conditions: (a) When the state other than the state of policy issue does not have the provider licensing, certification, or registration required in the policy, but where the provider satisfies the policy requirements outlined for providers in lieu of licensure, certification, or registration; or (b) When the state other than the state of policy issue licenses, certifies, or registers the provider under another name. (2) For purposes of this subdivision, \"state of policy issue\" means the state in which the individual policy or certificate was originally issued. 100 h. This subsection is not intended to prohibit territorial limitations. 3.Extension of benefits. Termination of long -term care insurance shall be without prejudice to any benefits payable for institutionalization if the institutionalization began while the long -term care insurance was in force and continues without interruption after termination. The extension of benefits beyond the period the long -term care insurance was in force may be limited to the duration of the benefit period, if any, or to payment of the maximum benefits and may be subject to any policy waiting period, and all other applicable provisions of the policy. 4.Continuation or conversion. a.Group long-term care insurance issued in this state on or after the effective date of this section shall provide covered individuals with a basis for continuation or conversion of coverage. b.For the purposes of this section, \"a basis for continuation of coverage\" means a policy provision that maintains coverage under the existing group policy when the coverage would otherwise terminate and which is subject only to the continued timely payment of premium when due. Group policies that restrict provision of benefits and services to, or contain incentives to use certain providers or facilities, may provide continuation benefits that are substantially equivalent to the benefits of the existing group policy. The commissioner shall make a determination as to the substantial equivalency of benefits, and in doing so, shall take into consideration the differences between managed care and non-managed care plans, including, but not limited to, provider system arrangements, service availability, benefit levels, and administrative complexity. c.For the purposes of this section, \"a basis for conversion of coverage\" means a policy provision that an individual whose coverage under the group policy would otherwise terminate or has been terminated for any reason, including discontinuance of the group policy in its entirety or with respect to an insured class, and who has been continuously insured under the group policy, and any group policy which it replaced, for at least six months immediately prior to termination, shall be entitled to the issuance of a converted policy by the insurer under whose group policy the individual is covered, without evidence of insurability. d.For the purposes of this section, \"converted policy\" means an individual policy of long-term care insurance providing benefits identical to or benefits determined by the commissioner to be substantially equivalent to or in excess of those provided under the group policy from which conversion is made. When the group policy from which conversion is made restricts provision of benefits and services to, or contains incentives to use certain providers or facilities, the commissioner, in making a determination as to the substantial equivalency of benefits, shall take into consideration the differences between managed care and non -managed care plans, including provider system arrangements, service availability, benefit levels, and administrative complexity. e.Written application for the converted policy shall be made and the first premium due, if any, shall be paid as directed by the insurer not later than thirty -one days after termination of coverage under the group policy. The converted policy shall be issued effective on the day following the termination of coverage under the group policy, and shall be renewable annually. f.Unless the group policy from which conversion is made replaced previous group coverage, the premium for the converted policy shall be calculated on the basis of the insured's age at inception of coverage under the group policy from which conversion is made. When the group policy from which conversion is made replaced previous group 101coverage, the premium for the converted policy shall be calculated on the basis of the insured's age at inception of coverage under the group policy replaced. g.Continuation of coverage or issuance of a converted policy shall be mandatory, except when: (1)Termination of group coverage resulted from an individual's failure to make any required payment of premium or contribution when due; or (2)The terminating coverage is replaced not later than thirty -one days after termination, by group coverage effective on the day following the termination of coverage: (a)Providing benefits identical to or benefits determined by the commissioner to be substantially equivalent to or in excess of those provided by the terminating coverage; and (b)The premium for which is calculated in a manner consistent with the requirements of subdivision f. h.Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a converted policy issued to an individual who at the time of conversion is covered by another long -term care insurance policy that provides benefits on the basis of incurred expenses may contain a provision that results in a reduction of benefits payable if the benefits provided under the additional coverage, together with the full benefits provided by the converted policy, would result in payment of more than one hundred percent of incurred expenses. The provision shall only be included in the converted policy if the converted policy also provides for a premium decrease or refund which reflects the reduction in benefits payable. i.The converted policy may provide that the benefits payable under the converted policy, together with the benefits payable under the group policy from which conversion is made, shall not exceed those that would have been payable had the individual's coverage under the group policy remained in force and effect. j.Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an insured individual whose eligibility for group long-term care coverage is based upon the insured individual's relationship to another person shall be entitled to continuation of coverage under the group policy upon termination of the qualifying relationship by death or dissolution of marriage. k.For the purposes of this section, a \"managed care plan\" is a health care or assisted living arrangement designed to coordinate patient care or control costs through utilization review, case management, or use of specific provider networks. 5.Discontinuance and replacement. If a group long-term care policy is replaced by another group long-term care policy issued to the same policyholder, the succeeding insurer shall offer coverage to all persons covered under the previous group policy on its date of termination. Coverage provided or offered to individuals by the insurer and premiums charged to persons under the new group policy: a.Shall not result in an exclusion for preexisting conditions that would have been covered under the group policy being replaced; and b.Shall not vary or otherwise depend on the individual's health or disability status, claim experience, or use of long -term care services. 6.a.The premium charged to an insured shall not increase due to either: (1)The increasing age of the insured at ages beyond sixty -five; or 102(2)The duration the insured has been covered under the policy. b.The purchase of additional coverage shall not be considered a premium rate increase, but for purposes of the calculation required under section 45 -06-05.1-24, the portion of the premium attributable to the additional coverage shall be added to and considered part of the initial annual premium. c.A reduction in benefits shall not be considered a premium change, but for purpose of the calculation required under section 45 -06-05.1-24, the initial annual premium shall be based on the reduced benefits. 7.Electronic enrollment for group policies. a.In the case of a group defined in subdivision a of subsection 3 of North Dakota Century Code section 26.1-45-01, any requirement that a signature of an insured be obtained by an agent or insurer shall be deemed satisfied if: (1)The consent is obtained by telephonic or electronic enrollment by the group policyholder or insurer. A verification of enrollment information shall be provided to the enrollee; (2)The telephonic or electronic enrollment provides necessary and reasonable safeguards to assure the accuracy, retention, and prompt retrieval of records; and (3)The telephonic or electronic enrollment provides necessary and reasonable safeguards to assure that the confidentiality of nonpublic personal financial information and nonpublic personal health information as defined by article 45-14chapter 45-14-01 is maintained. b.The insurer shall make available, upon request of the commissioner, records that will demonstrate the insurer's ability to confirm enrollment and coverage amounts.

The percentage may be expressed as a percentage of the premium rate prior to the increase, and may also be expressed as minimum and maximum percentages if the rate increase is variable by rating characteristics. (2)The insurer may, in a fair manner, provide additional explanatory information related to the rate increases. (3)An insurer shall have the right to exclude from the disclosure premium rate increases that only apply to blocks of business acquired from other nonaffiliated insurers or the long -term care policies acquired from other nonaffiliated insurers when those increases occurred prior to the acquisition.

General Authority: NDCC 26.1-45 45-06-05.1-16. Reserve standards. 1.When long-term care benefits are provided through the acceleration of benefits under group or individual life policies or riders to such policies, policy reserves for the benefits shall be determined in accordance with North Dakota Century Code section 26.1 -35-02. Claim reserves shall also be established in the case when the policy or rider is in claim status. Reserves for policies and riders subject to this subsection should be based on the multiple decrement model utilizing all relevant decrements except for voluntary termination rates. Single decrement approximations are acceptable if the calculation produces essentially similar reserves, if the reserve is clearly more conservative, or if the reserve is immaterial. The calculations may take into account the reduction in life insurance benefits due to the payment of long-term care benefits. However, in no event shall the reserves for the long -term care benefit and the life insurance benefit be less than the reserves for the life insurance benefit assuming no long-term care benefit. 107In the development and calculation of reserves for policies and riders subject to this subsection, due regard shall be given to the applicable policy provisions, marketing methods, administrative procedures, and all other considerations which have an impact on projected claim costs, including, but not limited to, the following: a.Definition of insured events; b.Covered for benefit; r.Inflation protection provisions; and s.Guaranteed insurability option. Any applicable valuation morbidity table shall be certified as appropriate as a statutory valuation table by a member of the American academy of actuaries. 2.When long-term care benefits are provided other than as in subsection 1, reserves shall be determined in accordance with section 45-03-15-01generally accepted accounting and reserve practices. History: Effective March 1, 2004; amended effective October 1, Implemented: care benefits . 1.This section shall apply to all long -term care insurance policies or certificates except those covered under sections 45 -06-05.1-08 and 45-06-05.1-18. 108 2. Benefits under long -term care insurance policies shall be deemed reasonable in relation to premiums provided the expected loss ratio is at least sixty percent, calculated in a manner which provides for adequate reserving of the long -term care insurance risk. In evaluating the expected loss ratio, due consideration shall be given to all relevant factors, including: a. Statistical credibility of incurred claims experience and earned premiums; b. The period for which rates are computed to provide coverage; c. Experienced and projected trends; d. Concentration of experience within early policy duration; e. Expected claim fluctuation; f. Experience refunds, adjustments, or dividends; g. Renewability features; h. All appropriate expense factors; i. Interest; j. Experimental nature of the coverage; k. Policy reserves; l. Mix of business by risk classification; and m. Product features such as long elimination periods, high deductibles, and high maximum limits. 3. Subsection 2 shall not apply to life insurance policies that accelerate benefits for long -term care. A life insurance policy that funds long -term care benefits entirely by accelerating the death benefit is considered to provide reasonable benefits in relation to premiums paid, if the policy complies with all of the following provisions: a.The interest credited internally to determine cash value accumulations, including long-term care, if any, are guaranteed not to be less than the minimum guaranteed interest rate for cash value accumulations without long -term care set forth in the policy; b.The portion of the policy that provides life insurance benefits meets the nonforfeiture requirements of North Dakota Century Code sections 26.1 -33-18 through 26.1-33-28; c.The policy meets the disclosure requirements of subsections 4, 5, and 6 of North Dakota Century Code section 26.1 -45-09; d.Any policy illustration that meets the applicable requirements of the national association of insurance commissioners life insurance illustrations model regulation; and e.An actuarial memorandum is filed with the insurance department that includes: (1)A description of the basis on which the long -term care rates were determined; (2)A description of the basis for the reserves; (3)A summary of the type of policy, benefits, renewability, general marketing method, and limits on ages of issuance; 109(4)A description and a table of each actuarial assumption used. For expenses, an insurer must include a percentage of premium dollars per policy and dollars per unit of benefits, if any; (5)A description and a table of the anticipated policy reserves and additional reserves to be held in each future year for active lives; (6)The estimated average annual premium per policy and the average issue age; (7)A statement as to whether underwriting is performed at the time of application. The statement shall indicate whether underwriting is used and, if used, the statement shall include a description of the type or types of underwriting used, such as medical underwriting or functional assessment underwriting. Concerning a group policy, the statement shall indicate whether the enrollee or any dependent will be underwritten and when underwriting occurs; and (8)A description of the effect of the long -term care policy provision on the required premiums, nonforfeiture values, and reserves on the underlying life insurance policy, both for active lives and those in long -term care claim status. History: Effective March 1, 2004; amended effective October 1, 1.This section shall apply as follows: a.Except as provided in subdivision b, this section applies to any long -term care policy or certificate issued in this state on or after September 1, 2004. b.For certificates issued on or after the effective date of this amended regulation under a group long-term care insurance policy as defined in subdivision a of subsection 3 of North Dakota Century Code section 26.1 -45-01, which policy was in force at the time this amended regulation became effective, the provisions of this section shall apply on the policy anniversary following March 1, 2005. 2.An insurer shall provide noticerequest approval of a pending premium rate schedule increase, including an exceptional increase, to the commissioner at least thirty days prior to the notice to the policyholders and shall include: a.Information required by section 45 -06-05.1-07; b.Certification by a qualified actuary that: (1)If the requested premium rate schedule increase is implemented and the underlying assumptions, which reflect moderately adverse conditions, are realized, no further premium rate schedule increases are anticipated; and (2)The premium rate filing is in compliance with the provisions of this section; c.An actuarial memorandum justifying the rate schedule change request that includes: (1)Lifetime projections of earned premiums and incurred claims based on the filed premium rate schedule increase; and the method and assumptions used in determining the projected values, including reflection of any assumptions that deviate from those used for pricing other forms currently available for sale; 110(a)Annual values for the five years preceding and the three years following the valuation date shall be provided separately; (b)The projections shall include the development of the lifetime loss ratio, unless the rate increase is an exceptional increase; (c)The projections shall demonstrate compliance with subsection 3; and (d)For exceptional increases: [1]The projected experience should be limited to the increases in claims expenses attributable to the approved reasons for the exceptional increase; and [2]In the event the commissioner determines as provided in subdivision d of subsection 1 of section 45-06-05.1-02 that offsets may exist, the insurer shall use appropriate net projected experience; (2)Disclosure of how reserves have been incorporated in this rate increase whenever the rate increase will trigger contingent benefit upon lapse; (3)Disclosure of the analysis performed to determine why a rate adjustment is necessary, which pricing assumptions were not realized and why, and what other actions taken by the company have been relied on by the actuary; (4)A statement that policy design, underwriting, and claims adjudication practices have been taken into consideration; and (5)In the event that it is necessary to maintain consistent premium rates for new certificates and certificates receiving a rate increase, the insurer will need to file composite rates reflecting projections of new certificates; and (6) A demonstration that actual and projected costs exceed costs anticipated at the time of initial pricing under moderately adverse experience and that the composite margin specified in paragraph 4 of subdivision b of subsection 2 of section 45-06-05.1-08.1 is projected to be exhausted. d.A statement that renewal premium rate schedules are not greater than new business premium rate schedules except for differences attributable to benefits, unless sufficient justification is provided to the commissioner; and e.Sufficient information for review and approval of the premium rate schedule increase by the commissioner. 3.All premium rate schedule increases shall be determined in accordance with the following requirements: a.Exceptional increases shall provide that seventy percent of the present value of projected additional premiums from the exceptional increase will be returned to policyholders in benefits; b.Premium rate schedule increases shall be calculated such that the sum of the accumulated value of incurred claims, without the inclusion of active life reserves, and the present value of future projected incurred claims, without the inclusion of active life reserves, will not be less than the sum of the following: (1)The accumulated value of the initial earned premium times fifty -eight percent; 111(2)Eighty-five percent of the accumulated value of prior premium rate schedule increases on an earned basis; (3)The present value of future projected initial earned premiums times fifty -eight percent; and (4)Eighty-five percent of the present value of future projected premiums not in paragraph 3 on an earned basis; c.In the event that a policy form has both exceptional and other increases, the values in paragraphs 2 and 4 of subdivision b will also include seventy percent for exceptional rate increase amounts; and d.All present and accumulated values used to determine rate increases shall use the maximum valuation interest rate for contract reserves as specified in section 45-03-15-01permitted by law in the valuation of whole life insurance issued on the same date as the health insurance contract . The actuary shall disclose as part of the actuarial memorandum the use of any appropriate averages. 4.For each rate increase that is implemented, the insurer shall file for approval by the commissioner updated projections, as defined in paragraph 1 of subdivision c of subsection 2, annually for the next three years and include a comparison of actual results to projected values. The commissioner may extend the period to greater than three years if actual results are not consistent with projected values from prior projections. For group insurance policies that meet the conditions in subsection 11, the projections required by this subsection shall be provided to the policyholder in lieu of filing with the commissioner. 5.If any premium rate in the revised premium rate schedule is greater than two hundred percent of the comparable rate in the initial premium schedule, lifetime projections, as defined in paragraph 1 of subdivision c of subsection 2, shall be filed for approval by the commissioner every five years following the end of the required period in subsection 4. For group insurance policies that meet the conditions in subsection 11, the projections required by this subsection shall be provided to the policyholder in lieu of filing with the commissioner. 6.a.If the commissioner has determined that the actual experience following a rate increase does not adequately match the projected experience and that the current projections under moderately adverse conditions demonstrate that incurred claims will not exceed proportions of premiums specified in subsection 3, the commissioner may require the insurer to implement any of the following: (1)Premium rate schedule adjustments; or (2)Other measures to reduce the difference between the projected and actual experience. b.In determinedetermining whether the actual experience adequately matches the projected experience, consideration should be given to paragraph 5 of subdivision c of subsection 2, if applicable. 7.If the majority of the policies or certificates to which the increase is applicable are eligible for the contingent benefit upon lapse, the insurer shall file: a.A plan, subject to commissioner approval, for improved administration or claims processing designed to eliminate the potential for further deterioration of the policy form requiring further premium rate schedule increases, or both, or to demonstrate that appropriate administration and claims processing have been implemented or are in effect; otherwise the commissioner may impose the condition in subsection 8; and 112b.The original anticipated lifetime loss ratio and the premium rate schedule increase that would have been calculated according to subsection 3 had the greater of the original anticipated lifetime loss ratio or fifty -eight percent been used in the calculations described in paragraphs 1 and 3 of subdivision b of subsection 3. 8.a.For a rate increase filing that meets the following criteria, the commissioner shall review, for all policies included in the filing, the projected lapse rates and past lapse rates during the twelve months following each increase to determine if significant adverse lapsation has occurred or is anticipated: (1)The rate increase is not the first rate increase requested for the specific policy form or forms; (2)The rate increase is not an exceptional increase; and (3)The majority of the policies or certificates to which the increase is applicable are eligible for the contingent benefit upon lapse. b.In the event significant adverse lapsation has occurred and is anticipated in the filing or is evidenced in the actual results as presented in the updated projections provided by the insurer following the requested rate increase, the commissioner may determine that a rate spiral exists. Following the determination that a rate spiral exists, the commissioner may require the insurer to offer, without underwriting, to all in -force insureds subject to the rate increase the option to replace existing coverage with one or more reasonably comparable products being offered by the insurer or its affiliates.

Many policies also pay for care at home or other community settings. Since policies can vary in coverage, you should read this policy and make sure you understand what it covers before you buy it. [You should not buy this insurance policy unless you can afford to pay the premiums every year.] [Remember that the company can increase premiums in the future.] The personal worksheet includes questions designed to help you and the company determine whether this policy is suitable for your needs. Medicare Medicare does not pay for most long-term care. Medicaid Medicaid will generally pay for long -term care if you have very little income and few assets. You probably should not buy this policy if you are now eligible for Medicaid. Many people become eligible for Medicaid after they have used up their own financial resources by paying for long -term care services. When Medicaid pays your spouse's nursing home bills, you are allowed to keep your house and furniture, a living allowance, and some of your joint assets. Your choice of long -term care services may be limited if you are receiving Medicaid. To learn more about Medicaid, contact your local or state Medicaid agency. Shopper's Guide Make sure the insurance company or agent gives you a copy of a book called the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' \"Shopper's Guide to Long-Term Care Insurance\". Read it carefully. If you have decided to apply for long-term care insurance, you have the right to return the policy within 30 days and get back any premium you have paid if you are dissatisfied for any reason or choose not to purchase the policy. Counseling Free counseling and additional information about long -term care insurance are available through your state's insurance counseling program. Contact your state insurance department or department on aging for more information about the senior health insurance counseling program in your state. Facilities Some long-term care insurance contracts provide for benefit payments in certain facilities only if they are licensed or certified, such as in assisted living centers. However, not all states regulate these facilities in the same way. Also, many people move into a different state from where they purchased their long-term care insurance policy. Read the policy carefully to determine what types of facilities qualify for benefit payments, and to determine that payment for a covered service will be made if you move to a state that has a different licensing scheme for facilities than the one in which you purchased the policy. 128APPENDIX E Sample Claims Denial Format Claims Denial Reporting Form Long-Term Care Insurance For the State of _______________________________ For the Reporting Year of ______________________ Company Name: ______________________________Due: June 30 annually Line of Business: Individual Group Instructions The purpose of this form is to report all long -term care claim denials under in -force long-term care insurance policies.

Insurers shall provide all of the following information to the applicant: Long-Term Care Insurance Potential Rate Increase Disclosure Form [is][are] applicable to you and that will be in effect until a request is made and approved for an increase [is][are] [on the application] be shown on the schedule page of] [will be attached to] your policy. 3.Rate Schedule Adjustments: The company will provide a description of when premium rate or rate schedule adjustments will be effective (e.g., next anniversary date, next billing date, etc.) (fill in the blank): __________. 4.Potential Rate Revisions: This policy is Guaranteed Renewable. This means that the rates for this product may be increased in the future. Your rates CANNOT be increased due to your increasing age or declining health, but your rates may go up based on the experience of all policyholders with a policy similar to yours. If you receive a premium rate or premium rate schedule increase in the future, you will be notified of the new premium amount and you will be able to exercise at least one of the following options: Pay the increased premium and continue your policy in force as is. Reduce your policy benefits to a level such that your premiums will not increase. (Subject to state law minimum standards.) Exercise your nonforfeiture option if purchased. (This option is available for purchase for an additional premium.) Exercise your contingent nonforfeiture rights.* (This option may be available if you do not purchase a separate nonforfeiture option.) Contingent Nonforfeiture If the premium rate for your policy goes up in the future and you did not buy a nonforfeiture option, you may be eligible for contingent nonforfeiture. Here is how to tell if you are eligible: You will keep some long -term care insurance coverage, if: Your premium after the increase exceeds your original premium by the percentage shown (or more) in the following table; and 131 You lapse (not pay more premiums) within 120 days of the increase. The amount of coverage (i.e., new lifetime maximum benefit amount) you will keep will equal the total amount of premiums you have paid since your policy was first issued. If you have already received benefits under the policy, so that the remaining maximum benefit amount is less than the total amount of premiums you've paid, the amount of coverage will be that remaining amount. Except for this reduced lifetime maximum benefit amount, all other policy benefits will remain at the levels attained at the time of the lapse and will not increase thereafter. Should you choose this Contingent Nonforfeiture option, your policy, with this reduced maximum benefit amount, will be considered \"paid -up\" with no further premiums due. Example: You bought the policy at age 65 and paid the $1,000 annual premium for 10 years, so you have paid a total of $10,000 in premium. In the eleventh year, you receive a rate increase of 50%, or $500 for a new annual premium of $1,500, and you decide to lapse the policy (not pay any more premiums). Your \"paid-up\" policy benefits are $10,000 (provided you have at least $10,000 of benefits remaining under your policy.) Contingent Nonforfeiture Cumulative Premium Increase Over Initial Premium That Qualifies for Contingent Nonforfeiture (Percentage increase is cumulative from date of original issue. It does NOT represent a one-time increase.) Issue AgePercentage Increase Over Initial Premium following contingent nonforfeiture disclosure need only be included for those limited pay policies to which subdivisions d and f of subsection 4 of section 45-06-05.1-24 are applicable.] In addition to the contingent nonforfeiture benefits described above, the following reduced \"paid-up\" contingent nonforfeiture benefit is an option in all policies that have a fixed or limited premium payment period, even if you selected a nonforfeiture benefit when you bought your policy. If both the reduced \"paid-up\" benefit AND the contingent benefit described above are triggered by the same rate increase, you can choose either of the two benefits. You are eligible for the reduced \"paid-up\" contingent nonforfeiture benefit when all three conditions shown below are met: 1. The premium you are required to pay after the increase exceeds your original premium by the same percentage or more shown in the chart below: Triggers for a Substantial Premium Increase Percent Increase Over Issue Age Initial Premium Under 65 50% 65-80 30% Over 80 10% 2. You stop paying your premiums within 120 days of when the premium increase took effect; AND 3. The ratio of the number of months you already paid premiums is 40% or more than the number of months you originally agreed to pay. If you exercise this option your coverage will be converted to reduced \"paid-up\" status. That means there will be no additional premiums required. Your benefits will change in the following ways: a. The total lifetime amount of benefits your reduced paid-up policy will provide can be determined by multiplying 90% of the lifetime benefit amount at the time the policy 133becomes paid up by the ratio of the number of months you already paid premiums to the number of months you agreed to pay them. b. The daily benefit amounts you purchased will also be adjusted by the same ratio. If you purchased lifetime benefits, only the daily benefit amounts you purchased will be adjusted by the applicable ratio. Example: You bought the policy at age 65 with an annual premium payable for 10 years. In the sixth year, you receive a rate increase of 35% and you decide to stop paying premiums. Because you have already paid 50% of your total premium payments and that is more than the 40% ratio, your \"paid-up\" policy benefits are .45 (.90 times .50) times the total benefit amount that was in effect when you stopped paying your premiums. If you purchased inflation protection, it will not continue to apply to the benefits in the reduced \"paid-up\" policy. 134CHAPTER 45-06-16 SHORT-TERM LIMITED -DURATION INSURANCE 45-06-16-02 Requirements 45-06-16-03 Disclosure Requirements 45-06-16-04 Standards of Marketing 45-06-16-01.
