Focusing on your whole well-being can improve your physical, mental and emotional health during and after cancer treatment. Complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, massage therapy, nutritional planning, wellness, mind-body therapies and oncology counseling may be combined with your cancer care plan to: - Manage symptoms such as pain, nausea and fatigue. - Improve your quality of life. - Enhance the effectiveness of your cancer treatment plan. For more information on integrative care, contact OhioHealth CancerCall at [(800) 752-9119](tel: (800) 752-9119). Our programs offer support, relief and healing. - Acupuncture Acupuncture is the practice of inserting whisker-like needles into specific points on your body to promote your natural ability to heal. Acupuncture may relieve pain, nausea, vomiting, hot flashes, dry mouth, stress and anxiety, fatigue and other side effects of radiation and chemotherapy. - Art therapy Art therapy provides a creative outlet to encourage relaxation and explore the thoughts and emotions that come with a cancer diagnosis. This program is offered in a medical setting, such as during chemotherapy treatments, bedside or in a group therapy format. It's a therapeutic process that anyone can participate in, regardless of artistic abilities. - Cancer rehabilitation Our rehabilitation therapists will help you maintain and improve your quality of life during and after cancer through education and various cancer-related therapies, including lymphedema therapy. - Massage therapy Licensed massage therapists work on muscles and surrounding soft tissue to increase circulation. Our patients report a decrease in pain, anxiety and insomnia, as well as improved flexibility. A relaxation massage can provide a retreat from treatment and daily life to focus on healing. - Mind-body therapies Using guided imagery, hypnosis and stress management, mind-body therapy can support your body's ability to heal. By activating your relaxation response, you can lower your blood pressure, release tension in your muscles and focus your body on repair. These practices can be used prior to surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy to reduce stress and prepare for the best possible outcome. - Music therapy Music has been shown to reduce heart rate, lower blood pressure, decrease stress hormones and increase levels of the \"feel good\" hormones, serotonin and dopamine. Our therapists use music to calm and comfort patients by the bedside, in lobbies, hallways and infusion areas. - Nutrition counseling You will have free sessions with a registered dietitian to create individualized goals no matter where you are in your cancer journey. Together, you will create a plan that nourishes you and boosts your energy so you can better withstand the effects of cancer and its treatment. Nutrition counseling addresses side effects such as poor appetite, nausea, constipation and weight management, as well as nutrient deficiencies, high blood pressure and diabetes. - Oncology counseling Oncology counseling provides a safe place to process complex emotions related to your treatment experience, including changes to your body, job situation, and family.
