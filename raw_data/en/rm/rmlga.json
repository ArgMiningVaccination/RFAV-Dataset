To prevent the disease, we developed a candidate inactivated vaccine (Omicron COVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell), Inactivated). To evaluate the safety of the vaccine, we tested the repeat-dose toxicity in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The doses were administered randomly to three groups: physiological saline solution (control), aluminum adjuvant in PBS solution adjuvant (adjuvant group), and low-dose and high-dose omicron vaccines (vaccine group) for 6 weeks. The SD rats were allowed to recover for 4 weeks after withdrawal. We evaluated the physiological condition of the rats, including their ophthalmological condition, body weight, food intake, body temperature, blood biochemistry, urine, neutralizing antibody, inflammation at the injection site, and organs weight. In summary, no dose-dependent adverse toxicological changes were observed, and a recovery trend was obvious, which proved the preclinical safety of the candidate omicron vaccine and provided evidence for clinical trials in humans.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-12-27", "cleaned_text": "The major mutation sites were in the spike protein, with 15 mutation sites in the RBD domain, far exceeding those of previously identified mutant strains [ [2](#B2-covid-03-00003)]. A large number of mutation sites in the spike protein of the Omicron strain is strongly related to the speed of its transmissibility and immune escape ability [ [3](#B3-covid-03-00003)]. [4](#B4-covid-03-00003)]. In response to the great threat of the Omicron variant of concern to the public, we have developed an inactivated candidate Omicron vaccine, which provides good protection against the virus [5](#B5-covid-03-00003)]. [6](#B6-covid-03-00003)]. For BIV1-CovIran BALB/c mice, Guinea pigs, and Wistar Rats were used as animal models to evaluate the acute toxicity and repeated dose toxicity test [ [7](#B7-covid-03-00003)]. For the BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm) inactivated vaccine, the acute toxicity was evaluated through Sprague-Dawley rats and the systemic allergic reactions of guinea pigs [ [8](#B8-covid-03-00003)]. [5](#B5-covid-03-00003)]. In this study, we further evaluate repeated-dose toxicity. During vaccine development, repeated-dose toxicity assessment in a single animal species is an important means of determining the nonclinical safety of a vaccine [ [9](#B9-covid-03-00003)]. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats are proven to be effective animal models for repeat-dose toxicity studies [ [10](#B10-covid-03-00003)] and have been applied to the preclinical study of COVID-19 vaccines [ [11](#B11-covid-03-00003)]. Here, we evaluate the repeat-dose toxicity of an inactivated candidate Omicron vaccine (Vero cell) by repeating the intramuscular injection of Sprague-Dawley rats for 6 weeks and then allowing them to recover for 4 weeks. In the test, the preclinical safety of this vaccine was evaluated by analyzing the physiological condition of the rats, including ophthalmology, urine, body weight, food intake, body temperature, clinical pathology such as blood biochemistry, urine, neutralizing antibody, inflammation at the injection site, and organs weight. 2. Results 2.1. Clinical Observations 2.2. Body Weights [Figure 1](#covid-03-00003-f001)). 2.3. Food Intake [Figure [Table 1](#covid-03-00003-t001)). 2.5. 2.6. Clinical Pathology 2.6.1. Complete Blood Count [Table 2](#covid-03-00003-t002)). No differences were observed in the low-dose group was slightly increased, but it showed no dose-dependent adverse toxicological weights recovered after 4 IgG antibodies in the high dose of the vaccine were higher than the low doses on day D42, D56, and D70, but the RBD-antigen-specific IgG antibody and the neutralizing antibody titer showed no differences in those two groups. Furthermore, we also tested the RBD-antigen-specific IgG antibody of the HB02 inactivated vaccine as a control ( [Figure 5](#covid-03-00003-f005)B,D,F,G). These results indicated that the Omicron-inactivated vaccine induced high levels of S1- and RBD-antigen-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron in the rats. 3. Discussion [12](#B12-covid-03-00003), [13](#B13-covid-03-00003), [14](#B14-covid-03-00003)]. The development of an effective vaccine against Omicron remains the most effective intervention to limit the COVID-19 pandemic. [5](#B5-covid-03-00003)]. This study evaluated the repeated-dose toxicity of SD rats after repeated intramuscular administration of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-inactivated vaccine (Vero cell) at the local and systemic levels [ [11](#B11-covid-03-00003), [15](#B15-covid-03-00003)]. [16](#B16-covid-03-00003)]. After repeated administration, the animals in each group showed no significant signs of toxicity when evaluated for clinical conditions. Common clinical signs of toxicity, such as erythema, congestion, swelling at the injection sites, changes in body weight, food and water consumption, and ocular lesions, were not present in the study [ [17](#B17-covid-03-00003)]. The animals did not develop a fever during the evaluation period, and the slight decrease in body temperature after initial administration was non-dose-dependent and within the normal physiological range. [16](#B16-covid-03-00003), [18](#B18-covid-03-00003)]. After the repeated-dose administration of the vaccines, some local inflammatory lesions were observed by histopathological sections at the injection sites. Three days after the last dose (D46), interstitial granulomatous inflammation, acute inflammation, and hemorrhage were observed in the control group and the Omicron COVID-19 vaccine candidate (low-dose/high-dose) group. Studies have shown that the aluminum adjuvant can also lead to local inflammatory reactions, such as granulomatosis [ [19](#B19-covid-03-00003), [20](#B20-covid-03-00003)]. Gender difference is not observed. The toxicity of all animals showed no dose-dependent behavior, and at the end of the 4-week recovery period (D71), the above changes showed a clear recovery trend. Therefore, it is believed that the abnormal changes in the injection site in this trial may be related to the aluminum adjuvant contained in it and are not to be considered a security issue. [21](#B21-covid-03-00003)]. The possible systemic toxicity of repeated administration was investigated according to the clinicopathological indicators. Hematological and blood chemistry parameters can be used to assess changes in rat immunotoxicology and animal health over time [ [22](#B22-covid-03-00003)]. After the repeated-dose administration of vaccines, blood-cell counts (except for Neut, Lymph, Mono, and MCHC), the coagulation function (except for FIB), blood biochemistry, and urine examination indicators showed no regular changes compared with the control group. In particular, the increase in the number of Neut, Mono, and FIB may be associated with the immune response and/or local irritation after the administration of vaccine/adjuvant, as well as with the fluctuation in the remaining indicators. These indicators showed a complete/significant recovery trend at the end of the 4-week recovery period (D71). In addition, we carried out gross examinations after euthanasia. There was no significant variation in the organs weights except for the testis, which demonstrated a lower weight 3 days after the last dose (D46) in the high-dose group, but recovered after 4 weeks (D71). [8](#B8-covid-03-00003), [10](#B10-covid-03-00003)]. We found that after immunization with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-inactivated vaccine (Vero cell), the SD rats could also induce high levels of specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies against the S1-antigen-specific antibody and Omicron virus, respectively. After the 4-week recovery period (D71), the immunization antibody titers and neutralizing antibody titers in the vaccinated group remained at high levels, providing protection against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron. This suggests that, in addition to being safe, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-inactivated vaccine (Vero cell) can induce a long-lasting immune response. [5](#B5-covid-03-00003)], it is believed that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-inactivated vaccine (Vero cell) offers good safety, providing an experimental basis for further clinical trials and a reference frame for related follow-up studies. Limitations [16](#B16-covid-03-00003)], clearer indications of vaccine toxicity need to be considered, such as the cellular-response factors induced by the vaccine. Thirdly, for the vaccine to be finally applied to humans, a primate model should be considered to confirm its safety in future studies. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Animal Ethics Statement 4.2.
