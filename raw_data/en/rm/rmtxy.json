Oprah and Dr. Oz both have raved about the benefits of receiving a Reiki treatment. Reiki can accelerate the healing process of the body, mind and emotions. Reiki helps to release stress and creates balance. Maybe you just feel tired and rundown, but your blood counts all indicate that you are healthy, or, emotionally, you feel stuck in a rut, going nowhere. Reiki helps to restore the energy that supports your health and well-being, getting you up and moving forward again. Reiki's Origins Reiki originated in Japan in the early 1900s and was founded and taught by Dr. Makao Usui. It was brought to the United States in the 1930s by Mrs. Hawayo Takata, who gave Reiki treatments and began teaching Reiki in Hawaii from 1970 until her death in 1980. Reiki is a technique where the practitioner facilitates the flow of universal healing energy into the client's energetic field. In the Western world of medicine, patients are looked at and treated from a biological and chemical perspective as having body parts, organs, skin and bones along with blood, hormones etc. The Eastern model of medicine includes treating the biological, chemical, emotional, mental and energetic components of each person. They know that each person's physical, emotional, and mental components are impacted by their flow of \"chi\" or energy throughout their body. When the chi is low, disease and illness form. Our chi is impacted by our habits, exercise, nutrition and self-care. If we think negatively, eat poorly, worry, smoke, overwork, over extend, drink excessively or do not exercise, our chi is diminished. When chi flows freely throughout the body, the person has radiant health. How Reiki Works The Reiki practitioner sends chi into the client's body where it is needed. This chi removes energy blocks, restores the energy pathways, returns energy levels to normal and reestablishes the body's natural capacity to heal itself. That is exactly why we have all these organs and body parts to maintain health. [Reiki](https://www.naturalnews.com/Reiki.html) is a natural way to create and restore health and well-being. It helps the body to recover from surgery, lowers pain levels, reduces stress, supports the immune system, aids better sleep, increases [energy](https://www.naturalnews.com/energy.html) levels, accelerates the body's self-healing capacity and assists with emotional healing and spiritual growth.
