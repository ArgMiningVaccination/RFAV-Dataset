Stimulating, in-depth music discussions aren't rare here. <UPDATED> SEE BOTTOM I rarely see serious discussion about this topic. I do think that music can possibly a negative impact of mental health, and I want to explain my personal experience related to it. In my case, I am specifically interested in the way that \"dark\" music relates to mental health: music that expresses feelings like anxiety, loneliness, frustration, anger, etc. There is already a good amount of cultural discourse about how \"light\", happy music can become an escape from gritty reality. With dark music though, I think a similar phenomenon can happen, although it is slightly different. In the case of dark music, the expressions of pain in it are not necessarily meant to be an end in themselves, but a way of framing our experiences, and hopefully empowering us to work towards overcoming what ails us. This means that the music is ultimately meant to be transcended. However, if the music is truly effective, it gives us a powerful sense of being understood in our suffering, and perhaps, instead of learning to overcome our pain, we become attached to this feeling of being understood. I think this is what may have happened to me, as I became virtually \"addicted\" to listening to particular pieces of music that seemed to speak to me with an almost overwhelming force. When this attachment happens, I think it may be possible to become caught up in a cycle of helplessness. Instead of learning from the music and living by it, we retreat to it as a haven where we can feel less alone. The expressions of pain become idolized for their own sake. Now that all music is available to everyone 24/7, this retreat can become a compulsive response to discomfort. I am curious to hear anyone else's thoughts on this. I do think there are other sides of the story. UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who responded. Unfortunately I don't have time to respond to everybody, although there are a lot of really interesting discussion points. I do see two problems with this post, which are my fault, but will help me have a more focused discussion in the future: - Everybody interpreted \"dark music\" as something different. Some people were thinking of sad Adele songs, some were thinking of dark ambient, others were thinking metal and punk. I personally was thinking of avant-garde and dissonant music when I wrote the post, which I barely saw mentioned at all here. Although I think my point still stands for all these different styles, I will have to clarify in the future. - People misinterpreted my argument as saying that dark music makes you depressed, or that it can't be really enjoyed. That's not what I was trying to say AT ALL. In fact, I was trying to say almost the opposite: the problem might be that it can be enjoyed too much, that it makes us too comfortable with being down. As I said, I think any sort of art that expresses pain is meant to be learned from and transcended. It can't become a full-time fantasy world where we retreat to feel understood and comforted. "}
