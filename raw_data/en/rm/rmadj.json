We're here to support you , your child, and your family . We created this manual as one of the first steps in that pro cess. We hope you find it helpful. 8 9 Welcome to the Blood and Marrow Transplant Program We created this manual for families who have a child or te en going through a blood and marrow transplant. Feel free to share the information within it with your child . Older children and teens may want to read it themselves. We welcome your comments about the manual. Notes from the editor: First, w ithin the document, you will see refences to \"y ou and your child\" . The \"you\" and \" your\" in these instances refers to the p rimary caregiver(s) who i s typically the child's parents . Second, instead of using the pronouns \"he or she\" throughout the document when referring to the child having a transplant, we alternate between \"he\" and \"she.\" 10 The steps of allogeneic transplant The cell that is being trans planted is the stem cell , which is made in the bone marrow. Stem cells are immature cells that grow and mature into red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets or plasma cells. Stem cells are an essential part of a person's imm une system. Names you will hear include: Bone marrow transplant (BMT) Marrow transplant Peripheral blood stem cell transplant Stem cell transplant Hemopoietic stem cell transplant Type of transplant There are several types of transplant. You may hear o thers discussing a pro cess different from yours. Below is a chart reviewing each type. This chapter will then go into detail. Type of transplant Cell source Goals Allogeneic Related Another person Family member Delive r highest dose of chemotherapy and radiation to eliminate disease. New cells replace patient's immune system. Unrelated Another person Usually anonymous Mixed chimerism (m ini) Related Another person Family member Deliver moderate dose of chemotherapy and radiation to set up a mixed i mmune system. New immune system attacks cancer. Unrelated Another person Usually anonymous Autologous Patient If patient has cancer: Deliver highest dose of chemotherapy and radiation to eliminate disease. If patient has an autoimmune disease: Halt progression of disease and reset the immune system. The transplant process can be divided into steps. Each step has its own purpose and c hallenges. The steps are: Planning ahead This step begins when you first think about transplant as a tre atment optio n for your child. You start to organize yourself and your family to undertake this journey. Preparation Once you arrive at the clinic, you will begin the process of medical evaluation, orientation, informed consent, and get ready to begin conditioning the rapy. Family members prepare to assume the caregiver role. Conditioning High -dose chemotherapy and/or ra diotherapy is given to your child . Transplant Stem cells harvested from the bone marrow or collected from the circulating bloodstream are infused. 11 Before engraftment Your child will receive close m onitoring, supportive treatment , and management of complications while waiting for signs that the transplanted stem cells are engrafting (growing and developing). After engraftment This is the time after th e first signs of engraftment when your child's new white cells, red cells , and platelets are being produced and the immune system is starting to recover. You r child will still need close monitoring and supportive treatment. Long -term recovery Your child will leave the clinic and further care and trea tment will be provided by your hometown doctor. The challenges in this stage include managing possible late complications and resuming life at home. Preparation When you first arrive, you and your child will go to the clinic to begin the pre -transplant e valuation. You will learn the proposed treatment plan, meet with your healthcare team, and get answers to your questions about treatment. You and your family members can attend classes on how to manage symptoms at home and prevent infection. All of this is to prepare you for the next step \u2014conditioning therapy. Childcare is not provided during appointments or classes and should be arranged ahead of time if needed. As a courtesy to the large number of patients wit h weakened immune systems in the clinic, please refrain from bringing family members or caregivers with even minor infection symptoms (cold or otherwise) into the clinic. Also, please do not bring any animal s but service dogs to the clinic. First clinic appointments Your first visit at the clinic will consist of meeting your primary doctor and your team nurse. Your nurse will take your child's vital signs, draw blood, take a short history, and give you an or ientation of the clinic. Your primary doctor will complete a health history and physical examination. You will be given a schedule of visits and consent forms that give permission to conduct the pre -transplant evaluation. In the first few days, you will meet with a social worker who will answer the quest ions you may have about your housing and social issues, describe resources you may access, and offer support for you and your family members. Arrival conference ( meeting with the physician and other member of your care team) After the health history and p hysical exam are done, you will be scheduled for a confer ence. This usually takes place on the 2nd day after you arrive at the clinic. Your attending physician will conduct the conference. You may invite members of your family, including the donor, to atte nd. The attending physician will talk to you about the process of having a bone marrow transplant. He or she will discuss the plan of treatment including the ri sks and benefits. You will receive a consent packet at your first appointment, please bring it w ith you to your arrival conference. The age and maturity of the child will determine whether he should attend the conference. We discourage small children from attending. If you would like, you may schedule time with our Child Life specialists for medical play with small children. 12 Evaluation and work-up The evaluation for transplant includes blood draws for tissue typing and clinical tests, a bone marrow aspirat ion and possible biopsy, chest X -rays, an electrocardiogram (ECG), pulmonary function tests , and other tests the doctor may order. You will meet with a dietitian , physical therapist and have a dental checkup. When the results of these tests a re available (5 to 7 days) you will be scheduled for placement of a central venous line catheter. Consul ts and tests occur both at the clinic and at Seattle Children's Hospital. The location and time of appointments will be on your schedule. Schedule chang es occur frequently due to testing results. Informed consent conference You will be scheduled for a se cond conference to review your child's test results before proceed ing with treatment. The doctor must share information with you so that you will be we ll informed and able to make the decision to go ahead with your child's transplant . The conference provid es you and your family the opportunity to ask questions. After the conference, you (or your child's legal guardian) will be asked to sign consent forms giving permission to proceed with treatment. You and your family will: Receive copies of all protocol consent forms for the protocols in which you r child is participating. Be offered copies of all protocols for the protocols in wh ich your child is participating. Be offered a copy of the dictated \"Data Review Conference\" summary. Central venous line placement Placement of this catheter is done at Seattle Children's Hospital. Your child will receive sedation (medicine to make them sleep) before the surgery begins. Because of this sedation, your child may not eat or drink anything before the catheter is plac ed. Not eating or drinking prevents the possibili ty of vomiting during surgery. Talk to the Pediatric Team regarding these specific instructions . We will schedule a time for you to return to the SCCA Clinic the following day so that one of the nurses can t each you how to take care of your child's catheter. Conditioning Conditioning consists of high -dose chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation. The purpose of conditioning therapy is to remove cancer cells or to remove the remaining immune syst em, so that new marrow can grow . Conditioning can be received in the clinic or in the hospital. Your care team will discuss your child's treatment plan with you. Chemotherapy All chemotherapies and radiation have some effects on normal cells as well as on diseased cells , and unpleasant effects can be expected. Each of the chemotherapy drugs has different effects. The specific s of the chemotherapy prescribed for you r child will be explained when your therapy program is planned. Common side effects include n ausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dry mouth, fatigue, hair loss, and skin changes. Some of the side effects of chemotherapy happen right away and can be managed with other drugs. Nausea and vomiting are major concern s for your child . Several drug therapies are a vailable to relieve nausea and keep you r child comfortable. Diarrhea can result from chemotherapy and is treated with fluid and electrolyte replacement. Hair loss is temporary, and your child's hair should start growing back a few months after the transpla nt. 13 Safe handling of chemotherapy at home Because chemotherapy (chemo) is made up of dangerous chemicals that can harm you, it is important to take precautions, especially at home. Only you (the caregiver ) should touch chemo and the items used to deliver the chemo, such as syringes and needles. Pregn ant women, children, and pets should avoid touching chemo and contaminated waste. In this section, we'll teach you how to handle the medication safely at home. Storing your chemo Below are some tips for storin g chemotherapy safely: Keep chemo pills in their original container; do not transfer them to a pill box. Do not crush or open chemo medication. Some medications need to be refrigerated or kept away from light; check medicine labels for special instructio ns; follow additional instructions from your care team. Store chemo and equipment in a safe place and out of reach of children and p ets. Do not store chemotherapy in your bathroom because humidity may damage the drugs. Disposal of chemo Because chemother apy is dangerous, it shouldn't be thrown away in your trash. If you r child is receiving intravenous (IV) chemo at home, IV equipment and gloves should be put in the hard, plastic containers that come with the chemo supplies. The container should say \"Chemo therapy Waste\" or something similar. If the waste is too large to fit in the plastic container, put all sharps in the hard, plastic container. Put the other equipment in a separate, leak -proof plastic bag (such as a garbage bag) and seal it tightly with rubber bands. The comp any suppl ying your child's chemo and equip ment will tell you who will remove the waste containers. If your child is taking oral chemotherapy, ask your care team how to dispose of it or refer to How to Safely Get Rid of Prescription M edications and Sharps . Managing chemo spills The company that supplies your child's IV chemo will inc lude a chemo spill kit with her medicine. If her chemo spills, follow the instructions on the kit and inform your child's care team. If, for some reason, you don't have a spill kit available, follow these steps: Put o n 2 pairs of disposable gloves. Clamp the IV tubing. Turn off the pump if you're using one. Place the following in a leak -proof plastic bag, such as a garbage bag: o All the tubing and container s o The pump and the carrying case, if you have one Soak up the spill with paper towels. Clean the area with soap and water. Rinse with clean water. Put all the supplies used to clean up the spill in a separate leak -proof plastic bag. Remove your gloves and wash your hands with soap and water. Call you care team fo r instructions on how to manage the spilled chemo, the equipment, and the dirty cleaning supplies. 14 Other instructions Body wastes Your child's urine and stool contain chemotherapy while she is receiving treatment, and for up to 2 days after she's finished treatment. Traces of chemoth erapy may also be p resent in vomit, vaginal fluid, and semen. Your child may use the toilet (septic tank or sewe r) as usual. For the first 48 hours (2 days) after your child receive s chemo, instruct her to flush the toilet twice with the lid closed each time she uses it. Be sure your child washes her hands with soap and water each time she uses the bathroom. Laundry Wash her clothing and bedding normally unless they b ecome soiled with chemotherapy. If that happens, put on disposable gloves and handle the laundry carefully to avoid getting chemo on your skin. Soiled items should be washed separately from other clothes. If you don't have a washing machine, place the dirt y items in a sealed, leak -proof plastic bag until they can be washed. Skin care Chemoth erapy can irritate you and your child's skin. If chemo spills on you or your child , thoroughly wash the area with soap and water, and dry it. If irritation develops tha t lasts more than 1 hour or if a rash develops , call your child's care team. Wea r gloves when working with chemo, chemo -soiled equipm ent, or waste to prevent it from touching your skin . Eye care If chemoth erapy gets into you or your child's eyes, flush them with water for 10 to 15 minut es, and contact your care team immediately. Questions and answers Is it safe for family members to have contact with my child during chemotherapy? Yes. If you r child wish es to, spending time with others is encouraged. Living, eating, and doing activities with others is safe. H ugging and closed -mouth ki ssing is safe, too. Is it safe for my family to use the same toilet as my child receiving chemo ? Yes. We understand your family may have concerns, but as long as any chemotherapy waste is cleaned from the toilet, it is safe to share a bathroom . What should my child do if she doesn't have control of her bladder or bowel s? Use a disposable, plastic-backed pad, adult or pediatric diaper, or sheet to absorb urine or stool. When it gets soiled, put on gloves, remove the soiled piece , remove the gloves, and then wash you and your child's skin with soap and water. If your child has an ostomy, you should wear g loves when emptying or changing the bags. Discard disposable ostomy supplies in the chemoth erapy waste container. What if my child uses a bedpan, urinal, or commode? If your child is using one of these, it's important for you to wear gloves when emptying and clean ing the containers . You should rinse the container with water aft er each use and wash it with soap and water at least once a day. What if my child vomits into a basin ? It's important for you to wear gloves when emptying and cleaning your child's basin. You should rinse the basin with water after each use and wash it with soap and water at least once a day. 15 Is it safe for my child to be sexually active during treatment? Please ask your child's care team this question, as this depends on the type of treatment she is on. Because traces of chemoth erapy may be present in vaginal fluid or semen for up to 48 hours after treatment, your child may need to take special precautions. Is it safe to throw I V chemotherapy in the trash? No. Chemoth erapy waste is dangerous and should be thrown away separately. If your child is receiving IV chemoth erapy at hom e, you should have received a special waste container for the chemoth erapy and equipment (such as used syringes, needles, tubing, bags, cassettes, and vi als). This container should be hard plastic and labeled \"Chemotherapy Waste\" or something similar. Can we travel with my child's chemotherapy? Traveling with chemo is usually fine but ch eck with your child's care team or home in fusion suppli er to confirm it is OK . Some chemoth erapy requires special storage, so you may need to make plans, such as traveling with a cooler . Rega rdless of how you travel (by pl ane, car, or another mode of transportation ), always seal your chemoth erapy drugs in leak -proof pl astic bags.

TBI is radiation given to the entire body. TBI is given according to the treatment plan specific to your child . It can vary from 1 to 3 times a d ay, 20 to 40 minut es at a time, for a length of 1 to 4 days. The treatment length is depende nt on your child's body size and prescribed radiation dosage. However, once determined, the amount of time you r child spend s in treatment will be the same. What ar e TBI t reatments like? TBI treatment will not cause pain or discomfort for your child . He or she will not have any unusual sensations while the radiation machine is on. You r child will not become \"radioactive.\" A famil y member may accompany your child to the radiation therapy department. However, it is necessary for you r child to be alone in th e room during treatment. You r child may feel alone during their treatment . Monitors are outside so that the nurse and radiation technician see and hear you r child at all times. You will be given detailed instructions when your child's nurse teaches you abo ut the radiation course. 16 Side effects of TBI Nausea : Most often occurs 1\u00bd - 2 hours after a dose of TBI. You r child will be started on medication to ease any fe eling s of nausea . The day before TBI begins , your care team will review the medications you r child should take before each TBI treatment. Dehydration : TBI can cause dehydration much like if you r child were exposed to the sun for too long. Other side effec ts such as diarrhea and nausea add to this problem. Your ch ild may receive hydration through an IV during each day of TBI to help prevent dehydration. Skin sensitivity : TBI acts as a heat source even though you r child will not feel this right away. You and your child will notice her skin may appear flushed or da rker following radiation therapy. Following treatment, your child's skin will be more sensitive, especially to sunlight. You and your child can take p recautions to avoid skin burns during treatment . This includes wearing l oose fitting clothing, removing all jewelry, glasses, and contacts. The clamp used to hold your child's central catheter will also be removed. The nurse or doctor will assess your child's skin frequently. Your child should a void us ing lotion and deodorant before TBI. Alopecia : Temporary hair loss may occur gradually over about two weeks following treatment. Parotitis : The parotid glands are located near and in front of the ears. Parotitis is swelling of the parotid gland , and it c an cause headaches, fevers, tiredness, and appet ite loss . Parotitis is not a common side effect but has been seen in TBI patients. Symptoms will occur from 4 to 24 hours after T BI. Ice packs and Tylenol \u00ae help to relieve the discomfort from the swelling. Parotitis will resolve in 24 to 72 hours following treatment. Diarrhea : Usually develops within the first week following TBI and can be treated with medications. Mucositis : Mucositis is painful swelling or ulceration of the g lands that secrete mucous and t he fast-growing cells that line the mouth and throat . It can cause dryness, swelling , and a painful mouth and throat. Mucositis is treated with salt -water rinses and pain medication. If pain continues, narcotics will be used. Transplant The transplant ta kes place a day or two after the chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment has been completed . The goal is to infuse stem cells . Stem cells are cells from which all types of blood cells grow. These cells can be collected from bone marrow, circulating blood, or umbilical cord blood after a baby's birth. Stem cells are infused through your child's central venous line in the same way that any blood transfusion is given. It takes place either in the infusion room at SCCA or in your child's room at Seattle Childre n's H ospital . In allogeneic transplants, the cells are harvested from the donor (either from a family member or an unrel ated person) on the same day the cells will be given to you r child . The bone marrow donor Donors will receive their own education al materials when they arrive at the clinic. The bone marrow donor is the person who makes an allogeneic transplant procedure possible. He or she is the person who most closely matches the genetic type of the patient. The donor may be an immediate family mem ber, often a brother or sister. In some cases, the donor and patient are not related but are still closely matched in tissue type. Mos t families arrive knowing who the donor will be. Even with a known donor, it is still important that some typing be repeat ed. This information assures the medical team that the best possible donor has been selected. There are no age restrictions for donors. 17 Marrow harvesting The actual marrow harvesting is performed in surgery where marrow is taken from the hip bones. Marrow is obtained through needles inserted through the skin into the hip bones. Most donors go home from the hospital the same day after marrow harvest unless an overnight stay is medically necessary. The stem cell donor Stem cells are produced in the bone mar row and circulate in the bloodstream. The stem cells that circulate in the bloodstream are called peripheral blood stem cells, or PBSC's. Normally, small numbers of stem cells circulate in the bloodstream. In addition to obtaining stem cells by harvesting them from the bone marrow, it is possible to obtain them by collecting them from the bloodstream. However, before that can be done , it is necessary to stimulate the movement of stem cells into the bloodstream. This is called mobilization. Stem cell mobiliza tion Mobilization of stem cells is achieved by giving the donor special proteins called growth factors. It takes a few days for the body to respond to the mobilization therapy. When blood tests show that the cell count is high enough, collection can begin. Once in a while, a stem cell donor must undergo more than one cycle of mobilization to collect enough stem cells for transplantation. Collecting stem cells Stem cells are collected in the Apheresis Unit . Before beginning collection, the donor must have a catheter (tube) placed into a large vein. The placement of the catheter may take place several days before or right before the collection procedure. The collection of PBSC's takes about three hours. During the procedure, the donor relaxes in a chai r or be d and can watch television or read. The donor's blood is withdrawn through the catheter and circulated through a machine that separates out the stem cells and collects them. The remaining blood cells are returned to the donor via the catheter. The procedu re is painless. When the procedure is over, the donor can resume normal activities. Infusion of donated cells Marrow or stem cells are infused into you r child as soon as the cells are available from the do nor. Your child may receive one or more bags of ce lls. In some cases , the bone marrow is process ed before infusion. Based on recommendation of the Transfusion Services Office, if the blood type bet ween your child and his donor doe s not match, red blood cells may be removed from the marrow befor e infusion. The nurse attaches IV tubing to the bag of cells and connects the tubing to your child's central catheter line. Each bag of cells is infused one after the other. During the infusion, the nurse will check vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, res piration, a nd temperature). Your child may be connected to a heart monitor, so nurses can observe their heart rate and rhythm. The length of the infusion depends on the volume, or amount , of st em cells to be given. The infusion takes 30 minutes to 2 hours to complete . Your child may receive stem cells on more than one day because of the donor collection process. 18 Before e ngraftment Signs that the new stem cells are growing (engrafting) and beginning to produce blood cells are expect ed from 10 to 28 days after transp lant. Often the first sign of engraftment is a rising white blood cell count. Your child will be monitored carefully while waiting for engraftment. The goals are to support you r child until they are producing blood cells a gain, to provide prompt treatment if complications occur, and to prevent infections. You and your child may feel uncertain, stressed, defenseless, and vulnerable while waiting for the engraftment to occur. Some families feel a loss of personal control a ssociated with the daily monitoring, medical procedures, and treatments following your child's transplant . Coping at this time can be a challenge. Keep talking to your child's team about your concerns and concerns your child has. Blood counts : what are they and what do they mean? Blood coun ts are numbers that show the amount of blood cells circulating in the blood stream. Blood will be drawn from your child's cen tral line to check the counts. The blood counts that are monitored closely are the total number of white blood cells (ANC), the hem atocrit, and the platelet count. Blood component Name Function Normal ranges Transplant transfusion guidelines Hematocrit % Red blood cells per volume of whole blood erythrocytes HCT Carry oxygen to the body Give color to the skin Give energy to the bo dy Adult: 37 to 52% Transfuse: If HCT less than 26% OR If patient symptomatic Platelets Thrombocytes PLTS Prevent bleeding Help blood to clot 150,000 to 500,000 / mm3 Transfuse: If less than 10,000 or, for bleeding or, if otherwise indicated White blood cells WBC Fight infection Adult: 5,000 to 10,000 / mm3 Not applicable Absolute neutrophil count ANC Neutrophils Polys , bands, segs, and granulocytes Type of WBC that is first to respond to potentially fatal infections Over 1,000 Very rare occurrences ; Only if life threatening infection is present with no signs of white cell recovery 19 Effects of chemotherapy and radiation on blood counts The amounts of chemotherapy and radiation used in conditioning cause the bone marrow to stop producing cells for a time. Your child's blood counts will be low during this period , and she may need a bloo d transfusion. After your child's blood counts are drawn, the doctor will determine your child's transfusion needs. When your child's stem cells begin to engraf t, her blood counts should start to rise. The actual time for recovery of cells will vary from p erson to person. Red blood cell transfusions When your child's red blood count is low, the doctor will order packed red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. This consists of a bag or bags of concentrated red blood cells , each transfused over 2 to 4 hours. This blood has been typed and cross -matched with your child's to minimize the chance of reaction. This means that the RBC donor and you r child have a compatible blo od type. It's still possible that you r child may have a reaction. Symptoms include fever, chills, hives, itching, and/or breathing problems. If you r child has any of these symptoms during transfusion, be sure to report them right away to your nurse. All b lood products are tested for infectious diseases such as hepatitis, HIV /AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency virus ), and West Nile. If you r child is cytomegalovirus (CMV) negative, your child will receive C MV safe blood, also kn own as leuko -reduced blood products. Platelet transfusions Collection of platelets is do ne at the Puget Sound Blood Center . Platelet transfusions come from three types of donors: Random pooled platelets: from two to six volunteer do nors in the community, which are pooled in the same bag . Random apheresis platelets (RAP): From one volunteer donor in the community. Matched apheresis platelets (MAP): From one HLA matched unrelated donor in the community. Infections Infections remain one of the major complic ations of transplantation. You r child is at high risk for infections because of low white blood cell counts and a poorly functioning immune system . All people have different types of bacteria, viruses, and yeast growing on their skin and in their bodies. Many of these organisms are needed for proper functioning of our b odies. The immune system controls the growth of the organisms so that they do no t make us sick. The source of infection in many patients is their own organisms. Routine cultures are importan t because the results keep the doctor informed about the bacteria, viruses, and yeast you r child may have growing in their body that may be causin g infections . Culture results help doctor s to prescribe the right antibiotic when you r child has an infection. Your child may have negative culture results , but he may still clinically look and feel like he has an infection. Another source of infection is organisms from other people. Hand washing plays a key role in stopping the spread of infection from one pers on to another. It is important that everyone enterin g and leaving your child's hospital or clinic room washes their hands . This is why visiting between you r child and other patients is not allowed in the hospital and why your family members should not go i nto other patients' hospital rooms. The medications used to treat infections include antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral medications. Respiratory viruses, which cause the common cold or the flu in people with normal immune systems, can lead to pneumoni a in transplant patients. 20 These virus es include parainfluenza, aden ovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). If you r child develop s symptoms of an upper respiratory infection, such as stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, chills, fatigue or fever, we will get a naso -phary ngeal and throat (NPT ) culture to determine if there is a specific viral infection. You r child will be in isolation as soon as symptoms develop and remain in isolation until the cultures are negative and your child no longer have symptoms. Family members or friends with cold o r flu symptoms should stay away from you r child until they are well. Cytomegalovirus (CMV ) Cytomegalovirus (CMV ) infection is a member of the herpes family and is very common. Between 50 to 80% of the US population ha ve had a CMV virus infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). CMV infections are rarely serious in otherwise healthy children and adults and usually cause only mild symptoms, if any. Once a person has had a CMV infection, the virus usu ally lies dormant ( inactive) in the body but can be \"reactivated\" and cause serious illness in people who have weakened immune systems due to illness, chemotherapy, or transplant. All stem cell transplant patients are monitored weekly for reactivation, re gardless if they ar e CMV positive or negative. This is done with a blood test called CMV PCR. In stem cell transplant recipients , the antiviral drug ganciclovir or f oscarnet can be given intravenously to treat the reactivation. It will be recommended to continue monitoring f or CMV reactivation for one year after transplant. This can be coordinated with the patient 's referring doctor . Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) Sinusoidal obstructive syndrome is a d isease caused by injury to the liver , which invo lves the partial bl ockage of blood flow through small veins . Congestion results in post -sinusoidal obstruction and liver damage. The cause of this problem is the chemotherapy and/or radiation used to prepare you r child for transplant. High levels of condi tioning therapies a re needed for successful transplant. Such intensive therapy can damage otherwise healthy tissues in addition to its desired effects. The liver is especially susceptible. The signs of SOS are fluid retention, weight gain, and an increase in liver function t est values. Gastrointestinal (GI) problems The chemotherapy and/or radiation used in the high-dose regimen also affect the entire GI tract. These side effects range from mild sore mouth and throat, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea, to more severe forms, which can include inflammation and mucosal breakdown throughout the GI tract. Narcotics are used for pain control, and intravenous nutrition (TPN) is often indicated. These side effects get better with engraftment. Lung problems Your child will be monitor ed closely for signs of any breathing difficulties due to fluid overload, pneumonia, or side effects of chemotherapy or radiation. Daily physical examinations and routin e chest X-rays will be done . Skin problems The skin is a sensitive organ often prone t o some damage from chemo and radiation. These side effects range from a mild redness like a sunburn to red, dry , and peeling skin. 21 Kidney problems Kidneys are organs that produce urine, remove bodily waste, and process some drugs out of the body. Some drugs affect kidney function. Your care team keep s a close watch on your kidney function through blood tests, the careful monitoring of the quantity and quality of urine, and frequent measurement of body weight. These and other factors help gui de them to pre vent and treat kidney problems and help return kidney function to normal. After engraftment As your child's new immune system develop s, the goal is to support his recovery and manage any complications that may arise. Your child's immune s ystem is immature and is still vulnerable to infections. Your child may need infusions of red blood cells or platelets. F luids a nd nutritional support maybe needed until he is eating and drinking enough. It is common to fee l tired during this phase. Even though you r child may feel tired, activity is good . Being active helps prevent some complications. You r child may also feel \"down\" or depressed at times during the recover y period . Your child may grieve because of changes in physical functioning or depend ence on others for care or even changes in relationships with your fami ly members. These are all common reactions to the intense experience of having a transplant. You r child may e xperience decreased concentration at this time. See the sections on Fatigue, Depression, and Memory and Concentration for more information. Progress may seem slow. You child may feel frustrated because they want to get well rapidly . It just takes time to recover. Former patients tell us that they coped by taking one day at a tim e. They found that if they set a simple and realistic goal to achieve each day, it was easier for th em to see the progress . It is helpful talking with staff about what is a realistic goal. As you r child recover s and no longer need s close monitoring and t reatment, the team will help you and your child prepare to leave SCCA and return to th e care of your child's local doctor . Despite t he eager anticipat ion, you and your child may experience separation anxiety as you prepare to leave . Graft -versus -host disease (GVHD) What is acute graft -versus -host disease (GVHD )? GVHD is caused by immune cells from the donor that attack tissues and organs in the patient who has received a transplant. Acute GVHD can occur any time after engraftment, but usu ally begins wi thin the first three to four weeks after transplant. GVHD is often the major problem after bone marrow, cord blood, or bl ood stem cell transplantation. It may affect the skin, liver, stomach, and intestines. After transplant, you r child will take two or three differ ent medicines that suppress the new immune system to prevent acute GVHD. Despite taking these medicines, two ou t of three patients with a related donor and four out of five patients with an unrelated donor develop GVHD and need additional treatme nt. 22 What a re the treatments for acute GVHD ? The usual treatment for GVHD is a steroid called p rednisone (taken by mouth as an outpatient) or methylprednisolone (given by IV as an inpatient). The goal of this treatment is to control symptoms of GVHD. The dose is reduced (tapered) over weeks or months depending on your child's response. We want to limit the number of days that you r child take s high -dose steroids to reduce their risk for serious infections and other side effects. What is mild GVHD? Mild GVHD does not affect the liver. Mild GVHD occurs in 1 out of 3 patients with a related donor and 1 out of 5 with an unrelated donor. Mild GVHD symptoms include: o Rash o Loss of appetite o Nausea o Vomiting o Mild diarrhea What is the treatment for mild GVHD? Mild GVHD of the skin may be self -limiting and not require treatment. Alternatively, it may be treated with ultraviolet light called PUVA or topical cre ams. If it persists, low -dose p rednisone may be used. Mild GVHD of the stomach and intestines can also be t reated with low -dose p rednisone. In this case, doctors migh t add a special steroid called b eclomethasone for the stomach, and another special steroid called b udesonide for the intestines. You may hear these called \"B&B .\" This use of B&B generally allows th e doses of p rednisone to be tapered more quickly. What are the signs of more than mild GVHD? In additio n to the symptoms listed under mild GVHD, symptoms might include: o A more intense, itchy , and inflamed rash o Large amounts of frequent and sometimes bloo dy diarrhea o Abdominal cramping o Liver damage resulting in jaundice (yellow skin, tears, and urine) o This g rade of GVHD occurs in 1 out of 3 patients with a related donor and 3 out of 5 patients with an unrelated donor. What is the treatment for more than mild GVHD? GVHD with more than mild symp toms is treated with high -dose p rednisone. If GVHD does not impro ve, additional trea tment may be needed. High -dose prednisone increases the risk for infections and other complica tions. Whether or not standard p redni sone therapy controls the GVHD, the dose of p rednisone is decreased over weeks or months, depending on your child's response. Failure to e ngraft Failure of the transplanted cells to grow and develop is an uncommon complication. At first, there may be signs of engraftment such as increasing blood counts, but later the blo od counts decrease. Generally, it takes a number of weeks after the transplant to find out the success of the graft. It takes longer for some patients to engraft than others. The production of blood counts is not a steady climb. Blood counts normally fluct uate after transplant. Also, certain medications influence the production of blood cells. 23 If failure to engraft is indeed the diagnosis, then you r child will be offered other therapies. So me treatment plans (research protocols) are focused on just this s ituation and aim to boost the production of blood cells. Other treatment plans invo lve stopping the drugs that interfere with bone marrow function or the infusion of reserve marrow or more s tem cells if available. Transitioning back to SCCA Allogeneic p atients are admitted to Seattle Children's during conditioning. The transition nurse will meet with you and your child to help with plans for discharge from the inpatient unit at Seattle Child ren's . After discharge, SCCA nurses will coordinate your child's care again . Before leaving Seattle Children's , you and your child will r eceive the information and have an opportunity to learn and pr actice the skills to manage care at home. Classes are ta ught demonstrating these ski lls, and all caregivers are welcome to attend any of the classes a second time to \"brush up\" on information or skills. A transition nurse will schedule the first clinic visit before the day of discharge from the inpatient unit. You r child will be scheduled to see your care team at SCCA at least once a week, and other times as needed. This clinic visit in cludes an exam and time for you to share your questions and concerns with staff. Also, on your child's first clinic vis it, you will be given a weekly schedule for clinic times, blood dr aws, and routine chest X- rays. You r child will have a nutrition visit scheduled. You r child may also need to be at SCCA for care other than your scheduled weekly visit. Blood will be drawn at the clinic in the morning, two to seven times a week. Bone marrow aspirations around day 28 and day 80 post -transplant are done by a nurse at the clinic to determine the status of the new marrow. Spinal taps (LPs) may be scheduled to administer therapy to the central nervous system. Intravenous medications, infusions, growth factors, study drugs, and blood product transfu sions are also given in the clinic. Preventing infection Even though your child is well enough to recover at home, his or her immune system is still recovering, and you will need to take precautions to guard against infection. We suggest that you do not socialize with other transplant patients, as a protection to your child. Use common sense to guide your decisio ns. For example, avoid crowds of people. This means that you may go to public places such as restaurants but avoid peak hours. And, of course, wash your hands. Temperature taking Take your child's temperature twice daily, morning and night. Call the clinic or after -hours clinic for a temperature taken by mouth that is greater than or equal to 38.3 C or 100.9 F, or a temperature of 38.0 C 100.4F for that lasts for 1 hour or more . When taking an axillary (under the arm) temperature with children, call if the temperature is 37.9 C or 10 0.3F. Do not take Tylenol\u00ae until you have talked with your child's care team . Report a shaking chill without a fever . Plants and pets Avoid plants. Do not keep fresh flowers and plants in your home. The organisms that may grow in water, dirt, and on pla nts can cause infections . Your child should not clean up after animals . Have your chil d wash his hands if a pet licks them . 24 Other health maintenance activities Daily exercise Regular exercise is important to your child' s recovery. Physical therapy and/or occupational therapy may be ordered. If you r child is taking prednisone (steroids) , your child may need p hysical therapy and/or occupational therapy to maintain muscle strength and function . Sun safety Use sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) 30 w hen outside and apply it to all exposed skin areas. Even if it is not especially sunny out, it is important to protect your child's skin from the sun's rays. Your child's skin is sensitive to the sun for 2 to 3 months after transplant. There is an increase d risk of skin canc er after a transplant, so you r child must continue to us e sunscreen for the rest of his or her life. A GVHD rash appears from sunburn, even from slight overexposure. Symptom management Review the Managing Care at Home section for more information on symptom management . The Quick Reference Guide in the pocket of this manual should be used for referen ce. If in doubt, give us a call. Keep your child's emergency card with you. Readmission Your child may need to be readmitted to the hospita l for management of symptoms that cannot be safely taken care of in the home setting or the clinic. As soon as you r child is medically stable, the medical team will work with a transition nurse to have your care returned to the clinic. Departure Departur e evaluation Before leaving SCCA to go home, you r child will have a series of tests done to detect any chronic graft -versus - host -disease (GVHD). Chronic GVHD usually starts around day 80 after transplant and can be present without causing any obvious probl ems to you. These screening tests can find early signs of GVHD, so if needed, you can receive treatment before further problems develop. These tests are scheduled around day 80 and take about one week to complete, and about 10 working days for the results to be available: Pulmonary function tests Skin biopsy Final bone ma rrow aspiration Blood tests Oral examination The results of these tes ts are evaluated by a doctor who performs a physical exam and will make recommendations for chronic GVHD as you and you r child make the transition to your home. 25 Departure conference and clinic v isit About two weeks after your child' s chro nic GVHD workup is done, your family will have a summary confere nce with the attending physician and nurse. At this conference, you and your child will receive the results of the day 80 work -up and will be given recommendations and/or instructions for continued self -care and monitoring at home. You and your child will also have the opportunity to ask any remaining questions about your condition or your retu rn home. Protocols may be offered for long -term care at home at this conference. Following this conference, you will have one final clinic vis it with your care team . Long -term follow -up departure class After you have l eft the clinic and you are home , the long-term follow -up staff will be a res ource for you , your child , and your child's doctor . They are available during business hours to answer questions and concerns. You will be scheduled to attend the long-term follow -up (LTFU) clas s to learn how to take care of your child during the coming year. Discharge papers Discharge papers consist of a packet of information that we ask you to take with you to give to your child's local physician . They contain a summary of all you r care and re commendations for your further care. These papers will be given to you and your child during your final clinic visit.

You and your child , in turn, may be asked to participate in similar research studies. The result s may benefit your child as well as future patients. By working together, results can be improved. We bel ieve that the goals of patient care, teaching, and research work together for the benefit of patients. How research studies are d eveloped Research studies are first developed by a staff member working in a specialized field of study. A proposal is written and shared among staff members working together, and then among the members of a scientific staff review committee. After review, the research proposal is turned in to the Institutional Review B oard. Their task is to ensure that being in the study is reaso nable in terms of benefits and risks. They also review the written consent form to be sure that it clearly describes what will b e done and the possible risks. Informed c onsent You will be aske d to sign a written consent form for e ach research study in wh ich your child participate s. Your signature indicates that the study has been explained to you, that you understand the risks, that you have had a chance to ask questions, and that you freely ag ree to participate. Consent forms also state that you remain free to withdraw your consent and your child from participating in the research study . Benefits and risks of research It is often a possibility that you r child will personally benefit by partici pating in research studies. There is also the possibility that your child will not benefit or that a harmful reaction may occur. Some studies involve assigning patients to a treatment by a process called \"randomization.\" This means that treatment will be decided by random computer selection. This is often done when i t is not known whether one treatment is better than another. Comparisons are often made between a \"new\" treatment and a \"standard\" treatment. Randomization is a way to avoid any bias that might influence results of the comparison. It increases the confiden ce that any differences seen between groups reflect the effect of the treatment rather than other factors. You may feel uncomfortable about having aspects of your treatment decided by random com puter selection. You might believe that the \"new\" treatment is likely to be better than the \"standard\" treatment, or you might be concerned that the \"new\" treatment may increase the chance of side effects. For either of these reasons, you may prefer to cho ose one treatment or the other. These feelings are understanda ble; however, we hope you will understand that there is no factual basis for any preference between treatments in this situation. If there were, we would not need to do a research study to find out which treatment is actually better. Long -term participati on in research Being involved in research will likely extend beyond your child's stay at SCCA , especially if you r child has problems that need ongoing treatment. We are able to carry on thi s research by working with her doctor . You and your child may be as ked to return for a periodic check -up. Research results Information gained from research studies is reported at scientific meetings and published in medical journals. In this way, we are able to share results with other professionals. 40 Confidentiality Patient confidentiality is always protected. Names and initials ar e not disclosed in any report. Records are kept locked and access is limited to authorized staff. Questions about research Care is taken to ensure that your child's treatment is not endangered by participation in research. If you have concerns about being in any research study, we hope that you will feel free to ask questions. Your child's continued participation remains essenti al, and we are grateful for your willingness to work with us. If you would like to know more about clinical research, please ask your care team . Financial interest in medical research Medical researchers occasionally have financial relationships with priv ate industry, such as: Owning shares of stock Serving on advisory bo ards or consulting for companies Receiving consulting fees and payments A medical researcher who has such an interest or relationship is required to disclose it. Institutions carefully review these disclosures. Decisions are made as to whether the study c an be carried out by the medical researchers and whether the personal financial interests and relationships can continue. We do this to safeguard patients and the integrity of the medical research. Connection with private industry For many years, medical researchers and private industry have worked together to study ideas that might become useful to science and patients. Drug companies and biotechnology firms sometimes pay for medical research studies. This financial support can lead to new ways to preven t, diagnose, and treat illness. Our commitment to your child SCCA and its member institutions are committed to protecting the rights and well -being of participants who volunteer for medical research studies. SCCA's member institutions have policies and p rocedures for the disclosure, review, and management of the financial interests and relationships between medical researchers and private industry. If you wish to learn more about policies and procedures Each member institution has its own methods for rev iew of financial relationships and interests. If you wish to learn more about these policies and procedures, you may contact the resources listed here.

The hospital is located at 4 800 Sand Point Way N.E., Seattle, WA 98105. This is in northeast Seattle near the University of Washington. Seattle Children's provides care for bone marrow transplant and other canc er patients on Forest 7 (200/300 wing) and Forest 8 (300 wing), the SCCA p atient -care unit. Your child's care Part of your child's treatment plan includes receiving care at Seattle Children's and Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. You may notice some differen ces between how your providers at Seattle Children's and SCCA perform some clinical tasks. Practices at both organizations are correct for the different settings and safe for your child. We want to make sure you're comfortable with your care at both locati ons. Your child's safety is always our top priority. Admissio n to the inpatient unit When you arrive at the SCCA , our staff will automatically pre -register your child at Seattle Children's so admission will be smooth. If your child's admission to Seattle Children's inpatient unit is scheduled in advance, you will be given the time and date t o go to the hospital by the clinic staff. Outpatients may develop symptoms that require hospitalization. Your SCCA care team can coordinate these admissions at any tim e. Remember to bring wall decorations from home and toys/games. Patients of all ages can bring their cell phones, tablets, and laptops to keep in touch with family and friends at home. Seattle Children's offers interpreter services for deaf, hard of hearin g, or non -English speaking families. To request these services, ask your child's care team , or you can find their contact number in the important numbers section of this manual. If the hospita lized infant is less than 120 days old, bed sharing is not reco mmended. It is recommended for the infant to be placed on a \"bassinet\" style sleep surface, if available, next to the parent's couch. If airway support equipment cannot be safely used in the ba ssinet sleeper, this option should not be used. A crib should remain in the room for infant assessment. Contacting the unit Please see lists of numbers for contacting the unit in the important numbers section of this manual.

For more information please call the number listed in the important numbers section of this manual. Caregivers need to take breaks and care for thems elves in order to con tinue to care for their child. 46 Your child's daily routine You may wonder what the normal routine day is like for your child in the inpatient unit at Seattle Children's. Rememb er, there is still time to play, when you r child is feeli ng up to it. What procedures are often done? What tests are usually ru n? What rout ine activities will be a part of everyday life on the unit? Routines will be explained in more detail by the inpatient nurse, but in the meantime , here is an overview of what you can expect . Rounds Every morning the physician and other members o f your child's care team will round with each child and family. This is to check on your child's progress and to make changes in therapy if needed. This is a good time to ask any quest ions you or your child may have and to discuss the plan of care. You can ask th e day nurse what time rounds are in the morning. Physical examinations The nurse and doctor will, at different times, need to listen to your child's heart a nd lungs with the stethoscope. They press lightly and listen to his abdomen with a stethoscope to check for sounds indicating normal functioning of the stomach and intestines. The nurse will look at your child's mouth daily and more frequently during the period he is likely to experience mucositis, an inflammation of the mouth. Routine blood tests Early morning, from 4 to 6 am, the nurses will draw daily routine blood tests f rom your child's central line. We will disturb you and your child as little as possible, but our medi cal team needs to review the laboratory findings as early in the day as possible. Vital signs Your child's temperature, pulse, respiration , and blood pressure, all of which we call \"vital signs \", will be taken every four hours as a standard so as not to a llow too much time to lapse before we see any cha nge in your child's con dition. Sometimes they are taken more often if we need to monitor her more closely. Daily weight A daily morning weight check is important to monitor the amount of fluid in your child 's body. Occasionally, she may need to have her weight checked twice per day. Chest X -rays Chest X -rays to check your child's lungs are done weekly , or more frequently, depending on your child's health. Medications and IV fluids Many medications such as antibiotics, anti-nausea medications, or medications to prevent graft -versus -host - disease will be g iven through the central line. Other fluids will also be given when your child cannot drink to help keep up fluid intake. Parents may give oral medicine to t heir child only afte r being instructed by a nurse. 47 Getting help from a nurse Please use the nurse call button for help if an alarm rings in the patient's room. Your child will have medications and fluid running on infusion pumps. These pumps have alar ms that will beep fo r various reasons. Family members should not correct the pump alarms. Transfusions Blood and platelet transfusions will be given to your child as needed until she is able to make her own blood cells. Blood counts will be checked ever y morning. Nutrition Dietitians will talk to you and your child abou t his food likes and dislikes. Patients who are not able to eat are given total parenteral nutrition (TPN), also kn own as hyperalimentation (HA). This goes through the central line and has no taste. Recording intake and output If you give your child food, water, or ice, notify the nurse of the amount given. It is important to kee p accurate records of fluid intake and output. Therefore, never empty a urinal, bedpan , or emesis (vomit) basin. Your child's nurse will do that for you. Exercise It may be harder for your child to participate in exercise and activities during the transplant process. It is important for your child to keep moving during this time. Physical and occupational therapis ts wil l provide exercises to help improve your child's strength, mobility, and function. They will also give you ideas for how to keep your child active while they're in the hospital. Bathing, showers, and oral care Daily baths are taken to help cleanse the bo dy of bacteria. This may help lower the chance of infection. Mouth care is also an imp ortant part of the transplant. We will encourage your child to do rinses with mild salt water called \"normal saline\" to help remove bacteria and promote healing. Th ere's a shower in each room that patients and families can use. Coordinate with your nurse to sign up for a bathroom time to use a bath tub. Central line care The central line dressing will be changed as necessary to g uard against bacterial growth. This gives the nurse a chance to inspect the skin around the central line. Nurses will check under the dressing at other times as well. Making the transition to recovery at home A transition nurse will meet with you and you r child to help with plans for disc harge from the inpatient unit at Seattle Children's . Care will then be coordinated by the care team at SCCA until your child is discharged from care to return home . This is the same care team that prepared your child for transplant and monitored the progres s of his therapy until he was admitted to the inpatient unit. 48 Visitor guidelines Open visiting hours Parents may be wi th their child 24 hours a day. Visiting hours f or siblings and others are 10 a m to 8 pm. We encourage families to keep their own he alth in mind an d to get a good night's sleep. One parent/legal guardian may stay at the bedside overnight. Siblings and other visitors may not s tay overnight in the hospital. A nurse will contact family members at home if any problem occurs. Siblings Children are important members of a family, and we encourage them to visit during their hospital stay. These guidelines are for brothers, sisters , and other child or teen visitors: Wash their hands like any other visitor. Those who are ill or might be ill are not allowed to visit. Those who have been exposed to chickenpox and who have not had chicken pox before are not allowed to visit. Those who have received live -virus oral polio vaccination cannot have contact with the patient for at least 6 weeks. If a ch ild needs polio vaccination, the inactivated polio vaccine can be given by injection. May not go into the room of another patient. Children under 10 years old must be with an adult when playing in the family room or teen room. Toys from the family room may not be taken into the patient's room. The hallway is not a play area for children. Children are not allowed to play with hospital equipment such as wheelchairs and stretchers. Receiving mail at Seattle Children's Friends and relatives may send mail to yo ur child by addressing it to the following: Your Child's Name Hematology/Oncology Unit WA 98105 -0371 Local phone number Family members should make sure that the unit coordinator has their correct phone number on file for emergency use. 49 Preventing infection Patients and family members are not allowed to visit other patient rooms. Th is helps to pr event the spread of infection. Patients are encouraged to walk around the patient care unit, but should avoid other pat ients, their families and the areas where people gather. Family members or other visitors should not use the bat hrooms in the patient's rooms. There is a danger of infections both to t he patient and to the visitor. Public restrooms are located on all nursi ng units. Keep surfaces clear of patient/family belongings. Some organisms can survive a long time on the surfaces and eq uipment in the patient's room. It is very important that these surfaces be cleaned daily by Environmental Services (ES). The ES staff c lean s bed rails and other items close to the pati ent if the patient is present. To help them do a complete cleaning, plea se leave the room if possible. Taking a shower, a walk , or sitting in a chair are options. Minimize the number of personal belongings i n the room. We encourage patients to have cards and pictures posted on the wall of th eir room. Other items should be placed in the patient's bedside cabinet. Family members can help by taking items sent to the patient by other family members and friends ba ck to the home or apartment shortly after the patient sees them. Clean or wash the patient's personal belon gings. Environmental Services staff do es not clean patient's personal belongings. Daily, a family member or friend should wipe off the patient's pers onal belongings , toys, and play activities provided by the hospital, with a cloth or paper towel dampened with soap and water. Hospital toys can also be put in the waiting roo m to be cleaned by volunteers. Items such as clothing or quilts should be washed periodically or when they become soiled. Here are a few reminders of procedures that also prevent the spre ad of infection: Place used tissue in the trash can , not on other surfaces suc h as the bedside table or floor . If you have a son who is using a urina l, please place it on the floor , not on the bed rail or on the bedside tabl e or bedside cabinet. Please ask for help if you are not able to put it on the floor safely. You and your child need to wash hands frequently , before eating and aft er using the bath room or urinal . Summary of infection control concerns It can take a s much as a year for the infection -fighting immune system to get back to normal. It is important to make the steps in preventing infection a part of daily life. Germs and bacteria , which c an cause infection, are present everywhere in the environment , as we ll as on and in a per son's body. Even when careful attention is paid to infection prevention procedures, it may not be possible to prevent infection duri ng the entire recovery period. Be sure to seek medical care at the first sign of infection so treatment can be started early. Any family member or visitor who has a fever or cold, or who is not feeling well, should not come to visit the patient. Even minor colds and infection s carry a risk to the patient. Children, in particular, are known to get many viru ses. Please evaluate the health of children, and their exposure to other children that may have been ill, before letting th em come to the inpatient unit. If a family member needs to see a doctor, ask your nurse for a referral. Handwashing is the single mo st effective way to prevent the spread of infection. Before entering and when leaving a patient's room, everyone is expected to follow a simple but thorough handwashing procedure. 50 What t o bring from home Bring wall decorations and your child's favorite toys and games. Patients of all ages can bring their cell phones, tablets, and laptops to keep in touch with family and friends at home . Service dogs, therapy dogs, and p ets Healthcare fa cilities and other places that serve the public must allow people with disabili ties to be accompanied by their service dogs. At SCCA, service dogs can accompany handlers in all areas of the clinic, except for in rooms where invasive procedures and imaging take place. A service dog is a dog that is individually trained for the purpose of assisting or accompanying a disabled person's sensory, mental, or physical disability. The special training service dogs receive is more than obedience training or positi ve reinforcem ents that are given to family pets. Service dog handlers are protected under the ADA because of the disability the handler experiences. A therapy dog is trained to provide affection and comfort to people. A therapy dog's primary job is to al low people (who may or may not have disabilities) to make physical contact with it and enjoy that contact. Although the emotional benefits of therapy dogs are significant, physical contact to the dog is an infection concern in cancer centers that serve pa tients with weakened immune systems. This is one of the reasons why SCCA does not allow therapy dogs, other therapy animals, or pets. Please do not b ring therapy dogs, therapy animals , or pets to the clinic. Fresh flowers and plants Fresh flowers and plants are not allowed in your child's room. There are organisms that grow on them and in their dirt or wate r, which can cause infections. Mylar ballo ons and silk flowers are okay. Latex balloons are not allowed at Children's Hospital. Money and v aluables Money and valuables should not be left in your child's room or the family room because of the risk of theft. There is a safe box in each room that you can access with your chosen code. Family space/ kitchen All who use these areas must help to keep them clean. There are two family spaces, one quiet space and one play area for siblings by the unit c oordination desk . Transplant patients cannot use these areas because of infection concerns. If you bring food into the Family Space, please clean up food items before leaving the area. You are encouraged to use this as a quiet space for reading, conversation, and other relaxing activities. Each patient room has a small refrigerator. Items that need to be in the freezer can be placed in the family room's freezer l abeled with your child's name. Teen Space -3B Teen Space is a hang -out fo r siblings 12 to 21 years of age. Adults must be accompanied by their teenager. If you have any questions , call Child Life at x3646. Please f ollow these infection control guidelines: Wash your hands as you enter the room . The n earest s ink is in the Family/Play Space . If you are ill, please do not enter the Teen Space. Please place any games, craft materials, and other items that get soiled into the \"Clean Me\" bin! If it's sneezed on, coughed on, or has come into contact with any bodily substances , it qu alifies for the \"Clean Me\" bin. Please do not bring food into the Teen Space. You can eat in the Family/Play space. 51 Chapter 3 - Managing Care at Home \"There are only four kin ds of people in this world: Those who have been caregivers Those who are currently caregivers Those who will be caregivers Those who will need caregivers\" -Quote from Rosalynn Carter's colleague Rosalynn Carter's book Helping Yourself Help Others begins with the above quote. Education and support have been developed to meet the needs of you r child and family caregiver s. Weekly group classes, videos, individualized ins truction, and written materials are offered . Support is offered by team members including nursing, social work, and spiritual health . Please review the next two sections for details of caregiving. 52 53 Suggestions for coping with care at home Ask qu estions . If you are not sure, call using the important phone numbers provided . Remember that yo u and your child are member s of the team, and your input is important. Keep your nurse and doctor informed. Review the symptom sheets provided and call for help if needed . Review hints for self -care. Ask your family and friends for help before you are too fatigued. Keep a list of what friends can do, and dele gate. For example, one person could make a meal and another could go to the grocery store. Some people have more time than others; this is where your list would be helpful. Organize the day into manage able segments. Develop a schedule each day and week. This process allows family memb ers or friends to be in agreement with the goals for the day or week. If everyone is working with the same agenda in mind, the tension within a family usually decreases. Remember, the staff a t SCCA is here to support you as well. Tell your care team, including your social workers, if you need more support. Use websites to keep family and friends informed: www.caringbridge.com or www.carepages.com Outline of typical caregiver responsibilities Making arrangements: Transportation . Financial . Tracking appointments . Giving emotional support: Being physically present . Giving encouragement . Providing physical care: Identifying changes in patient's condition . Reporting patient's symptoms to healthcare staff . Obtaining medical care if needed . Monitoring patient compliance in self -administration of oral medications . Recording medications taken/adm inistered . Acquiring and maintaining medical supplies . Performing tasks such as central line care . Administering fluids and medications using an intravenous pump . Maintaining the home environment: Cleaning . Food preparation . Shopping . Patient advocacy : Gathering information and assuring that perti nent information is given to medical staff . Helping with decision -making . 54 Providing assistance and support to others: Serving as a communication link with other family members or friends . Imparting information t o children . Providing child care . Taking care of the caregiver Caregivers are encouraged to take care of themselves through exercise, proper diet, and adequate sleep. Caregivers benef it from breaks. Caregivers are at risk for becoming ill if they ignore their own health. Here are some he lpful tips from Rosalynn Carter's book about caregiving , Helping Yourself Help Others : Listen to your friends. Be open to others' observations. Let go. Know your limits. Focus on your loved ones' strengths. Learn relaxat ion techniques. Take care of your he alth. Maintain a life outside your caregiving role. Insist on private time. Build a caregiving team. Rely on your sense of humor. Appreciate the benefits of leisure time. Help your loved one find a support group. Seek pr ofessional help. Appreciate your own efforts. Seek spiritual renewal. Develop a plan of care The nursing staff will work with you to develop a unique home care plan. You and your child have a nurse available 24 hours a day to a nswer questions. Other fami ly members and friends can help during different stages of transplant with various tasks. Caregiver s need to develop a schedule and division of tasks tha t is satisfactory to all . Your child can particip ate in self -care, as long as they feel well enoug h to do so. Other adult family members can learn to operate the ambulatory pump. When a differen t person takes over line care, they should review the steps with a nurse. The home care plan should meet safety needs. The following recommendations give an i dea o f the different levels of caregiving needed throughout the tr ansplant and recovery process. Each patient and family organizes their routines different ly. Some patients and families like to keep a logbook of activities, infusions, and medications. Plea se se e the example s of a home care schedule at the end of the manual . Recommendations for caregiver support We hope these recommendations will assist families in anticipating the need for caregiver support. N eeds change throughout the transplant process. 55 Clinic phases and support levels: Young children need consistent support on an ongoing basis. Older chil dren in late teens and young adults may reach a point when intermittent or minimal supports are appropriate. Consistent suppor t: Caregiver is present m ost of the time; breaks should be less than three to four hours. Adult patients, but not children, can be left alone if they have access to the phone, the ability to contact emergency services, operate ambulatory pumps, get to the restroom, and have access to food and fluids . Criteria for recommending a consistent caregiver for the patient are : During conditioning (including Dilantin \u00ae administration), chemotherapy, and radiation therapy First 1 to 2 weeks in at SCCA after initial discharge from the hospital after transplant Three different IV infusions such as hydration, medications, or parente ral nutrition (PN or TPN) over a 24 -hour period Neutropenia (ANC < 500) Altered mental status: drowsy, confused, impaired judgment, poor memory Weakness/limited mobil ity (cannot walk without assistance) Sliding scale insulin (when starting therapy) Interm ittent support: Does not need a caregiver for the majority of hours within a 24 -hour period. A caregiver is availa ble 2 to 3 times per day to provide assistance with d ressing changes, medications, transportation, and processing information provided during conferences or clinic visits. Minimal support: Patients do not require a caregiver but do benefit from emotional support during clinic visits and conferences. Patient and caregiver education Patient and Caregiver Education is an integral part of treatment and services offered. Informational, educational, and support services are available to patients, family members, and caregivers. You have the right to information re garding health status, di sease, treatment options, the treatment process, managing and monitoring health in the home setting, and maintaining health after treatment. Patient and caregiver education has three major components: Individual teaching Classes Videos Videos and some classes are online at youtube.com/c/SCCAPatientEducation . Individual teaching is offered on topics such as care of the central line, medications, blood glucose monitor ing, and specific needs that may arise during the treatment and recovery process. Educational classes focus on gaining an understanding about the treatment process and developing the skills needed for the patient's treatment, and recovery in the home setti ng. 56 Class descriptions Classes are scheduled by the clinical support staff. A personalized list of appointments and scheduled classes is placed in your patient mailbox. Managing care at home and review of transplant p rocess This class includes an overview of the bone marrow/ stem cell transplant process, review of the patient/caregiver role and resources and how to prevent infection. Content of this class includes managing symptoms , emergency plan development (mucositis, dehyd ration, diarrhea, bleed ing, and breathing problems) , and adjusting to re covery at home. Food s afety The content of this lecture and discussion class includes the rationale for food safety, foods to omit, safe food selection, and proper food handling techniques including cooki ng, preparation, and storage. Long -term recovery class Information on how to manage care after leaving the Center is presented. Content includes immune system recovery, assessing symptoms, treatment of graft -versus -host d isease, guidelines for daily livin g, and coping with the common psychological reactions after transplant. Guidelines for preventing infection What is an infection? Infections are caused by germs , which are also call ed microorganisms or microbes. Germs cause illness by entering the body a nd multiplying. T ypical germs that can infect transplant patients are bacteria, viruses, and fungi (molds and yeast). During transplant , your child's immune system will be weak, so he or she will be at a higher risk for getting infections. Infections aft er transplant are more serious than in those peo ple who are otherwise healthy. It is critical to limit exposures to sources that might increase your child's risk for acquiring an infection, and to seek help when you r child develop s infectious symptoms. Whi le it is not possible to prevent all infections, there are a number of simple steps th at you and your child can take to help p revent many common infections. While this section cannot cover all scenarios or possible situations, it includes basic information on how to prevent infections during your child's transplant. Clean your hands often Cleaning your hands is one of the be st ways to prevent infections. Hand hygiene is key, especially during the first year after your child's transplant and/or while he or she is taking immunosuppressive medicines (medicine that weakens the immune system). You, your child, and anyone you com e into contact with, including all members of your household, your doctors, and nurses, should cle an their hands frequently. Do not be afraid to ask visitors or healthcare staff if they cleaned their hands before they meet with you. 57 There are two op tions for cleaning hands. Standard washing with soap and water is a great way to clean your hands. Alcohol h and sanitizer (hand gel such as Purell \u00ae) is another good way to reduce the number of germs on yo ur hands. For home use, be sure to select a hand san itizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Hand sanitizers are not as effective when hand s are visibly dirty or greasy. Also, keep in mi nd that these hand sanitizers do not prevent some gastrointestinal infections, such as C. diff and noro virus. P ersons wi th these infections and their caregivers should wash their hands with soap and water instead. At SCCA, Seattle Children's, and UW Medica l Center, hand sanitizer is located in elevator lobbies, waiting rooms, and exam rooms. Please use hand gel frequently . Keep nails short. Germs like to hide under fingernails. Avoid the use of artificial nails. When should you clean hands? It is importa nt for all family members to clean hands frequently throughout the day, particularly when you are in public places ( SCCA, Seattle Children's , restaurants, shopping, comm on areas, and waiting rooms ). Some specific times that are important to make sure you c lean your hands: Before eating . Before and after preparing food . After touching pets or animals . After sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose . After going outdoors . Before and after any central ven ous catheter care or intravenous infusions . Before taking oral medicines . Before entering and leaving an exam room . Before entering and leaving SCCA or Seattle Children's . Before and after getting on a shuttle . How to wash hands with soap and water It may sound a bit funny , but washing yo ur hands proper ly is important. Read through the steps and practice them . Make this process a habit. Wet your hands with warm water and apply soap. Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Be s ure to lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails. Scrub your hands for 15 to 20 seconds \u2014about the time it takes to hum the \"Happy Birthday \" song from beginning to end twice. Rinse your hands with water. Dry your hands with a clean or disposable towel or air dryer. If possible, use a towel to turn off the faucet. How to apply hand sanitizer ( hand gel) Apply one to two pumps of hand sanitizer to the palm of one hand. Rub your hands together. Rub the product over all surfaces of your hands and fin gers until your hands are dry. Make su re you get the product between your fingers and on the back of your han ds. 58 Cleaning At least once a week and as needed, clean the kitchen and bathroom with a bleach solution. Make the solution daily with one part bleach to ten parts water. The solution needs to be made daily to make sure that the bleach solution is effecti ve. You can also buy a pre -made bleach solution, such as \"Clean -Up Cleaner with Bleach\" spray made by Clorox\u00ae. Key kitchen areas to clean are : Sinks, which can be very dirty because g rime and mold often stick to their surfaces Faucets and faucet handles Countertops Cutting boards Refrigerator and microwave handles Stovetops All areas that hands have touched or where food has been prepped Personal hygiene Personal hygiene is necessary to help prevent infection. You r child may shower or bathe daily , as long as you don't submerge his or her centr al venous catheter under water. Details on central line care are provided later in this manual . Cover the line as instructed. Daily cleansing wit h soap and water is the first line of defense against bacteria on the skin. Ill family members Your child should not be in the same home as an ill family member. Dental care To prevent infection, daily or al (mouth) care is needed . Keep your child's mou th clean by brushing his or her teeth twice each day with toothpaste. Ask your doctor or nurse if it's okay to gently floss their teeth. Tell them if your child's gums bleed or if he has new sores in his mout h. You r nurse may give you a special mouthw ash t o help clean your child's mouth. Most patients who are going through a transplant see a dental sp ecialist; ask them any questions you have about your child's dental hardware (de ntures, bridges, retainers) or issues you have with oral care. Safe eating Both how you prepare your food and what you eat play a role in keeping you healthy. Your doctor and dietitian may recommend a special diet to follow depending on your child's situation . You r child might need more protein or calories or might need to avoid cer tain foods. Follow that diet and these other tips to prevent infections: Do not allow your child to share cups, glasses, or eating utensils with other people. Cook food thoroughly. Leftovers s hould be stored in small containers and refrigerated within 2 h ours of cooking. Reheat leftovers thoroughly. Keep food at its proper temperature. Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Avoid salad bars, buffets, deli counters, and food in bulk bins (if not cooked) . Follow recommendations and check the guidelines fo r dietary restrictions. Ask your nutritionist questions if you don't know if something you r child is eating is safe. Keep foods fresh and buy in small amounts to avoid spoilage and mold contami nation if possible. Do not allow your child to eat or drink foo ds that are beyond their expiration date. 59 Prevent infection by having your child avoid the following: Certain activities: Avoid activities such as gardening, raking, mowing, farming, or direct contact with soil and plants. These activities create plant or soil aerosols which increases e xposure to fungi and bacteria. Potted plants should be avoided. You child should avoid working in green hous es or managing plants at home. Flowers and plants: Ask friends and visitors to avoid bringing fresh flowers and pott ed plants as gifts following your child's transplant. The organisms that may grow in water, dirt, and on plants can cause infections. After the immediate post -transplant period, you may have plants in your home, but you are discouraged from allowing your child to touch them. People who have respiratory illnes ses (cough, cold, and other illness ): Be especially careful around school -aged children and those that attend daycare, since they are often exposed to other children who are ill. Should not be in the same home as someone with a respiratory virus . Avoid cr owded areas where you are unable to control the d istance between you and others, such as at movie theaters or sporting events . Construction sites, including homes or buildings that are being repaired or remodeled. These dusty environments increase your ex posure to molds. Tobacco and marijuana use. The use of these substances, along with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (second -hand smoke), increases your risk for bacterial and fungal infections . Wood-burning fireplaces, because wood contains fungus. If a wood stove is your only source of heat, have someone else touch the wood and manage the fire. House cleaning that will disturb dust and mold, causing it to be stirred up in the air (such as va cuum cleaning, dusting , and scrubbin g down showers). If cleaning needs to be done, it is best to clean when you are not in the home and use a wet washcloths or wipes as they capture dust. Do not use feather dusters. Once you have the energy, it is not harm ful to iron, wash clothes, dry cloth es, and wash dishes. Use of room humidifier because of bacteria that live in water. If you like to use air conditioners (AC) and fans during warm weather, they should be cared for properly as they can bring dust and mo ld in to your home. Regular inspectio n and cleani ng of the AC unit is critical. AC Filters should be changed regularly per manufacturer recommendations. Swimming in recreational water such as ponds, swimming pools, lakes, whirlpools, and hot tubs. Changing a baby's diaper. Touching bird drop pings. Cleaning a fish tank. Emptying and cleaning litter boxes. Cleaning up after pets. Your child may feel \"safer \" wearing a mask when they are outside, but they are not required to wear a mask when they go o ut. This i s a personal choice. If you r child choose s to wear a mask, they should still avoid situations as described above. 60 Prevent infections spread from animals Have your child wash their h ands immediately after petting their animals. It is not necessary to part with pets. Your child should delegate the majority of pet care to other family members or friends. It is important to minimize direct contact with animals, especially animals that ar e ill, and avoid getting any ne w pets during your child's transplant. Do not allow your child to sleep with pets. If you have a cat, do not place the litter box in kitchens, dining rooms, or other areas where food preparation and eating occur. H ave someone else handle the daily litter box cleaning during the first year aft er transplant and when you r child is on immuno suppressive medicines . This will reduce your child's risk of acquiring toxoplasmosis, a parasitic disease. K eep your cats inside and do not adopt or handle stray cats. It is recommended to avoid contact with r eptiles ( turtles, snakes, lizards), ducklings, or chicks to prevent exposure to bacteria called salmonella. If you have other pets, please discuss this with your team. Vaccinations It is beneficial for family members and household contacts to be vaccinate d to prevent exposure to vaccine - preventable d iseases. Recommended vaccines help to prevent important diseases such influenza (flu), pertussis (whooping cough), measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, tetanus, diphtheria, and pneumococcal. Have your family m embers, caregivers , and close contacts see their doctors to make sure they are up to date on all of t he recommended adult vaccines. Children should also be up to date on all childhood vaccines. Some vaccines, such as MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), (Zostavax\u00ae) vacc ines are live -virus vaccines. It is often safe for persons in your household to receive these , but make sure you discuss the timing of these vaccinations for your family members wi th your child's care team . Some of these live vaccines pose a very small risk of household transmission, so if a family or household member develops a rash after receiving the chicken pox or shingles vaccine , notif y your doctor or nurse . It is very important that family members and household contacts receive the flu (influenza) shot every year. The flu vaccine is the best wa y to prevent the flu. SCCA offer s the flu vaccine to family and household contacts. If your family or household contacts opt to receive the nasal spray flu va ccine (Flumist \u00ae), have your child avoid contact with that person for five days , as the nasal spray vaccine contains a weakened live fl u virus that could spread to you r child . Recent outbreaks of pertussis have been seen throughout the U .S., including Was hington State. Due to the risk of pertussis (also known as whoo ping cough) in transplant patients, make sure that your family, caregivers , and visitors chec k with their doctor to see if they are up to date on this vaccine (also known as Tdap - tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis ). Be sure to notify your team i f you have been exposed to an infection, if your caregiver or family member is ill, or if they have recently been diagnosed with an infection . 61 How does the clinic work to prevent infections? Infection prevention is a very high priority at SCCA and a foundation of preventing major post -transplant complications. All in fections cannot be avoided, but here are some of the steps taken in order to ensure that your child receive s care in a safe envir onment : All staff cleans their hands while performing patient care. If you would like to confirm that the staff caring for you r child has cleaned their hands, we encourage you to ask them. Staff know that we all need to work t ogether to prevent infections. By asking, you are helping us maintain a high standard of care. Isolation precautions are used as a way of stopping the spread of germs from one p erson to another. Your child may be placed on isolation if he or she has an infection that can be transmitt ed or harmful to other people. If you r child is in isolation, staff will take extra precautions to ensure t hat those germs do not spread. Staff may p lace you r child in an exam room right away, clean their hands more often, and wear protective equipment, like gowns, gloves, and masks. If you r child is in isolation , make sure to remind staff when you arrive at SCCA or are admitted to the hospital. We tak e cold and flu s eason very seriously . When you check -in for your appointments, at certain times of the year you and your family or caregiver may be asked if you have cold or flu sympto ms like a cough or runny nose. If you do not have symptoms of cold or fl u, you will be given a sticker to wear that indicate s that you have been screened. If you have symptoms, you will be given a mask to wear and you will be placed in isolation to prevent the spread of cold and flu viruses. You may notice patients wearing mas ks. Patients with cold and flu symptoms are encouraged to wear a mask while walking through SCCA . This helps to prevent the spread of cold and flu viruses. If you have a cold or the flu, it is especially important that you r child avoid riding any of the s huttles . Let your team know and your nurse will give you taxicab vouchers to use until your cold and flu symptoms go away. The flu vaccine is provided to caregivers and household members of transplant patients . Information about flu va ccine clinics are posted starting in October year ly.

Anemia Just the facts Red blood cells carry oxygen to the tissues of the body. Hemoglobin and hematocrit are the tests used to evaluate the red blood c ell count. When these measures are low, your body tissues do not get e nough oxygen to do their work. If red blood cells are low, this condition is called anemia. Your goals Recognize your child's symptoms early. Get professional help when needed. Import ant signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a doctor or nurse during clinic hours today. Dizziness . Shortness of breath . Unusually tired or weak . Pounding head or ringing in your child's ears . What your child can do at home Get plenty of sleep. Save energy by resting between short periods of activity. To avoid getting dizzy , your child should move slowly when getting up from a lying position and s it up for several minutes before standing. Information adapted from: Pha rmacia and Upjohn Company 63 Anxiety Just the facts It is very common for a person to feel anxious when facing a new or stressful situation. We all feel worried at times in our day -to-day lives. You r child may experience anxiety as nervousness, tension, panic, fear , or feeling like something bad is going to happen. Anxiety can also be experienced as physical symptoms such as upset stomach, sweaty palms, and fast heartbeat, shaking or flushed face. Although it is normal to feel anxious when facing a life -threatening illness and intensive treatment , there are things that may help dec rease the feelings of anxiety. The goal is to reduce anxiety, not eliminate all anxiety. Goals Learn how to cope with anxiety. Get professional help when needed. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a docto r or nurse during clinic hours today. Feelings of dread and apprehension for several days. Physical symptoms such as sweaty palms, shaking, rapid heartbeat, etc. Keep in mind that these symptoms can be side effects of treatment. Wide mood swings that you c annot control.

Get professional help when needed If anxi ety doesn't improve despite efforts to reduce it, discuss it with your doctor, nurse , or social worker. 64 Bleeding Just the facts Chemotherapy slow s the production of platelets. Platelets help the blood to clot and stop f lowing if there is an injury. Bleeding problems can be trigge red by certain medications, injuries, vigorous exercise, or deep massage when y our child' platelet count is low. Goals Prevent bleeding. Control bleeding if it starts. Call fo r professional he lp when needed. Emergency signs and symptoms Call 911 immediately if: Uncontrolled, constant bleeding. Patient is unconscious. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the after -hours clinic now if: New or increased bleeding or bruising. Bloody urin e. Little red or purple spots on the skin . Unable to stop nosebleed . Bloody diarrhea. Vomiting of blood. Patient falls or is injured. One or more feminine pads per hour are used. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a doctor or nurse during cli nic hours today. Little red or purple spots on the skin or in the mouth. New bruising. What you can do at home for your child Prevent bleeding Do not take or give over -the-counter medications without first consulting your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. Cert ain medications can increase your child's risk of bleeding. Do not take aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen (Aleve\u00ae), Alka -Seltzer\u00ae, or cold remedies containing these drugs. T alk to your doctor or nu rse before giving your child any over -the-counter medications. This is only a partial list of medications that can affect your child's platelets. Take blood pressure medications as ordered; high blood pressure can trigger bleeding. Use a soft bristle tooth brush. Do not use razorblades; use electric razors for shaving. Use caution to avoid falls . No vigorous exercise; follow activity guidelines from physical therapist or doctor. 65 Do not engage in deep massage. Do not blow nose hard or scratch inside of nose. Women who are menstruating should use pads, not tampons. Women a re not to resume sexual intercourse if they have experienced breakthrough bleeding (any vaginal bleeding) within 2 weeks. No anal sex until platelets are stable. No rectal insertion of s uppositories, enemas, or thermometers. Control bleeding if it starts Apply pressure to the bleeding site. For example, for a nosebleed, press the nostrils together firmly with the fingers. Or wrap ice in a soft cloth and press it firmly against the nostrils . Hold pressure on bleeding site for a full 5 minutes before checkin g to see if bleeding has stopped. Remain calm. Call for professional help when needed If a nosebleed doesn't stop after 30 minutes of applying pressure, contact your care team . When transporting a patient with a bleeding problem, keep pressure on the blee ding site. Keep the patient quiet and minimize activity. 66 Body image changes Just the facts Treatment can affect your child's body and life in ways that ma y be hard on your child's self-esteem. Weight loss or gain, loss of stamina, skin reactions, and a puffy face - all of these can be distressing if you r child think s of their body as being who they are. Fortunately, most of the side effects of therapy, which affect appearance and stamina, are temporary. The first step in coping with body changes is to direct your child's energy and thoughts toward what they can contro l. Paying attention to skin care, diet, exercise, and positive attitudes are healthy ways to cope with body image changes. Finding ways for your child to express his or her feelings about t he changes is very important. Goals Maintain a confident and positive self -image. Take care of skin. Build stamina with exercise. Wear attractive and comfortable clothing. Get professional help if needed. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms t o a doctor or nurse during clinic hours today. Feeling or acting very sad most of the day, very angry, or losin g interest in life because of body changes. Not taking care of self (not exercising, dressing, or caring for skin). What your child can do at home Maintain a confident and positive self -image. Encourage your child to express feelings to trusted family members, friends, doctor, nurse, or social worker. Talk with other people who have had similar treatment about what they did and how they coped with changes in body image. List your best points, and then list your options on how you would like to tr y to maintain a good body image. Laugh! Humor is a fine way to cope. Treat your child to funny movies, TV shows, books, or even people. Consider using a hair alternative Buy or borrow a wig. The Patient and Family Resource Center on the 3rd floor of SCCA offers wig fitting appointments and wig resources . Most offices of the American Cancer Society can tell you how to obtain or borrow a wig. Many of them hav e a \" wig b ank.\" Use a headwrap. Making headwraps out of scarves is easy. A headwrap can complement your looks. The emphasis should be on color and texture rather than on complicated tying techniques. 67 The book Beauty and Cancer by Diane Doan Noyes and Peggy Mellody, gives instructions on headwraps, skin care, makeup, clothing, nut rition, and exercise. Try turbans, scarves, hats, or caps. Head coverings protect against drafts, enhance appearance, and help retain body heat. Your child can wear attractive and comfortable clothing Wear colorful clothing. Chemotherapy and radiation ten d to make skin pale, sallow or ruddy. Colors and interesting patterns can decrease the intensity of skin changes. If your child's face becomes very round or puffy, wear a \"V\" shaped neckline. If you r child has lost a lot of weight, try a round or oval neckline. Avoid any garment that might puncture or break the central intravenous line such as front clasping underwire bras or pins. Soft fabrics drape best over catheters. Take care o f your child's skin Select s kin care products that you r child likes and are inexpensive, fragrance -free, hypoallergenic and alcohol -free. Cleanse skin twice a day. Mild soap and water is the most basic cleanser, especially good for oily skin. Cleansing cre ams are good for dry and nor mal skin because of their moisturizing effect. All cleansing products should be applied gently to avoid pulling the delicate surface of your skin. Use caution to avoid bruising the skin. Use a moisturizer to help skin retain its moisture. Avoid hot water. Wear sunscreen or protective clothing when outside. Report any skin changes such as rash or inflammation to the doctor or nurse. Build stamina with exercise Exercise daily. Exercise is one of the simplest and most effective way s to reduce stress, increase stamina, and impart a feeling of well -being. Begin slowly with low intensity exercise, such as walking. Your child's body will tell her what her limits are. A good rule of thumb is you r child should never be out of brea th. You r child should be able to tal k while exercising. Get professional help Talk with your child's doctor, nurse , or social worker for a referral to a counselor. 68 Breathing problems Just the facts Difficulty breathing may occur during your child's treatment. Symptoms include shortness o f breath, wheezing, and cough. A number of things can cause breathing problems: infection in the lungs, fl uid in the lungs, or bleeding. The m ost common cause is infection. Do everything you can to prevent irritati on and infecti on in the lungs. Exercise and breathing clean air helps the lungs function optimally. Goals Keep your child's lungs healthy. Call for professional help when needed. Emergency signs and symptoms Call 911 immediately if you r child is: Unable to breathe. Choking/not able to move air. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the after -hours clinic now if your child : Trouble breathing/shortness of breath. Gets \"winded\" more easily with normal activity. Feeling as if they can't get enough air. Troubled b reathing when lying flat. Wheezing with breaths. New or recurrent cough. Uncontrollable or continuous cough. Tightness or wheezing with each breath. Coughing blood or green/yellow sputum. Important signs and symptoms Repor t symptoms to a doctor or nurse d uring clinic hours today: New or recurrent cough. Gets \"winded\" more easily with minimal activity. What your child can do at home Keep lungs healthy: Avoid smoke or be ing around smoke. Exercise daily . This helps expand th e lungs and improves oxygen excha nge and blood flow. Sitting in an upright position allows the lungs expand and exchange oxygen better. For example, during the day , sitting is better than lying flat. Standing up and moving really let the lungs expand. Avoi d any clothing that restricts bre athing. Avoid contact with any person who has signs of respiratory infection (cold, fever, sneezing, runny nose, etc.). Call for help right away when you r child has a problem with breathing. The sooner treatment can be started, the more likely the treatmen t will work. 69 Change and uncertainty Just the facts The treatment process is one filled with changes and uncertainty. When will this be done or how can a family plan ahead? Answers to these questions are difficult because each patient resp onds differently to treatment. Compl ications are hard to predict. Take it day by day. Goals Adapt to change. Cope with uncertainty. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a doctor or nurse during clinic hours today if you r child is having : Feelings of dread a nd apprehension for several days. Physical symptoms such as sweaty palms, shaking, rapid heartbeat, and so on. Keep in mind that these symptoms can also be caused by side effects of treatment. Wide mood swings that you r child cannot control. What you and your child can do at home Adapt to change: Identify the change that is taking place and any options you have. Discuss these changes with family and staff. Ask staff for explanations. Keep track of questions and information in a notebook. Cope with uncert ainty When planning for the future, limit the time span as much as possible. If plans need to be made, consider alternative plans. Encourage your ch ild to talk with someone who listens about their hopes and disappointments. 70 Constipation Just the facts It is common for a person with cancer to develop constipation, especially when opioi ds (narcotics) are being used. Bowel movements can become infrequ ent, hard , and small in volume. It is important to avoid letting this become a problem. Constipation can d evelop because of inactivity, some pain medications, changes in the body, lack o f fluids/fiber , and depression. Excessive use of laxatives can make the colon less sensitive to its natural reflexes, so always discuss use of laxatives with your doctor or nur se. Goals Prevent constipation and recognize symptoms early. Get professional help when needed. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a doctor or nurse during clinic hours today: Bloated abdomen and/or abdominal pain. No bowel movement for more than 2 to 3 days. Dizziness and/or confusion. Back pain. Leaking stool. Fever. No bowel movements with nausea and vomiting. What you and your child can do at home Preventing constipation: Drink plenty of fluids. Drinking hot water upon rising in the mor ning can stimulate the bowels. Eat food that is high in fiber when possible. Fiber includes: fruits, figs, dates, prunes or prune jui ce, vegetables, and grains. Ask your nurse if you would like a consultation with the dietitian. If you r child is taking pai n medication, ask your doctor or nurse about the use of laxatives and stool softeners. Keep your child as physically active as possi ble. Ask your doctor or nurse if you r child need s a laxative. 71 Dehydration Just the facts Dehydration means there is not enough fluid in your child's body. It occurs when the re is not enough fluid intake. The body does not funct ion well without enough fluid. Excessive loss of fluid can result from diarrhea, vomiting, fevers , and sweating. Dehydration can cause complications such as increased weakness, dizziness, rapid heartbeat , and confusion. Goals Fluid intake. Call for profes sional help when needed. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the after-hours clinic immediately if your child is: Dizzy or lightheaded. Fainting. Confused. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a doctor or nurse during clinic hours today. Decreased urination, dark urine, strong smelling urine. Increased weakness.

If you detect early signs of dehydration in your child, have him drink more. Avoid caffeinated beverages such as: coffee, cola, diet cola, hot or iced tea, and hot cho colate. Check with the dietitian or nurse for goals or restrictions. Get p rofessional help when needed Monitor for signs of dehydration such as decreased amounts of urine and dark urine. Report symptoms to the doctor or nurse promptly. 72 Depression Just t he facts Dealing with a life -threatening illness causes a roller coaster of emotions. Most patients experience feelings such as helplessness, despair , and sadness during treatment. Symptoms of depression can also include loss of appetite, changes in sleep patterns, lack of energy, and inability to focus. If you r child has had symptoms of depress ion or have been on anti -depressants before, be sure to inform the doctor, nurse , or social worker. Goals Acknowledge that it is normal to have feelings of sadness at times. Allow your child to feel sad at times. Identify when you r child need s help with depression. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a doctor or nurse during clinic hours today. Feeling sad most of the time for several days. Feelings inte rfere with your child's ability to care for herself. Your child has thoughts ab out hurting himself . Mood swings that your child cannot control. What you and your child can do at home Allow you and your child to feel sad at times. Talk about these feeling s with someone who l istens (family member, social worker ).

Get professional help when needed Psychiatrist and psychologists can provide: Evaluat ion of cause of depression (sometimes medications can cause depression). Medication to manage depression. Counseling. Ask your doctor, nurse , or social worker for a referral. 73 Diarrhea Just the facts Diarrhea is frequent bowel movements with the stools having a more or less fluid consistency. Diarrhea is caused by chemotherapy, radiation, medications , and sometimes emotional distress. It is important to report diarrhea because it can lead to dehydra tion and loss of electrolytes. It is not always possible to prevent diarrhea. Goals Prevent dehydration. Prevent infection. Call for professional help when needed. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the after-hours clinic now if your child is experiencing: Constant or uncontrolled diarrhea. New ons et of diarrhea. Fever and abdominal stomach cramping. Whole pills passed in stool. More than 5 bowel movements a day. Stool that is bloody, burgundy , or black. Abdominal cramping. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a doctor or nurse during cl inic hours today: New onset of diarrhea. Diarrhea more than 5 times a day. Mild abdominal stomach cramping. Whole pills passed in the stool. What you and your child can do at home Prevent dehydration: Drink fluids (in suggested amounts). Follow dietary re commendations. Note any food allergies or in tolerances and discuss with the doctor, nurse , or dietitian. Prevent infection and irritation. Wash hands often with soap and warm water. Keep anal area clean with mild soap and water. Do not use ointment or crea ms on the anal area unless directed by your care team . Use white, non -perfumed toilet paper. Call for professional help when needed Describe the type of diarrhea to health care staff by including frequency, consistency, color, and presence of cramping. 74 Exercise and blood value precautions Platelets are parts of your blood that are important for blood clotting. Your child's platelet count must be greater than 20,000 before he or she can do any type of cardiovascular exercise or strength training with weig hts (cuff weights, dumbbe lls, machines, and elastic tubing). If your child's platelet count is consistently below 100,000, you need to check his blood counts before exercising to know whether or not you he can do strength training and/or cardiovascular exe rcise. If your child's platelet count is less than 20,000, she may have an increased risk of bleeding with certain types of exercise that could become serious and even life threatening. Platelet count 50,0 00 to 100,000: cardiovascular exercise and strengt h training with weights are allowed. If you r child has any signs of bleeding (such as from the nose), you r child should not exercise, and you must notify your physician or care team, even if your child's platelets are in this range. If platelet count is un der 100,000, no contact sports, climbing, bike riding, or other high -risk activities. Platelet count 20,000 to 49,999 : strength training without additional weight (body weight exercises, such as lunges, squats, push -ups) and cardiovascular exercise are ok if you r child has no signs of bleeding, but exercise must be performed without strain, such as holding your breath. Strain during exercis e can spike your blood pressure and increase your child's risk for a stroke or major bleed. Massage at this platelet count should be discussed on a case -by-case basis with your physician. Gentle comfort massage is allowed if the skin is not fragile or pron e to easy bruising for other reasons (such as chronic steroid medications), but deep tissue massage is not allowed. Platelet count 10,000 to 19,999: active range of motion (such as arm circles, seated marches, etc.) and cardiovascular exercise without strain, are both ok if your child is steady on his feet and has no sign of bleeding. Platelet count less than 10,000 : no strength training or cardiovascular exercise until your child's platelet count is in a safe range f or exercise. Walking around his room an d to the bathroom are OK as long as you r child is steady on his feet and ha s no sign of bleeding. Gently stretch your c hild's arms and legs. Hematocrit ( Hct) and h emoglobin (Hgb) are lab values that reflect the level of red blood cells within your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen around to your tissues. If your child's red blood cell number and oxygen - carrying capacity (Hct and Hgb) are too low and you r child exercise s anyway, he is diverting needed oxygen from his vital organs to his muscles, which may cause micro -damage to his organs. When your child's Hct or Hgb are too low, you r child is not allowed to perform stren gth training or cardiovascular exercise until he has had a red b lood cell transfusion and we are sure that his red cell numbers have improved to the safe range. It's always difficult to anticipate how much a transfusion will increase the level of Hct and H gb - a follow -up blood count is the only way to know for sure. If your child's hematocrit is less than 25% or hemoglobin is less than 8.0, it is necessary to consult with your doctor or a physical therapist to determine safe exercise options. 75 Fall preven tion Just the facts Your child may be at risk for falls because of: Different environments than you r child is used to. Medications that make you r child tired, dizzy, or confused. Weak muscles from taking steroid medications. Low red blood cells or a low blood pressure that could make y our child dizzy. If you r child has a history of confusion with any medications for nausea or pain control , let your doctor or nurse know. We want to prevent falls both in the clinic and at home. R eview this information with fami ly members and friends who are part of the team to keep you r child safe. Goals Prevent injury. Prevent permanent disability. Prevent death. Emergency signs and symptoms Call 911 immediately at home if: Your child fell and is bleeding. Any loss of consciousness occurs. You think you r child has a broken bone. Your child has fallen and hit her head, ha s low platelets, and/or is on anti -coagulant medications. Do not attempt to get your child up alone, because you might hurt yourself or your child . Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to your doctor or nurse during clinic hours today: If you r child has fallen, even if you think that nothing is wrong. What you and your child can do at the clinic Wear safe shoes! This is one of the most import ant things you can do to pre vent falls while you r child is here. Our floors can be very slippery. Closed -toe, closed -heel shoes with non -skid soles are the best choice (like tennis shoes). Flip -flops or op en sandals are very dangerous. It is OK with us if your child puts her shoes on our exam tables and beds so that her shoes are always on to keep her safe. We don't want you r child to ever walk around in socks or with bare feet. Non -skid slippers are available if she forgot her good shoes. Please ask for a pair. Ask for help . It does not bother the staff for you or your child to ask for help. Even if you r child gets around at home by herself , you r child might need extra help while she is in our clinic. We can help her get from one place to another in o ur cli nic, get on an exam table, or walk her to the bathroom. Move around with care . Be careful that you and your child don't lean on wheeled equipment for support. Wheelchairs are available to use in the clinic. Get up slowly after treatments and procedures . Have your child w ait to see if she feels dizzy or weak. She might need help from a staff person. 76 Use assistive devices. If you r child uses a hearing aid, glasses, prosthesis , or walker/cane, be sure to bring it to the clinic and use it while she is here. If you see an ything that is hazardous in the clinic (like a spill on the floor), tell staff right away. Call for professional help when needed if your child Is groggy, dizzy, or feeling faint. Has fallen, let staff know right away by yelling or asking anyon e around you to help. Do not attempt to get your child up alone. You might hurt yourself or your child trying to get her up. What you and your child can do at home Think about the shoes you r child wears. Have your child avoid wearing shoes such as slippe ry slippers or socks, high heels, shoes without backs, or flip-flops. Wear sturdy, non -skid shoes such as tennis shoes. Wear them inside and outside the house. Avoid going barefoot, even inside the house. Move furniture so there are clear paths. Keep the f loor, pathways, and stairs clear of objects. Remove things you r child can trip over (like paper, books, clothes, and shoes) from s tairs and halls. Never put small objects inside/outside your house, especially on the stairs . Fix loose or uneven ste ps. Have sturdy handrails and lights in all stairwells/staircase areas. Make sure carpet on the stairs is attached firmly to every step. Consider using reflective tape at the top and bottom of stairs. Tape cords and wires to th e floor/wall away from the walking pat h. Remove small throw rugs or use double -sided tape to keep the rugs from slipping. Enhance/add to the existing lighting home. Hang lightweight curtains or shades to reduce glare. Place a lamp next to your bed within easy reach and turn on the light when g etting out of bed. Install nightlights all the way to the bathroom (bedroom, hallways, and bathroom). Put a non -slip mat in the bathtub and on shower floors. Consider installing a grab bar in the bathtub, shower, and near the toilet. If you r child has bala nce problems, consider having him use a shower seat or urinal for showering and dressing. Keep items that are used often in cabinets and on shelves that are within easy reach, without use of a step stool. Never stand on a chair. Get up slowly after sitting up or lying down. Consider painting doorsills and other flooring level changes a different color so you r child doesn't trip. Review medications regularly with your doctors to identify medicines that cause sleepiness, dizziness, or confusion so you r child can be extra -safe after taking these medicines. Don't drink alcohol if taking sedating medications. Talk to your child's doctor about seeing a physical therapist for mobili ty aid and balance and strengthening. Practice approved exercises regularly to impro ve strength, balance, and coordination. References: Holly, S. (2002).

Fatig ue is a daily lack of energy, an unusual or excessive whole body ti redness not relieved by sleep. There are a number of possible causes for fatigue: the intensive treatments, medications, a lower than normal number of circulating red blood cells, stress, d ecreased nutrition, nausea, vomiting, mouth sores, taste changes, heart burn, diarrhea, dis ruption of normal resting and sleep habits, or feelings of depression. It usually takes time to work out ways to live with fatigue. Goals Establish regular rest and sleep periods. Conserve energy. Get professional help when needed. Emergency signs and symptoms Call 911 immediately if: You are the caregiver and cannot wake your patient. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the after-hours clinic now if your child is: Dizzy. Too tired to get out of bed or walk to the bathroom. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a doctor or nurse during clinic hours today. Fatigue is getting worse. Staying in bed all day. Other symptoms occur with increased fatigue. Increased weakness or exhaustion. Drowsiness or confusion. Loss of balance. Child is try ing to catch his breath . What you can do at home Establish regular rest and sleep periods. Set up a regular daily schedule for nap and sleep times. Keep active during the day to sleep better at night. Play soft music, put on the TV as a background sound, engage in meditation or prayer, or offer your child a back rub to help them sleep or rest . Keep a diary for one week to monitor fatigue levels. Note what you think may be contributing factors . 78 Conserve e nergy Rest between bathing, treatments, and exercis e. Do things or be active only for a short time. Plan activities such as exercise, visits, or trips when feeling the most rested and energetic. Decide on the most important activities for the day. Be realistic. Regular exercise helps reduce fatigue; it sou nds contradictory, but it helps. Give your child snacks between meals to keep up his energy. Plan ahead and organize your work. 79 Fever Just the facts Seek professional help when your child has a fever. A fever and chills are signs of possible infection. A patient is very vulnerable to infection after chemotherapy, radiation, while on immunosuppressive medications, and when blood counts are low. Act pro mptly when a fever occurs because the your child cannot fight infection when her number of white blood cel ls is low. Goals Monitor the your child's t emperature. Seek professional help when your child has a fever. Urgent signs and symptoms Go to Seattle Children's Hospital Emergency Department (ED) NOW if : Temperature taken by mouth is between 38 to 38.2C (100.4 to 100.8F) for one hour or more, or a temperature that is 38.3 C (100.9F) or above. Temperature taken under the arm between 37.5 to 37.7C (99.5 to 99.9F) for one hour or more, or a temperature that is 37.8 C (100F) or above. Fever greater than 1 degree above normal when the patient is on p rednisone or steroids. Shaking chills (temperature may be normal). Cold symptoms (runny no se, watery eyes, sneezing, coughing). Note: Do not give Tylenol\u00ae (unless directed by the doctor or nurse). If your chi ld has a fever you may be directed go to the Seattle Children's Emergency Department (ED).

HFS symptoms may be caused by the breakdown of chemicals that are use d in chemotherapy. HFS is a skin reaction which often affects hands and feet, although it can also affect other areas where there is increased pressure or warmth (like the buttocks, groin, armpits , or under the breasts). Goals Avoid tight fitting shoes or gloves . Control skin irritations with moisturizers and avoid activities that can make HFS worse. Call for professional help when needed, especially if pain becomes a problem. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a doctor or nurse during clinic hours today: Palms or soles of the feet are red or tender. Skin of palms and soles peeling. Numbness, burning , or tingling sensation. What you and your child can do at home Prevent dryness and irritation: Apply moisturizer to your child's hands and feet frequently , especially in the creases. Recommended moisturizers include: Bag Balm\u00ae, Udderly Smooth Cream\u00ae, lanolin creams (unless allergic to wool), Aveeno\u00ae cream, Eucerin\u00ae cream, and Lubriderm\u00ae. Avoid heat. Bathe or shower in lukewarm water. Soak hands/fe et in basi ns of cold water for 15 minutes 3 to 4 times per day when possible. Take cool baths and put gel ice packs on affected areas. Avoid activities that cause irritation due to even slight rubbing or pressure on the skin. For example, vigorous washing , gripping tools, typing, driving, or playing musical instruments. Do not apply any adhesives or dressings such as Band -Aids \u00ae, since adhesive will irritate skin further. Sit or lie on padded surfaces of chairs or mattresses. Raise legs whenever possible wi th cushions. Place a pillow between knees or wear pajamas if rubbing of legs occur during sleep. Avoid any unnecessary and vigorous exercise. Wear loose fitting clothing and shoes with comfortable soles. Do not walk barefoot. 84 Alleviate symptoms if they start Place palms or bottoms of feet on an ice pack or a bag of frozen peas to provide temporary relief from pain and tenderne ss. Alternate on and off for 15 to 20 minutes at a time. (May use gel insoles that can be cooled before insertion in shoes). Apply moisturizing cream of choice after the area has been cooled for maximum comfort. If your doctor suggests a steroid cream, apply it after the skin has been cooled and apply moisturizers over the top of the steroid cream for maximum effectiveness. If blisteri ng and ulceration starts, apply gentle moisturizers on your hands and feet and contact your doctor or nurse, who may suggest further therapies. Talk with your nurse about how to change your activities of daily living (bathing, dressing , and eating ) if the HFS is severe. Contact your doctor regarding other over the counter or prescription options to relieve symptoms of HFS. 85 Memory and concentration Just the facts Changes in memory and concentration are common throughout treatment. The changes may be tempo rary. Your child's memory and concentration may improve as his treatment is completed and when he start s feeling better. Many factors affect memory. Memory and concentration problems may be situational and vary from day to day du e to stress, pain, medica tions, menopause, anxiety, a ging, depression, and fatigue. Since you r child may have good and bad days, you may want to use routine strategies to assist you when you r child is having a bad day. It can be a frustrating and taxing pr oblem. Goals Learn how t o cope with changes in memory and concentration. Get professional help when needed. Neuropsychologists evaluate memory. Ask your doctor to make sure that your child's medications are not causing the problem. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the after-hours clinic now if your child is : Disoriented Confused Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a doctor or nurse during clinic hours today if your child is : Forgetting things more quickly and more often than usual. Finding it harder to read more than a paragraph or a page at a time. Finding it hard to keep his mind from wandering. What you and your child can do at home Learn how to cope wit h changes in memory and concentration , your or your child can : Write down important information.

T here are things you can do to regain some of your child's mental plasticity and prevent any further decline in cognitive faculties. Puzzle books : Crossword puzzles are known to improve mental skil ls. Sudoku : Similar to a crossword puzzle, but with numbers instead. Card games : o Start with a shuffled deck of cards and a stopwatch. Sort the cards into separate piles, one for each suit (diamonds, clubs, spades, hearts). Do this three times daily. A typ ical young adult can do this in 35 seconds. Keep practicing this task until you can do it in that amount of time! o Play and l earn other card games such as bridge, rummy, pinochle, canasta, cribbage, black jack, or solitaire. Games : stimulating games su ch as chess, checkers, Scrabble \u00ae, and any other games you r child enjoy s. If your child has a Nintendo \u00ae, try the game Brain A ge, developed by neuroscience researchers to improve mental abilities and hand/eye coordination. Hobbies : Learn a new skill such as knitting or crocheting, or a new sport. Have your child t ry writing and brushing her teeth with the opposite hand than she usually do es. Conversation : Enjoy a conversation with a friend and discuss world events. Languages : Learn a new language. Rosetta S tone \u00ae has CDs that you can purchase in various languages. Read books : Join a book club , or attend a book reading. A couple of suggestions include: o The Better Brain Book by David Perlmutter and Carol Colman o Whole Brain Thinking by Jacquelyn Wonder and Prisc illa Donovan o Carved in Sand by Cathryn Jakobson Ramin (the story of her struggle with early onset memory loss). Website suggestion : www.positscience.com/ is a website where you can try out a couple of the exercises from their Brain Fitness Program. This pr ogram has been used to help veterans with traumatic brain injuries recover some of the ir capabilities. Get professional help when needed If problems persist or affect day -to-day living to a large degree, discuss the symptoms with your doctor or nurse. Ask your doctor or nurse about a neuropsychological referral and neuro -rehabilitation treatment. 87 Mucositis (inflammation of mucous membranes ) Just the facts Mucositis and mouth pain are common physical problems for chemotherapy and radiation patients. Chem otherapy and radiation lead to inflammation of cells of the tongue, lips, mouth, throat , and gastrointestinal tract. Saliva usually becomes thicker and more mucous -like. Mouth sores or bleeding in the mouth may occur also. The experience varies from mild d iscomfort to severe pain, which makes eating, drinking , and sleeping difficult. Your child's ability to fight infection is temporarily reduced by the therapy (chemotherapy and/or radiation). The inflamed mouth is a possible site of infection. Swelling may make it hard to swallow. If swelling is severe it may become hard to breathe. Goals: Call for professional help when needed. Prevent infection. Control pain. Maintain nutrition and fluid intake. Emergency signs and symptoms: Call 911 immediately if: Not breathing. Severe difficulty breathing. Urgent signs and symptoms: Call the clinic or after -hours clinic now if your child : Having difficulty breathing. Bright red in the mouth. Pain not controlled by medication. White patches or sores appear on gums or mouth. Difficulty swallowing food or fluid. Important signs and symptoms: Report symptoms to a doctor or nurse during clinic hours today. White patches or sores appear on gums or mouth. Start to have difficulty eating or drinking. Increased sensitivity to foods or significant dryness. 88 What you and your child can do at home: Prevent infection and irritation : Rinse mouth often w ith salt -water solution every 1 to 2 hours. Rinsing with solutions may also help reduce thickened secretions and should be don e before eating, drinking, or taking medications by mouth. Recipe: 1 quart water, \u00bd to \u00be level teaspoon salt. If the salt solution causes stinging or burning this may be reli eved by diluting it or adding 1 to 2 teaspoons of baking soda. Spit secretions ou t often and especially before eating, drinking , or taking m edications by mouth. Brush teeth twice a day with a very soft bristle toothbrush as long as you r child is able. If it becomes too painful or significant bleeding occurs, a child's toothbrush or too thettes (sponge brushes) can be substituted. Resume using y our normal toothbrush as soon as possible as it is more effective at keeping the bacteria under control and causes less trauma. Continue to floss daily as long as it is comfortable and no significa nt bleeding occurs. Avoid using commercial mouthwashes. Man y contain alcohol or peroxide, which can dry and irritate your child's gums and the tissue in his or her mouth. Control pain : Topical anesthetics such as lidocaine viscous gel can be used to help control pain. They can be used as a rinse or applied direc tly to localized areas of soreness. These are prescribed by the doctor. They are jelly-like liquids which numb the mouth. These gels can be used full strength or diluted 1:1 or 1:2 if they cause st inging or burning. Fill a small container such as a medicin e cup with the solution. Have your child t ake a small amount (5 to 10 ml) and swish and hold the solution in the mouth for 15 -30 seconds. Repeat this until you r child has used the entire volume of the cup. Repeat as often as needed. Do not swallow the solu tion. For single or small areas, try applying the gel with a cotton tip applicator or gauze square once for 15 to 30 seconds then reapply in 30 to 60 second intervals for a total of 3 to 5 minutes. Use the gel at least 15 minutes before or after eating. Wh en used rig ht, the medicine may provide 30 to 45 minutes of pain relief. Take pain medication as instructed. Tell the doctor or nurse if pain medication does not seem to be controlling your child's pain. For chapped lips apply lanolin creams, Chapstick\u00ae or Blistex\u00ae and lip balms that contain lanolin. Place ice packs on painful areas such as cheeks, lips , or throa t for 10 to 15 minutes every 2 hours. Avoid pretzels, chips, tomato juice, orange juice , or hot drinks. All oral rinses can be kept in the refrigerator or placed in an ice bath. This can be soothing, help to reduce swelling , or control bleeding. Maintain adequate nutrition and fluid intak e: Warm fluids - try: soup s, chicken or vegetable broth, and tea Cool fluids - try: smoothies, shakes, iced tea, diluted juices 89 Nausea and vomiting Just the facts Many patients experience nausea and vomiting at some time during the treatment process. It is one of the side effects of the chemotherapy and radiation. Contrary to what most people think, nausea and vomiting have l ittle to do with your stomach. They are actions controlled by certain centers in y our child's brain and are involuntary. Willpower alone cannot stop nausea and vomiting. A number of things can trigger nausea and vomiting: Chemotherapy agents . Radiation . Persistent pain . Poor kidney and liver function . Medications such as some narcotics . Infections of the gastrointestinal tract . Electrolyte disturbances . Graft -versus -host disease . Thankfully, just as medicine has advanced against cancer, great progress has been made in preventing and treating nausea and vomiting. Some patients have little or no nausea and vomiting and keep eating during most of the treatment process. Anti -nausea (antie metic) medications are often started before radiation and chemotherapy and then co ntinued on a regular schedule. Even if you r child does not feel nauseated, he should take the medicine. The fact that you have not vomited means that the medicine is working. Many antiemetics can make you r child feel tired or sleepy. Some people will feel jittery and restless. Your goals Take anti -nausea medicines. Maintain nutrition and fluid intake. Call for professional help when needed. Urgent signs and symptoms Call th e clinic or the after-hours clinic now if: Having uncontrolled (constant) nausea and vomiting. Blood or \"coffee ground\" appearing material in th e vomit. Medicine not kept down because of vomiting. Weakness or dizziness, along with nausea/vomiting. Severe s tomach pain while vomiting. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a doctor or nurse during clinic hours today if: Nausea persists without control from anti -nausea medications. Projectile vomiting. 90 What you and your child can do at home Preven t nausea and vomiting or manage symptoms well: Make sure your child takes anti-nausea medicine as instructed before nausea starts. Before chemotherapy, l ie down in a quiet place for 15 to 20 minutes and relax. Wear loose fitting clothes. Use distraction, relaxation , or deep -breathing techniques such as tapes, visualization, or hypnosis techniques. Have your child tr y breathing throug h his mouth. Keep his mouth clean. Rinse with water often. Rest in a chair after eating, keeping head elevated. Take anti-nausea medications Some anti -nausea medicines can cause drowsiness or sleepiness. Do not allow your child to drive a car or operate a ny dangerous equipment while he is taking them. Do not drink alcohol while taking anti -nausea medicines. Because anti -nausea medicines can make you r child drowsy, it is advisable to stay with your child throughout this treatment period. Maintain nutrition and fluid intake Eat small meals during the day so your stomach is not too full. Eat and drink slowly so only small amounts enter your stomach at one time. Avoid eating and drinking one hour before and one hour after chemotherapy. Stay away from sweet, fatty, or fried foods. Drink cool, clear fruit juices. Eat dry foods like toast or crackers to help ease nausea. Avoid odors t hat bother you. If food smells make you sick, avoid being in the kitchen when food is being prepared. Avoid food serv ed at extreme temperatures. Keep a wide choice of food available. Call for professional help when needed If you notice that the anti -nause a medicine does not seem to control your child's nausea, call your doctor or nurse. Additional medications may be us ed to better control your nausea. If the medicines seem to make you r child nervous, jittery, or cause any unusual sensations, let your doctor or nurse know. Do not increase the amount of medicine without checking with the doctor, nurse , or pharmacist. Do not take any over -the-counter medicines without checking first with your doctor or nurse . 91 Pain Just the facts Your child may experience pain during the course of his illness. Most pain can easily be treated with pain medication and/or other treatments. Your oncologist and nurse will assist you to find the best possible way to control his pain. On occasion your doctor may ask a doctor who s pecializes in cancer pain mana gement to manage your child's pain. Pain is an unpleasant sensation that only your child can fe el. It is what you r child says it is. A change or increase in pain does not necessarily indicate that your cancer has returned or i s progressing. Pain may be cau sed by a number of things including cancer, treatment of the cancer, or a medical problem not related to the cancer diagnosis. Myths about narcotic s and o pioids Some people will think they will become addicted. Research has shown that this is not true. I f you r child uses her pain medication the way her doctor prescribes it, it is very rare for her to become addicted. Some patients do not want narcotics because they fear the side -effects. Nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, constipa tion, and itching are common s ide effects, but can easily be managed by changing your child's medication or adding other treatments. Patient rights and responsibilities As a patient of the SCCA, you and your child have the right to: Information about pain and pain management. Have your child's pain treated promptly. Have doctors and nurses who believe your child's report of pain. As healthcare providers, we expect y ou to Describe and rate your child's pain. Ask about pain management. Discuss options with your child 's doctor or nurse. Ask for pain relief when you r child first experience s pain. Inform us if pain treatment is not working. Help us develop a treatment plan for you r child . Goals Report your child's pain. Rate you r child's pain . Keep track of w hat triggers it and what makes it better. Have pain treated promptly. Maintain optimal level of physical activity. Assessment of pain Your child's doctor or nurse will ask you or your child to \"rate\" her pain using a simple method. Remember, only your chi ld knows what and where her pain is, and we need her to help us so that we can help her . 92 Your child's doctor or nurse will ask her to \"point\" to the area of her pain. They will also ask the following questions: What will cause the pain? What do you thi nk will get rid of the pain? What is the quality of your pain? ( burning, radiating, throbbing, stabbing) It is the staff's goal to provide you r child with the best possible treatment of her pain. We ask t hat you help us do so by telling us about your child's pain when she first experience s it. How can we treat your child's pain? Your child's pain can be treated/managed in many different ways. Your child's doctor may choose to prescribe Tylenol\u00ae, ibuprofen , or narcotics/opioids such as morphine. Sometimes he/she may choose to use a local anesthetic. The method depends on the location and severity of your child's pain. Non -drug methods of pain relief Hot or cold packs . Massage/therapeutic touch . Hypnosis . Relaxation and music therapy . Pain medication may b e given different ways Pills. Patch (like a bandage placed on the skin) . Intravenous . SQ (under the skin) . PCA-intravenous (a small computerized pump that lets you con trol how much pain medication you receive) . Epidural (a small tube inserted into your bac k). Some pain medications should be taken on a regular basis (long -acting medication), while others should be taken only when you begin to feel the pain (break -throug h medicine) . Emergency signs and symptoms Call 911 immediately if your child has : Severe chest/arm pain . Severe squeezing or pressure in chest . Severe sudden headache . Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the after-hours clinic now if you r child has : New or uncontrolled pain . New headache . Chest discomfort or heart \"flip -flop\" feel ing. Pounding heart . Painful central line site or area of \"tunnel\" . Burning in chest or stomach . Strong stomach pain . Pain with infusion of med ications or fluids into central line . 93 What you and your child can do at home Maintain your child's treatment p lan and take medications as ordered. Do not increase your child's dose of medication without talking to your nurse or doctor. Keep a pain journal. Use hot or cold packs. Find a relaxation technique that works for you r child such as meditation, guided image ry, hypnosis, massage, or therapeutic touch. Listen to relaxing music. Taking care of your child's pain will help her sleep better, feel stronger , and be better able to cope with her illness. Continue activities that are meaningful to you r child . These act ivities may help you r child notice less pain or discomfort. Before taking pain medication or opioid s, ask your nurse or doctor about ways to prevent constipation. 94 Peripheral neuropathy Just the facts Peripheral neuropathy is damage to nerves that can spa n from your child's fingers to his toes. Peripheral means nerves beyond the brain and spinal cord. Peripheral nerves take information to the muscles, organs, skin, and joints , and then take information back to the brain. \"Neuro\" means nerves. \"Pathy\" means abnormal. When this occurs it can cause pain and numbness, or a sensation that is similar to burning or tingling. In many cases symptoms improve with time. There are many different causes. Some chemotherapy medications can cause this problem. Other causes include: traumatic injury, diabet es, infectious conditions, and toxic compounds. Goals Monitor onset of symptoms. Protect your hands and feet. Get professional help when needed. Emergency signs and symptoms Call 911 immediately if: You cannot wake you r patient. Urgent signs and sympt oms Call the clinic or the after-hours clinic now if: Your child is unable to move his legs. Your child has fallen . Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a doctor or nurse during clinic hours today. Change in s ensation symptoms: numbness, tingling, tremor, burning, loss of sensation, gait imbalance (unstable walking), sensitivity to touch, weakness, tiredness and heaviness. Movement symptoms: lack of muscle control, falling, muscle twitching, cramping , foot drop , and muscle atrophy. Autonomic symptoms: failure of the nerves to work correctly can result in abnormal blood pressure and digestive problems such as nausea, blurred vision, and dizziness. What you and your child can do at home If your child is having pr oblems with balance or fine motor skills (such as writing or drawing), a physical or occupational therapist can meet with them to help improve mobility and function. They may recommend home equipment and/or devices to help your ch ild walk or perform routin e daily activities safely. Avoid extreme temperatures. Peripheral neuropathy may make areas of your body more sensitive to hot or cold. Have your child w ear shoes, slippers, gloves, and other clothing to protect his skin from ch anges. Use extra care whe n using hot, sharp, or potentially harmful objects. You r child may be more at risk for clumsiness and prone to injury if he has reduced sensations. Avoid falls - review the Fall Prevention symptom sheet in this manual . If you r child has sensation changes, you are more at risk for falls. 95 Check your child's feet every day, looking carefully at the bottom of his feet and toes for any changes. For lack of sensation in your child's hands: Check temperatures with inner forearms to avoid burns. Always use prot ective padding for cooking and rubber gloves for cleaning. Keep finger nails short to avoid tearing. Keep hands moisturized to avoid skin breaks from dryness. Coping with peripheral neuropathy Your child's doctor will try to determine the source of the problem. Ask your doctor questions. Let your child's care team know how much the neuropathy impacts his life. There are techniques for coping with pain and discomfort. In many cases, symptoms improve with time. Websites www.neuropathy.org 96 Sexual health Just the facts Treatments such as chemotherapy, surgery and radiation may cause changes that can affect intimacy and sexuality, including desire and body image. We want to be sure young adults experiencing cance r treatment are prepared for the physical and emotional changes that they may experience during this time. We encourage them to: Goals Discuss any restrictions and questions with their care team. Keep an open mind about the possibility of needing to adjus t to physical and emotional sexual changes that occur; communicate openly with partner(s). Have a pleasurable experience (free from pain or risk). Prev ent infection . If young adults are sexually active, it is important to prevent infection, pregnancy, or fathering a child. Young adults who are sexually active should talk to their care team if they experience Pain, di scomfo rt, or bleeding during or after sex. Fear about sexual activity. Lack of desire that is affecting their relationships. Young women: vaginal dryness, discharge, pelvic pain, or menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes or loss of menstrual cycle Young men: pain during penetration or ejaculation, abnormal discharge, changes in his ability to get erections or ejaculate What can b e done at home Young adults who are sexually active should optimize positive feelings of intimacy : Plan s exual activity for the time of day when they are feeling best. If young adults are taking pain m edication, they can take it at an hour when it will be in full effect during sex. Talk about expectations and what might feel good, or what to avoid. Consider other forms of intimacy \u2014holding hands, snuggling, kissing, self -stimulation, and talking can happen at any stage of cancer treatment. Find a position or activity th at puts as little pressure as possible on the sensitive or painful areas of the body. Empty the bladd er before sexual activity. Communicate with partners to let them know if any kinds of touching causes irritation or pain. Use a sexual lubrica nt to help dry skin areas be slippery. PREGNANCY AND CHEMOTHERAPY Chemotherapy can have harmful effects on pregnancy. If there is a chance young adults who are sexually active during treatment could become pregn ant or father a child while undergoing chemotherapy or radiation , talk to the care team about birt h control. 97 Prevent infection: Wash hands befo re and after sexual activity. Urinate after sex. This rinses out bacteria that may cause infection in the urinary tract. Avoid sexu al contact with peop le who have infectious diseases (colds, flu, cold sores) or sexually transmitted infections. Common questions about sex during chemotherapy Is it safe for me to kiss while I'm receiving chemotherapy or after treatment? To reduce the risk of in fection, avoid k issing anyone who has open mouth sores, cold sores, a cold, the flu, or symptoms of a respiratory infection. What are restrictions for sexual activi ty? When platelet counts are less than 5 0,000. This is due to the risk for bleeding. When white blood counts are low. N eutrophil (AN C) count should be more than 5 00 to prevent infection with most sexual activity. An ANC of 1,000 or more is needed for anal sex. Vaginal or rectal bleeding, sores in your mouth, vagina or rectum. If your par tner has infections or open sores . Condoms are no t always effective at preventing infections. Why don't I have m uch sexual desire? Lack of desire (also called lack of libido) and fatigue can be a normal response to the stresses of treatment, some medications, and changes in hormone levels . Young adults who are sexually active can talk to their partner or a counselor, and sometimes hormone replacement can be helpful. Talk to the care team so they can help find something that works. Will I be infertile after treatment? Factors that influence fertility include: type and dose of chemotherapy, radiation, and other medications; if young adults have had a transplant; and age at time of treatment. Young women often stop having periods but resume t heir menstrual cycle after treatment; some young women resume n ormal menstrual cycles but are still unable to become pregnant due to damage to eggs in the ovary; still, other young women may experience complete menopause. Young men often stop making sperm completely or have very low sperm counts during and for several months after cancer treatment. Not every male will resume normal sperm production and may be infertile. Testing of sex hormones, sperm counts, or ovarian function is needed to see if fertility is intact. If young adult patients are interested in preservi ng fertility, talk with the care team before treatment. This gives young men and women the opportunity to store sperm, eggs, or embryos when appropriate. A fertility specialist (reproductive endocrinologist) can provide more information about fertility st atus and the options available before and af ter treatment. Fertility services are not always covered by insurance, but financial assistance may be available. Don't let fear of cost prevent you from asking what services are possible. What options do I have to store my eggs or sperm? For young men , sperm banking is the standard approach. Sperm can be collected several different ways, but the simplest is to provide a sample of ejaculated semen. Sperm can be safely frozen for many years. 98 For young women , the s tandard approach is to collect eggs, which can require hormone therapy and a medical procedure. This process can take up to 2 weeks. Eggs can be frozen individually or fertilized with sperm to create embryos before freezing. Eggs and embryos can be safely frozen for many years. Brochures and books SCCA's Patient and Family Resource Center on the 3rd floor of the clinic offers brochures and books that young adults check -out. Some titles we suggest include: Katz, Anne.

Problems with sleep are associated with fatigue. Up to 50% of patients with cancer have sleep problems. Goals Prevent insomni a. Call for professional help when needed. Emergency signs and symptoms Call 911 immediately if your child is unconscious. Urgent signs and symptoms Call the clinic or the after-hours number now if your child : Has not slept in days. What you and your child can do at home Promote sleep: Keep a regular schedule. Create a bedtime routine. Use a preferred relaxation technique such as reading, or taking a warm bath or shower. Back rubs or massages may be relaxing. Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine b efore bed. Maintain a healthy diet. Decrease negative associations with bed time. Do not stay in bed when not sleeping. Do not lie in bed while worrying. Do not exercise right before bedtime. Avoid electronic devices before sleep such as cell phone, television , and computer. Use the bed for sleep and sex only. Create a peaceful enviro nment in which to sleep by decreasing noise, dimming lights, adjusting room temperature, and keeping bedding and pillows clean, dry, and wrinkle -free. Try not to drink fluid before bed and empty bowel and bladder before bedtime. Minimize daytime naps. Listen to relaxation tapes and or peaceful music before bed. Call for professional help when needed If you r child is not sleeping. 100 White blood cells Just the facts A white blood cell count with differential provides information about your white blood cells. White blood cells help protect the body by fighting bacteria and viruses that cause infection. It is important to protect yourself against infection. When your child's white blood count is low, they are more prone to infection. Goals Recognize signs o f infection. Get professional help when needed. Important signs and symptoms Report symptoms to a doctor or nurse during clinic hours today. Shaking or chills. Cough. Temperature greater than or equal to 38.3 C (100.9F), or a temperature of 38.0 C (100.4F) for 1 hour . When taking an axillary (under the arm) temperature with children, call if the temperature is 37.9 C (100.3F) or higher. Sore throat. A general feeling of tiredness or \"flu -like\" symptoms. Painful or frequent urination. What you and your child can do at home Preventive measures: Look at your mouth and skin for signs of infection. Exercise excellent mouth care. See Mucositis information sh eet. Have your child b rush her teeth after each meal and at bedtime. Use a soft -bristle toothbrush an d be careful to avoid injury to the gums. Avoid use of mouthwashes that contain alcohol. Keep your child's skin clean and avoid cuts and scratches. Report any changes in skin including rashes, sores, and cuts. Wash hands frequently. Wear gloves when washin g dishes. Shave with an electric razor. Use lotion for dry skin. If you r child has hemorrhoids, ask her doctor or nurse for advice before self -treat ment . Check with your doctor or nurse regarding dental work. 101 Food safety guidelines Overview Foodborne illness, or \"food poisoning,\" is any illness caused by eating a food that is contaminated with a bacteria , virus, mold or parasite. Examples of organisms that can cause a food borne illness are E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria. Sources of foodborne illn ess may be the food handler, the environment (such as a contaminated work surface) or the food itself. Bacteria and other organisms exist commonly in foods. Most of these organisms are of little risk to the average healthy person. However, persons under going chemotherapy, radiation, or a hematopoietic cell transplant are at increased risk for infections, including foodborne illness. By following safe food practices, patients and caregivers can reduce the risk of foodborne illness. All hematopoietic cel l transplant patients are recommended to follow the \" Immunosuppressed Patient Diet \". In addition, it is recommended that all patients follow the food safety guidelines discussed below. If you have any questions regarding food safety and diet guidelines, t alk to your dietitian. Steps to food s afety Wash hands and surfaces often Avoid cross -contamination of foods Keep foods at safe temperatures Tools for food s afety Food and refrigerator thermometers Hand soap Clean towels (cloth or paper) Bleach solution (for washing countertops, cutting boards and other items) *Dilute bleach s olution : Mix 1/3 cup unscented household bleach with 3 1/3 cups w ater. (This will make a total of 3 2/3 cups of bleach solution.) This solution must be remade daily. Hand h ygien e Wash hands frequently with soap and warm, running water and rubbing motion (friction) for 15 seconds before and after every step in food preparation. This is critical before and after handling raw meat, seafood and poultry. Wash hands before eating and after using the rest room, handling garbage, and touching pets. Dry hands wit h a paper towel or cloth hand towel that is changed daily. 102 Kitchen c leanliness Overview Replace dishcloths and dishtowels daily. They should be laundered in the hot cycle of your washing machine. Sanitize sponges daily and after contact with raw meat, fish and eggs. You may soak them in the dilute bleach solution* for five minutes, heat them in a microwave oven on high for one minute, or run them through the dishwasher. Use li quid dish soap and very warm water when hand -washing dishes, pans, and utensi ls. Air -dry dishes instead of towel -drying them. Wash counters, utensils, and can openers with soap and hot water immediately after use. After washing, they can be sanitized usi ng the dilute bleach solution.* Keep the refrigerator clean. Clean spills im mediately. Wash shelves and doors weekly using the dilute bleach solution.* Make sure food storage areas remain clean. Rotate food stock so older items are used first. Check exp iration dates. Do not use foods past the expiration dates. Throw away any bulging, leaking or cracked cans, or those deeply dented in the seam area. Do not taste these foods. Keep appliances free of food particles (including the microwave oven, toaster, can opener, blender and mixer blades). Blender blades and the bottom ring should be removed from the blender after each use and washed in hot, soapy water. Keep food storage areas c lean. Do not store any food supplies under the sink. Do not store chemic als and cleaning solutions over or near food supplies. Cutting b oards Wash cutting boards with hot, soapy water after each use; then rinse and air -dry or pat dry with fresh paper to wels. Non -porous acrylic, plastic or glass boards and solid wood boards c an be washed in a dishwasher (laminated boards may crack or split). Sanitize both wooden and plastic cutting boards with the dilute bleach solution.* This should be done every time th e board is used for raw meat, fish and poultry. Sanitize cutting boards used for other purposes at least once weekly. Flood the surface with the bleach solution and allow it to stand for at least 2 minutes, then rinse and air -dry or pat dry with fresh pa per towels. Alternatively, use a commercial sanitizing agent (that conta ins bleach) and follow the directions on the product. Replace worn cutting boards, including boards with cracks or grooves. 103 Safe food handling: from the grocery store to your h ome Grocery s tore Shop for shelf -stable items first (shelf -stable refers to unopened canned, bottled, or packaged food products that can be stored at room temperature before opening; the container may require refrigeration after opening.) Select frozen and re frigerated foods last, especially during the summer months. Check \"Sell B y\" and \"Use By\" dates on dairy products, eggs, cereals, canned foods, and other goods. Select only the freshest products. Check packaging dates and \"use by\" dates on fresh meats, poultry, and seafood. Do not purchase if they are outdated. Do not use dama ged, swollen, rusted, or deeply dented cans. Check that packaged and boxed foods are properly sealed. Select fruits and vegetables that are not moldy, bruised or damaged. Fresh fruits and vegetables should look fresh. Wilted salad greens may be an indic ation that the product is old and not properly handled. Avoid unpasteurized juice (unless prepared at home with washed produce). Choose shelf -stable salsa rather than salsas found in the refrigerator section of the grocery store. Avoid unpasteurized milk, yogurt, cheese, other unpasteurized milk products, including Mexican -style cheese made from unpasteurized milk (such as queso fresco). Do not use foods with any mold present , including blue cheese. Avoid unrefrigerated, cream - and custard -filled pastry pr oducts, such as fresh bakery cream pies, \u00c9clairs, cream -filled donuts and pastries. Commercial, shelf -stable items such as Danish pastries are allowed. Follow the \"use by\" date and store them according to the manufacturer's guidelines after opening. Avoid foods from \"reach in\" or \"scoop\" bulk food containers. Avoid food from any type of bulk food container if it will not be cooked prior to consumption. Do not taste unpackag ed food samples. Choose eggs that are refrigerated in the store. Do not use cracke d eggs . Pasteurized eggs, liquid pasteurized egg products (such as EggBeaters) and powdered egg whites may be used in recipes calling for raw eggs in foods that will not b e cooked. Place meat, poultry and fish in plastic bags. Ask to have these items pl aced in separate bags from the fresh produce and ready -to-eat foods when at the checkout stand. Never leave perishable food in the car. Refrigerate or freeze them promptly. Home Wash the tops of canned foods before opening. Clean the can opener after ea ch use. Throw away eggs with cracked shells. Throw away foods older than their \"use by\" expiration dates. Throw away entire food packages or containers with any mold present, including yogurt, cheese, cottage cheese, fruits (especially berries), vegetables , jelly, bread, cereal and pastry products. Fruit and vegetable handling 104 All fresh produce (whether organic, natural or general produce) may carry dangerous bacteria or other organisms that can cause food borne illness. Bacterial contamination can occur in the fields from the use of natural fertilizers (such as animal manure) or from human contact during produce harvesting, transporting and in the grocery store. The term \"organic\" or \"natural\" refers to growing without the use of chemical fertili zers or pesticides and has no relationship to the cleanliness or safety of the pr oduce. Use the following guidelines for handling all raw produce, including organic, organically grown, \"natural\" and general produce: Refrigerate fruits and vegetables prom ptly. Do not purchase produce that has been cut at the grocery store (such as melon or cabbage halves). This is particularly true for produce that will not be cooked prior to eating. Rinse produce thoroughly under clean, running water just before use, includin g produce that is to be peeled (such as bananas, melons and oranges) or cooked. Do not wash fruits and vegetables with soaps, detergents or chlorine bleach solutions. Produce can absorb these cleaning agents. Commercial produce rinses (such as Fi t Fruit and Vegetable Spray) are not recommended since they have not been shown to be more effective for removing bacteria off the produce than washing under running water. Scrub produce that has a thick, rough skin or rind (such as cantaloupe or potatoes ) or has visible dirt on the surface using a clean vegetable scrubber. Rinse leaves of leafy vegetables (such as lettuce, spinach, cabbage) individually under running water. Packaged salads, slaw mixes and other prepared produce, even when marked pre -washe d, should be rinsed again under running water; a salad spinner or colander can be used to make this easier. Check for \"use by\" dates. Do not eat any raw vegetable sprouts (avoid all types, including alfalfa sprouts, clover sprouts, mung bean sprouts, and so on) due to high risk of Salmonella and E. coli contamination. Cooked mung bean sprouts are acceptable. Throw away fruits and vegetables that are slimy or show mold. Review the processing procedure if preparing home -canned foods. Be sure the procedure is appropriate for the acidity of the food, size of the bottle, and elevation above sea level. Look for mold and leaks. Check seals. If you suspect a home -canned food may not have been properly processed (for example, if the lid bulges or if the food ha s any bad odor or unusual characteristics after opening), THROW IT AWAY. It is recommended to use home canned foods within one year of canning as chemical changes may occur. Avoid cross c ontamination Use a clean knife for cutting different foods (for example, use different knives for cutting meat, produce and bread). During food preparation, do not taste the food with the same utensil used for stirring. Use a clean utensil each time you taste food while preparing or cooking. In the refrigerator, stor e raw meat separately from ready -to-eat foods. When grilling, always use a clean plate and utensils for the cooked meat. 105 Keep foods at safe t emperatures Proper thermometer u se Test a thermometer's accuracy by putting it into boiling water. It should re ad 212oF. Read the manufacturer's instructions. Insert the meat thermometer into the middle of the thickest part of the food to test for doneness. The entire part of the stem, from the dimple to the tip, must be inserted into the food. For thin foods, in sert the t hermometer sideways. A refrigerator thermometer should be placed on a shelf toward the back of the refrigerator. It should read 40oF or less. Refrigeration Keep the refrigerator temperature between 34 F to 40F. Keep the freezer temperature be low 0F to 2F. Never leave perishable food out of the refrigerator for over two hours . Throw away food left out longer than two hours. Marinate foods in the refrigerator. Thaw foods in the refrigerator, never on the counter. Thaw meat, fish or poultry i n the refrigerator away from raw fruits and vegetables and other prepared foods. Place on a dish to catch drips. Cook defrosted meat right away; do not refreeze. If you are in a hurry you can thaw meat in the microwave. The m eat must be cooked immediate ly after thawing . Cool hot foods uncovered in shallow containers in the refrigerator. Cover storage containers after cooling. Make sure that covers seal tightly. Throw away all prepared food after 72 hours (3 days). Use labe ls or masking tape to write dates on containers. Freeze foods that will not be used within 2 to 3 days. NEVER TASTE FOOD THAT LOOKS OR SMELLS STRANGE! Cook foods a dequately Cook meat until it is no longer pink and the juices run clear. These are signs that the meat may be cooked to a high enough temperature. However, the only way to be sure that the meat has been cooked to the proper temperature is to use a food thermometer (See Table 1 on the next page). Thoroughly heat until steaming (165 \u00b0F) all hot dogs and \"ready to eat\" lu ncheon meats, cold cuts and \"deli -style\" meats before eating. Do not eat raw, lightly cooked, or soft boiled eggs. Do not eat uncooked foods containi ng raw or undercooked eggs, such as raw cookie dough, cake batter or salad dressings containing raw or codd led eggs. Pasteurized eggs and liquid pasteurized egg products (such as EggBeaters) may be used in recipes calling for raw eggs in foods that will not be cooked. Hold food at safe temperatures: hot food above 140\u00b0F, cold food below 40\u00b0F. 106 Recommended minimum cooking temperatures Microwave c ooking Microwave cooking can leave cold spots in food where bacteria can survive. Rotate the dish a quarter turn once or twice during cooking if there is no turntable in the appliance. When heating leftovers, use a lid or vented plastic wrap to cover the m. Stir several times during reheating. When the food is heated thoroughly (to a minimum of 165oF), cover and l et sit for 2 minutes before serving. Produc t Cooking temperature or v isual characteristics Eggs, egg dishes, and c asseroles Eggs Cook until yolk and white are firm casseroles, foods containing eggs, custards and egg sauces 160\u00b0F Veal, beef, pork, lamb, rabbit, goat, game Whole pieces meat 160\u00b0F Ground veal, beef, lamb, pork, rabbit, goat, game 160\u00b0F Poultry (chicken, turkey, duck, goose) Chicken and turkey: whole bird and dark meat (leg, thigh, wing) 180\u00b0F Breast, roast 170\u00b0F Ground chicken, turkey 165\u00b0F Stuffing (always cook in sepa rate container outside of bird) 165\u00b0F Ham Fresh (raw) 160\u00b0F Pre-cooked (to reheat) 160\u00b0F Seafood Fin fish (such as salmon, cod, halibut, snapper, sole, bass, trout) Cook until opaque and flakes easily with a fork Shrimp, lobster, crayfish, crab Should turn red and flesh should become pearly opaque Scallops Should turn milk white or opaque and firm Clams, mussels, oysters Cook until shells open (may be high risk food for people with low white count or immunosuppressed) Leftovers, hot dogs , and luncheon meats Leftovers 165\u00b0F Hot dogs, luncheon meat Steaming hot 107 Additional guidelines for g eneral oncology patien ts with low white blood c ount* and all stem hematopoietic transplant p atients *Low white blood cell count refers to a neutrophil count less than 1000mm3 or when chemoth erapy is held due to low neutrophil count. Dining out s afely Eat early to avoid crowds. Ask that food be prepared fresh in fast food establishments (for example, a hamburger should be fresh off the grill, not one that has been sitting under heat lamps). Ask if fruit juices are pasteurized. Avoid raw fruits and vegetables when dining out. Eat these items when prepared at home, where you can wash them thoroughly and prepare them safely. Ask for single -serving condiment packages. Do not use public self -serve condiment containers, including salsa. Avoid salad bars, delicatessens, buffet s and smorgasbords, potlucks and sidewalk vendors. Be sure that utensils are set on a napkin or clean tablecloth or placement, rather than directly on the table. Check the g eneral condition of the restaurant. Are the plates, glasses, and utensils clean? Are the restrooms clean and stocked with soap and paper towels? How clean the restaurant looks may tell the amount of care taken while preparing the food. If you want to ke ep your leftovers, ask the server to bring you a box into which you can transfer the food yourself, rather than having your food transferred into a box in the restaurant kitchen. Be sure to take home and refrigerate the leftovers immediately. Other f oods Do not eat soft cheeses such as feta, Brie, Camembert, blue -veined, Stilton . Fet a, brie, goat and Mexican - style cheese (queso fresco) are acceptable if heated to steaming . Cut tofu into 1 -inch cubes or smaller and boil 5 minutes in water or broth before e ating or using in recipes. (Note: This process is not needed if using pasteurize d tofu or aseptically packaged shelf -stable tofu such as Mori -Nu silken tofu.) Choose shelf -stable salsas and salad dressing (shelf -stable refers to unopened canned, bottled, or packaged food products that can be stored at room temperature before opening; the container may require refrigeration after opening.) Avoid fresh fruit or ve getable salsas and salad dressing found in the refrigerated section of the grocery store. Do not consume raw honey or honeycomb. Choose Grade A honey. 108 Water safety guidelines Overview Public water quality and treatment varies throughout the United S tates, so always check with the local health department and water utility regarding the safety of household and community tap water and ice for use by immunosuppressed persons. These guidelines should be followed before and after all conditioning therapy (chemotherapy and/or radiation) and while on immunosuppressive medications. Your health care pr ovider and dietitian will let you know when the water safety guidelines are no longer required. In general, we recommend the following: Autologous transplant patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment only: follow th ese guidelines during the first three m onths after chemotherapy or transplant. Allogeneic transplant patients: follow the guidelines until you r child is off all immunosuppressive therapy such as cyclosporine, prednisone, Tacrolimus\u00ae, Myfortic\u00ae, sirolimus, or MMF. Before end of these time peri ods, you should talk to your child's health care provider and dietitian regarding whet her or not to continue any part of the guidelines. Tap w ater Water from your home faucet is considered safe if your water is from a city water supply or a municipal well serving highly populated areas. Well w ater Well water from private or small community wells is not considered safe for consumption by persons considered immunosuppressed and at risk for infection unless it is tested daily and found to be negative for col iforms and Cryptosporidium organisms. Examp les of ways well water could become contaminated: Construction occurs near the well Well depth is shallow Well is located near a dairy farm or large numbers of livestock Flooding has recently occurred in the we ll area Municipal wells : Drinking well wate r from municipal wells serving highly populated areas is considered safe because the water is tested for bacterial contamination more than two times each day. Private and small community wells : The quality of we ll water from these sources cannot be guaranteed unless it is tested daily and found to be negative for coliforms and Cryptosporidium organisms. It is recommended that other approved water sources be used instead , including : boiled water or bottled water ( see guidelines below). Not considered safe : Common home water filtration devices do not remove bacteria or viruses. If the well water supply is chlorinated per guidelines provided by your local health department, the chlorinated wa ter treated with one or more of the following is considered safe to consume: Reverse osmosis treated Distillation Filtered through an absolute 1 micron or smaller filter ( NSF Standard #53 for cyst removal) See \"Water Filters\" (below). 109 Safe water s ources The following sources of water are suggested if your water is not from a city water or municipal well supply: Boiled Water : At home, safe water can be made by bringing tap water to a rolling boil for one minute. After processing, the water should be stored in a clean, covered c ontainer in the refrigerator; discard water not used within 72 hours (3 days). Distilled Water Water may be distilled using a steam distillation system. After processing, the water should be stored in a clean, covered containe r in the refrigerator; disca rd water not used within 72 hours (3 days). Bottled Water Acceptable forms of bottled water have been processed to remove organisms known to cause stomach or intestinal infection. Bottled water labels reading \"well water\", water\" do not guarantee that the water is safe to drink. Water labeled as having been treated with one or more of the following are considered safe: Reverse osmosis treated Distillation Filtered through an absolute 1 micron or smaller filter ( NSF Standard #53 for cyst removal) To be sure that a specific brand of bottled water has undergone one of the above processes, contact the International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) at 1-800-928-3711 , or visit their home page at www.bottledwater.org . If the IBWA does not have information on a specific brand, call the bottling company directly. IBWA follow more strict manufacturing practices in their water bott ling process than those practices curren tly mandated by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Therefore, water bottled by a member of the IBWA may be preferable to water produced by non -member bottlers. Water filters Most water filtration devices will not make the water safe if the w ater supply has not been previously chlorinated. If you choose to install water filters on household water taps purchase only filters certified by NSF International. The following specific ations must also be met: a. The filters must be designed to remove co liforms and Cryptosporidium . Any of the following are acceptable: Reverse osmosis filter Absolute pore size of filter 1 micron or smaller Tested and certified by NSF Standard #53 for cyst removal b. The water tap filter must be installed immediately before t he water tap c. Manufacturer directions must be followed for filter maintenance and replacement Portable water filters (such as a Brita\u00ae or Pur\u00ae system) as well as refrigerator -dispense d water and ice machine systems do not meet filtration standards. Portab le water systems filter out chemical impurities, not bacteria. If a portable water system (such as a Brita\u00ae pitcher) is used in combination with a safe water supply (to improve water flavor and remove chlorine and other impurities), it is recommended to c hange the system's filters frequently according to manufacturer's guidelines. For a list of approved filtrat ion systems, call the National Sanitation Foundation International , at 1-800-673-8010 or visit www.NSF.org (see \"Home Water Treatment Devices\"). 110 Diet guidelines for immunosuppressed p atients Overview You may have decreased immune function because of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy or from taking medications to suppress your immune system. This means that you are at increased risk of developing a food - related infection. The purpose of this diet is to help you avoid specific foods that are more likely to contain infection -causing organisms while allowing maximum healthy food choices. Choose foods from the \"May Eat\" column. Do not eat foods in the \"Do Not Eat\" column. You may want to discuss the safety of the se or other foods with your dietitian. This diet should be followed before and after all conditioning therapy (chemotherapy and/or radiation)and while on immunosuppressive medications. Your health care provider and dietitian will let you know when the diet is no longer required. In general, we recommend the following: For autologous transplant patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment only: Follow this diet during the first three months after chemotherapy or transplant. For allogeneic transplant patients: Follow the diet until you are off all immunosuppressive therapy such as cyclosporine, prednisone, Tacrolimus\u00ae, Myfortic\u00ae, sirolimus, or MMF. Before end of these time periods, you and your caregiver should talk to your h ealth care provider and dietitian regarding whether or not to continue any part of the diet.

You may find that you r child is not eating th e way he normally do es because of nausea, mouth and throat soreness, lack of appetite, or changes in the way foods taste. Use these tips to help you: Keep in mind that your child's calorie needs are higher during your transplant. Keep your child's body nourished even during the times he does not feel like eating. Your child will be using some medications that can be hard on his kidneys, so it is important to drink lots of fluids. Fluids include all beverages, smoothies, yogurt, ice cream, popsicles, and so ups. Your dietit ian wi ll give you a goal for daily fluid intake. Protein is needed for repair, growth, and fluid balance. Regularly i nclude high protein foods such as eggs, milk/dairy products, meat/poultry/fish, beans, nuts, or high protein smoothies. Eat smaller, more frequ ent meals; snack often, and keep beverages handy at all times. Use a water bottle to keep beverages close all day long. Foods will probably taste differently for a while. This will pass, but you r child may need to make some adjustment s to the way he eats. Drink beverages with meals or snacks if your mouth is dry. And remember, what does not taste good to day might taste good tomorrow. Tell your doctor or nurse if you r child is having nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn, or mouth and throat pain. A dietitian can answer questions you might have or help you find the foods that will work for you r child . This education resource was intended to be given as a part of a nutrition consult by an SCCA dietitian. Questions? Ask an SCCA dietitian at nutrition@seatt lecca.org 115 Nourishing food suggestions If your child do es not feel hungry , has a sore mouth , and/or taste changes, eating can be challenging. To make it easier, we have some suggestions for stocking a kitchen with ingredients for fast, healthy, and flavorful meals and snacks: For the refrigerator Yogurt o Look for at least 10 grams protein per serving o Consider getting plain yogurt and adding your own fruit and sweetener (such as honey) Ginger Ale, can be taken hot or cold Lemons and limes to enhance flavor Premade, pasteurized smoothies Nut butters (peanut, almond, or cashew) Eggs cheese: easy to eat and prot ein-rich Single -serve cheese packages: o String cheese or cheddar o Babybel \u00ae or Laughing Cow \u00ae cheese rounds For the freezer Frozen/microwavable meals. For example: o Whole -wheat macaroni and cheese o Pot pies or single -serve casserole dishes o Oven -baked swee t potato wedges Frozen Magic Mineral Broth - freeze in ice cube trays for single servings. Ask your dietitian for the Recipe Packet for details. Whole fruit popsicles or sorbets 116 Tips on e ating if you have thick, viscous saliva: Switch to mostly fluid food s. Drinking more total fluids will help to loosen mucous. Club soda, seltzer, hot tea with lemon, or sucking on lemon drops may help to break up the mucous. Milk and dense liquids are sometimes hard to swallow when there is excess mucous. If you have nause a in the morning from mucous build up, try eating a lighter breakfast. Avoid thick nectars and juices, cream so ups, and bread products. Some foods to try : Beverages Proteins Seltzer water, diluted nectars and juices Thinned fruit smoothies Tea with lemon Clear broth soups Sugar -free lemon drops, sour candies Moist, cooked fish and chicken Thin, broth -based soups Breads and cereals Fruit and vegetables Hot cereals thinned with milk or water Blended fruits or vegetables diluted to a thin consistency High moisture fruits such as melon 117 Tips on eating if your mouth and throat are sore : A soft, bland diet will cause less irritation . Avoid rough, acidic, and spicy foods. Popsicles and slushies (frozen beverages) may help to soothe your mouth and throat and quench your thirst. Try smaller bites of foods that don't take much chewing. Avoid ext reme hot and cold food temperatures. Canned fruits are usually softer than fresh, raw fruits and cause less discomfort. Some foods to try: Beverages and seasonings Proteins Herbal teas Diluted juices Smoothies/shakes Popsicles Low-salt homemade or canned soups (can be put in the blender to change texture) Herbs for seasoning: thyme, basil, oregano, bay leaf Blended meats and casseroles Bland entrees: macaroni and cheese, souffl\u00e9s, bland quiches, creamed chicken, spaghetti with cream sauce Milk Eggnog Cottage cheese, yogurt, cream cheese Custard, pudding Breads and cereals Fruit and vegetables Hot cereal; may be thinned with milk Dry cereals soaked in milk Plain cooked pasta Mashed potatoes with butter Cool fruits, especially watermelon, honeydew, grapes, papaya Canned fruits, blended if needed Pureed baby fruits Diluted fruit nectars Cold blended homemade soups: cucumber, avocado, potato 118 Tips on eating if your mouth is dry: Dry foods like meats and breads will be easier to swallow if served in a liquid, such as gravy or broth. Dip cookies in milk or cocoa , or eat with ice cream. Pour sauces over cake and gravy over breads. Citric acid, found in citrus fruits an d fruit juices, may help to stimulate saliva; try addin g lemon to tea, water, and soda. Do not eat dry crackers, unless dipped in broth or gravy. Do not eat really hot foods. Keep beverages handy when eating any food to keep your mouth moist between bites. Some foods to try: Beverages and other items Proteins Beverages with meals Tea with lemon, lemonade Sherbet Sugar -free sour candies Biotene gum, toothpaste, mouth rinse Oral Balance mouth gel Tender, moist fish and chicken with gravy or sauce Cassero les French dip sandwiches Milk, milkshakes, malts Eggnog Breads and cereals Fruit and vegetables Cooked cereals Dry cereals soaked in milk Vegetables with sauces Melon, peaches Canned fruits Fruit juices and nectars 119 Calorie and protein guide For calo rie and protein information, ask your dietitian for the booklet, \"A Guide to Good Nutrition.\" Food records Follow these steps: Use a new food record sheet each day ( you can ask for more records from your dietitian). Record your child's name and da te. Do n ot write in the \"Code\" columns. Write down the time you r child eats or drink s each food. Note if the food is vomited up and what time. Turn the food record over and a nswer the questions on the back. Bring your completed food record sheet to each nutrition appointment, every time you come for a blood draw, and for every clinic appointment. How to record fluids on your food record: Include water, juice, milk, soup, ice cream, sherbet, Jell -O\u00ae, Kool -Aid\u00ae, soda , and yogurt. Record fluids as cups, ounces (oz .), or millili ters (mL ). Describe drinks clearly, such as: 2% milk or whole milk. Specify how much sugar you add when sweetening tea or other drinks. List each ingredient of special drinks (such as homemade milkshakes). How to record solid foods on your f ood record : Cereal : Measure with a measuring cup. Include the amounts of milk and sugar added. State if milk is used in the preparation of cooked cereals. Condiments and snacks : Include these, as they are important sources of calories. Please write them ou t on your record! Be specific about the amount you use (1 t easpoon, 2 tablespoons, and so on ). Examples are: - Butter or margarine (on toast, sandwiches, potatoes, oatmeal, etc.) - Mayonnaise or salad dressing - Syrup, jam, or honey - Olives or pickles - Nuts or sun flower seeds - Potato chips or other kinds of chips Fruits and vegetables : State whether fresh or canned. Measure cooked ones with a measuring cup or state number (such as 3 French fries). Estimate raw foods, such as \"one m edium tomato\" or \"3 carrot sticks\" or \"\u00bd large banana.\" Meat, cheese, and eggs : State how meat or eggs are prepared (fried, roasted, broiled, and so on ). State whether you eat the skin of poultry. List portion size by the dimension or cup: 1 hamburger patty, 3\" diameter x 1/2\" thick ; 1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese . Some foods can be listed by the piece: 1 scrambled egg , 1 small chicken thigh without skin , 5 potato chips 120 How to record soups: State whether homemade, canned, or dehydrated. State if creamed soups are made with milk or water. How to record mixed items: List recipes for casseroles, pasta dishes, sandwich ingredients, and contents of tacos, pizzas, hamburgers, and hotdogs. How to record s pecial products, frozen dinners, and so on : Tape onto your food record the nutrient in formation from TV dinners, protein powders, canned foods, or other products with which we may not be familiar. How to record brand names foods: Include these , as the brand name can be he lpful. Examples are: \u00be McDonald's Big Mac\u00ae 1.6 oz Butterfinger\u00ae candy bar How to record food when eating out: State fast food or restaurant names and the foods and beverages you eat. 121 Herbal and nutrient supplement s Your child may be using nutrient supplements or herbal preparations . Your dietitian and doctor will ask about any supplements or herbals your child uses during their initial evaluation. Stop use of all herbal and nutrient supplements at this time . These supplements may affect tre atment or even cause a serious infection. There are four main concerns about the use of nutritional supplements, herbals , and other preparations during marrow or stem cell transplantation or high dose chemotherapy: 1. Interactions between herbal supplements and prescribed medications may reduce the effectiveness of drugs routinely used du ring transplantation or chemotherapy. 2. Potential contamination of preparations derived from plants may cause bacterial, fungal , or parasitic infections because of inadequate purification and sterilization. Even boiling water may not destroy some infectious organisms that can contaminate these pr oducts. 3. A few specific preparations have been repeatedly associated with serious toxic side effects to the liver, blood, kidneys, heart , and other body organs. 4. The production, distribution, and labeling of herbal pre parations and nutrient supplements are n ot regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As a result, the dosage may vary from the dose listed on the label. Also, the product might contain ingredients not listed on the label. Herbal and botanical preparations Herbal and botanical preparat ions include a variety of products derived directly from plants. They may be sold as tablets, capsules, liquid extracts, teas, powders, and topical preparations. There are no manufacturing regulations for the cleanli ness or purity of these products. There is a danger the products may be contaminated with fungus, bacteria, parasites or other chemicals, which can be life -threatening to a person with an impaired immune system, including persons receiving chemotherapy or transplantation. Even boiling water may not kill some organisms that can contaminate these products. It is recommended that your child avoid all herbal a nd botanical products during chemotherapy and as long as her immune system is impaired. Make t he decis ion to use any preparation with your doctor , who will consider how the product affects your child's kidneys, liver, and other organs, your child's risk of infection , and any interactions it may have with other medications. Some herbals may decrease blood clotting. If you r child has low platelet counts, do not take garlic and gingko biloba . Do not use any product that is given as an injection into the central line or as an injection under the skin. Several herbal and botanical medications have very dangerou s side effects and should not be taken under any circumstance. These include: Alfalfa Black Helle bore Wort Yohimbe an d Yohimbine 122 Vitamin and mineral supplements and antioxidants Your child will be prescribed a multiple vitamin and mineral supplement that provides nutrients at about the same levels of the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI). In some instances, you may wish that your child takes higher doses of specific vitamins, minera ls, or antioxidants. Talk to your registered dietitian before your child takes any additional vitamin and mineral supplements. Higher doses may be toxic or interact with other medications. Antioxidants A high intake of some antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, and \u00df -carotene) may protect against the development of certain types of cancer. However, taking antioxidant supplements during radiation and chemotherapy may reduce the effectiveness of th ese treatments in destroying diseased cells. Therefor e, your child should stop antioxidant supplementation before chemotherapy and radiation. Antioxidants may be inappropriate post -transplant because of interactions with medications, immunosuppressive ther apy, or other vitam ins and minerals in your child's body. B vitamins The B vitamins (thiamin, niacin, riboflavin, (B 6), folate, and pantothenic acid) are water -soluble nutrients that assist in energy production. High levels of supplementation may not be toxic. However, it is important to maintain a balance among these B - vitamins. High doses of one may have a negative eff ect. Specific recommendations As your child's immune system begins to recover and strengthen, he may be able to include herbal supplements and vitamins in his diet, depend ing on the type of transplant he had. Some people wish to start using the supplemen ts they were taking before transplant. It is critical to check with your child's health care team before taking any vitamin or herbal supplement, as some may put his still immature immune system at risk. Allogeneic transplantation Your child is at risk for infections until all immunosuppressive medications have been stopped and is free of active chronic GVHD (graft versus host disease). Immunosuppressive medications line care What is a central venou s catheter? A central venous catheter, or central line, is a small flexible tube inserted into a large vein in your child's chest. It is used to give your child fluid, nutrients, medicine, and blood products. It may also be used to get blood samples. A cen tral venous catheter is also called a central line, tunneled catheter, central venous line, or Hickman line . In this section , we will refer to it as a \"central line\". There are m any types of central lines. Note: A c entral lin e should not be used for oral medications. A central line is not the same as a nasogastric (NG) tube. How is the central line placed ? Inserting the c entral line is a minor surgical procedure. It is done in an operating room and takes about 1 hour. Your child's doctor will use general anesthesia (full sleep) to numb their neck and chest. During the surgery, your child's doctor will make 2 small incisions. Your ch ild will have 1 small incision at the bottom of their neck, by their collar bone, where the central line enters their vein. The other incision will be in their upper chest where the central line exits their body. The central line is threaded through a \"tun nel\" under the skin between these 2 sites. Your child will likely have a few stitches placed to help secure the central line . Your child will have a dressing (bandage) placed on top of each incision site. A small cuff on the central line helps hold it in place in the tunnel underneath the skin. This cuff also acts as a barrier to help prevent bacteria on your child's skin from traveling up the central line tunnel and into their bloodstream. Will it hurt? Your child's shoulder and chest a rea may be sore for a few days after the central line is placed. They may be prescribed a mild pain reliever. It helps for your child t o move their shoulder and neck right after surgery to keep the area from getting stiff. What instructions should we follow after the procedure? Do not give your child over -the-counter (non -prescription) pain medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae) and ibup rofen (Advil\u00ae) without checking with your care team first . Secure the line by dressing your child in a tight -fitting tank top/undershirt or sports bra for at least 1 night after placement. Do not let your child lift anything heavier than 5 pounds for 3 day s after their surgery. Do not let them participate in any activities that strain their chest muscles. 124 How do we care for the central line? The day after your surgery, your child will have an appointment to get their dressing changed for the first time. The dressing over the central line exit site will need ongoing care as long as they have the cen tral line in place. This care is described in the rest of this packet. Parts of the central line 125 Central line care tasks You will need to care for y our child's central line daily to prevent infection. Care involves cleaning the central line, flushing the lumens (lines), protecting the central line from water, and changing the dressing. The chart below gives an overview of th is care. Central line car e How often Clean central line Use alcohol wipes Change tape tabs, if using Daily Flush lumens Daily or with each use Protect line from water: Put Parafilm\u00ae on end caps Put AquaGuard\u00ae or Press'n Seal\u00ae over dressing When bathing/showering Change dre ssing Every 7 days for Tegaderm\u00ae CHG or other clear dressing Every 1 -2 days for gauze and tape dressing 126 Supplies to care for your child's central line Below are the supplies used to care for your child's central line. You may receive some of them from a home infusion company or SCCA. If not, all of them are available online, but Press'n Seal, alcohol wipes, plastic tape, and gloves can usually be found a t a grocery or drug store. If you have any questions about which supplies you should buy , please contact your care team nurse. Supplies Parafilm AquaGuard or Press'n Seal; you do not need both Alcohol prep pads Plastic tape \u2014do not use paper, cloth, scotch, or masking tape Medical gloves Bulldog clamp 2 lanyards Cloth pouches 127 Important notes on central line care Keep your child's line safe Keep the bulldog clamp with you r child at all times. The bulldog clamp is a safety clamp . If the central line leaks, gets cut, or breaks, clamp the central line close to your child's chest and call the clinic immediately. Secure your child's central line one of the below ways to prevent acci dental removal of the line: o Place central line ends in a clean cloth pouch and secure the pouch with a bulldog clamp to clothing or a lanyard. Pouches are for one-day use and should be washed daily; OR o Place plastic tape tabs between clamp and cap on the central line and change daily. Use the plasti c tape tabs and bulldog clamp to secure the central line to clothing or a lanyard. Always p lace the central line clamp on the thick, reinforced area of the line . Protect your child's line from water Always cover your child's central line dressing with a plastic covering such as AquaGuard or Press'n Seal to prevent water from entering the dressing and exit site . The uncovered dressing and exit site should never come in contact with water. Always securely wrap your child's central line end caps with Parafilm to prevent water from entering the cap top or into the connection to the central line . If you notice moisture under the Parafilm, ask to have your child's end caps changed in the clinic. Clea n your child's line Clean your child's lumens once a day with alcohol wipes after your bath or shower . If using plastic tape tabs to secure your child's line, replace tape tabs each day. Your child's care team will tell you how often to change their chil d's dressing and if you will change it yourself or have it changed in the clinic. If your child's dressing starts to come off, gets wet, or if there is moisture underneat h it, it needs to be changed right away. Call your care team to get your child's dressing changed in the clinic as soon as possible. You may change it yourself if you have been taught how to do this and have the correct supplies at home . Do not Do not remove the end cap s off of your child's central line . Do not let end caps, central line or dressing go under your child's bath water. Do not allow your child to go into swimming pools and hot tubs. Do not store central line supplies in a moist (humid) area, such as the bathroom or kitchen. Do not use scissors near your child's central line. 128 Cleaning your child's central line It is important to clean your child's central line daily. This helps to prevent infection. See instructions below for how to do this. Supplies 4 or more alcohol wipes (use 2 per lumen) Plastic tape, if using Instructions 1. If using tape tabs, remove plastic tape tabs. If not using tape tabs, go to step 2. 2. Use 2 alcohol wipes, 1 to hold the line and 1 to clean it. Start where the line exi ts the dressing and wipe towards the end cap. Using the same alcohol wipes, clean the clamps. 3. If using plastic tape tabs, replace them. Fold about \u00bd inch of tape over at each end to make the tab easier to remove. 4. Repeat this for each lumen. Note: After cleaning longer lines, secure the central line one of the below ways to prevent accidental removal of the line: o Place central line in a clean cloth pouch and secure the pouch with a bulldog clamp to clothing or a lanyard . Pouch es are for one -day use and should be washed daily; OR o Place plastic tape tabs between clamp and cap on the central line and change daily. Use the plastic tape tabs and bulldog clamp to secure the central line to clothing or a lanyard. 129 Flushing your child's central line Flush you r child's central line with saline and heparin at least once a day or at the end of an infusion . Heparin helps prevent a clot within the central line. The daily heparin flush is still required even if you r child is on any oral or injectable blood thinners to prevent or treat a blood clot . When to flush the central line Flush each lumen with saline followed by hep arin at least once each day and after each use. If you r child has a blood draw or infusion at the clinic, the central line will be flushed there . You do not need to flush it again at home. If your child is doing an infusion at home: o Flush the central line at the beginning of the infusion with saline only. o Flush the central line at the end of the infusion with saline followed by heparin. If yo ur child is receiving antibiotics at home, their care team will instruct you to alternate yo ur infusions of antibiotics between the lines of their catheter . How to flush the central line Gather your supplies and then follow steps 1 through 1 6 below Supp lies 2, 5 ml syringes with saline flush 2, 3 ml syringes with heparin flush Alcohol wipes 1 pair of gloves *You need a prescription for saline and heparin syringes. Instructions 1. Wash your hands. 2. Place all supplies on a clean surface. Remove t he syringe(s) from their package(s) by peeling the plastic downward. 130 3. Put on clean gloves. Vigorously scrub the central line end cap with an alcohol wipe for 15 seconds (count one one -thousand, two one thousand, etc.) using a twisting motion as if y ou were juicing an orange. Take special care to clean the tip of the cap. Allow the cap to dry completely (at least 5 seconds). 4. Start with the saline syringe . Hold the syringe with the cap on, pointed towards the ceiling, and remove the cap of the syri nge. Carefully remove the air bubble by gently pulling down and then pushing up on the plunger. Do not touch the end of the syringe because it is sterile. If you touch it, throw it out. 5. Do not touch the tip of the end cap or the end of the saline syringe with your hand . Insert the saline syringe into the center of the end cap by pushing in and turning clockwise. Suggesti on: A flushing routine that starts with the same color lumen is helpful for remembering which lumen has been flushed. 6. Unclamp t he central line. 7. Push the plunger on the saline syringe with alternating pressure and release (starting and stopping to create turbulence) to inject the fluid into the central line. This keeps clots from forming in the central line. Leave \u00bd ml of sali ne in the syringe. 8. Clamp the central line (leaving \u00bd ml of saline in the syringe) while keeping your thumb on end of the plunger of the syringe. 131 9. Remove the syringe. Hold the end cap , not the central line, when disconnecting from your line . Throw sy ringe away in regular garbage can. 10. Next, use the heparin syringe . Hold the syringe with the cap on, pointed towards the ceiling, and remove the cap of the syringe. Carefully remove the air bubble by gently pulling down and then pushing up on the plung er. Do not touch the end of the syringe because it is sterile. If you touch it, throw it out. 11. Do not touch the tip of the end cap or the end of the heparin syringe with your hand. Insert the heparin syringe into the center of the end cap by pushing in and turning clockwise. Suggesti on: A flushing routine that starts wit h the same color lumen is helpful for remembering which lumen has been flushed. 12. Unclamp the central line. 13. Push the plunger on the heparin syringe with alternating pressure and re lease (starting and stopping to create turbulence) to inject the fluid into the central line. This keeps clots from forming in the central line. Leave \u00bd ml of heparin in the syringe. 14. Clamp the central line (leaving \u00bd ml of heparin in the syringe) while keeping your thumb on end of the plunger of the syringe. 132 15. Remove the syringe. Hold the end cap, not the central line , when disconnecting from your line. Throw syringe away in regular garbage can. 16. Repeat steps for each lumen. 133 Protecting your child's central line when bathing or showering It is important to protect your child's central line from water. You will do this by covering the end caps with Parafilm and covering the dressing with AquaGuard or Press'n Seal. Repeat the instructions belo w for each end cap. Supplies Gather your supplies and then follow steps 1 through 9 below. Parafilm AquaGuard or Press'n Seal Clean cloth pouch or tape tabs Alcohol wipes Bulldog clamp Lanyard Instructions 1. Wash your hands. 2. Place Parafilm on central line end cap and tubing connection. Use 4 squares for each side of your child's central line. a) Peel Parafilm from adhesive cover backing. b) Stretch the Parafilm. This makes it stick to itself. c) Place it over the end cap of the central line. Picture of 4 squares of Parafilm. 134 d) Fold Parafilm over the top of the end cap (like you would seal the top of an envelope). Make sure it covers the connection point between the end cap and the central line. This will make it waterproof. 3. Wrap only around the thicker part of the end of t he central line. The Parafilm will fit closely around the end cap and will stick to itself. Make a tab on the end so it will be easier to remove. Use the heat of your hand and grip onto the wrapped end cap to mold the Parafilm around the central l ine. 4. Cover the entire dressing with a square of AquaGuard or Press'n Seal. If you are using Press'n Seal, it may be helpful to use a piece large enough to drape over your shoulder. The central line lumens should hang out of the bottom edge of AquaGuard or Press 'n Seal. Reinforce the edges with medical tape if it does not stay secure. 5. Place the Parafilm -covered central line ends in a pouch and secure with a bulldog clamp to the lanyard. You may also secure with a lanyard with the bulldog clamp applied to the ce ntral line. 6. If your child takes a bath, the central line should be kept above the water level at all times. If they shower, the dressing should be kept out of the direct stream of water. 7. After bathing, dry the AquaGuard or Press'n Seal with a t owel, then remove and throw it away. 8. Dry the Parafilm with a towel, then remove from central line end caps - DO NOT USE SCISSORS. After removing, test end cap connections to ensure they are secure. 9. If there is moisture underneath the dres sing or if it has come loose, the dressing should be changed. 10. Clean both of your child's lumens once a day with alcohol wipes and replace plastic tape tabs, if using. Note: For longer lines, s ecure the central line one of the below ways to prevent accidental removal o f the line: o Place central line in a clean cloth pouch and secure the pouch with a bulldog clamp to clothing or a lanyard. Pouches are for one -day use and should be washed daily; OR o Place plastic tape tabs b etween clamp and cap on the central line and chang e daily. Use the plastic tape tabs and bulldog clamp to secure the central line to clothing or a lanyard. 135 Troubleshooting your child's central line Problem Solution s Line does not flush. 1. Check to see if central line is clamped or kinked. 2. Call the SCCA clinic or after -hours numbers for instructions. Fluid is leaking from the central line .

You may be taught how to change your child's dressing at home. If so, please follow the instructions below. While your child has their central line, please: Look at their dressin g and exit site e very day. Report any redness, drainag e, or pain to your child's care team. Talk to your child's care team if their skin is sensitive to the dressing. If you r child has a Tegaderm CHG dressing : It should be changed every 7 days. The dressing should also be changed if: o The exit site cannot be seen because of drainage or moisture o The gel pad stays depressed when pressed with finger (this means there is too much moisture in the pad) o The dressing starts to c ome off If you r child has a gauze and tape dressing : o It should be changed every 24 to 48 hours. 137 How to change your child's Tegaderm CHG dressing Supplies 1 ChloraPrep\u00ae applicator (also called chlorhexidine) 7 alcohol pads (4 pads are for cleaning the line -use 2 per lumen - and 3 pads are for removing the dressing) 2 pair s of clean gloves 2 Cavilon No -Sting Barrier Film\u00ae pads or swabs 1 transparent dressing (Tegaderm\u00ae CHG) 1, 10 ml syringe with saline 1 Sterile gauze pad Plastic tape (if using for tape tabs ) Adhesive remover (optional) Instructions 1. Wash your hands with s oap and water and put your supplies on a clean work surface. 2. Put on clean gloves. 3. If present, remove plastic tape near central line end caps. 4. Remove existing dressing. If you r child has a Tegaderm CHG dressing : Remove the old dressing by starting at bottom corner, lifting up and folding back upon itself, pulling \"low and slow\" or rolling with fingers. When gel pad is reached, use an alc ohol pad or adhesive remover if needed to loosen gel pad from central line and skin while continuing to slowly pul l back on dressing, grasping both the gel pad and dressing. Do not use scissors. Remove dressing and throw away. If you r child has a gauze and tape dressing and are switching to Tegaderm CHG: Remove the old gauze and tape dressing and throw away. Do not use scissors. 138 5. Report to your child's nurse if there is: Bleeding or drainage at the central line site. Redness or swelling at the central line site. Pain or discomfort at the central line site. 6. Remove gloves. 7. Wash your hands again. 8. Put on pair of clean gloves. 9. Wet the sterile gauze pad with the sterile saline syringe. Using the gauze pad, cleanse the area around the central line exit site. If there is crust, clean it from the central line exit site using an alcohol wipe, if necessary. If there is a scab, you do not need to remove it. 10. Activate the ChloraPrep applicator by squeezing the wings. Scrub around the central line exit site with ChloraPrep applicator using a back -and-forth motion for 30 seconds. Allow to dry completely for 1 -2 minutes. Make sure the chlorhexidine you used to clean the central line exit and area around the exit site (in the ChloraPr ep One -Step Swab) is completely dry before you apply the Cavilon No -Sting Barrier Film. Alternate cleaning procedure for chlorhexidine allerg y: Use a povidone -iodine swab to clean the exit site in a circular motion, starting at the central line exit site and moving outward away from the exit site. Repeat with the other two povidine -iodine swabs, for a total of 3 cleanings at the exit site. Allo w to air dry and do not wipe off . If you are sensitive to povidone -iodine, you may remove the iodine with a sterile gauze pad soaked with sterile saline syringe. Alternate cleaning procedure for chlorhexidine Use a 70% alcoh ol swab to clean the exit site in circular motion, starting at the central line exit site and moving outward away from the exit site. Repeat with the other two povidine -iodine swabs, for a total of 3 cleanings at the exit site. Allow to air dry and do not wipe off . 139 11. Open two alcohol wipes for each lumen. Use one to hold the line near the exit site and one to wipe it, start at the exit site and wipe towards the end of the line. Take special care to thoroughly scrub around the connection between the line and the central line end caps. Repeat for each lumen. 12. After cleansing has dried completely, apply Cavilon No -Sting Barrier Film to the area that will be under the transparent dressing. Avoid the exit site and the area that will be under the chlorhexi dine gel pad. Allow to dry completely for 1 -2 minutes. 13. Apply new dressing. o Apply Tegaderm CHG transparent dressing by peeling the liner from the dressing, exposing the adhesive surface. o Center the dressing and gel pad over the central line exit site a nd press gently to make it stick. Optional: Make a stress loop with the centr al line to decrease the external length of the line . Make sure the central line comes out of the dressing edge at a notch. o Slowly remove the paper frame from the dressing whil e smoothing down the dressing edge. o Smooth the entire dressing from the center towards the edge using firm pressure to enhance adhesion. If your gloves stick to the dressing, you may remove them. o Remove tape \"wings\" from frame, lift central line, and apply wing across opening of dressing underneath the cent ral line, creating a little hole where the central line comes through. This helps keep the central line secure. o Paint border (outside edges) of transparent dressing with Cavilon No-Sting Barrier Film to create a seal between the transparent dressing and the skin.

Cyclosporine comes in 25 mg and 100 mg capsules , and liquid for oral use. It also comes as an (intravenous) IV preparation. The concentration of cyclosporine liquid is 100 mg/milliliter (ml). You will be told how many milliliters make up your child's cyclosporine dose. For example, 250 mg of cyclospor ine = 2.5 mls . Know your dose and ask the nurse or pharmacist to show you how to find the dosage mark on the measuring device. It is important to take the correct amount of the drug. Blood levels of cyclosporine will be checked at least weekly to make sure that your child's dose is correct. The goal is to maintain a level that is effective without causing toxicities. Cyclosporine can damage kidney function. A high fluid intake helps to flush your child's kidneys and keep them functioning normally. The leve l of creatinine in the b lood is a measure of kidney function. It increases if kidney function decreases. Fluid requirements increase while taking cyclosporine (your dietitian can provide this information) : Goal: _ ( _____ ml/day) Cyclosporine c auses magnesium loss from your body. Your child will probably need to receive magnesium in IV fluid or PN*. As you r child is able to eat and drink, his doctor will prescribe magnesium pills to be taken several times each day. Magnesium pills cause his bowe l movements to become slightly loose or soft. If your child develop diarrhea, tell his doctor, nurse , or dietitian . Most peop le taking cyclosporine cannot get enough magnesium from food alone; thus, a supplement is still needed. You r child can get magnesiu m from these foods: Foods with a lot of magnesium: Foods with some magnesium : Bran cereals Apricots, dried Nuts Brown rice Beet greens Dates Tofu Soybeans Shrimp *PN is parenteral nutrition, a form of nutritional support given intravenou sly. 146 Dose preparation 1. Always wash your hands with warm, soapy water before and after preparing cyclosporine liquid doses . 2. Clean up any drops or spills to protect your family from getting the drug on their skin and to prevent oily stains on clothing or fu rniture. 3. Measure the cyclosporine liquid dose: A measuring device is provided by the manufacturer. Follow the manufactur er's instructions for measuring the cyclosporine. Squirt the cyclosporine into the desired diluting liquid. Stir well and drink at once. It is best to use a glass container and rinse it with more liquid to ensure the total dose is taken. After use, dry the syringe with a clean paper towel or tissue and replace it in the clear case. To avoid cloudiness, do not rinse the syringe with water o r other cleaning agents. If the syringe requires cleaning, it must be completely dry before using it again. Cyclosporin e blood levels On the day your child is to have blood levels measured, do not administer his morning cyclosporine dose until after the b lood draw. Bring the cyclosporine with you to SCCA if you do not plan to return home after blood draw. Your child's nurse will inform you of his cyclosporine blood draw day. Beverage and food recommendations Most people prefer to take the liquid format of cyclosporine with a flavored beverage. Oral cyclosporine should not be taken with beverages containing the enzyme bergamottin such as grapefruit or grapefruit hybrids such as tangelos or honeybell oranges, Sunny Delight \u00ae, Fresca \u00ae, Squirt \u00ae, or Earl Grey t ea. Please consult your d ietitian, pharmacist, or nurse if you have questions about taking oral cyclosporine with other fruit juices or beverages. It is good to eat breakfast or a small snack before taking the morning dose of oral cyclosporine. Some peopl e find that taking cyclosporine by mouth on an empty stomach can result in nausea. If you r child has eaten dinner within 2 to 3 hours, he may not need to eat again right before taking the evening cyclosporine dose. If cyclosporine continues to cause nausea , talk with your child's nurse, doctor, or dietitian. Storage Store cyclosporine, either liquid or capsules, at room temperature only. Do not store cyclosporine in the refrigerator or freezer or expose it to heat or strong light. Throw away partly used bottles of cyclosporine when two months have passed since opening. Keep your cyclosporine with you when you travel. Store the bottle in a plastic bag to protect purse, carry -on bag , or clothing. Refills Call the SCCA Pharmacy when your supply of cyclospori ne gets low. Allow 24 hours for refills. Once you are discharged for home, cyclosporine will be prescribed by your local doctor. It can be obtained from your local pharmacy. Plan ahead with your doctor and pharmacist. Do not wait u ntil you are completely o ut of medicine to get a refill. 147 IV cyclosporine Rate: As prescribed. Cyclosporine can cause burning in hands and feet if it spills on your or your child's skin. If this occurs, call SCCA at (206) 606 -7600 or the after-hours clinic at (206) 987-2032 (pediatrics). Cyclosporine must be infused in the white port only. Do not infuse in the blood draw side of your central line. Keep IV cyclosporine in the refrigerator. Tacrolimus Tacrolimus is an immune -suppressing drug used to treat or prevent graft vers us-host disease (GVHD) in bone marrow/stem cell transplant patients. Tacrolimus comes in 0.5mg, 1mg, and 5mg capsules for oral use. It also comes as an IV preparation and a liqui d form made by the pharmacy. The concentration of tacrolimus liquid is 1mg/m illiliter (ml). You will be told how many milliliters make up your child's tacrolimus dose. For example, 1mg of Tacrolimus = 1 ml.

Prednisone comes in several sizes of tablets for oral use. It also comes as an IV preparation. Your child may need to us e several different milligram sizes of tablets to take the prescribed total dose. You may also need to cut your child's pills in half to take the prescribed dose. Never take oral prednisone on an empty stomach. Give your child her morning do se of prednison e after breakfast or at least with a glass of milk or smoothie. If you r child has eaten dinner within 2 to 3 hours, she does not need to eat again right before taking the evening dose . Nutrition recommendations during prednisone therapy Consume a protein -rich diet while taking prednisone. Your child may experience muscle loss while taking prednisone, even if her weight is stable or increasing. A protein -rich diet and regular exercise may help to maintain your child's muscles. Your child's dietitian will gi ve you a protein goal. Consume a calcium -rich diet while taking prednisone. Calcium goal: 1500 mg daily . Prednisone can cause bone loss. Vitamin D and calcium, as well as exercise, can help minimize this loss. Your child's dietitian will assess her curren t calcium intake and recommend supplements if needed. Calcium carbonate (such as Tums\u00ae) or calcium citrat e are recommended supplements. Prednisone may increase blood glucose (sugar) level, similar to diabetes. A nor mal fasting blood glucose level is 60 to 110 mg/dl. If your child's fasting blood glucose level is above normal, your dietitian may advise her to make some diet changes. This may include changing the amount of carbohydrates your child eats . Levels of blood glucose usually return to normal when prednisone is stopped. Your child may need more potassium in her diet while taking prednisone. Prednisone causes some people to \"waste\" potassium into their urine. If your child's blood potassium level is below n ormal , her doctor may presc ribe a potassium supplement and recommend a high potassium diet . Please ask your care team for the \"potassium handout\" that includes dietary suggestions. Prednisone can cause your body to retain fluids. A high salt intake can worsen fluid retention . Limit added salt and salty foods such as canned, instant, and frozen soups and entrees ; soy sauce ; cured meats ; and packaged sauces and seasonings. In general, processed foods contain excess salt. Your child's dietitian can prov ide you with more information abo ut diet recommen dations during p rednisone therapy. (also MMF or Cell Cept\u00ae) MMF is an immune -suppression drug used to treat or prevent graft -versus -host -disease (GVHD) in stem cell transplant patients. MMF is available as a 250mg tablet, 500 mg capsule, liquid form , or IV infusion . Swallow the tablet and capsules whole; do not break, crush, chew, or open the capsule or tablet. Do not mix the liquid form with any other medicines. MMF can cause nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, muscle pain, headache, and/or swelling of the feet or lower legs. Your child's MMF dosing may be given every 8 or 12 hours. MMF blood levels Some patients may need to have MMF levels dr awn. This would require several blood draws over an 8 to 10 hour period on these days. Beverage and food recommendations MMF is absorbed best on an empty stomach. If you r child is having problems with nausea , have him take the medication with some crackers. Do not take within 2 hours of high calcium foods such as cow, almond or fortified soy milk, cheese and yogurt , oral calcium, or oral magnesium supplements. Storage Keep tablets and capsules in a closed container at room temperature aw ay from excessive heat, moisture, and direct sunlight . The oral liquid may be stored in the refrigerator but not in the freezer. The oral liquid expires 60 days from the time you receive it from the pharmacy. Dispose of any unused medication at that time. Do not refrigerate intravenous infusions of MMF . It cannot be mixed with saline flushes. Lines need to be flushed with 50ml of dextrose 5% in water before and after the completion of each infusion. Discuss this with your child's nurse or pharmacist to mak e sure you understand this instruction. 151 Sample transplant outpatient medicat ion schedule Bring this sheet to the first clinical visit.

Your life will instantly become more fulfilling and enjoyable the moment you stop be ing, say 70%, of what you used to be and becoming 100% of what you are now!\" -BMT Survivor What to expect moving forward? The long -term recovery phase may take a year or longer. This is the time to reestablish your child's life after transplant. What do es reestablishing your child's life entail? It means gradually getting back to you, your child's, and your family's life patterns at sc hool or at home and making adjustments in relationships with your family and friends. It may also mean learning to adjust to the therapy needed for chronic or long -term complications. Former patients have noted that the interruption of life plans, the adju stment in relationships , and preparing to re -enter family life can be a difficult adjustment. Your child and other family members may experience a sense of loss or discouragement. Some people become involved in the quest for deeper meaning in their lives. Your family may want to seek therapy to help cope with chronic health issues and emotional responses to the challenges of treatment and recovery. Your child and family may find that everyone will benefit from counseling to gain tools for coping with issues of chronic illness, feelings of loss, anxiety, stress, worry, and depression. Reestablishing life may vary from difficu lt and rough , to easy and smooth. During their recovery some patients express a positive view caused by achieving a redirected life, gr eater compassion for others and improved family relations. The majority of survivors report that their quality of life is now the same or better than before transplant. On the other hand, some patients struggle and become discouraged as they cope with the various life changes. Despite the intensity of the transplant experience, most patients make effective adjustments in their life and maintain an optimistic outlook for the future. In addition to the information in this manual, you and your child will re ceive information from doctors and nurses that will help manage your child's care when you leave SCCA . Take pride in yo ur child's journey through an intensive medical treatment, but remember that full strength and fitness will take several more months, o r sometimes years, to achieve. Recovery is usually a gradual process. Remember rest, exercise, and good nutrition are the cornerstone to recovery. Transition to home The Long -Term Follow - Up (LTFU) department offers telephone consultation services to you and your child's primary doctor when you return home. Call your local doctor for everyday concerns. Call your SCCA care team for treatment -related issues. LTFU consult ation is available at SCCA if you or your child's doctor are concerned about transplant -related side effects or complications. It is a real possibility that your child may be readmitted to a hospital during her first year after transplant. 156 Self-care steps You can play a proactive role in your child's recovery by taking responsibility fo r the following self -care steps. Doctor's visits These include physical exams, as well as labs and tests (such as blood counts and kidney and liver function tests ). Our standard recommendations are: Weekly visits for the first month and every other week for the next 2 months. Then go once every 3 to 4 weeks, depending on your child's progress. Your doctor will help you decide. A one year follow -up evaluation is n ecessary to assess disease status, late complications and to receive vaccinations. Call (206) 667-4415 to make your child's one year follow -up appointment. Skin care Note any of the following changes in skin, and report them to your doctor: Color changes Rash Lesions Scaly skin Texture changes and thickening Stiff or tight skin around joints It is important to protect your child from UVA and UVB (ultraviolet A and B) radiation from sun exposure for two reasons: exposure can cause sun -activated, chronic graft -versus -host disease (GVHD) of the skin and add to the increased risk of skin cancer. Take the following steps to protect your child f rom harmful rays. These are smart sun care steps for everyone for everyone to take, not just patients. Use sunscreen: SPF 30 or greater is recommended for everyone, reapply every hour while outdoors . Protect you r child's lips with SPF 30 (sun protection factor) lip balm. Wear clothing with SPF protectant manufactured into the fabric such as Columbia \u00ae, Solumbra \u00ae, and ExOfficio \u00ae. Avoid long (over 1 hour) exposure to sun . Apply sunblock or wear SPF clothing even on cloudy days, as they still resul t in exposure to ultraviolet radiation. If dry skin is a problem, it is not necessary to bathe daily. Use oil in bath water Use lotion Try natural soap for sensitive skin Nail c are Your child should not have manicure and pedicures if her immune system is still recovering and on antibiotics. Avoid fake nails and cutting the cuticles. If your child's ANC (absolute neutrophil count) is greater than 1 ,500 without need for transfusions , and she is off high dose steroids (great er than 1mg/kg), she can have a manicure or pedicure. Make sure a single basin is used, and equipment is sterilized after each person. Check the facility's license: fortress.wa.gov/dol/do lprod/bpdLicenseQuery/ Choose \"Cosmetologist, Barber, Manicurist, Visit your child's eye doctor ( optometrist or ophthalmologist) for any of the following changes: \"Gritty\" feeling Discharge Changes in vision Continual redness Continual dryness without relief from eye drops Pain or sensitivity to light Sensitivity to wind Burning Excessive tears Of the patients who receive total body irradiation before their transplant, 20% develop cataracts within 1 to 5 years after transplanta tion. Cataracts a re also more common in patients who receive long -term steroids. Cataracts can be removed surgically and the lenses will be replaced. Many patients who develop chronic GVHD will experience eye problems , which can be severe. Adequate managem ent of GVHD of th e eyes is necessary to avoid severe complications (see chronic GVHD section). Discuss with your eye doctor whether it is appropriate to change the prescription for your child's glasses. You may wait until your child is receiving less medic ation such as pre dnisone that can affect eyesight. Daily mouth care Careful flossing and brushing are important to maintain dental health and prevent infections. Continued use of saline rinses can help if your child's mouth is dry, if your child has exc essive mucous, or if your child is being treated for oral fungus. Your child can rinse her mouth using \u00be teaspoon table salt in 1 quart of warm water. Dental visits See a dentist six months after returning home for an exam to monitor tooth decay and ove rall oral care. Routine dental cleaning and dental work should be postponed for at least 12 months after transplant, longer if your child is still on an immunosuppressa nt. Your child's dentist should also monitor for oral cancer every 6 months. If dental w ork is necessary and your child is still receiving immunosuppressant medication , he will need an antibiotic based on recommendations from the American Heart Association . If urgent dental care is needed in the first year or while your child is still on drug s that affect his immune system (those that help prevent or treat graft -versus -host disease), he should take oral antibiotics prescribed by his doctor, before dental wo rk is done. Dry mouth See a dentist if you r child has extreme problems with decay. H owever, fluoride and excellent oral hygiene can minimize or prevent this. Daily home use of fluoride brush -on gels or custom fluoride trays is recommended. Follow guide lines provided by SCCA Oral Medicine department. Saline rinses or other non -prescription products, such as Biotene\u00ae, can help to relieve dryness. Mouth changes Contact your child's doctor for any changes such as ulcers, mucoceles (clear blisters on the soft area of the roof of your mouth or the inside of your lower lip), stinging, burning, dryness, pain, difficulty eating or swallowing, or loose adult teeth. 158 Common changes \"The new normal is not a bad normal, just different. Perspective is everything.\" -BMT Survivor Cognitive The issue of cognitive changes is receiving more research attention. Cancer causes biochemical changes that are now suspected of contributing to cognitive changes, even before any treatment. High -dose chemotherapy and radiation affect cognitive function. Studies show varying incidences of \"chemo brain\" among tran splant patients. However, research indicates that post -treatment cognitive changes, which are characterized by a decrease in memory, multi -tasking ability , and attention resolve for most people after about a year. Patients can return to their pre -transplan t cognitive functioning anywhere from one to five years post -transplant. Some people will continue to have memory or fine motor difficulties. If you r child is still having difficulties with cognitive changes after one year, ask her doctor for a referral fo r neuropsychological testing so you know what your child's deficits are and what you can do about them. In the meantime, help your child's memory by encourag ing them to keep a notebook of things they want to remember. They can also make sticky notes about what they do not want to forget, like taking a medication before they go to bed. Put the sticky note by something your child always remembers, like brushing teeth. Keep a basket by the door for the things your child need s to take with him, like glasses. Sleep Most people have difficulty with sleep at some point during and after transplant. It can be hard to get on a regular cycle of sleep and worry tends to increase as people lie in bed awake. Medication should be a short term solution, not a lifetime aid. Tips that help to promote sleep include keeping the bedroom dark and cool and going to bed and getting up at the same time each day. It may be helpful for your child to get out of bed and do a relaxing activity like reading if she does not sleep after 30 minutes of trying. Your child can also learn relaxation skills to hel p body and mind to relax while lying in bed. Depression and other feelings \"People are entitled to their feelings. And they're entitled to them at every stage of treatment and survivors hip. We know from the science of emotion that the most harmful way, t he most damaging way, to manage emotions is to try to dictate them.\" -Dr. Karen Syrjala (in Surviving Survivor Stereotypes by Curtis Pesmen) Your child may continue to experience signif icant distress following transplant. Sometimes, this can lead to feelings of sadness or depression and associated symptoms such as worry, anger, and fatigue. Distress can also lead to changes in sleep and eating patterns. Even post -traumatic stress can hap pen. We recommend making time and saving energy to participate in activities that your child enjoys, so life is not entirely about health. Spend time with friends and family. If these symptoms continue for more t han a couple of weeks, it is important to di scuss them with your child's care team . Some people find that talking to a therapist after transplant is very helpful. There is so much that most people have been through and have to cope with after treatment. Ta lking with a therapist can help your child r eclaim his life and make sense of what he has gone through. 159 Fatigue, weight , and exercise \"Some problems such as fatigue can begin during therapy and may continue indefinitely, though the duration and severity differs greatly between individuals.\" -Rabiya Tuma, PhD, Treatment Aftershocks Many people report increased fatigue after transplant. Exercise is an effective way to decrease this fatigue over time. We recommend a program of daily moderate exercise for your child, such as walking. Increase the distance and pace as your child's strength and stamina increase. It is also important to rebuild muscle through a program of gradually increasing weight training. Couple this with stretching, yoga , and gentle fitn ess classes. See if a YMCA or local gym near you has a low-cost cancer survivorship program or ask for a physical therapy referral to get an exercise plan from someone who has experience with exercise after cancer treatment. If your child exercises at a moderate level and ha s rebuilt muscle, but his fatigue continues or increases, talk to your child's doctor about other possible causes of fatigue. The best exercise is the one that your child does regularly! Follow recommendations for healthy eating from your child's dietitian . Osteoporosis for allogeneic transplant patients Osteoporosis or bone loss may happen in some patients. It is related to irradiation, use of steroids, inactivity , and low hormone levels. Weight bearing exercise is recommended to help prevent or stabilize osteoporosis. Your ch ild may need calcium and vitamin D supplements or bone rebuilding me dications. You can discuss this with your child's dietitian. Immune system recovery Adequate immune function takes approximately one year after transplantation to recover. Adequate immu ne function may take longer if your child has chronic GVHD or is taking medications that suppress her immune system. During this time your child is still vulnerable to infections. Symptoms such as fever, chills, coughing, difficulty breathing, severe diarr hea, or vomiting should be promptly reported t o your doctor. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) monitoring Your child may need weekly CMV monitoring after treatment. At discharge from SCCA, you will receive specific recommendations to take to your child's local docto r. Exposure to others Avoid crowds, especially during cold and flu season. Avoid people with a contagious infection. Please contact your doctor if your child is exposed to chicken pox or shingles. Hand washing Continue to be as careful about hand washin g as you have been thro ughout the transplant process. You, your child, and your family should p erform hand hygiene frequently by washing hands with soap and water or applying an alcohol -based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 85% alcohol. Ask family and f riends to wash their hands or use hand sanitizer when they come into your home. Have your child wear disposable gloves if he must change a diaper. Wash hands after disposing of gloves. 160 Temperature Take your child's temperature if she is feeling ill, has shaking chills , or you suspect that she has a fever. Note time and circumstances. Notify your doctor promptly if your child has a: Temper ature taken by mouth between 38 to 38.2C (100.4 to 100.8F) for one hour or more, or a temperature that is 38.3 C (10 0.9F) or above. Temperature t aken under the arm between 37.5 to 37.7C (99.5 to 99.9F) for one hour or more, or a temperature that is 37.8 C (100F) or above. Rash Notify your doctor promptly if any rash develops. Animals and plants Avoid contact with body excretions of all animals and do not sleep with pets. Do not bring new pets into the home during the first year or thereafter, if your child is taking immunosuppressant medications. Established household pets and plants may remain in the home. Gardeni ng is not recommend ed while on drugs that suppresses the immune system. Sexual a ctivity Limiting the number of sexual partners is advised. Condoms should be used for protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Normal cleanliness should be observed. Birth control should be used as necessary to prevent pregnancy, as your child ma y not be sterile. Discuss with your child's doctor and nurse. If vaginal dryness is a problem, a lubricant may be helpful. Drugs used for impotence should be avoided while your child is on an immunosuppressant and should not be used without a cardiac evalu ation. Swimming Swimming may expose your child to germs capable of causing infections. You should measure the benefits of your child swimming against the potential r isks of these infections. If swimming or water aerobics is the preferred or recommended me thod of exercise, it should be done in a well -maintained pool with adequate chlorination. Your child's face should not be submerged under the water. Never swim with a central line in place. Also, do not swim for the first 6 months after the transplant or i f on drugs that treat GVHD within the first year. Hot tubs should not be used for the first 6 months after transplant or if your child is on drugs that treat GVHD. Travel Take extra medications with you when you travel and consider where your child could receive the treatment he needs if he became ill. Move around during flight or transit time to prevent blood clots that could lead to a major lung problem. Many patie nts travel home within the first 6 months after transplant. As with any activity involving risk, weigh the specifics of your situation. To minimize risks when traveling: Take a copy of your child's critical medical records with you. Seek medical care prom ptly for new symptoms. Control your environment by avoiding crowds and maintaining infecti on precautions. If you fly, ask to be moved if you are seated near someone with respiratory symptoms. Carry hand sanitizer and wipes. 161 Other reminders Minimize exposu re to dirt and aerosolized material . Minimize sun exposure, use sunscreen (SPF 30 or greater ). Use a hat, long -sleeve shirts and long pants if outside for long period of time . Avoid construction sites . Avoid contact with people that: - Have cold and flu sym ptoms like coughing and sneezing. - Display symptoms of other types of infections such as vomiting or skin rashe s Immunizations Patients generally receive post -transplant immunizations starting at one year. These killed -virus and killed - bacterial imm unizations include: Tetanus Diphtheria Pertussis Meningococcal Inactivated polio Influenza Pneumonia Haemophilus influenza type B Hepatitis B Hepatitis A Human papilloma virus (HPV) (ages 9 to 26) If you do not return for your child's one -year follow u p, ask your doctor to contact the Long -Term Follow -Up department about immunizations. If a household member receives the Varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, your child should be taking acyclovir. If a household member develops lesions (or pox), your child need s to be isolated while their lesio ns are present. 162 Graft -versus -host d isease (GVHD) One form of GVHD that may occur around day 80 or later is called chronic graft -versus -host disease. Approximately 50% of patients who receive allogeneic transplants are diagnosed with chronic GVHD, with variation in the incidence related to characteristics of the donor and the source of the stem cells. GVHD can affect any organ. Unfortunately, 15% of the patients develop severe chronic GVHD that goes on for many years and may lead to disability. The range of medical issues caused by GVHD can be mild to seve re. You might notice your child's skin becoming dry, scaly, and discolored with patches of thickened or hardened underlying tissue. The surface of the eyes and mouth c an become dry. Mouth lesions may develop. Sometimes the esophagus, gastrointestinal tra ct, or liver are affected. Weight loss due to poor absorption of food or GVHD increased catabolism (burning more calories despite adequate eating) can occur. Bacterial i nfections are common. Treatment protocols have been developed for GVHD and the Long -Term Follow -Up team is available to you r child and your child's doctor if she develop s symptoms after going home. There may be some positive aspects to having GVHD. Patient s with GVHD have a lower risk of the cancer returning after transplantation than patien ts who do not develop GVHD. Report any of the following changes to your doctor. Make sure your doctor is watching for possible changes in your liver and kidney function test results as well. Skin: Rash, thickness, discoloration, tightness, texture changes , shining, itching Hair: Thinning or coarse Nails: Texture changes, brittleness, ridges Eyes: Dryness, grittiness, irritation, burning, blurring, discharge, tears, sensi tivity to light or wind Mouth: Dryness, pain, sensitivity to hot/cold foods or toothpas te, ulcers, white lacy changes on gums and cheeks Vagina: Dryness, irritation, tightening Penis : Irritation Digestive System: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetit e, unexplained weight loss Lungs: Chronic dry cough, wheezing, shortness of breath Liver: Jaundice and elevated liver test numbers Joints: Unable to fully extend fingers, wrists, elbows, ankles or knees, joint pain, or stiffness Energy Level: Increased fat igue Temperature sensitivity: Cold intolerance, inability to sweat Treatment of GVHD The duration for treatment of chronic GVHD with immunosuppressants (therapies that suppress the immune system prednisone, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus, myc ophenolate mofetil , and others) varies between 2 to 3 years after the initial dia gnosis of this complication. Approximately 10% of patients require chronic GVHD treatment for seven years or longer. Eventually the graft will develop tolerance to the new body, and the GVHD will resolve without the need of treatment. 163 Therapies most commo nly used for chronic GVHD are prednisone, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, rapamycin, mycophenolate mofetil, and others. All immunosuppressive drugs have some side effects. The most common toxicities of these drugs are listed below. Prednisone: Osteoporosis, deterioration of joints that can require joint replacement, increased risk of infections, diabetes, cataracts , and emotional changes , differences in body shape (weight gain, facia l swelling or \"moon face\") Cyclosporine: Kidney function issue s, loss of magnesium, tremors, headaches, seizures, nausea, increased blood pressure Tacrolimus (Prograf\u00ae): to cyclosporine Myc ept\u00ae): Nausea, vomiting, di decreasing white blood cells count, anemia Rapamycin, Sirolimus (Rapamune\u00ae): Decreased white cells or platelets, increased triglyceride level, edema (fluid buildup that causes swelling) , and others. Despite the side effects of medication s used to treat chronic GVHD, adherence to the tre atment schedules and doses is of the utmost importance in the long term. Damage from untreated or undertreated chronic GVHD to the eyes, lungs , and skin cannot be reversed. This damage is worse than the sid e effects of the medications used to treat GVHD . 164 Medications Your child's medications are important to help her maintain general health. Please give them as prescribed. Bactrim\u00ae (sulfamethoxazole -trimethoprim): This is a broad spectrum antibiotic specifi cally for the prevention of pneumocystis pneumonia and for prevention of certain types of bacterial infections (Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus influenza). - Take this medication if prescribed for at least 6 months after transplant, or longer if con tinued on immune suppression medications. - Always t ake Bactrim\u00ae (or an alternate drug) when taking immune suppression medications. - If on tapering doses of immune suppression medications, take Bactrim \u00ae until 6 months after treatment of chronic GVHD. Acycl ovir or valacyclovir: These drugs are antiviral ag ents used to prevent varicella zoster (shingles). If one of these is prescribed, it should be taken for the entire first year, and should be given concurrently while on immunosuppression and for 6 months af ter completion of taper. Hormones: Hormones may be prescribed for women in premature menopause due to the effects of conditioning therapy. Immunosuppression: Keep accurate records of dates when stopping or restarting immunosuppressive medications (predniso ne, cyclosporine, MMF, tacrolimus, rapamycin). Immunosuppressive medications may require that blood levels be checked . Secondary cancers There is an increased risk of getting a different cancer in long term survivors after transplantation. The risk starts to increase at five years after transplantation. Skin, mouth, thyroid , and breast cancers are the most common sites of secondary cancers after transplant. Cancer screening evaluation is recommended and includes: complete skin examination, oral exams, br east exam and mammograms (wom en), prostate exam (men), colonoscopy (according to age and history), and others as needed. Original disease restaging is also recommended at periodic intervals depending on diagnosis. For patients transplanted for CML or acute lymphocytic leukemia PH+, bl ood monitoring for the BCR/ABL by PCR test is recommended periodically. 165 Reconnecting with life and survivorship \"This has been five years that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, but strangely enough, wouldn't trade for the wo rld.\" -BMT Sur vivor It is normal to feel vulnerable after returning home. These feelings are valid, but don't push the panic button every time someone sneezes! It's important to see friends and return to normal activities. Just use common sense - \"when in doubt, don't. \" Some patients, especially those who had a stormy transplant course, find it hard to plan for the future. Make a specific detailed plan for something your child wants to do. This helps your child to feel like he is moving toward something , not just markin g time while he recovers. Helpful hints for your child to remember It is healthy to find a \"silver lining\" in your situation. It doesn't mean that you forget the clouds, it's just that the clouds are not the whole story. You are your own best friend. Take care of yourself. Get enough rest, exercise, and good nutrition. Be patient with yourself and others. Watch for changes in your body, hair, nails, eyes, skin, mouth , and joints. Tell your doctor of any changes. Try to take one day at a ti me; f ocus on your goals for today, particularly after you first return home. Make sure you include something you enjoy in each day. It is normal to feel alone at times; it's true that no one else has been down your road and really knows what it is like for you. Make it a goal to connect with people and do activities you enjoy so that you start to feel like part of your community, even if at first you don't feel like it. Remember that your caregiver and family have also been through a major challenge. Chec k in with them weekly to let each person describe what they are experiencing. You don't need to fix each other's concerns; just use this as a time to listen and reflect upon what each person is feeling. Ask if there is anything that would make things bette r. Do not be afraid to ask for professional guidance; you deserve it! Almost everyone receives some kind of help. SCCA suggests that you return one year following transplant for re -evaluation. Relationships It may be difficult to resume relationships as t hey w ere before transplant because your child's experience has changed her perspectives. Your child's illness may have affected the feelings and perspectives of the people around him. It may have produced role changes that can affect relationships. People repor t that these changes can be very positive, but they also can take some time to sort out. Make sure each person in your family has a chance to describe their fears and concerns. Even if it is hard, try to give each person time to describe what is going on in their lives and thoughts. As a caregiver, you may be used to taking care of your child and home tasks. These role changes can take time to get back to normal. It can be helpful to discuss a weekly plan of who will do what. As your child is ready for more responsibility, help her communicate this to her caregivers. With your child's friends, it might help to discuss what is different in his life and how much the friendship means to him. Sometimes your child may have to reach out to friends rather than wait ing for them to come to him. 166 Returning to work or school Returning to work or school is very complicated. You and your child need to be ready both physically and emotionally. We suggest that y ou wait 6 to 12 months after transplant to return to work or school, but home tutoring or work in a home office can precede these dates. If your child has contributed to Social Security, he or she may be eligible for social security benefits because of their inadequate immune system. This will be the case for at least one year and possibly longer if you r child is on immunosuppressive medication for GVHD. There are many organizations that assist cancer and transplant survivors with employment issues. For more information on your child's employment rights, see the Resources section at the end of this chapter. The Department of Vocational Rehabilitation offers counseling to for emotional or physical disabilities. Some people are eligible for Social Security. See below for additional information: Department of Vocat ional Rehabilitation dshs.wa.gov/dvr/ Americans with Disability Act ada.gov/ Cancer and Careers canceran dcareers.org Financial concerns Many people re port insurance and financial concerns. We recommend that you look into Social Security and private disability insurance. Look online and at the resources at the end of this chapter for more information on cancer and financial concerns. Young adults The road to independence and maturity is more difficult for young adults who have been ill. Feelings may fluctuate, sometimes viewing parents as being overly concerned and involved, and at other times feeling insec ure and wanting more parental guidance and reassurance. Many young adults report that starting to date and sexual activity can bring uncertainty. An excellent resource for young adults experiencing this is livestrong.org/we -can-help/young -adults . Sexuality \"Nobody wants to talk about it. It becomes a self -propelling problem, in that, the longer time goes by, people then also become kind of less connected with that part of themselves.\" -Sharon Bober, PhD Most people notice a drop in sexual desire during the first year. Young adults can m ake time for intimacy to re-awaken those feelings. They may have a low energy level or feel unattractive due to the changes that their body has undergone. P artners often hesitate to make sexual adva nces out of concern for a patient's health. Young w omen can have vaginal changes and young men may have erection problems. Medications can be the cause of some of these changes; problems may disappear over time or after stopping the drugs. Hormones can cha nge for young men and young women after transplant. For young men, it often takes a full year for testosterone levels to return to normal, affecting both erections and desire. It's important for both partners to talk about their feelings and to be patient with one another. Begin to set aside \"date\" time to b e romantic, include touching during intimate time together. Young adults can s tart trying sexual activity even if desire is not back to its previous level. If dr yness or irritation is a problem, a silico ne-based lubricant can be helpful. Water -based lubricants are also safe, but won't last as long. If graft -versus -host disease or sensitivity is a problem, ask to see a sexuality -after -cancer specialist or look onli ne at BMT websites on sexuality to learn more about what can be done for these problems. After cardiac evaluation, drugs used for erectile problems can be helpful for some men. 167 Survivor syndrome \"Little studied, survivor guilt brings with it a host of iss ues that can cause depression, anger , and self -blame that may even compromise health.\" -Kathy Latour, Getting Through Survivor Guilt Your child may have feelings of guilt because she is alive when others did not survive. Your child may also have a strong sense of grief and loss. Even though your child is glad to be alive, it is normal to feel that she has lost things that she will never again be able to regain. Discussion with a counselor, minister, priest, or rabbi can help put this in perspective. If yo ur child isn't sure what she wants to do, or feels like she wants a change, give her time to recover while she discovers what she wants most. Some people re -evaluate what they want to do for the rest of their life. Having survived this adventure, your chil d might decide to try another new one ! Survivorship Clinic Cancer and its treatment can result in some potentially long -lasting or late -onset effects. The SCCA Survivorship Clinic addresses various problems cancer survivors may face after therapy ends. Th ese include pain, fatigue, and fear of recurrence, living wi th uncertainty, neuropathy, lymphedema, bone loss, sexual dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, memory issues, and future cancer risk. At the Survivorship Clinic, our medical staff will talk with y ou and your child about how to assess and manage late compli cations or issues your child may be experiencing and develop a plan to support your child's future health. As part of your child's appointment in the Survivorship Clinic you will receive an indiv idualized Treatment Summary and Survivorship Care Plan . This includes an evaluation and information on the prevention of the late effects of your cancer a nd cancer tr eatment, recommendations and resources for dealing with long -term effects, and suggestions for healthy lifestyle behaviors. Copies of the treatment summary, survivorship care plan, and any recommendations made during the appointment are shared with your ch ild's healthcare team, including the SCCA physician and primary care (local) physician . We will work in partnership with these doctors to make sure your child's survivorship needs are being met. We do not provide testing for recurrence of your child's cancer; this care will continue to be provided by your SCCA care team . To schedule an appointment in the SCCA Survivorship Clinic please call (206) 606 -1024. Visit the Survivorship Clinic website at: www.fredhutch.org/en/treatment/survivorship/survivorship -clinic.html Transitional Transplant Clinic (TTC) is a clinic for patients with complex conditions such as GVHD that is not well controlled, serious infe ctions, or o ther complex conditions that require extensive ongoing management. Talk with your child's nurse if this is right for you and your child . 168 Sample letter for returning home To my family and friends: I am recovering from a bone marrow transplant . I am able to return home; however, my recovery from this procedure can take months. The following is a list of some of the ways you can help with my recovery. My risk for infection continues It will take at least ____ months for my immune system to reco ver. It's possible that it could take even longer, depending on what medications I will need or what complications I might experience. I am at a higher risk for infection and will need to pick a ctivities that will minimize my risk of infection. Family and friends need to be up to date with their vaccinations. Please see the vaccination recommendations in the Preparing for Transplant booklet. Hand washing etiquette Hand washing is the most effect ive way to prevent infection from spreading. I was taught to w ash my hands frequently. My family, friends and visitors will be asked to do the same when in my company. Please don't be offended if I remind you to wash your hands.
