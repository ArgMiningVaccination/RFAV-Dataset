Applies to England The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is monitoring the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines in the real world as set out in the [COVID-19 vaccine surveillance strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccine-surveillance-strategy) and has published reports on the impact of the COVID-19 vaccines on: - symptomatic disease - hospitalisation - death - infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) Duration of protection of ancestral-strain monovalent vaccines and effectiveness of bivalent BA.1 boosters against COVID-19 hospitalisation in England: a test-negative case-control study This study [estimates the long-term duration of protection of the monovalent COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00365-1/fulltext#seccestitle10) against hospitalisation, as well as the incremental vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation of the bivalent BA.1 booster vaccines given as part of the autumn 2022 booster campaign to those aged 50 years or older. Effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines against severe disease with Omicron sub-lineages BA.4 and BA.5 in England The latest evidence shows that [vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation](https://khub.net/documents/135939561/338928724/Effectiveness+of+the+COVID-19+vaccines+against+severe+disease+with+Omicron+sub-lineages+BA.4+and+BA.5+in+England.pdf/5ab89df8-bbb3-2cd2-6ce5-16e489e869a8?) is similar for the BA.4/5 variants as it is for BA.2. In somebody who received their second dose around 6 months previously, a booster dose increases protection against hospitalisation by 50% to 60%. This is the most comprehensive analysis of vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation for BA.4/5 undertaken to date.
