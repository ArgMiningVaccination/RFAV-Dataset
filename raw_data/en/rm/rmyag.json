Reproduction prohibited without the written permission of the NRMP.Backgro und The first edition of Charting Outco mes in the Match was published in August 2006 to document how applicant qualifications affect outcomes in the Main Residency Match\u00ae. The report was published biennially between 2007 and 2011 and , initially, was a collaboration of the National Resident Matching Program\u00ae (NRMP\u00ae) and the Asso ciation of American Medical Colleges\u00ae (AAMC\u00ae). Match outcome data from the NRMP were combined with applicant characteristics from the AAMC's Electronic Resid ency Ap plication Service (ERAS\u00ae) and United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE\u00ae) scores from the AAMC data warehouse. Starting with the 2014 Main Residency Match, the NRMP added an Academic Information section to its Match reg istration process to collect the USMLE scores and other applicant characteristics, an d those have b een used to independen tly prod uce all subsequent Charting Outcomes in the Match reports. Prior to 2016, this report examin ed the Match su ccess of only two applicant groups : senior students from U.S. MD medical school s (\"U.S. seniors\" or \"U.S. MD senio rs\") and independent applicants. Indepen dent appli cants included all applicant types other tha n U.S. seniors: graduates of U.S. MD medical schools, students/graduate s of U.S. DO medical schools, students/grad uates of Fifth Pathw ay programs, students/grad uates of Canadian medical schools, an d U.S. citizen and non U.S. citizen students/graduates of internati onal medical scho ols (IMGs). Because indepen dent applicants are a heterogeneous group , a d ecision was mad e in 2016 to report data separately for U.S. MD medical school seniors, students/gradu ates of U.S. DO medical sch ools, and U.S. citizen /non-U.S. citizen students/graduates of international medical schools. In 2018, upon requests from U.S. DO medical schools, the Chartin g Outcomes in th e Match report was redesigned to include only senior students o f U.S. DO medical schools (\"U.S. DO seniors\"), eliminating the reporting on U.S. DO graduates because their numbers are so small. The 20 22 Charting Outco mes in the Match reports marks the third iteration of publication s for U. S. MD Seniors, U.S. DO seniors and U.S. citizen /non-U.S. citizen IMGs. This report examines the characteristics of U.S. MD seniors. Data Match outcome, specialty preference, and ranking information were collected through the Main Residency Match. The 40 U.S. medical schools receiving the highest totals of National Institutes of Health (NIH) gran ts were obtained from the NIH website. Other applicant characteristics, including USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 Clinical Knowled ge (CK) scores, academic degrees, publications, Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society (AOA) membership, as well as research, work and volunteer experiences, were self-reported through the Academic Information section of th e NRMP's Ap plicant Registration Form for the Match. To co mplete the form, applicants were asked to an swer th e questions as they did in their ERAS Common Application Fo rm (CAF). Completion of the form was optional, and applicants who completed the form could consent or decline to participate in NRMP research. Data collection for the self-reported Academic In formation sectio n was granted exemption by the Advarra Institutional Review Board (IRB). A total of 19,902 U.S. MD seniors submitted certified rank order lists in the 2022 Main Residency Match. After excluding the 17 percen t of U. S. MD seniors who did not give consent to participate in NRMP research, 16,510 applicants were included in the final datas et. Missing data were found in Step 1 scores (1% missing), Step 2 CK scores (2.4%), number of research experiences (10.8%), number of abstracts, presentations, and publications (10.9%), number of experiences (11.2%), number of uate AOA membership (7.8%). To ensure that USMLE Step scores were not misreported, the NRMP asked med ical schools to verify the scores of their U.S. MD sen iors. In 2022, 90.2 percent of the Step 1 scores and 90.6 of the Step 2 CK scores used in this report were verified, corrected, or supplied by U.S. medical schools. Because the self-reported scores are highly accurate (the intracorrelation coefficient (ICC) between the self-reported scores and school-verified scores was 0.958 (99% CI [0.95 6, 0.959]) for 1 sco res and 0.932 (99% CI [0.929, 0.935]) for Step 2 CK scores), both verified and unverified scores were used to prepare this report. Metho ds Specialties that of fered 50 or more positions in the 2022 Main Resi dency Match are included in this report. Over the years, sp ecialties have been add ed to t he report, includi ng Otolaryng ology and Ne urology in 2007, Neurological Sur gery i n 2009, Child Neurol ogy an d Vascular Surgery in 2014, and In terventiona l Rad iology in 2018. Tr ansitional Year program s were excluded beginning with the 20 11 report because they are not viewed as a preferred sp ecialty choice.

Pro bability analysis usin g a simple logistic regressio n mo del was intro duced in 2009 to evaluate th e relationship between Match outcome and contiguous ranks an d USMLE Step 1 scores. Probab ility analyses in this report used data on U.S. MD seniors who participated in the Match in 2020, 2021, and 2022. This report examines whether a match was made to the specialty of the applicant's first-ranked program, or \"preferred specialty,\" because that is assumed to be the specialty of choice. U.S. MD Seniors who match to a specialty not ranked first on the rank order list or who do not match are not included in analyses. No distinction was mad e based on whether a pplica nts ma tched to the first, second , third, or lower choice program. Summary Some general observations apply to all specialties in this report. U.S. MD seniors who match to their preferred specialty are more likely to: Rank more programs within their preferred specialty Have higher USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 scores Be members of Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society It is important to note that other factors also likely contribute to matching to a preferred specialty . As examples, the data sources used for Charting Outcomes in the Match do not include important applicant factors such as course evaluations, reference letters, and the Medical School Performance Evaluation (MSPE). Despite the fairly strong relationship between USMLE Step scores and matching to a preferred specialty, the distributions of scores show that program directors consider other qualifications. A high score is not a guarantee of matching, and a low score is not a bar to matching. I n the more competitive specialties, U.S. MD seniors with high scores may not match to their preferred specialties. In less competitive specialties, U.S. MD seniors with scores slightly above passing usually match to their preferred specialties. The data are reassuring because they indicate that some programs do not employ an arbitrary cutoff or decline to consider ap plicants with less competitive scores . The data in this report support the following straightforward advice one should give to an applicant: Rank the programs with which you'v e interviewed in the ord er you most prefer them. Includ e a mix of both competitive an d less competitive p rograms within your preferred specialty. Include all programs on your list where you wo uld be willing to train if matched. Inclu de all of your qualifications in your application but k now that you do not have to be AOA, have the highest USMLE scores, have publications, or have participated in research projects to match to your preferred sp ecialty. Program directors and applicants will find the tables and charts for the specialty of their particular interest later in this r eport.

To quantify this aspect of applicant behavior, we tallied the number of program s ranked in the first-choice specialty before a program in another specialty appeared on the app licant's rank order list (contiguous ranks). Chart 4 displays the median number of contiguous ranks by pref erred specialty for U.S. MD seniors who matched and did not match to their preferred specialty. The chart shows some va riation across the specialties for U.S. MD seniors. Neurological Surgery and Vascular Surgery both had the longest average c ontiguous rank list (20) for ma tched U.S. MD seniors and Interventional Radiology had the shortest (4). For all specialti es, U.S. MD seniors who matched to their preferred specialty had median contiguous rank lists th at were longer than those of U.S. MD seniors who did not match. The principal message of these graphs is that applicants with longer rank order lists are more successful than those with short er ones. Copyright \u00a92022 NRMP.

MD seniors (matched or not matched), the p atterns are less consistent; unmatched ap plicants preferring Emergency Medicine and Neurol ogy sh ow more work experiences than their matched counterparts but fewe r among applicants that prefer Child Neurology, Family Medicine and Pathology. Nearly three-quarters (73.6%) of U.S. MD seniors reported work experiences, with an average o f 3.6 work exp eriences for all U.S. MD seniors.

AOA membership is limited to students in medical schools that sponsor an AOA chapter. Most, but not all, M.D.-granting medical schools in the United States participate. An analysis of its relationship with success in the Match is limited by the relatively small number of applicants who are members, by the fact that some schools do not have AO A chapters, and by the fact that other schools elect AOA members t oo late in the academic year for it to be considered in the application process. Data on AOA membership are self-reported. Overall, 13.4 percen t of U.S. MD seniors included in this report claimed AO A membership. Among matched U.S. MD seniors, 18.2 percent reported AOA membership, compared to 10.0 percent o f unmatched applicants. As with several of the other measures, the most competitiv e specialties are able to attract the greatest proportion of AO A members. All specialties attract some AOA applicants, but for most specialties AOA members account for fewer than one in four successful applicants. Copyright \u00a92022 NRMP.

To test that assumption, we obtained data on the amount of NIH grant awards an d identified the 40 schools with the highest NIH funding. This measu re, by definition, is limited to students of U.S. medical schools. Overall, 31.2 percent of match ed and 22.6 percen t of unmatched MD seniors were graduates of one of th e 40 medical schools with the highest NIH funding.
