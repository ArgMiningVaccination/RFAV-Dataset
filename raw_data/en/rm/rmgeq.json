Ixcela Balance is specially formulated to support below-optimal serotonin levels. This blend of 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) and vitamin B6 may assist with emotional health, sleep disturbances, digestion, and muscle pain.* 5-HTP is an amino acid that converts to serotonin in the human body. Serotonin is important for feelings of well-being, mood regulation, sleep, and digestion. Vitamin B6 is necessary for immune health, mental alertness, energy, and nervous system health. Studies show that vitamin B6 supports the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, which are involved in motivation, mood, digestion, sleep, and memory. Ixcela Balance can be taken at any time of day, but if you are looking to improve sleep quality, consider taking Ixcela Balance 30 minutes before bed.
