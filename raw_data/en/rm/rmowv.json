Simplify development. Increase compatibility. An open-source approach Members of the Alliance have taken an open-source approach to the development and implementation of this new, unified connectivity protocol. We use best-in-class contributions from market-tested smart home technologies, such as those from Amazon, Apple, Google, the Connectivity Standards Alliance, and others. By leveraging these technologies' contributions, we are able to accelerate the development of the protocol and deliver benefits to manufacturers and consumers faster. IP-Based Matter makes it easier for device manufacturers to build devices that are compatible with smart home and voice services such as Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google's Assistant, and others. The first specification release of the Matter protocol will run on [Wi-F](https://www.wi-fi.org/) [i](https://www.wi-fi.org/) and [Thread](https://www.threadgroup.org/) network layers and will use [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://www.bluetooth.com/) for commissioning.
