The recipients will be 2 first-year veterinary students in the United States who are starting classes in the fall of 2024. The winning students will each receive up to $35,000 for each year of veterinary school adding up to $140,000 each for up to 4 years of veterinary school. According to an organizational release,1 Godchaux created this scholarship to recognize her veterinarian with the goal of creating more veterinarians like him. Dunn has been there for Godchaux's dogs for the lifespan of 7 dogs through personal communication and helpful information shared with honesty and compassion for her and her pets. She entrusted the Vin Foundation after seeing their approach to supporting veterinary professionals at every stage of their careers. \"While I am supporting the students by providing the scholarship for the school tuition, it feels good to know the VIN Foundation is providing the support of helpful programs and tools to guide them through their careers and set them up for success,\" explained Godchaux, in the release.1 To qualify for the scholarship, the selected students must be attending a veterinary school in the United States and costs of tuition and fees must not exceed $170,000 for the duration of the program. During admissions,2 only the first 300 applications that are completed will be considered and the completed applications must include a personal statement and a letter of recommendation from either a mentor or professional reference. The chosen finalists will then be asked to participate in a video interview and provide proof of acceptance to veterinary school for the upcoming fall. The recipients, along with the scholarship money, will also receive support and mentorship through Vin Foundation through programs on mental health support, student debt, and everything in between. \"I am still in shock with Becky's level of generosity. It is so nice to know that we, as veterinarians, make such an impact on people's lives,\" expressed Dunn.2 The scholarship is restricted to admission for fall of 2024 only and applications will officially open on August 15, 2023, at 9 AM PT.
