China [Suai Tao, Department of Encephalopathy, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, PR. China.] [Biomedical Research](https://www.alliedacademies.org/biomedical-research/volume-selector.php) Abstract This study aims to investigate the clinical efficacy of integrated Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine (TCM-WM) in treatment of late-onset [epilepsy](https://www.alliedacademies.org/scientific-journals/epilepsy-724.html) after cerebral hemorrhage. 60 patients with late-onset [epilepsy](https://www.alliedacademies.org/scientific-journals/epilepsy-724.html) after cerebral hemorrhage were divided into control group and TCMWM group, which were treated with loading dose of sodium valproate and 1/2 loading dose of sodium valproate combined with 18 g of Chinese traditional medicine (TCM) (developed from the Lingjiao Gouteng decoction). The efficacy of TCM syndrome, [epilepsy](https://www.alliedacademies.org/scientific-journals/epilepsy-724.html) seizure frequency, Electroencephalogram (EEG), life quality, cognitive function and safety of each group were observed at the middle of and after treatment. Results found that, after treatment, the [epilepsy](https://www.alliedacademies.org/scientific-journals/epilepsy-724.html) seizure times in TCM-WM group were significantly less than control group (P<0.05). The total effective rate of TCM syndrome in TCM-WM group was 82.8%, which was significantly higher than 71.4% in control group (P<0.05). The total effective rates of EEG in TCM-WM group and control group were 82.7% and 57.1%, respectively, with significant difference between them (P<0.05). The life quality score in TCM-WM group was 24.91 \u00b1 11.48, significantly lower than 14.59 in group (P<0.05), and the quotient in TCM-WM \u00b1 than 69.26 \u00b1 11.49 in control group (P<0.05). There was no obvious adverse reaction after treatment in each group. The TCM-WM integrated treatment has good efficacy and safety for patients with late-onset [epilepsy](https://www.alliedacademies.org/scientific-journals/epilepsy-724.html) after cerebral hemorrhage. | | Keywords |Epilepsy, Treatment, Traditional Chinese medicine, Efficacy, safety.| | | Introduction |Epilepsy is the second commonly-occurred neurological disorder after stroke, and the cerebrovascular disease is the most common cause of secondary epilepsy [ | Subjects and Methods General data [5](#5)] and syndrome differentiation and classification criteria of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (Guiding Principle of Clinical Research on New TCM, 1995); (ii) met the diagnostic criteria of late-onset epilepsy after cerebral hemorrhage; (iii) aged 40-80 years. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) non-epileptic seizure; (ii) progressive, malignant or deformative disease; (iii) during the pregnant and lactating period; (iv) accompanied with kidney stones; (v) the patient could not keep the medication in time and fill the observation diary. [Table 1](#Table1). There was no significant difference of each index between 2 groups (P>0.05). During this study, 2 and 1 cases fell off from the control group and TCM-WM group, respectively. Finally 28 and 29 cases in control group and TCM-WM group completed the follow-up, respectively. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Affiliated Yantai Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. A written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Treatment methods Observation indicators [6](#6)]. (4) Quality of life. The quality of life was evaluated using Minnesota life quality scale. (5) Cognitive function. The cognitive function of patient was tested according to Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale revised (Chinese Revised edition, 1982), using full-scale intelligence quotient (FIQ) as index. The total scale >81 points, 71-80 points, 61-70 points, and <60 points were considered as normal, mild cognitive impairment, moderate cognitive impairment, and severe cognitive impairment, respectively. (6) Safety indicators. The adverse events and abnormality were confirmed by laboratory test in the blood routine, urine routine, stool routine, liver function, renal function, etc. Follow-up Statistical analysis Results Comparison of TCM syndrome efficacy between 2 groups [Table 2](#Table2), the total effective rates of TCM syndrome in control group and TCM-WM group were 82.8% and 71.4%, respectively, with significant difference between them (P<0.05). Comparison of epilepsy seizure frequency after treatment between 2 groups Comparison of EEG changes between 2 groups [Table 3](#Table3)). [Table 4](#Table4). Before treatment, there was no significant difference life quality score between 2 groups (P>0.05). After treatment, the life quality score in each group was significantly lower than before (P<0.01), and that in TCM-WM group was significantly lower than control group (P<0.05). Comparison of cognitive function between 2 groups [Table 5](#Table5), the cognitive functions in TCM-WM group and control group had no significant difference before the treatment (P>0.05). After treatment, FIQ in control group was significantly lower than before (P<0.01), while that in TCM-WM group was significantly higher than before (P<0.01). There was significant difference between 2 groups (P<0.05). Comparison of treatment safety between 2 groups Discussion [7](#7)]. The incidence of epilepsy is related with the balance disorders of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter [ [8](#8)]. Glutamic acid and -aminobutyric acid (GABA) play an important role in maintaining the balance of excitation and inhibition, as well as in the pathogenesis of epilepsy [ [9](#9)- [12](#12)]. The early-onset type epilepsy after cerebral hemorrhage is the outcome of abnormal electrical activities induced by cellular biochemical dysfunction. The acute hemorrhage causes the increased concentration of extracellular glutamate, which acts as the excitatory neurotransmitter associated with the secondary nerve injury [ [13](#13)]. GABA is the major inhibitory central neurotransmitter. GABA and its receptor widely exist in the brain tissues such as hippocampus, amygdala and cerebral cortex, playing an important role towards the occurrence of epilepsy and other diseases [ [14](#14)- [16](#16)]. The production and release abnormalities of GABA are the important cause of epilepsy [ [17](#17)]. The late-onset type epilepsy is due to the glial cell proliferation and occurrence and development of meninges scars [ [18](#18)]. The change in cell membrane, selective neurological deficit and formation of collateral branch can cause the excessive excitability and synchronic neuronal discharging, thus resulting in the epileptic seizure [ [19](#19), [20](#20)].
