While there is no cure for COPD, there are effective options to manage this disease. Rapid Immediate Care in Hoffman Estates and Crystal Lake, IL, offers COPD treatment to improve your health and quality of life. Risks and Symptoms of COPD The most common risk factor for COPD is smoking. Smokers are at a much higher risk for obtaining COPD, along with anyone exposed to breathing in smoke, particles or chemicals for long periods. This disease obstructs the airflow to the lungs, contributing to inflammation (bronchitis) and emphysema. Symptoms of COPD include: - Tightness in the chest - Wheezing - Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath - Edema or swelling in the feet or legs - Chronic cough - Coughing up mucus - Frequent respiratory infections COPD is a progressive disease. By the time symptoms occur, damage may have already been done to the components in the lung. However, there is COPD treatment that can control symptoms and improve breathing. With the right combination of medications, many people with COPD can live long and healthy lives with their inflammatory lung disease. COPD Management Diagnosing COPD requires collecting medical history, exams, imaging and other testing. If you are diagnosed with COPD, many medications can effectively treat and manage COPD. These include using bronchodilators (inhalers) for short and long-acting effects to open airways in the lungs. Other medications can include steroids, antibiotics and combination inhalers. Anyone who is still smoking and has COPD should quit, which should be part of the treatment plan. If you have symptoms of COPD, come see our medical team at Rapid Immediate Care.
