A Milestone for Five Quad Five Quad members - past and present - gathered April 27 at the Albany Hilton for a banquet celebrating the ambulance squad's 40th anniversary. Here, guests pose for a photo commemorating the occasion.Price Heads SUNY Student Assembly SUNYwww.albany.edu 3Gifts at Work By Carol Olechowski Jordan Arnold, B.A.'97, and David \"Brink\" Brinkerhoff, B.A.'01 met while serving Quad \"and became fast friends.\" Arnold recalled: \"We were steady shift partners on the ambulance. Brink had a tremendous work ethic. He was sharp and really funny. He was also a genuinely good person; helping others came naturally to him.\" The two \"remained close and saw each other regularly\" even after Brinkerhoff left to attend the New York State Police Academy and Arnold went off to law school at Vanderbilt University. Arnold clearly remembers April 25, 2007, the day Brinkerhoff - by then a state trooper who had returned to UAlbany to complete his degree in political science - died in the line of duty. On receiving the news that his friend had been shot during a manhunt, \"I grabbed a suit, left work and drove to Brink's house just south of Albany,\" said Arnold. \"Later, I stayed near the uptown campus and ran the [Perimeter Road] loop each day to clear my head. On one of those runs, I was thinking about how often Brink ran the loop, during college and while at the academy. Brett Morey, B.A.'98, one of Brink's best friends, and I had already been talking about how we would honor his memory.\" A scholarship funded by \"a charity run on the loop, held as close to April 25 as possible so that Brink's family could look forward to something positive around that day every year,\" seemed a fitting tribute. \"It had the BRINK 5K name before I finished that run.\" The course, a certified 5K, \"includes a portion of the loop, so that runners get to trace Brink's footsteps. It's a challenging, multi-terrain course that also cuts around Indian Lake.\" The race is open to anyone, \"and every year, the pack includes active and retired New York State police, as well as active and alumni members of Five Quad.\" Arnold credited Five Quad volunteers for their work in building the scholarship endowment. \"They took on this event with amazing spirit and limitless dedication. It says so much about Five Quad that the volunteers didn't even know Brink, and yet they honor him like family, year after year. It's deeply satisfying to know that the values he stood for and the contributions he made will be honored at UAlbany forever,\" said Arnold. Last April, more than 250 runners participated in the BRINK 5K. A highlight of the 2013 event - the awarding of the first David C. Brinkerhoff Memorial Scholarship to sophomore Brendan McCann, a criminal justice major and Five Quad member - was \"incredible,\" Arnold observed. The race's tagline, \"Run T oward It,\" was developed because \"first responders - police, fire, EMS - run toward danger.\" It also ties in with the award: \"Through the scholarship, we want to help each year's recipient run toward his or her goal,\" explained the New York City resident. Arnold, a Manhattan District Attorney's Office prosecutor who led the development of the office's Financial Intelligence Unit, noted that the BRINK 5K has reconnected him with UAlbany. \"I spent some of the most special years of my life at the University,\" he said.

Jones joins four other college and university presidents and a school district superintendent - all UAlbany alumni - to discuss the importance of higher education. www.albany.edu 7With higher education under intense scrutiny, the value of a college degree is being questioned like never before. For generations of Americans, attending a four-year residential college was part and parcel of the American dream, a path that led to a career with upward mobility and often a rise in social class, as well. For working-class families, in particular, a college degree was the great equalizer and a portal to opportunity. Now, however, naysayers point to escalating tuition costs, mounting student debt, stagnant graduation rates and uncertain job prospects as arguments against the primacy of a college degree. College presidents are battling on many fronts against the forces undercutting higher education. For this article, University at Albany President Robert J. Jones, Ph.D., and four college presidents and the superintendent of a large suburban upstate New York school district - all UAlbany alumni - added their voices to this important discussion, conceding that they have never felt such intense questioning about the importance of higher education. \"Unprecedented\" and \"crossroads\" are among the words they used to describe such disturbing trends as declining government funding, a boom in online learning and concerns that high tuitions are pricing middle-class families out of the market. On the other hand, the presidents cite statistics to bolster their argument. For instance, despite a lingering recession, the unemployment rate for college graduates with bachelor's or advanced degrees was 3.8 percent compared to 7.4 percent for high-school graduates, according to a May 2013 report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. A 2012 study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found that, between 2010 and 2012, people with bachelor's or graduate degrees gained 2 million jobs, while those with high-school diplomas, and those with less than a high-school education, lost 230,000 jobs over the same two-year period. That same study confirmed that, on average, college graduates still earn nearly twice as much as high-school graduates over the course of their working careers - a stark wage disparity existing since 2005. At the same time, such narrow assessments of return on investment fail to recognize the less-tangible benefits of a college degree, such as civic engagement, societal contributions and a richer understanding of the world. \"The ultimate purpose of higher education is to give students a broad base of knowledge and skills, rather than to train them for a specific job,\" said Jones, who attended three national forums since May to discuss the \"perfect storm\" of forces challenging higher education. \"We need to prepare students who possess analytical and critical skills and also have the entrepreneurial ability to shift jobs several times. We need critically engaged citizens who can reinvent themselves for jobs that, in some cases, don't even exist today. I get worried about this growing trend of trying to commoditize higher education. We are a four-year public university at UAlbany, and we're not meant to be a technical school that offers training for a specific job.\" Jones said a president's challenge is leading large and complex institutions that are not very nimble and tend to \"the ultimate purpose of higher education is to give students a broad base of knowledge and skills, rather than to train them for a specific job,\" said Jones.The University at Albany's downtown campusmove at a glacial pace, ruled by committee. But ever-accelerating workplace and societal changes require a swift and agile response. Jones is endeavoring to bring the methodology of academia and the demands of corporate America into closer alignment, and he has a sense of urgency about the task. \"There is no doubt in my mind that the higher-education landscape will be shaped and re-shaped in unprecedented ways in the next 10 to 20 years,\" Jones said. Mary ellen Jukoski, M.S.'74, president of Mitchell College in New London, Conn., concurs that rapid change is inevitable, but she believes that higher education cannot afford to abandon its bedrock principles. \"As with health care, media and other industries, higher education is at a crossroads today,\" she said. \"But we cannot forget that we need to have an educated citizenry for the continued success of our country. T oday's college students are the future leaders of our nation, and they will require a liberal-arts foundation and the ability to communicate articulately, to think critically and to work well with others in a team-oriented workplace environment.\" Jukoski added, \"I don't have all the answers about the future direction of higher education, but I have a strong belief that the residential-college experience has value and that it has a place now and will have a place in the future.\" As the daughter of first-generation immigrants from Europe, Jukoski, who grew up in Massena, N.Y., near the Canadian border, understands firsthand how a college degree can open many doors. \"My parents always stressed the value of higher education because they saw it as a great opportunity,\" she said. \"I loved it at UAlbany, and it led me to pursue a career as a leader in higher education.\" California State University, San Bernardino, President t om\u00e1s Morales, M.S.'78, Ph.D.'98, whose career in higher education spans 38 years, puts it plainly: \"There is no way I would be where I am today without my Ph.D. from UAlbany. The return on investment has been huge for me.\" Morales, who raised three children with his wife of 41 years, Evy, worked full time as an administrator at the State University of New York at New Paltz when he began graduate school part time at UAlbany. It took him eight years to complete his Ph.D. in educational administration and policy studies. Born in Puerto Rico, Morales grew up in the South Bronx in a lower- middle-class family. His father worked in a Farberware factory, and his mother was a crossing guard; they made great sacrifices to send Morales and one of his brothers to college. His other brother chose to join the military and later served with the New York City Police Department. At San Bernardino, situated in a financially challenged county in southern California, fewer than one adult in five has a baccalaureate degree. The college's motto, \"T ransforming Lives and Communities Through Higher Education,\" is more than a slogan to Morales. He is testament to the transformative effect of a college degree, and he wants to ensure that future generations of students from humble backgrounds such as his still have that opportunity to attend college. \"there is no doubt in my mind that the higher education landscape will be shaped and re-shaped in unprecedented ways in the next 10 to 20 years,\" Jones said. 8 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2013www.albany.edu 9Next year, Morales will assume the chairmanship of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. \"We are going to have to embrace change and control our destiny as a higher-education industry,\" he said. \"I am on other national organizations, and we are talking about this issue constantly. I would not say we are not yet pushing the panic button, but we are all looking at how best to serve students, how to increase student success and how to reinforce the value of a baccalaureate degree.\" University of South Carolina President Harris Pastides, B.S.'75, said a college degree has never been more important. He added: \"But don't just take my word for it; ask business leaders and the innovators in our technology sector. They will tell you a bachelor's degree is now the minimal entry point for getting a decent job. There is simply no better pathway to earning a healthy lifetime living than a college degree.\" Pastides noted the current rate of 35-40 percent of Americans earning a bachelor's degree \"is not good enough,\" and the U.S. is losing ground to China, India, Brazil and other countries that are robustly subsidizing and placing a premium on higher education. Pastides said his biggest concern remains rising tuition costs resulting from cuts in government funding, and his top priority is to devise ways to hold the line on price. But he refuses to be an apologist for higher education: \"The American model of public higher education is the best ever developed in the history of the planet. That's why we pull the best and the brightest students from around the world to U.S. colleges and universities. I believe if we fiddle with that too much, we're going to be in trouble. College is the last organized place society has for inculcating leadership.\" Pastides grew up in a working-class family in New York City and graduated with honors from highly regarded Stuyvesant High School. He had many choices for college but chose UAlbany, where he majored in biology, \"because it was a high-quality education at a very low cost.\" A New York State Regents Scholarship covered nearly his entire tuition. At the University, \"I made lifelong friends, and it was one of my best choices and among the most formative experiences of my life. It all started for me at Albany,\" said Pastides, who went on to earn a master's of public health and a Ph.D. in epidemiology at Yale University. Joseph S. Brosnan, M.S.'69, ed.D.'81, president of Delaware Valley College in Pennsylvania, grew up lower-middle class in Levittown, Long Island.

After earning a bachelor's degree from Marist College, Brosnan was accepted to Columbia University for graduate school but chose UAlbany because the tuition was more affordable. He praised provost Susan Phillips, who chaired the committee that reviewed his dissertation on determinants of student success in college, noting that the University \"gave me access to a great education.\" Added Brosnan, who received fellowships that provided tuition waivers and stipends: \"Albany really launched my career and provided me with a great network of colleagues. It opened up a door that helped me get hired in the SUNY System at Potsdam, where I worked eight years as an administrator.\" A veteran of 40 years in higher education, Brosnan said this \"is one of the most critical periods I've experienced.\" He added that the pressures and challenges of being a college president are underscored by the fact that the average tenure for a president has dropped from eight years to five in the past decade. \"We used to emphasize the intrinsic value of higher education and how a well-educated person would have a better, richer life. But I make the economic argument much more often now. I've seen studies that show a person with a college degree is going to earn anywhere from $300,000 to $1 million more over the course of a lifetime than a person with a high-school diploma. I also quote the statistic that shows that a high-school graduate will only be able to earn 67 cents to every $1 earned by a college graduate,\" said Brosnan. But he cautioned that the irrefutable evidence of a college degree's superior value will be moot if colleges and universities cannot rein in costs and control rising tuition rates. \"Affordability is the most important issue facing higher education,\" Brosnan said. \"The economic model we're working with now is broken. We have to find a more affordable model. My bottom line is that yes, higher education has value, but if college is no longer affordable for families, the question is irrelevant. That is why continued federal and state support of post-secondary education is so important.\" Loliver robinson, M.S.'94, ed.D.'96, is superintendent of the Shenendehowa School District in Clifton Park, an Albany suburb. Eighty-five percent of the 740 students who graduated in the high school's Class of 2013 will attend a two- or four-year college. That rate of college-bound students continues to increase, but Robinson said parents, with growing concern, are questioning higher education's value. \"The parents I talk with are still afraid their children will lose a competitive edge in the workforce if they don't get a college degree,\" Robinson observed. \"But they also want to get the biggest bang for their buck. I Harris Pastides, B.S.'75 President, University of South CarolinaJoseph S. Brosnan, M.S.'69, President of Delaware Valley ed.D.'96 Superintendent, Shenendehowa School District .www.albany.edu 11think colleges need to add more skills-oriented classes to their liberal-arts cores. Students need to come out of college with skill sets that are marketable, and that's a legitimate concern for parents. I am hearing a lot of concern from parents who say they're spending a lot of money and taking on debt, and the kids are coming out college educated but grossly under-skilled for the labor force. Parents want to see their children get practical experience while they're in college, through internships and other workplace opportunities.\" Robinson's parents were adamant that he and his seven siblings would all have a chance to attend college, and they did. Robinson, the youngest, earned a bachelor's degree in economics at Brown University, and his graduate degrees in educational administration and policy studies at UAlbany, he said, were a sound investment. \"The practical nature of my courses at UAlbany gave me direct skills that applied in my field. The biggest benefit was that they prepared me to be a school administrator,\" added Robinson. Jones, who grew up poor on a sharecropper's farm in Georgia, said his parents instilled the value of education at a very young age in him, his brother and sister. \"My parents made sure we went to school and did well,\" he said. \"I remember they went to PTA meetings after working in the fields all day so they could meet with our teachers and check on our progress. My parents only went to school through the sixth or seventh grade, but they encouraged me to go on to college and graduate school. The only thing intentional in my entire career was to get a Ph.D. and to become a scientist. Everything else that has happened, from working with Bishop Desmond T utu in South Africa to becoming the president of this University, has been unexpected. \"With a college education, all kinds of unintended, exciting things can happen in your life. Once you acquire the credentials, the world is an open door, and you can go anywhere.\" Jukoski congratulates a recent Mitchell College graduate. a high-school graduate will only be able to earn 67 cents to every $1 earned by a college graduate.12 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2013 Larry Bortstein, J.D., B.A. '91Alumni Profiles Larry Bortstein arrived on the University at Albany campus in 1987, \"the dawn of a new era in computing. I literally came to Albany with a typewriter and left with a PC.\" Now one of the preeminent legal experts in his field, Bortstein was named the top information-technology attorney in the New York City area for 2013 by Lexology, a firm that rates attorneys around the globe. Chambers USA, publisher of \"the world's leading guides to the legal profession,\" has recognized the New York-based Bortstein Legal Group (BLG) in the \"T echnology and Outsourcing\" category for three years. Bortstein, who earned his J.D. from Brooklyn Law School, served as senior technology counsel at American Express and global head of technology law at Lehman Brothers. After Lehman's bankruptcy in 2008, he founded BLG, a law firm specializing in technology transactions with a focus on the financial-services industry. \"We bring expertise and dedication to a unique area of law,\" Bortstein says of the firm, which recently opened a London office. \"Albany instilled in me an appreciation for the utility of technology, and the classes I took helped me understand how I could apply it in the real world,\" recalls the former political-science major, who minored in English and history. \"It was an exhilarating time to be studying technology.\" From Nancy Belowich-Negron, who worked for Disabled Student Services and now directs the University's Disability Resource Center, Bortstein \"learned perseverance and toughness. She is an incredible person, and the number of students she's helped throughout her career is remarkable. I'm forever grateful to Nancy for the time she spent with me.\" Through Belowich-Negron, Bortstein has supported the Disability Resource Center Scholarship Fund. \"I have very fond memories of Albany, and I want the school to be great,\" he notes, adding that he tells friends whose children are UAlbany students that \"their children are getting a phenomenal education.\" Although he hasn't visited UAlbany recently, the Great Danes basketball fan would welcome the opportunity to talk with students on campus. \"Albany is a hub for technological investment and innovation in New York State,\" Bortstein observes. \"That's exciting for me. I really got the bug at Albany, and I still get excited by technology.\" For more information about Larry Bortstein and BLG, please visit http://blegalgroup.com. By Carol Olechowski From Typewriter to Personal Computerwww.albany.eduWhile a student at UAlbany, Deborah Rosenbaum was hungry for additional experiences that could enrich her education. Her experiences included an internship in a senator's office, student teaching and independent study - all while earning her degree in business administration. This hunger continues today.In July of 2012, she took a six-month leave from her job as an account manager in graphic-arts solutions for Xerox to volunteer her talents to the Syracuse chapter of Say Yes T o Education, a nonprofit education foundation designed to increase high-school and college graduation rates for urban youth. During this time, she helped Say Yes cultivate new relationships in the Syracuse business community. Her efforts will not only enhance fundraising for the organization, but will also help attract mentors and create internship and job opportunities for youths in the Say Yes program. \"It's such an important organization,\" explained Rosenbaum, when asked why she chose to volunteer full time for Say Yes. \"I believe that education is the key to ending the cycle of poverty.\" The best part: Her leave was not only approved and encouraged by Xerox - it was paid in full through the company's Social Service Leave program. Through a rigorous application process, Rosenbaum was one of only 11 Xerox employees nationwide selected to take part in this program last year. \"It's such a unique program; I was very fortunate to be part of it,\" said the mother of four and native of Manlius, N.Y. \"Xerox is truly committed to fostering stronger communities.\"Even though her full-time stint is over, Rosenbaum remains active in the Say Yes organization. She also maintains strong ties to the UAlbany community ... from annual trips with close alumni friends to occasional trips back to campus. Rosenbaum credits UAlbany with providing a foundation for her well-rounded life and career. \"I got a great education and opportunities for great experiences,\" Rosenbaum noted. \"Life is about experiences.\" Deborah Rosenbaum, B.S.'81 to Give Back By Jim Sciancalepore, M.A.'93 1314 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2013 THe RNA INSTITUTe: Distinguishing UAlbany in Life Sciences Research By Jill U AdamsPhotos by Gary Gold '70 Professor of Chemistry and Biology Daniele Fabris is the director of the RNA Mass Spectrometry Center, part of the RNA Institute.www.albany.edu 15Muscular dystrophy, antibiotic resistance, breast cancer, arthritis. These disparate diseases have something in common, something beyond biology gone wrong. \"Central to all that bad biology is RNA,\" says Paul Agris, director of the newly christened RNA Institute expansion at the University at Albany. A quick primer for the non-biologists out there: RNA is a kind of middleman between DNA and proteins. Our genes are made of DNA and represent the blueprint for all our features and predispositions. Proteins are the workhorses of the cell; they include enzymes, hormones and structural components. The job of RNA is to \"transcribe\" the DNA information and \"translate\" it into proteins. In the realm of scientific research, however, says chemistry professor Dan Fabris, \"RNA is a little neglected.\" Some researchers have studied RNA their whole careers. Agris became intrigued with RNA in graduate school. Others, such as biology professor Ben Szaro, came to RNA late, by following a research question to its core. Szaro studies how neurons send out projections in order to connect to other neurons. \"When connections are lost between neurons, disease results,\" he explains, naming neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's. Focusing on neurofilament proteins, which provide structural support for neuronal projections, Szaro studies how nerves can regenerate. \"We originally focused on proteins,\" Szaro says. \"Then we focused on DNA. Then we realized, nope! It's the RNA that is the major central point by which the neurons decide how much protein to make.\" BIRTH OF A NeW INSTITUTe The story of the RNA Institute begins with a coincidence - a conglomeration of UAlbany and Capital District scientists whose research focused on RNA and who nurtured their shared interests through the Hudson Valley RNA Club. It continued with a strategic vision, a recognition that UAlbany could not compete against the country's top research universities in genomics and proteomics. Lynn Videka, then UAlbany's vice president for Research, saw that by fully engaging this RNA research, the University could get ahead of the game. A senior scientist was needed to provide leadership. Enter Agris, who had spent years at North Carolina State University as researcher, professor and department chair. There, he formed the RNA Society, which brought together Research T riangle Park scientists to share data and methods. But his efforts to establish a formal RNA center never gained traction. Former Duke postdoctoral fellow Scott T enenbaum, now at the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, called Agris to come take a look at UAlbany. Agris took up the challenge 16 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2013and, in 2009, started working on formalizing the RNA Institute, hammering out new faculty lines and new facilities while still doing research at NC State. He moved to UAlbany full time in 2010. At that time, senior faculty slots were filled first by Fabris and later by Marlene Belfort, who was previously at the Wadsworth Center of the New York State Department of Health. Since then, two new junior faculty have been hired, and two more are on their way. \"We're using the institute as a way to recruit great faculty,\" Agris says, adding, \"The institute wouldn't be here without the desire of UAlbany faculty in the first place.\" ReSeARCH AND APPLICATIONS How niche is RNA research? It's not exactly a poor stepchild to genetics and protein research: Indeed, researchers in the field have been the recipients of more than 30 Nobel Prizes, eight of them since 2006. Still, with perhaps one exception, it's been largely limited to very basic research in cell biology. Viewing RNA as a road to therapeutics has been slower to catch on. That one exception is the potential of a type of RNA that silences, or turns off, genes.\"T wo-thirds of the research in my lab is disease-oriented,\" Agris says, and includes rare and neglected diseases, such as multi-drug-resistant infections. Agris has identified a bacterial RNA target for novel antibiotic drugs, which would be effective in treating drug-resistant infections that confound current antibiotic arsenals, such as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and methicillin-resistant staph infections (MRSA). The vast majority of pharmaceuticals on the market are designed to target proteins in the body. T ake, for instance, the top two prescribed drugs of 2010: Hydrocodone binds to neuronal proteins that dampen pain signals, and lisinopril binds to an enzyme in blood vessels to lower blood pressure. Fabris says RNA has the potential to be a much more efficient target for therapies. Here's why: T o provide enough drug to interact with most copies of a particular protein, the dose is often high enough to produce other effects - including toxic side effects - on the body. But a single strand of RNA can code lots of the same protein, so in theory one might get more effect with lower doses. It's comparable to shutting down production of widgets at the factory, rather than trying to track down and pull the product from store shelves later.RNA Institute Director Paul Agris looks on as biochemistry student Seoyeon Hong works on a UV-visible spectrophotometer; Hong consults with her mentor, postdoctoral fellow Kimberly Harris. www.albany.edu 17INNOVATION R ULeS Making RNA the focus of an institute is novel in itself - and UAlbany covers the spectrum, from biophysics of the molecules to cellular functions. The RNA Institute has proved innovative in other ways, too. The research facilities, located in the Life Sciences Research Building, include specialized laboratory spaces, such as an advanced computational center and an advanced instrumentation lab. Agris is adamant that these facilities are of a programmatic nature, much more than \"core facilities,\" because they also house potential collaborators for anyone investigating RNA. \"They're not just instruments, but staff people, too,\" he says. \"Thus, the institute engages in full-fledged, long-term collaboration with investigators on papers and on grant proposals. It is also a necessity to make the institute economically sustainable.\" Another way the RNA Institute distinguishes itself is through its commitment to undergraduate research. No lip service here: The institute supports graduate students' and postdoctoral fellows' travel to present at national and international meetings. Individual faculty members financially support undergraduate research in the labs. Seoyeon Hong, a biochemistry major, learned about research opportunities from a friend and, after working about 10 hours per week, for credit, during her junior year, spent her summer in the Agris lab. The work sharply contrasts with her coursework experience, where she followed standard written protocols to obtain expected data. Doing real research in a real lab is beyond what's in a textbook, she says. \"We sometimes get data we can't explain.\" When that happens, Hong consults with Agris or postdoctoral fellow Kimberly Harris to troubleshoot. Or she combs through the scientific literature for alternative methods or interpretations. Hong is undecided about her future, but continuing research science is an option she's considering. Agris, too, got his start as an undergrad. \"I came out of that experience motivated to look for things that were new - not just what everyone else is doing.\" You know what he found: RNA. After working in the Mass Spectrometry Center lab, student Yik Siu pauses for a photo with, clockwise from left, graduate student Rebecca Rose; Agris; Fabris; Harris; and Hong.Getting Down to Business After years of planning and fundraising and months of construction, UAlbany's new School of Business building opens this fall. The 96,000-square-foot LEED-certified structure, designed by architect Perkins+Will and constructed by Kirchhoff-Consigli Construction Management, was completed at a cost of $64 million - $9.75 million of it from private sources. To date, 81 percent, or nearly $8 million, of the private funding has been raised. Designed to accommodate 21st-century teaching and learning, the School of Business includes: one trading room 17 classrooms, including a specialized executive-education classroom, a computing classroom and an honors/enhanced classroom one business center one Student Services suite five labs one research computing lab one graduate student lounge one faculty lounge 11 seminar rooms two interview offices five conference rooms 10 group-study rooms Office of Career Services 50 faculty offices one caf\u00e9 and seating area 18 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2013www.albany.edu 19Stacy J. Kanter, B.S.'79 The Art the Deal By Jim Sciancalepore, M.A.'93 \"I love puzzles,\" said Stacy J. Kanter, partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP , one of the largest law firms in the world. \"I enjoy working through a challenge and bringing something to a successful conclusion.\" It's this love - and a unique combination of problem-solving and people skills, underscored by tenacity and perseverance - that has made Kanter a nationally recognized leader in the legal community. She was recently named a \"Dealmaker of the Year\" by The American Lawyer magazine, which honored Kanter for her work in guiding Realogy Holdings Corp. through a successful initial public offering (IPO). The task was a multi-year, multi-layered challenge as she helped the real-estate giant (parent company to brands such as Century 21 and Coldwell Banker) navigate the intricacies of a debt restructuring during a real-estate downturn ... and ultimately raise $1.2 billion dollars, making it the biggest private equity-backed IPO of 2012. In her work for Realogy and other clients, Kanter employs expertise that intersects law and business, building on a foundation she formed as a business major at UAlbany. \"I was looking for a quality education from a public university, and UAlbany was my best choice,\" she explained. She also credits experiential opportunities at the University - such as serving as an R.A. and on student boards - with helping to foster her leadership skills. The mother of two currently lives and works in Manhattan. She is both co-head of her firm's Global Corporate Finance practice and co-chair of its Global Diversity Committee. Whatever puzzles are coming her way in the future, Kanter is ready. Gary Gold '70 Alumni Profile 20 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2013 Three Literary MastersBy Paul Grondahl, M.A.'84 The following profiles, excerpted from stories published by the Albany Times Union in May and June 2013, are reprinted with permission. Joseph E. Persico, B.A.'52 Merging History and Biography At age 78, Joseph E. Persico took on the most demanding assignment of his career: a sweeping history of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his interactions with the military commanders he appointed to lead American forces in World War II. \"I told my wife this book was either going to keep me alive or kill me,\" said the author, now 83. \"Well, I'm still here.\" Roosevelt's Centurions: FDR and the Commanders He Led to Victory in World War II was published May 28 by Random House. The magisterial work merges an expansive military history with an intimate political biography. The 650-page volume includes 70 pages of bibliography and source notes. Persico's research techniques are a curious hybrid of old school and new technology. \"The material that can be found online now is miraculous,\" he said. He read the Marshall Papers (housed in Lexington, Va.) and the Eisenhower Papers (Johns Hopkins University) online from his winter home in Mexico. Persico still takes research notes in long-hand on 3x5 index cards and files them in a large box kept under his bed. When the box is full, he starts writing. \"The under-the-bed box worked its magic again,\" he said. Roosevelt's Centurions probes the machinations of FDR as commander-in-chief and adds profiles of the deep bench of talent the president recruited. \"He made some brilliant choices,\" said Persico. \"[George C.] Marshall was FDR's stout oak and a selfless man, universally respected. Hap Arnold became the founding father of the U.S. Air Forces. The team Roosevelt appointed was so good that they stayed in place throughout the war, while Churchill was firing generals left and right.\" Persico was critical of FDR for contradicting commanders and choosing North Africa for the initial campaign www.albany.edu 21 Coming Attractions Through the New York State Writers Insti- tute's Visiting Writers Series, Man Booker International Prize winner and UAlbany professor Lydia Davis will give a reading Oct. 1 at 4:15 p.m. in the University's Performing Arts Center Recital Hall.

For times and locations, and for more information about NYSWI Fall 2013 programming, link to www.albany.edu/writers-inst/. in the European theater: \"Churchill saw the Mediterranean as the lifeline of the British Empire, and he was focused on preserving it. He was very persuasive and had so much military expertise that FDR went along with him. It turned out to be a bad decision because the American campaigns into North Africa, Sicily and Italy postponed D-Day and the invasion of Normandy by at least a year and extended the war.\" Still, FDR \"was the right commander-in-chief for the time,\" Persico said. \"It's hard to argue with victory.\" John D'Annibale/Times UnionUniversity at Albany professor and writer-in-residence Lydia Davis, who has published a chapbook of observations of three cows that graze across the road from her rural Rensselaer County house, is the 2013 winner of the Man Booker International Prize. The prestigious literary award, presented in London last May, carries a cash prize of \u00a360,000 (roughly $91,000). \"She is a unique fiction writer who writes very short stories that are highly reflective, kind of ironic and sometimes comical. They play with the very concept of what storytelling is,\" said Donald Faulkner, director of the New York State Writers Institute at UAlbany. \"This is a wonderful tribute and great recognition of a brilliant writer,\" said fiction writer and UAlbany faculty member Lynne Tillman, who shares an office with Davis and teaches a fiction workshop with her. \"She's very observant of the world around her. I think of her as making paintings with words.\" Sir Christopher Ricks, chairman of the Booker Prize judges, said that Davis' fictions \"fling their lithe arms wideto embrace many a kind ... They have been called stories but could equally be miniatures, anecdotes, essays, jokes, parables, fables, texts, aphorisms or even apophthegms, prayers or simply observations.\" In the first sentence of \"Cows,\" Davis, 66, writes: \"Each new day, when they come out from the far side of the barn, it is like the next act, or the start of an entirely new play.\" Davis, recipient of a 2003 MacArthur Fellowship, is also an acclaimed translator of classic works of French literature into English. She was named a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters in France for her translations of Proust and Flaubert. \"She is an excellent editor, great teacher and sympathetic reader who has helped a lot of young writers,\" Faulkner said. \"She's not a prima donna on any level.\" After she won the MacArthur grant, Davis chose to remain in the classroom. \"I've realized I miss working with undergraduate students because they make me laugh and their writing can be very exciting and unexpected,\" the Writers Institute Fellow told the Times Union in 2005. 22 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2013 Lydia Davis Painting With Words Janie Aireywww.albany.edu 23William Kennedy Roscoe's Operatic Rendering William Kennedy finds it fitting that his novel Roscoe, a fictional reconstitution of Albany's legendary Democratic political machine, is going to be turned into an opera by composer Evan Mack. \"I think Roscoe would approve because he led a grand, operatic life,\" Kennedy said of the title character, Roscoe Conway, the fixer and bagman who wants to quit politics after 26 years of carrying out the machine's chicanery. The New Yorker praised the novel - set in Albany on V-J Day 1945 - as \"thick with crime, passion and backroom banter.\" Roscoe was published in 2002 and reached the New York Times bestseller list. Last June, Mack announced a two-year development deal with Kennedy to render the fictional portrait of the O'Connell-Corning machine into a new American opera. \"The novel had been sitting on my desk for a while. I read it a few months ago, and it hit me in the gut that this is an opera,\" said Mack, an Albany-based award-winning opera composer and professor of music theory and piano at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs. \"Roscoe\" will be Mack's third full-length opera and his second collaboration with librettist Joshua McGuire. Mack's operas have been performed around the country. He figured it will take about one year to create the opera.Kennedy, founder and executive director of the New York State Writers Institute, said Mack approached him. He listened to the composer's work and liked it. It is the first time that the Pulitzer Prize-winning author, who has sold movie and stage options for his novels, inked a deal for an operatic rendering of his work. \"The world of opera is a new musical incursion for me,\" said Kennedy, who is known for singing popular tunes at parties, sometimes while playing ukulele, and for performing in a barbershop quartet. Kennedy reads at Skidmore each summer as part of the Writers Institute. At 85, he is rewriting two plays and \"fiddling around with a new novel.\" Suzanne Lance24 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2013 The UAlbany family is cheering the completion of the University's long-awaited multi-sport complex. Ground was broken April 17, 2012, for the complex, which features seating for a total of 8,500 spectators, as well as chairback seats and luxury suites. The total construction cost of $23 million includes $3.5 million for the new track facility. Great Danes football and men's and women's soccer will be played at the complex.

Something to Cheer About! Mark Schmidt Ask Geoff By Geoff Williams , University Archivist 26 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2013Home Sweet Home PArt 2 By the early 1960s, noted architect Edward Durrell Stone was designing and building the first of the University at Albany's uptown campus dormitory complexes. Dutch Quadrangle was partially occupied in Fall 1964, two years before courses were held on the new campus. In many ways, the uptown campus dorms were similar to those on Alumni Quadrangle. All had communal spaces where students could congregate, but rooms were now gathered around central suites. Each suite had an individual washroom, rather than shared bathrooms down the hall. (The Indian Quad low-rises, the exceptions, are now being remodeled to include en suite bathrooms.) Gone, however, were such amenities as the beautiful molding that characterized Alumni Quad, as the pressure to build on a massive scale as quickly and inexpensively as possible meant the elimination of molding and woodwork. The Stone dormitories would be the last residences to have dining halls. By 1972, the last of the uptown campus residence hall complexes, Indian Quad, was completed. No new construction of residence halls or academic buildings would take place on the campus until the late 1980s. While there were many reasons for the halt in construction - including the '70s decline in student enrollment and periodic New York State fiscal problems - one major reason was repaying the bonded debt that Gov. Nelson Rockefeller had accumulated while expanding every campus in the SUNY System simultaneously. In the mid-1960s, University President Evan Collins required every fraternity and sorority to sell, or give up the lease on, its house and relocate residents to the uptown campus dormitories. Fully occupied dorm rooms paid off the quadrangles' construction. The Greeks' move to campus would have long-term consequences, though. The anti-establishment atmosphere of the time made it difficult for the Greeks to fill dormitories, and most of the groups disbanded. A grouper law imposed in the mid-'70s prevented fraternities and sororities from having houses in Albany, and the era of small-group housing owned or rented by the organizations and the school was over. The housing situation retained the status quo until 1988, when Freedom Quadrangle opened across Fuller Road. Projected to cost $6.8 million, Freedom Quad represented a distinct departure from all former housing at the school. Driven by demand for more amenities in student housing, the project represented the first campus residences based on an apartment model. Each unit had a fully equipped kitchen. Arranged in four clusters of buildings, Freedom Quad provided accommodations for 410 graduate and upper-division undergraduate students. An even more ambitious project, the apartment-style Empire Commons, opened in 2004. The complex, consisting of 26 buildings on 25 acres on the western side of the campus, houses 1,200 graduate and upper-level undergraduate students. Each building designated for undergraduates has 12 four-bedroom, two-bath apartments. Members of Gamma Kappa Phi gathered at Herkimer Hall for this photo published in the 1968 Torch. www.albany.edu 27 Graduate accommodations include four bedrooms and four baths per unit. All Empire Commons apartments include kitchens, living rooms, and washers and dryers. A commons building houses exercise and mail facilities, vending rooms, staff offices and meeting areas. All rooms provide high-speed Internet access - an amenity since retrofitted into older residence halls at considerable expense. The $59 million cost of Empire Commons' construction was funded through tax-exempt municipal bonds. UAlbany's newest student housing, Liberty T errace, built at a cost of $66.2 million, continues the trend of apartment-style living. The 500-bed complex, which opened in Fall 2012 on the east side of the campus, overlooks the pond behind Indian Quad. A typical apartment layout features four single bedrooms and two baths. Liberty T errace has a number of commons areas. Like Empire Commons, it includes weight rooms, which are being retrofitted into all uptown housing. UAlbany's Student Housing Corporation manages the complex. Although much smaller than Empire Commons, Liberty T errace affords \"swing space\" to house students while older uptown-campus dormitories - the oldest opened nearly 50 years ago - can be gutted and remodeled. The complex also boasts another distinction: It's environmentally sustainable. Equipped with a geothermal heat-pump system, Liberty T errace is expected to reduce energy and water usage by 50 and 45 percent, respectively. Housing options have expanded on and near the uptown campus over the past 25 years, as evidenced by the aerial photo, below, of Freedom Quad; the Empire Commons picture, right; and the interior and exterior shots of Liberty Terrace, below, right. The Liberty Terrace floor plan depicts the apartment-style layout of the complex.

Vince reports that he tried to get to the reunion, but was not able to make it. He called Charlie Quinn, Shirley Tooker, Buzz Miller, Josie Autilio, Janet Risacler and Harvey Klaus and found them all to be in reasonably good health, but they were also unable to attend the reunion. If you have a news item please contact Vince, who now lives in New Bern, N.C., at (252) 638-1048. Norman Baldwin's wife, Louise Owire '43, passed away in 2003. He has since moved into a retirement home in San Francisco, Calif. Norman, now 93, is still the secretary for the Stanford School of Business' Class of 1947. Miriam Newell Biskin is the author of many books and remains active. Class notes councilor: Vince Gillen, vpgillen@yahoo.com 47 College of the Atlantic commemorated its third president, Dr. Louis Rabineau, by dedicating The Lou Rabineau Educational Studies Center April 5. An avid educator who had previously served as chancellor of the Connecticut Commission for Higher Education, Lou served as president of COA from 1984 to 1993. Lou's intellectual curiosity, humor, openness and astute ability to engage experts in a wide variety of fields have been credited with saving the college while it was in a state of turmoil. 48 A note from your class councilor: Donald Sayles has summed up the feelings of the Class of 1948 by wondering what kind of news people of our vintage might have that's worth being published in The Carillon. Since most of the men had started college in the early 1940s, then served in World War II, they are now approaching some 90 years of age. However, Don reports that he can still walk, see, hear, drive, sail, swim, read and do yardwork. There are limitations about work, though. In army training, the march lasted 50 minutes, followed by a 10-minute break. Now any energy demanding work calls for 10 minutes' work and 50 minutes' rest. He says that he does value the magazine and mentions his happiness about the new football stadium, which will be opening this fall. Helen Kisiel Schick traveled for four days from Long Island to Potsdam for her grandson's graduation from Clarkson University in May. Helen was able to spend Mother's Day with family before returning to Bay Shore Atria in New York. Another one of her grandsons graduated from UMASS Amherst - now all five of her \"varsity\" are out of college, leaving the \"junior varsity\" five to follow in the years to come. Helen did her \"Queen Elizabeth\" wave from a convertible in West Islip's Memorial Day parade and participated in the after-parade festivities. Her work with historical societies, Atria programs and planning for the 36th County Fair keeps her busy. Sam Dickieson reports from Seneca Falls, N.Y., that all is well with him and his wife, Dorothy '47. They are looking forward to their 66th wedding anniversary. edna Wylie is continuing her work at her retirement community. Both of her grandchildren are college students. Jane O'Brien is well and enjoys seeing her five children and 11 grandchildren. Isabel Cooper Baker's grandson from Glens Falls, N.Y., earned first place in a recent pentathlon, and will enter Syracuse University in the fall. He plays lead trombone in the All State Youth Orchestra. Isabel and Robertson Baker '49 have five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Ruth Doran from Baldwinsville, N.Y., is holding her own but not traveling. eileen Abrams Pettersen and Wanda Tomasik Methe live in the Cohoes area, are doing well and see each other often.

They are: Annette and Larry Appleby (5/31/13). Bonnie Lewis Adkins notes that her granddaughter, Dee Hertzberg, has moved from Paraguay to Madagascar, where she is serving as country director of Mission for the Peace Corps. Bonnie and Lee have finally finished remodeling their living quarters in Middlebury, Vt. They have a new living area with a bedroom alcove. Now, classmates traveling through the Vermont/New England area have a place to stay free of charge. Bonnie states, \"We are looking forward to our 65th reunion in 2014 and seeing all of our classmates.\" Doris Hoeninger Andersen writes from Grand Rapids, Mich., that her husband, Dan, a V-12 graduate of Union College, celebrated his 88th birthday May 30. She keeps in touch weekly with Ruth Leiger Fishburn, who lives in Good Samaritan Village in Kissimmee, Fla. Lena Sorcinella theCarillon Alumni News & Notes 28 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2013 www.albany.edu29Capuano sounded so happy when she wrote about the birth of her great- grandson, Brady, born April 9, 2013. Brady's father, Marine Staff Sgt. Wesley, is stationed in Japan and Okinawa, but made it home three days before the birth. Lena states: \"Spring is unbelievably beautiful here in Altamont. It's great to be alive and see the beauty all around us.\" Doesn't she sound happy?! elsa Moberg Cox writes that she is so busy in southern California that she does not even think of traveling elsewhere. She did travel to Arizona for a week to visit her son and grandson. Elsa is very involved in church activities, serving as a circle leader for a women's group and as deacon, and administering communion to shut-ins. She may make plans to attend our 65th reunion and again bring her daughter Kristen. Don Dickinson continues to be involved in his church library in Tucson, Ariz., and also attends regular meetings of two book clubs (a true librarian!). In May, he attended the high-school graduation of a granddaughter. Richard Foster reports from Sarasota that he has little to complain about. He still plays for Vesper services and enjoys singing with the Harmonaires, playing bridge two or three times a week, and attending theater often. It was great to receive a letter from Mary Jane Peris Fredericks, who was the editor of our yearbook, The Pedagogue. She and her late husband, Charlie, made many moves around the United States, including California and Delaware, before settling in Gloversville, N.Y., near their Johnstown roots. Charlie passed away far too young in 1982, but Mary Jane states that she was fortunate to be left with four terrific daughters. Her family now includes seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. She retired from teaching French at Gloversville High School in 1988. Being involved in church activities, the local library and playing bridge regularly keep her active and out of trouble. It was great to receive a nice, long letter from Janet Lewis Hanson. She graduated from Fort Edward High School with Marea Battershall Reid-Roberts, Bob Nichols and Ursula Neuhaus Schiff, all of whom attended NYSCT. At Albany, Janet lived with nine other girls on Western Avenue, in a house connected to Pierce Hall and called \"New House.\" The girls have remained close all these years, although some have passed away. Janet served as a librarian in the Hudson Falls, N.Y., Central School for 30 years and retired more than 20 years ago. She keeps active as a guide and archivist of photographic materials for the Fort Edward Historical Association; Janet also belongs to AAUW and a local garden club. With two grandsons, three great-grandsons and the rest of their family, Janet and her husband celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary in July. Audrey Schmay Jones reports that her husband, Art, 92, is in poor health but great spirits. He is receiving skilled nursing care in the Vermont Veterans' Home in Bennington. Audrey has a room in the \"Dorm\" and comes and goes as she pleases. Congratulations to Audrey and Art on celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary in May. Audrey keeps in touch with Betty Uline engineri, Helen Califano Belanger and Glenyce Jones Trainor. Bob Kaiser proudly reports his grandson Alex graduated from St. Michael's in Winooski, Vt., in May, and his grandson Zachary graduated from MIT with a degree in graphic arts. Bob Kittredge and wife Diana are on the go, as usual. In January, they spent a With this fall comes a new stadium, new fountains and a new School of Business building. This is an exciting time for UAlbany as we will have access to the types of facilities worthy of UAlbany's stature. What does this mean for alumni? As your university grows, so does its reputation as a leading public research university. Our development is symbolic of the growing prestige of UAlbany and in turn the value of your diploma. It also allows us to build school pride for future alumni (some people call them students) as they will watch their first Colonial Athletic Association football game being played on the brand new Bob Ford Field here on campus. A previous stroll by the fountains will now be a stroll through (yes, through) the fountains with exciting new multi-color LED lighting. The business building will host collaborative programming with business leaders from every industry. You've got to see this! I invite you to join us as we embark on this next era of the UAlbany journey. Homecoming Weekend (october 18-20) will provide the perfect opportunity to experience this new excitement. On Friday night, you are welcome to a wine-tasting reception and tour of the new business building. Saturday's tour of the campus will show you what's new and remind you of what was. I guarantee you will be in awe of what goes on in these facilities every day, from providing access to a great education at an unbelievable value to the cutting- edge research that is creating new knowledge for the future. Of course, our tailgate party prior to the big game on Saturday is always a can't miss. Only this year the live music, food and games will take place in the shadow of our new state of the art facility. Who knows, maybe your image will even end up on the new scoreboard? Attend the game, tour the facilities, come home. T rust me, you will not be disappointed. Please visit www.albany.edu/homecoming13 for detailed information about Homecoming Weekend. And, as always, please contact me at lserravillo@albany.edu to find out how you can stay connected and collectively, we can make UAlbany stronger.A Message from Lee Serravillo ~ Executive Director, UAlbany Alumni AssociationDid you hear wha t's happening? 30 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2013week at the Palm Springs Film Festival, and in May they flew to Spokane, Wash., to attend the graduation of their granddaughter, Hannah, from Gonzaga University. Bob couldn't help bragging about her achievements: graduating summa cum laude and receiving both the president's four-year leadership medal and the Honor Society medal. In November, Bob and Diana will be on a cruise through the Panama Canal. About once a month, they travel from Fresno to San Francisco to visit family and dine in their son's restaurant, the Tryptych. Gloria Maistelman Herkowitz and husband have their house in Albany on the market and plan to move to an independent retirement community. Gloria says in order to \"keep moving or you lose it,\" she takes classes in Gentle Ballet, NIA, which consists of martial arts, dancing and healing arts and an osteo class. Freddy Laemmerzahl Miller traveled to Fountain Hill, Ariz., to attend her grandson's high-school graduation. Oklahoma had some terrible tornadoes and floods in May, but Freddy said she was lucky and missed the devastation. Anne Sulich Raser, who lives in Los Angeles, continues to participate in the Women's Health Initiative at UCLA as she has for the past 20 years. She is also part of the California Teachers Study run by USC. Both activities keep her hopping, keeping regular appointments and filling out lengthy questionnaires, but she feels her efforts are worthwhile because the research these studies publish adds to our general knowledge about health issues. Jerry Reisner and Estelle proudly report that two of their granddaughters have graduated from college. One is employed by the federal government and one is a CPA. Jerry states that he is finally retiring from substitute teaching and jokingly says that he is now dependent upon Estelle for extra income. Estelle continues to donate blood and to date has given 32\u00bd gallons! Good going, Estelle! Ursula Neuhaus Schiff received a lengthy write-up in The Piper, the newspaper of the Glenridge Retired Community, where she lives. The article was a tribute to Ursula upon her retirement after serving for more than seven years as coordinator of ushers for the Glenridge state-of- the-art theater. From the article, it was obvious that Ursula's diligence and organizational skills were instrumental in developing a professional group of ushers. Betsy and Jake Schuhle report that four generations of Schuhles gathered in May to celebrate Betsy's 85th birthday. In mid-March, she traveled solo to North Carolina to celebrate the 90th birthday of a beloved cousin. Jo Ann Joplin Stutz, widowed since 1976, writes from Winter Park, Fla., that her three children, six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren all keep her entertained and involved in all those \"landmarks of evolving lifelines.\" Jo Ann says that having spent time with the U.S. Foreign Service in such \"hot spots\" as Iraq, Sudan, Morocco and Lebanon - before they were as \"hot as they are now\" - she thrives in the heat of Winter Park all year. Millicent Robinson Tubbs reports that her life has taken quite a turn. Instead of volunteering with several groups, she has now taken up the responsibility of caring for her 96-year-old husband. One daughter has moved from California back to Trumansburg, N.Y., to be of assistance. Milli and her husband celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary in April. In June Joe and Joyce Zanchelli had two occasions to celebrate: their 62nd wedding anniversary and the high- school graduation of their grandson Patrick, who lives in Mechanicsville, Va. He will be attending Virginia Commonwealth University starting this fall. By now, you should have received a survey letter from our reunion committee concerning our 65th reunion, which may be our last. It would be of tremendous help to our committee if you would return it to us. Please explore all possible means to attend. WE NEED YOU! It was great to receive news from so many \"new\" classmates for this edition; I am very grateful for your cooperation. KEEP IT UP! Class notes councilor: Joe Zanchelli, jjzanch@yahoo.com 50 A your class councilor: elise DeSeve and Irwin Baumel remained in touch after graduation. When both were widowed, they traveled together to South America. Thereafter, they passed the spring and fall in Elise's condo in Washington, D.C., and summer and winter in Irwin's home in Whittier, Calif., enjoying the best of both locations. They have taken several trips abroad: three weeks in northern Italy, where they visited Sparky Vaughn in Florence, and three weeks in northern Spain, plus a trip to visit some of Elise's family in Alaska. They also took a weeklong trip to London, followed by a week in Paris. Elise has been retired from teaching for 20 years. Irwin has been out of the line of fire for about the same period of time. Fortunately, the income from his real-estate properties is being managed by one of his daughters, making travel possible. Irwin and Elise have made three round trips by car between Washington, D.C., and California, visiting state capitals and friends. Another trip is planned for September, beginning in San Francisco, where Irwin will celebrate his 89th birthday watching the Giants beat the Dodgers (hopefully). Irwin reports, \"We are in pretty good health for octogenarians and hope to squeeze out a few more good years.\" Alumni News & Notes 2014 Excellence Awards CaLL For noMInatIonS Recognize alumni and friends of the University for their outstanding achievements and service.

Paul Dybas '12 joined other alumni for an accepted-student reception in Syracuse in March. He was one of 33 alumni who volunteered to share their experiences and enthusiasm for UAlbany at spring admissions receptions in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts.In April, Ben and Gloria Jackson attended the spring concert of the New Albany Symphony Orchestra in New Albany, Ohio. It was the first time they were able to combine a visit with Benita and her family and a concert since she became a member of this community orchestra. In an interesting coincidence, the conductor's father was the conductor of the Saratoga School for the Performing Arts when Benita spent the year there while in high school. Lila Lee Harrington wrote from Ames, Iowa, while visiting her daughter, Leslie, and family for two and a half weeks over Mother's Day. She attended her grandson Andy's high-school graduation and enjoyed family time together. In February, they were blessed to spend a glorious week in Sarasota, Fla. From Ames, Lila will fly back to her Saratoga Springs apartment at Prestwick Chase and resume work on the in-house newspaper, The Chase; review Belva Plain's Heartwood for Book Chat; check on the bluebird houses' and interview residents.

Life is good.\" Marjory D. Lyons continues an active life with a major focus on the theater. On May 4 and 5, she appeared in a short play, the comedy Dead to Right by Jon Frangipane, a member of the South Florida playwrights group active in the Fort Lauderdale area. \"A wonderful cast party,\" Marjory wrote. In March, she attended a University at Albany Alumni Association event where she met the new president, Dr. Robert Jones. She brought the Class of 1950 Pedagogue Yearbook, which Dr. Jones found intriguing. She was the judge for the young-adult category of entries in the South Florida Annual Writing contest. It was the 15th year of the contest, which began when she was president. Some years ago, Marjory taught young-adult literature at Nova Southeastern University, where she currently works online with doctoral students. She will be in Washington in July and plans to see Sparky Vaughn and other friends in the area. earline \"Ken\" Sorensen wrote that nothing much has changed - \"which is probably a good thing\" - since she last wrote. She still walks every day; does Tai Chi daily; does volunteer work; and, best of all, travels as much as possible. Earline had a great trip last August to Scandinavian countries, with several days on the fiords of Norway (\"Absolutely beautiful\") and felt very much at home in Denmark, where her last name is among the most common. In May, her oldest grandson, Dylan, graduated from the College of Environmental Science and Forestry at Syracuse University. Harold \"Sparky\" Vaughn served on the host committee for the University at Albany reception in Washington D.C., in honor of the new president, Dr. Robert Jones. He would like to continue playing tennis but has run out of partners, which he realizes is subject to various interpretations. Daughter Karen just returned from a month in Florence, Italy, where she and a few friends stayed in the Vaughn family apartment, as they did a year ago. Her architect daughter, Christine, came near the end. In June, Sparky will join much of the family in California to take part in the wedding of a grandson, Matthew Scaglione, son of daughter Connie. Class notes councilor: Audrey Koch Feathers, akochfeathers@roadrunner.com 51 Howard Swartz, husband of Goldie Brenner Swartz Swartz '51 and Howard Swartz Scholarship Fund on Mother's Day, in memory of Goldie and in dedication to all mothers past, present and future. Goldie, who passed away June 1, 2010, was the mother of their two sons, Mark and Barry. Howard misses Goldie very much. 52 A note from your class councilor: Jeanne Seymour earle has some happy news. Her son Chuck was married in September 2012 to a \"very wonderful young woman\" and is now involved in settling into a new apartment. Best wishes, Chuck. Although Jeanne is no longer subbing, she is still working three days a week at the Putnam Valley Library, overseeing her large property and taking care of her health. Vickie eadie eddy brings us up to date on her oldest daughter, Pamela, who was named a full professor in the higher education department at William and Mary College. She also received the Senior Scholar Award from the Council for the Study of Community Colleges. She and husband David have three children; two have graduated from college, and one is a junior at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia. Vickie is grateful that her five children are healthy and remain involved with their children and with her, whether she is at her winter home in Yuma, Ariz., or in her summer home in Olean, N.Y. \"I am very blessed,\" she writes. evie erdle eisenhard states that she and her husband now live in Ashburn, Va., just west of Washington, D.C., in Ashby Ponds. She says there are lots of interesting things to do there, which keeps them busy. Cheryl, one of their daughters, lives close by and works at the United States Geological Survey in Reston, Va. She ends her email with, \"so many interesting things to do daily ... we are always busy.\" Tom Holman reports that he's still avoiding Long Island winters by spending them in Naples, Fla., and St. Maarten. He was in New York City in March to help entertain his nephew and his nephew's daughter, who came from Japan for her first visit to the United States: \"Good to see the Big Apple through the eyes of a 15-year-old.\" On May 18, Kitty Kloser Irons welcomed Megan, her oldest granddaughter, home from South Africa, where she had spent the second semester of her junior year. Her younger sister Erin has joined her at St. Michael's, having transferred from the University of Vermont. Kitty also reports that her mini-quilt group just finished a Quilt of Valor and is sending it off to Afghanistan. Each wounded soldier receives a quilt when he or she is taken to the hospital. It is theirs to keep and was made by a quilter in the United States. Jane Minckler Jennings writes that, this spring, she, her daughter and son-in-law visited her niece in her beautiful, huge house on the outskirts of Tucson, Ariz. Jane said they saw many interesting sights and had beautiful weather. She also reported that Mimi Gorski Blake's husband fell, which necessitated a partial hip replacement, followed by rehab. Anna Morrissey Karpiak had a lovely four-day trip to the Catskills with the members of her St. Pius X Senior Club. She said, \"It is so much better to travel with people you know and like (as well as those with whom you have so much in common) rather than alone.\" True, Anna. Dave Manly alluded to some maladies and medicines but says retirement living at Hilton Head is still wonderful. He continues to fill the pulpit at nearby churches while up north, more often preaching than officiating at weddings or funerals. \"Life is good with caring wife Jean in our 48th year of marriage.\" Maureen Davis Mullin www.albany.edu 31President Robert J. Jones and Nishtha Modi '12 chat during the fifth annual Celebration of Vital Volunteers April 20. Modi, Samantha Hiza '13 and Jennifer Pollard '13 shared their compelling volunteer experiences with more than 125 volunteers. Alumni News & Notes32 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2013expresses regrets that she missed our 60th reunion, but she had accepted a job teaching French at Santa Ynez High School. Two of her sons live there, one of whom also teaches at the high school; the other is a professor at UC Santa Barbara. With her in the high school were her grandchildren Abigail in 9th grade; Alice in 12th grade; and Maureen and her son in the classroom: \"We were running the show.\" She had an interesting conversation with Joan Baez this year. Ms. Baez and her sister, Mimi, were in Maureen's class when she taught in Belmont, Mass., so they relived old times. She adds that SUNY Albany is getting well known on the West Coast and that the four years she spent at Albany were four of the best years of her life. Joan Bennett Kelly spent two weeks with \"the kids\" because her daughter turned 50 and her granddaughter turned 21 - milestones both. She attended a track meet in Binghamton and two lacrosse games in two different states. Those Kellys sure do get around. Joan's oldest granddaughter has the lead in an off-Broadway play, Blood Brothers; it got a good review in The New York Times. Let's hope we soon see it on Broadway. Congratulations to Joe Persico on the publication of his 12th book, Roosevelt's Centurions and the Commanders He Led to Victory in World War II. The book, which deals with FDR's relationships with his military commanders, has already garnered favorable reviews. The 650-page volume includes 70 pages of bibliography and source notes and took Joe four years to write. Nancy Frey Pettinelli sent her usual \"tongue-in-cheek\" humorous response. She starts her email, \"Well, this just in ... I have just won the lottery for the sixth time this year ... I'm pretty much set for life now ...\" She surely has fun with her \"news.\" Shirley Feinstein Rosenbaum sounds very involved. She's an active member of the League of Women Voters (LWV) and a board member of both the Virginia state and local leagues. This year, she was trained as a coach for the Membership Development Learning Program for LWV. She also continues to perform in the Morgantown Community Orchestra. Good to hear from Kathleen Cody Sengle, who celebrated two granddaughters' college graduations: one in nursing from Pittsburgh, and the other in industrial design from Pratt. She hopes to attend her 65th high school reunion in Cazenovia in July, then spend a week in Maine in August. Kathleen also hopes to get together with classmate Barbara Anderson Hadden sometime this summer. Jean Faville Smith celebrated her daughter's wedding on Valentine's Day in Hilo, Hawaii. It was held in a pagoda with all the Hawaiian traditions. Sounds beautiful. Jean and Smitty are planning a 22-day cruise later this year from Rome to Athens, Cairo, and home from Istanbul, with more stops in between. They will celebrate their 61st wedding anniversary this year. Jean also states, \"Our reunion last year was wonderful, and we wish more of you would attend.\" Marilyn Johnson VanDyke, class president, and Joan Roeder Barron, class councilor, attended UAlbany's Department of English 2013 Recognition Ceremony during graduation weekend. They presented the Class of '52 Scholarship to English major Samuel Joseph Gorenstein. They met Samuel's parents and brother after the ceremony and learned the Gorensteins are from Guilderland. Samuel is planning to study improvisational performance in New York City. Marilyn proudly announces that her grandson, Alexander Aust, completed his first year as director of Brubacher Hall, which is now leased to The College of Saint Rose and houses first-year students from CSR. Alex has a bachelor's degree from SUNY Oneonta and a master's in student living from Saint Rose. A nice, long email from Bill Wiley tells us that he retired as president of his Townhomes Association coincident with him and his wife moving to a great Hilton Head senior community that provides all kinds of trips, activities and diversions. Their \"kids\" are spread up the East Coast: two in Florida with two granddaughters (one working for Best Buy and the other a very talented middle schooler); and one in Marietta, Ga., with two grandkids, a boy who is Bill's namesake, a great Cub Scout and superior lacrosse and soccer player, and a girl who is a joy and a good soccer player. She's also a flautist and sings like a bird! A daughter in Indianapolis has two daughters. One, an electrical engineer working with an aerospace company in Dayton, is taking a leave to attend the University of Arizona to get her master's; the other is an anthropologist from Grinnell College. Bill's oldest daughter, who has her doctorate in art history, has worked most of her career as a development consultant for universities, hospitals and other entities. Joyce Leavitt Zanchelli and husband Joe had two reasons to celebrate: Their grandson Welcome to our new Alumni Association Board Members Catherine Provost '05 Senior Manager of Alumni Engagement, National Society of Collegiate ScholarsElizabeth Ukpe '07 Merchandising Manager, Moda Operandi Rockefeller College of Public Affairs & Policy honored seven distinguished individuals for their outstanding contributions in the areas of political science, public administration, leadership and continuing professional development at its annual Alumni Dinner and Awards Ceremony May 17.

Joyce and Joe continue to enjoy life in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., where there are a number of activities to keep them busy. Class notes councilor: Joyce Zanchelli, jjzanch@yahoo.com 53 A note from your class councilor: It has been 60 years since the Class of 1953 graduated from what was then New York State College for Teachers. What good times we had getting to know one another in Frosh Camp, participating in rivalry, being awed by the faculty, and doing our student teaching. Students today have trouble believing that women students of our time had curfew - and that, consequently, the men had a curfew, as well. So many of the upper-classmen were WWII veterans; how we admired them. A great number of us were first-generation Americans and were fulfilling our parents' dreams of seeing their children succeed through education. There we were on the old campus, where you could move from one building to the next via the elegant peristyles. As freshmen, we had to wear our red beanies, and we gave homage to Minerva in the rotunda of Draper Hall. We were required to answer questions from our handbooks when stopped by upperclassmen - especially the dreaded Sophomore Yellowjackets. Proudly, we performed in our Big-4 productions and cheered for our Red Devil teams. Was there ever a better life? Because our class was relatively small when compared to today's classes, we knew one another and greeted our classmates when encountering them. We got our mail in The Commons and met there for noontime dancing. If we had extra funds, we could eat at \"The Boul\" - or, even better, go to Joe's Delicatessen for indescribably wonderful sandwiches. The years went swiftly by and, with great surprise, we were graduating. One never expected the sadness as we watched our class officers walk off into the dark with our banner on their backs as Torch Night came to an end. We were expected to grow up now ... to put into practice what we had learned. We were well prepared for the world after State; no better education could be found. Some of us went on to earn more degrees; some went to teach in secondary schools; others found jobs where they could use their talents; and others went into the military. Since that sunshiny day of our graduation, some no longer are with us. Reading the list of those who have passed on, one is reminded that we are no longer those young graduates who had the world before them. Our class of close to 300 has lost 96 - almost 35 percent. Let us remember them with those lovely words from \"Follow the Gleam,\" the Torch Night Song: \"When the sun sets on college days, resplendent with love you've won; when you leave all the friendly ways to those who will after come. We will follow, follow the gleam, torches alight, all through the night; we will follow, follow the gleam, of the Great Fires of S.C.T.\" Millie Foote Frandino Sheerin was the first to respond to our call for news from the class. She's still full of that pep she exhibited as a student and walking three miles a day! She reported that she, Ruth Dunn Reed and Joan Allen Balfe enjoyed a mini-reunion at Ruth's home in Rome, N.Y., last year. \"We still try to meet at least every year or two at one or another's homes.\" Millie recently directed the Neil Simon play \"Lost in Yonkers\" for a local community theatre in Orleans on Cape Cod. She manages to stay involved in either acting or directing as often as she can. She proudly told us that she is blessed with 18 grandchildren and has her first \"great\" on the way! Can't help but wonder if Millie wins the prize for having the most grandchildren! Rosie Keller Hughes and Bob Hughes are quite proud of their son, who won an Emmy in April as producer for a documentary, Signs of the Time, about the signs used in baseball. This is the first year that the Hugheses haven't gone on a major trip, but they hope to get back in the swing next year. They've traveled to 61 countries; they set a goal to visit 100, but time has marched on and is running out. During some of their foreign travel, they have researched their genealogical roots. Rosie has 13,971 relatives on her family tree, thus far. Both Bob and Rosie agree that the Internet has been the greatest tool in their quest. Hank Koszewski stopped in Rochester on his way to Toronto a year or two ago and regaled Bob and Rosie with his life in Hawaii. Hank should be getting a stipend for promoting our beautiful 50th state! Linda Hopkins McGrath tells us that all is well in Naples, Fla. Fortunately, she enjoys good health. She plays a lot of golf and bridge, and works with the boards of her homeowners association and country club. Linda has two young grandsons, ages 2 and 5, and family visits are high on her list of activities. She sends warm greetings to her former classmates and has high hopes that a 60th reunion becomes a viable undertaking. Irene Brezinski McDonald's travel with husband Dan has become limited because of Dan's glaucoma-induced blindness, but they still keep busy at the nearby University of South Alabama, enjoying the music programs and the great recreation center there. Irene and Dan still live at the same address in Mobile, Ala. Despite their attempts to bribe their children with room and board and other benefits to live in Mobile, the children continue to live in Phoenix, Austin, and St. Croix. Irene writes a column for their diocesan publication Catholic Week, a kind of non-denominational affair called \"Reading and Renewal.\" Irene went on to say that the McDonalds love company and would enjoy seeing any alums who venture to this lovely area; as an enticement, she added that there are beaches nearby. Unless we hear differently, we have to list Betty Coykendall-Hart as the Class of '53's secondary teacher with the greatest longevity! When questioned whether or not she is still teaching, her reply was: \"Yes, I am still in the saddle and loving it, but many changes are on the horizon all around, including teaching and medicine. Probably this will be my last year. The poor district has put up with me for 50 years.\" It's this reporter's opinion that the Webster, N.Y., educational system has indeed been lucky to have Betty there for that length of time! Betty, you amaze us! Janet Norton DeFabio tried changing her address but went back to her beloved Florida. \"In January of 2012, I sold my home and moved to North Carolina (near Charlotte and one of my three daughters!). I stayed until June 1, 2012, when I moved back to Florida!! Mayflower Moving loves me and I love Florida!!!\" As with a lot of us, Janet's activities have been scaled down in the last few years. After eight years as a volunteer with the Make-A-Wish Fundation, she is now planning to begin participating in the volunteer program at Golisano Children's Hospital in Fort Myers. Janet is still ready to get back in the saddle! In March 2013, her family gathered for a second time in Myrtle Beach - and they have decided to come together annually. Janet went on to say, \"I even went horseback riding with everyone Alumni News & Notes all-alumni Wine t asting at the new School of Business Building oct. 18, 5-7 p.m. Start off the weekend activities at the all-alumni Wine t asting and get your first glance at the new School of Business.

For his 80th birthday last year, Bob Hughes was given a flying lesson. It had always been his secret wish to learn how to fly. He loved the whole experience: a half-hour of instrument instruction, then an hour of soaring over the beautiful countryside of western New York, from Rochester to Canandaigua. Bob's flying time included takeoff; he would have handled the landing, too, if the wind had not been so strong that day. Another item was checked on Bob's bucket list: He is thinking of taking another lesson this year! Marie Hoffman earned a chuckle for her comment: \"Please condense as you see fit. A keyboard encourages me to 'talk' too much.\" No condensing was needed. Marie is very interested in genealogy and has used the Internet in her quest. The Hoffman Labs email, her son's website, is how we connected with Marie. She told us all about her son and his wife, something we all tend to do; talk about our kids; they live in New Hampshire. No grandchildren, but her son produced two computer books, \"one adopted by some college as a textbook.\" Her daughter-in-law, Kelly Kreiger Hoffman, worked in the computer lab at SUNY in the early 1980s. Now she works for Agilent Technologies. Marie retired at 55 in 1986 from Algonquin Middle School in Averill Park, N.Y. She was happy to report that she did not die several years back, as reported by the alumni magazine. Paul Ward straightened that out before Marie even knew her death had been incorrectly reported. It was another woman of the same name, and Paul and Marie were both volunteering in the Education building, so he knew it wasn't true. (Mark Twain would have enjoyed this situation, as he is quoted as having said, \"The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.\") In the late '90s, Marie ran for Poestenkill town justice and became the first woman judge in town. After that, she tried a seat on the town board for four years. At the end of that stint, Marie wanted more time to volunteer at the New York State Library, so she didn't seek re-election. She was (and still is) active in Capital District Genealogical Society. Marie has bad knees, which got her out of the State Library, but she gets around pretty well and is still driving. Her health is good. She had some laser eye surgeries and the usual little things that all of us get. Joyce Turner Ogden loves her location: \"I've been retired out here in Olympia, Wash., for about 17 years. I love not having to shovel snow (used the shovel just four times since arriving) and don't mind the rain that comes and comes from about September 25 to July 5. So if anybody is traveling this way they can leave their umbrellas behind and enjoy our NON-humid version of summer after those dates.\" Joyce went on to say that she has happily shared a house with her \"never-married daughter,\" and they've done a marvelous job of taking care of each other. Her daughter has had cancer since 2007, and the doctor is confounded every month when she walks into his office yet another time. According to Joyce, Olympia is a great place for gardeners. In April, she had about 17 different kinds of flowers in blossom; in May, there were about a dozen - plus the multiple rhododendrons. \"The downside, of course, is that when the sun DOES shine, I'm out there wearing out my back and shoulders pulling weeds.\" Your councilor wants to thank all those who contributed to the first of her class notes, but she is expecting an even greater response for the next alum magazine! The Class of '53 was a great participatory group. Don't let me down; live up to your great reputation! Help me do a good job keeping us connected! Stay well and enjoy each moment! Class notes councilor: Rose Mary (Rosie) Keller Hughes, Rhughes5@rochester.rr.com 54 Gerry Holzman has started a blog about the quirkiness and unpredictability of life by relating some unusual, and oft-times humorous, moments in his 43 years of chiseling and gouging as a woodcarver.

He also is still putting out a magazine about dance teachers. Art currently is teaching at conventions in Chicago and Phoenix, but only ballroom dancing. At his age, he is thrilled to still be doing what he loves. ed Osterhout and his wife, Carol, are still actively participating in Volunteers in Mission. They completed their 17th annual mission to Salem, Maine, to work on poverty housing this past July. Ed spent his 80th birthday moving his mother-in-law into a condo; he also helped move his daughter and son-in-law to New Mexico. Ed's house was recently remodeled to make it accessible for their 42-year-old multiple sclerosis- afflicted son. Barbara Vanderveer retired from Finger Lakes Community College, where she held a really interesting part-time job as manager of the computer help desk. The retirement lasted over the winter. Now, Barbara works as a docent at Rose Hill Mansion, a restored Greek revival mansion owned by the Geneva Historical Society. She also has spent time working at The Center of Concern and the affiliated food pantry. In addition, Barbara made time to visit her daughter in Willsboro Bay, N.Y.

The first, mostly for family, was at his son's home in New Jersey; the other was in Latham, N.Y., for a limited number of friends. James sees Bill Floyd once a month for lunch, so he celebrated at the Latham party. James also got the chance to visit his son, a Navy captain in Washington, D.C.; his son and family in New Jersey; and his daughter and her family in Vermont this past year. He and his wife enjoyed their summer season at Tupper Lake, N.Y., with their travel trailer. Gertrude Smith Daly reports that she is 80 years old and is in pretty good health. She is still working with the Hudson River Shakespeare Company, where her daughter is the general manager, her son is the artistic director and Gertrude is the treasurer.

He also is conducting an evaluation study of online teaching and learning. He and Nancy spent their 12th year wintering in Charleston, S.C. Bonnie Brousseau had major back surgery in June, so she wasn't able to travel this past summer, but is hoping that this year will be better. John Cooper and his wife followed their visit to the Oregon Shakespeare festival with a trip to central Oregon this past June. In August, they headed to Alaska to visit Denali, also known as Mount McKinley. Aside from traveling, John has been delivering meals on wheels. Trying to keep alive intellectually, he has sent off a scholarly article on Milton for publication. John also enjoys spending time with his one granddaughter, who just turned five. Bea and Jim Finnen are doing well and staying involved in their community. Bea belongs to two book clubs and volunteers for the St. Vincent de Paul Society and at the nearby St. Francis Retreat House; Jim also helps out at the retreat house. They have been residents of Easton, Pa., for more than 50 years, and Jim is entering his 49th year as the public-address announcer for Lafayette College athletics. They're also preparing for a grandson's wedding and a granddaughter's departure for Pennsylvania State. Stu and Myra Macnofsky went to San Diego. From there, they took a trip to California Berkeley for their grandson's graduation and attended their granddaughter's graduation from the University of California. They also stopped over in Santa Barbara and Paso Robles along the way. eileen Sloth retired this past July after serving as a minister in the Methodist Church for 23 years.

Jan Goodermote Newport and her husband are now completely retired. Due to health considerations, they sold their house in Poestenkill, N.Y., last fall. They had lived there for 48 years. They now own a townhouse near Hudson Valley Community College, which they love. Two of their three children live locally, so they are able to see them frequently. Their youngest son and his family, including the two youngest grandchildren, live in Charleston, S.C., so they travel now primarily to visit there. Jan and her husband have been privileged to have three grandsons; unfortunately, the first was killed at age 16 nine years ago by a drunken hit-and-run driver. Every year on his birthday, their family and friends ring the Salvation Army bells in his memory. After having majored in social studies at Albany, Jan received an up-close-and-live dose of government in action following Christopher's death. With great effort and time, the family succeeded in having a law passed that makes \"leaving the scene\" the same degree felony as is DWI in New York State. Their intent was to encourage drivers to stay with the victim and get help, as opposed to leaving the scene in order to \"sober up.\" They also advocated strongly for widespread implementation of the ignition interlock device, knowing that its usage could be a significant factor in preventing DWI-related deaths. The only member of our class with whom she maintains close contact is Dave Murphy. Jan never knew Dave when they were fellow students, but they started their teaching careers together at Bethlehem Central. She does often think of others from that bygone era and would love to hear from people she knew then. elaine Frankonis is living a relaxing life in western Massachusetts with her daughter and family, experimenting with suburban farming, continuing to blog sporadically, and learning math and science concepts she never knew as her 11-year-old grandson explores the excitement and innovations of home schooling.

She has such fond memories of her days as an undergraduate at Albany, but unfortunately, she has been out of touch with many of our classmates. She does see Connie Herodes and Barbara Dolansky every so often, as they all live in the Poughkeepsie area. Nancy and Sandy '58 celebrated their 50th anniversary.

Using feminist and psychological theory, the author examines the behavior, relationships and gender roles depicted in the popular Twilight series, and includes perspectives from both fans and detractors of the series. The book discusses whether the character Bella, and the series in general, is antifeminist or an example of modern feminism, and whether the relationship between Bella and Edward is healthy or maladjusted. Integrating research findings and theories in the areas of personality and social psychology, as well as scenes from the novels and surveys of readers, Deconstructing Twilight separates myth from reality regarding the series' depictions of women, men, romantic relationships and motherhood. A social learning perspective is employed to demonstrate the effect the novels can have on gender role formation and the development of relationship scripts in young-adult readers. Social psychological concepts are used to explain and integrate the discrepant views of fans and critics. Ashcraft also edited and wrote three chapters for Women's Work: A Survey of Scholarship by and About Women, an introductory women's studies text. Her Personality Theories Workbook is currently in its 5th edition, and she is working on the 6th.

Aguilera published The Maya World of Commu- nicating Objects: Quadripartite Crosses, Trees, and Stones (the University of New Mexico Press) in 2010. That same year, the ASU School of Historical, Philosophical, and Religious Stud-ies faculty member was tenured. And last May, he received the Zebulon Pearce Distinguished T eaching Award, named for an 1899 graduate of the T erritorial Normal School at T empe, now ASU. In accepting the award, Aguilera acknowledged the \"professors, colleagues, students, relatives and Maya consultants\" who have inspired him. \"I try to bring to my teach- ing what I admire most in many of them: a vivid interest in explaining our world and our place within it.\" His students attest to Aguilera's success as both teacher and mentor. One noted: \"Dr. Aguilera has influenced my scholarship and teaching in profound ways. While these have been critical to my professional development, my interactions with Dr. Aguilera have resulted in strengthening my character, as well. He has instilled in me ethics that guide my work and interpersonal relationships. Most of all, he has taught me that honesty and personal account-ability are key for being a good researcher, teacher and human being.\" Aguilera learned those same lessons at UAl- bany. Anthropology faculty Marilyn Masson and (now emeritus) Gary Gossen - to whom Aguilera dedicated his book - co-chaired his doctoral dissertation committee and \"taught me what it means to be a scholar. They gave unselfishly of their time in guiding and men- toring me. Without them, I doubt I would have attained a tenure-track position, never mind Distinguished Associate Professor status, at Arizona State University,\" Aguilera said. - Carol Olechowski Mike Elliot42 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2013Alumni News & Notes 00 Addie Russell, a member of the New York State Assembly, District 116, received the Distinguished Alumna in Political Science Award at the Rockefeller College Alumni Dinner and Awards Ceremony May 17.01 Michael Schnipper was promoted from attorney to partner this past February by Nixon Peabody LLP in Boston.
