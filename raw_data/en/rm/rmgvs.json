CHARM is a cornerstone event for the ACT health system. It supports the system's journey to becoming a learning health system by investing in its people and showcasing the infrastructure and platforms that facilitate high-value research. The meeting continues to be an excellent forum for highlighting health research achievements and supporting the Canberra region community to innovate and maximise the impact and contribution made by our healthcare researchers. CHARM also provides opportunities for networking, collaboration and capacity building for researchers and clinicians in the ACT and beyond. There have been many challenges over the past two years, so it is exciting that we can come together to celebrate the research that has continued during this time. We also have significant achievements to recognise and CHARM provides an opportunity to celebrate and explore these. The program details each presentation, addressing important research questions in population health, preclinical and clinical, allied health, nursing and midwifery research. High-profile keynote speakers will present each day on Indigenous health, the role of Epic (the Digital Health Record) in both health research and clinical care, and consumer co-design in healthcare. The meeting's focus day will unpack Quality data driving learning health systems to demonstrate how data underpins a learning health system and improved patient outcomes, building capacity to use data in undertaking high-value research, and the crucial role of data and platforms as infrastructure supporting high-value research. CHARM has been organised by the ACT Health Directorate's Centre for Health and Medical Research, in collaboration with Canberra Health Services and our academic partners. Each of these organisations has contributed greatly to the success of CHARM and I also thank the members of the CHARM program and scientific review committees for their hard work. Thank you to the sponsors for their generous support of this meeting. It is extremely valuable to have others committed to the important work of health research in the ACT . I hope that you enjoy CHARM 2022.

He grew up on the south coast of New South Wales (NSW) with family connections to Nowra, Wreck Bay and Wallaga Lake on the far south coast of NSW. Over the last 20 years, Alex has established an extensive and unique research program focused on chronic disease in vulnerable communities, with a particular focus on outlining and overcoming health disparities. He leads projects encompassing epidemiology, psychosocial determinants of chronic disease, mixed methods health services research in Aboriginal primary care and hospital settings, and randomised controlled trials of pharmacological and non- pharmacological chronic disease interventions. Alex Brown has taken up a new appointment as Professor of Indigenous Genomics as part of a new strategic partnership between Perth's Telethon Kids Institute and The Australian National University (ANU).INVITED SPEAKERS Better Together: A strategic plan for research in the ACT health system 9.30am Prof Graham Mann Director, John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University Darlene Cox Executive Director, Health Care Consumers Association Prof Imogen Mitchell Executive Director, Research and Academic Partnerships, Canberra Health Services Prof Nick Brown Professor Allied Health; Director UC Clinical School, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra Prof Christine Phillips Professor, Social Foundations of Medicine, ANU Medical School, The Australian National University Professor Graham Mann Chair of the ACT Health and Wellbeing Partnership Board's Research Working Group will lead a collaborative presentation on the territory-wide research strategic plan, Better Together. The group will describe how the plan intends to guide: system- wide actions to foster a learning health system where evidence is both applied and developed as a natural product of the care and prevention process; investment in the people who serve the ACT health system; and investment in the key research capabilities, infrastructure, platforms and programs that the ACT's health ecosystem needs to thrive. DAY ONE ABSTRACTS26 - 29 July 2022 | 13 Research and Innovation Fund - update 10.50am The ACT Government Research and Innovation Fund (RIF) aims to support world-leading health research in the ACT , underpinning the delivery of high-quality health care through cross-discipline collaboration and engagement. The RIF aims to build research capacity and capability in key health areas to meet the health and wellbeing needs of the ACT community. In August 2021, $2.0 million was granted to the first group of nine successful RIF projects. We look forward to sharing an exciting update about the RIF during this presentation. BIG INITIATIVES: THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY 11.00am An Aboriginal Australian genome project Dr Ashley Farlow Genome Biologist, National Centre for Indigenous Genomics, The Australian National University Reconstruction of a human genome de novo from Australian Indigenous individuals reveals the amount of genetic variation that is not readily recovered using standard techniques. I will present a joint analysis of Illumina whole genome sequencing from 168 individuals and long-read de novo assemblies from four individuals for four remote Aboriginal communities. Consistent with their deep cultural and linguistic distinction, these communities display strong genetic population structure and a wealth of novel genetic variation. I will focus on the surprising observation that these assemblies reveal a substantial amount of single nucleotide variation in regions of the reference genome not previously considered problematic when using standard approaches. National Centre for Indigenous Genomics enabling the inclusion of Indigenous Australians in precision medicine Dr Hardip Patel Bioinformatics Lead, National Centre for Indigenous Genomics, The Australian National University Large-scale projects that develop perpetual community resources, such as UK Biobank, 1000 Genome Project, and the Human PanGenome Reference, play an increasingly important role in biomedical research and precision medicine. The National Centre for Indigenous Genomics (NCIG) is establishing genomic reference resources and related biospecimens from Indigenous Australians. It is an example of a community resource built to enable broad- scale representation of ancestrally diverse populations to enable equitable benefits of genomics for all humans, irrespective of their ancestry. In the first phase, we have established deeply trusted relationships with four Indigenous communities; 684 individuals (10% of population) have donated their genomic data and samples into the growing NCIG collection. We have begun generating reference genomes leading to telomere-2-telomere assemblies. In addition, whole-genome sequence data from 160 individuals using ONT long reads and Illumina short reads has revealed distinct genetic diversity missing from global resources and specific to Indigenous communities. We have established first that the unique genetic diversity of Indigenous Australia will require modification to data analysis workflows to discover genetic variations accurately. Second, many more Indigenous communities would have to be included in genetic reference resources to comprehensively ascertain genetic diversity to benefit all Indigenous Australians. The next phase of NCIG, under Indigenous governance backed by federal statutory powers, will enable integration of these genomic resources into clinical practice in coming years.DAY ONE ABSTRACTS14 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingInvestigating the genetic basis of chronic kidney disease in the Tiwi Islands Dr Simon Jiang Nephrologist and Group Leader, College of Health and Medicine, The Australian National University Indigenous Australian populations have the highest recorded rates of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. These rates of kidney disease are in excess of rates of diabetes and other cardiovascular illnesses in these communities. It has been estimated that genetics accounts for 60% of the risk of CKD. We have established a national collaboration to sequence and define the genetic contribution to the high rates of CKD in Indigenous communities. From this we have identified rare, potentially deleterious variants in CKD-relevant genes at high frequencies in patients from the Tiwi Islands including A20/TNFAIP3, AIRE, BLK, IRAK3, which are unique to the Tiwi. Variants in A20, LYN and AIRE were validated for altered function. Whilst the LYN variant had no impact, one variant in AIRE and two in A20 impaired IFNb and NFkB expression respectively, highlighting the importance of understanding the unique pathophysiologic processes in Indigenous communitiesBIG INITIATIVES: AUSTRALIAN CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY 1.30pm Living with pressure injury: Evolving care through inclusion of the patient and carers experience Dr Adam Burston Lecturer, Nursing, Faculty of Health Sciences, Australian Catholic University This multi-stage project seeks to engage with consumers to inform the evolution of care delivery for people experiencing a pressure injury. Are you speaking to me? Receiver perspectives on speaking up conversation Melanie Barlow Senior Lecturer and Academic Lead for Specialist Learning Environments and Simulation, Australian Catholic University As part of a larger study that evokes Communication Accommodation Theory to study receiver behaviour, this presentation will discuss the results of how receivers responded to speaking up messages within an actual encounter, and in a hypothetical defined context. Findings show that receiver professional identity, their evaluation of the speaking up message and the conversational context, play a more significant role than current speaking up training programs acknowledge or teach.DAY ONE ABSTRACTS26 - 29 July 2022 | 15 Interprofessional Education and Graduate Transition: A mixed-method study Robyn Dickie Lecturer, Nursing, Faculty of Health Sciences, Australian Catholic University This research aimed to identify and explore factors impacting a graduate's ability to utilise teamwork and communication behaviours developed during interprofessional education (IPE) during workplace encounters while transitioning to clinical practice. BIG INITIATIVES: UNIVERSITY OF CANBERRA 2.20pm Health innovations in AI and robotics Prof Debra Rickwood Professor of Psychology, Faculty of Health, University of CanberraProf Roland Goecke Professor of Information, Technology and Systems, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Canberra Dr Janie Busby Grant Senior Lecturer, Psychology, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra A/Prof Damith Herath Associate Professor in Software Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Canberra Prof Nick Brown Professor Allied Health; Director UC Clinical School, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra A/Prof Shahid Hussain Associate Professor of Biomedical Robotics, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Canberra In this group of presentations, we will discuss our research examining human-robot interactions within health care settings, innovative research investigating how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to enhance the capacity and quality of crisis line counselling services, and the engineering science behind the development of novel rehabilitation robots, including how robot-assisted rehabilitation can enhance recovery from neurological injury and disease.DAY ONE ABSTRACTS16 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingBIG INITIATIVES: UNSW CANBERRA 3.10pm The challenges of palliative care - innovating, implementing and evaluating support options A/Prof James Conner Research Project Coordinator, School of Business, UNSW Canberra Carer burn-out as a key challenge facing those supporting a person with a life-limiting illness. One support mechanism is to provide respite services - to allow carers to rest and recharge. However, the provision of services has been very limited. Palliative Care ACT has created an innovative respite service, known as 'Leo's Place' - a novel model of respite provision. I will present on the challenges of innovating the model, evaluating it and then moving into permanent provision of the service.Cochlear implantation and carers' employment Prof Max Tani Professor, School of Business, UNSW Canberra There is substantive evidence that childhood disability or illnesses negatively affects carers' employment status, with mothers being the most affected. There is however less evidence about the impact of interventions against those disabilities or illnesses on parental employment. We use a unique longitudinal survey of Australian children with hearing loss and apply panel data techniques to investigate the relationship between Cochlear implantation and their carers' subsequent employment over an eight-year period. We find that the principal carer (typically the mother) is more likely to return to work if the child receives a Cochlear implantation, and the effect is substantially stronger for principal carers from a lower socio-economic status. This result is novel and suggests that the intervention enables carers from disadvantaged groups to expedite their return to the labour market.DAY TWO ABSTRACTS26 - 29 July 2022 | 17 DAY TWO WEDNESDAY 27 JULY 2022 QUALITY DATA DRIVING LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEMS PRESENTERS AND ABSTRACTSDAY TWO ABSTRACTS18 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingKEYNOTE SPEAKER How John Hopkins and other US health systems are using Epic to promote both clinical research and quality of care 9.00am Dr Daniel Ford Director - John Hopkins Institute for Clinical and Translational Research; Vice Dean - Clinical Investigations Dr Ford is a professor of medicine and psychiatry in the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and a professor of epidemiology and health policy and management in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. As vice dean for clinical investigation, he leads one of the largest clinical research enterprises in the world, overseeing hundreds of millions of dollars in basic science inquiries. For nearly 20 years, Johns Hopkins has been the top recipient of biomedical research funding from the National Institutes of Health, much of it for clinical investigation. Widely regarded as a pioneer in research associated with the interrelationships between mental disorders and chronic medical conditions, Dr. Ford gained international acclaim for clinical studies documenting depression as an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease and for research describing the long-term health risks related to sleep disturbances. A leader in using the Internet for clinical research, Dr. Ford worked closely with Johns Hopkins personnel who developed e-IRB, an electronic process for submitting research proposals to the school of medicine's Institutional Review Board, which oversees requests to launch clinical studies. INVITED SPEAKERS An Epic transformation: Considering research as we prepare for the digital health record 8.40am A/Prof Rohan Essex Chief Medical Information Officer, Canberra Health Services From November 2022, the ACT's Digital Health Record will not only transform how health care is provided in the ACT , it will also reshape the health and medical research landscape. In this presentation, Associate Professor Rohan Essex, the ACT's Chief Medical Information Officer will provide an overview of the journey so far and the considerations made as the ACT prepares itself for the transformation to DHR. Research in the EMR: Workstation (bench) to bedside 9.40am Dr Daryl Cheng Acting Chief Medical Information Officer, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne Dr Daryl Cheng will share the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne and Parkville Precinct experience in their journey from paper-based to electronic medical records (EMR) - particularly in the domains of data and research. Using case examples of audit & quality improvement projects, patient registries and databases as well as clinical trials, this presentation will describe the joys and challenges of digital health EMR research.DAY TWO ABSTRACTS26 - 29 July 2022 | 19 Respectful use of health data 10.15am Marc Emerson University of Canberra Human Research Ethics Committee How are you using the data that you collect for your research? Are you collecting more data than you actually need? How do you store the data that you collect? Using health data respectfully is key to good research practice. This presentation aims to guide you on fulfilling your ethical obligations when it comes to the data that you collect and use. Data sovereignty 10.35am Professor Ray Lovett Senior Research Fellow - National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, The Australian National University Health Analytics Research Collaborative: Bringing clinicians and data experts together into research teams 11.05am Dr Ekavi Georgousopoulou Director Research Analytics, Centre for Health and Medical Research, ACT Health Directorate Health Analytics Research Collaborative (HARC), as a collaboration between ACT Health Directorate, Canberra Health Services and academic partners focused on health data science, research methods and analytics in both qualitative and quantitative areas, aims to drive high quality and efficient research and innovation, strengthen collaborations and accelerate translation of knowledge to practice and policy. In this presentation, Associate Professor Georgousopoulou will share examples and describe the benefits of collaborative approaches to research, bringing teams together with complementary skills. The Australian Diabetes Data Network (ADDN): A registry for improving diabetes care 11.40am Professor Maria Craig Professor, Discipline of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW Sydney ADDN, established 10 years ago, is a longitudinal clinical quality registry of all forms of diabetes in youth and type 1 diabetes in adults. ADDN's core activities include 6 monthly benchmarking, evaluation of federally funded CGM programs and provision of data to researchers, including collaboration with international registries. Choosing your words wisely: How stories can support systems to change 12.00pm Dr Penney Upton Associate Professor, Health Research Institute, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra Health changes at a population level are typically measured and reported using numerical data. From monitoring the spread of infectious disease to reporting changes in smoking prevalence, quantification can tell us what change (if any) is happening. However qualitative data is needed to show how and why change happens - essential information for changing systems. We describe how success stories can influence positive systems change to improve health and wellbeing outcomes, using the Tackling Indigenous Smoking (TIS) Program as an exemplar.DAY TWO ABSTRACTS20 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingEnsuring the best outcome for women with breast cancer: The ACT and SE NSW Breast Cancer Treatment Group 12.20pm Prof Jane Dahlstrom Senior Staff Specialist, Anatomical Pathology, Canberra Health Services Professor of Pathology, ANU Medical School, The Australian National University Prof Paul Craft Senior Staff Specialist, Medical Oncology Department; Clinical Director, Canberra and Region Cancer Centre, Canberra Health Services The ACT and SENSW Breast Cancer Treatment Group commenced in 1997 with a voluntary group of breast cancer clinicians supported by a small team of Quality Assurance offices funded by the Canberra Health Services. To date, the group has diligently collected data from 6,676 consenting participants and has reported outcomes for over two decades. One of the key objectives of the Quality Assurance Project was to improve the quality of breast cancer treatment by promoting adherence to national breast cancer treatment guidelines and secondly to establish a database, unique in Australia, to enable researchers to answer important questions regarding treatment and outcome in a real-world setting. Injury and illness surveillance in Australian high performance sport 12.40pm Liam Toohey Sports Epidemiologist, Athlete Performance Health, Australian Institute of Sport Systematic collection of electronic injury and illness surveillance data has been undertaken by Australian national sporting organisations for the past ten years. These data have been vital in supporting a transition towards proactive models of care that prioritise prevention initiatives, while providing a means to longitudinally monitor athlete health outcomes. Artificial Intelligence in nephrology 1.30pm Dr Daniel Christiadi Immunology and Infectious Diseases Division, The Australian National University We will discuss the application of machine learning, an artificial intelligence sub-field, in predicting the outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease. The implementation of machine learning is made possible by the prospectively collected data in the electronic medical record.DAY TWO ABSTRACTS26 - 29 July 2022 | 21 PATH Through Life 1.50pm Prof Kaaren Anstey Scientia Professor and ARC Laureate Fellow in the School of Psychology, UNSW Sydney The PATH Through Life Study has collected data on a representative sample of adults originating from the Canberra and Queanbeyan regions and following them for 20 years. An overview of the dataset, experiences with data linkage and the role of cohort studies in the era of big data, will be presented. Using data from the Multi-Agency Data Integration Project (MADIP) for health policy and clinical research 2.10pm Dr Jennifer Walsh Research Fellow, National Centre for Population Health, Research School of Population Health, College of Health and Medicine, The Australian National University Dr Danielle Butler Research Fellow, Centre for Public Health Data and Policy, The Australian National University In this presentation, we will showcase research using data from the Multi-Agency Data Integration Project, a new national data asset. We will present an overview of the data and two example projects relevant for population health and clinical research. This will include research on education related variation in uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations and factors associated with under treatment of cardiovascular disease according to guideline recommended pharmacotherapy.Impact of changing social context due to residential mobility on depression: A nationwide cohort study 2.40pm Prof Clive Sabel Professor in Public Health (Spatial Epidemiology), Health Research Institute, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra There is increasing evidence linking social context to depression. Adopting a life course approach, we focussed on how the changing nature of social environment, or neighbourhood context impacts on the subsequent risk of developing depression. Both changing neighbourhood character over time (where the individual remains static, but the neighbourhood changes), and the impact of an individual changing neighbourhood are considered. PANEL DISCUSSION Quality data driving learning health systems 3.00pm The panel will explore key issues emerging from the presentations on this day. Chair: Dr Jennifer Welsh Panellists: Prof Rosemary Sandison, A/Prof EssexDAY THREE ABSTRACTS22 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingDAY THREE THURSDAY 28 JULY 2022 ACT RESEARCH IN FOCUS PRESENTERS AND ABSTRACTSDAY THREE ABSTRACTS26 - 29 July 2022 | 23 KEYNOTE SPEAKER Advocating for change: Involving consumers in health and medical research Darlene Cox Executive Director, Health Care Consumers Association Darlene has been involved in the consumer movement since the late 1990s. Darlene has been an active consumer representative at the local and national for over 20 years. She has been the Executive Director of Health Care Consumers' Association Incorporated since 2008. She is a board member of the Capital Health Network and Meridian. She is also a member of the ACT Health and Wellbeing Partnership Board. Darlene has had a long-standing interest in improving the quality and safety of heath care and sees involving consumers in research, service design and governance as key to bringing about the change we want to see. ABSTRACT: Consumers are people who use health care services and have lived experience of a health condition or disease. This term includes patients, our friends, families, carers and members of the wider community. As consumers we want to see changes to healthcare services, policies and practices so they meet consumer needs, preferences and values. We want to see research that looks to answer questions that matter to consumers, carers and our communities. Consumer involvement in health and medical research means meaningful and authentic participation. This is more than involving consumers as participants or subjects. In research projects and programs consumer voices need to be heard equally with those of clinicians and researchers. This extends to a range of roles including as investigators and in the governance of projects and programs. This presentation will outline a range of approaches researchers can use to involve consumers.INVITED SPEAKERS COVID in the nation's capital: The clinical response 9.00am Prof Imogen Mitchell Executive Director, Research and Academic Partnerships, Canberra Health Services The Australian Capital Territory declared a health emergency on 16th March 2022, which allowed the Chief Health Officer to take any action, or give any direction, considered to be necessary to protect Canberrans and reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the ACT . During the next two years, the ACT health care system has had to adapt and respond to the health emergency to ensure the protection of patients, staff and the community as well delivering non-COVID health care. Toxins, sepsis and immunity 9.00am Prof Si Ming Man Division of Immunology and Infectious Disease, The John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University Infectious diseases, such as food poisoning, sepsis, and pneumonia, are responsible for one-third of deaths in the world. The immune system is critical in controlling infections and ensuring our survival. In this presentation, I will discuss our latest research studies on the biology of the innate immune system and the importance of the immune system in recognise toxins and microbes. DAY THREE ABSTRACTS24 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingAvoiding co-option and tokenism as consumer engagement in research becomes sexier 10.30am Dr Brett Scholz Research Fellow (Senior Lecturer), ANU Medical School, The Australian National University Consumer movements have fought for greater participation in health systems for decades, and there have been some significant strides towards meaningful engagement. However, as such engagement becomes more mainstream, we risk co-option of consumers' expertise and tokenism. This presentation will explore ways of strengthening engagement and moving towards consumer-led approaches. COVID recovery? Don't hold your breath! 10.30am Dr Bernie Bissett Discipline Lead, Physiotherapy, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra Long COVID will affect thousands of Canberrans in the coming months and years, and a major challenge for many survivors is breathlessness.

Sloan-Gardner1 1. Response Division, ACT Health Directorate, Woden, ACT , 2606 2. The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 epi.covid@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION: Due to the literature in this area being sparse, we investigated multiple episodes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). METHOD: We conducted a retrospective case series analysis of all SARS-CoV-2 infections notified in the ACT between 1 March 2020 and 9 May 2022. We defined multiple episodes as an individual who reported 2-or-more instances of a positive rapid antigen test and/or a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of a 4, 9 or 12-week period dependent on the national testing advice at the time. Demographic and clinical information was collected through routine public health follow-up. Disease severity was measured by instances of hospital admission identified by the ACT Clinical Health Emergency Coordination Centre. RESUL TS: No multiple notification episodes were recorded in the ACT until the emergence of Omicron in December 2021. A total of 505 individuals with multiple notification episodes were identified. The median time between first and subsequent episodes was 98 days (range 34-721 days). The highest proportion of multiple episodes was seen in the 18-39-year age group (60%). Only a small proportion of hospitalised cases were among those with multiple episodes and there were no recorded deaths. CONCLUSION: Our study describes multiple episodes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the ACT . It is expected that the risk of acquiring COVID-19 again will increase over time due to waning immunity from infection and/or vaccination, and as new subvariants/variants emerge. COVID-19 vaccine response in patients on cancer therapy - results from the Evaluation of COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacy and Rare Events in Solid Tumour (EVEREST) study 9.30am George C. Cavic1, Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 2. The Canberra Hospital, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT 2605 yada.kanjanapan@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION: Cancer patients have increased morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 but were under-represented in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Immunosuppression may result from underlying malignancy and/or anti-neoplastic therapy. AIMS : To compare seroconversion post COVID-19 vaccination in cancer patients versus controls, and among patients on different cancer therapies. METHODS: Solid tumour patients and healthy controls who received COVID-19 vaccination between 3/2021-1/2022 were included. Blood samples collected at baseline, pre- 2nd vaccine dose, one, three and six months post-2nd dose measured SARS-CoV-2 (87 evaluable for primary endpoint) and 20 healthy controls were enrolled. Median age 62 years; 61% female. COVID-19 vaccines included 87% of and 100% of controls (p=0.12). Mean anti-spike IgG was 91 and 169.6 binding antibody units (BAU)/ml in patients and controls respectively (p=0.10). Seroconversion occurred in patients on chemotherapy (84%), immunotherapy (80%) targeted therapy (96%; p=0.2). Age, metastatic disease and lymphocyte count were not associated with anti-spike antibody. Among cancer patients, 40% and 95% were seropositive after 1 and 2 vaccine doses respectively, with increased anti-spike level post 3rd vaccine dose. CONCLUSION: Cancer patients achieved comparable seroconversion three months post COVID-19 vaccination compared with controls. Cancer therapy did not significantly affect vaccine response. A rise in anti-spike antibody occurred after the 3rd vaccine dose in cancer patients, surpassing the level among controls prior to booster vaccination.26 - 29 July 2022 | 27 ORAL PRESENTATIONSSIGNIFICANCE: Cancer patients respond to COVID-19 vaccination regardless of anti-neoplastic therapy, and benefit from 3rd doses in augmenting immune response. Changing ED and inpatient demand during Delta and Omicron COVID-19 outbreaks 9.40am William Zhou1, Drew Richardson1, 2, Ian Marr2 1. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 2. Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 william.zhou@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION: The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) with a population of 431000 serviced by two Emergency Departments (EDs), experienced a COVID-19 Delta strain outbreak Aug-Dec 2021 with 2062 cases (12 deaths) and an Omicron strain outbreak from Dec 2021 with 26136 cases (7 deaths) by 23-Jan-2022. AIMS/QUESTION: This study aimed to describe the difference in rates of ED visits and hospital admissions between the Delta and Omicron outbreaks. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of ACT cases diagnosed across two periods; 09-Aug - 12-Dec and 13-Dec - 23-Jan where Delta and Omicron were the predominant strain respectively. ED visits were defined as patients with one or more visits to The Canberra Hospital ED, a tertiary referral centre, between one day before a positive test and clinically cleared date. Admissions were defined as those admitted while infectious. Two sample t-tests were used to compare rates, Wilson score intervals approximated 95% confidence intervals. RESUL TS: During Delta, 124 patients made 137 visits to ED while during Omicron 319 patients made 337 visits. The presentation rate was 6.60% (95% CI 5.60-7.75) during Delta and 1.29% (95% CI 1.16-1.43) for Omicron. 133 were admitted during Delta and 158 during Omicron. The admission rate was 6.45% (95% CI 5.47-7.59) during Delta and 0.60% (95% CI 0.52-0.71) for Omicron. There was a significant decrease in presentation and admission rate in Omicron (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The rate of ED presentations and admissions decreased significantly in the Omicron outbreak compared to Delta.Impact of COVID-19 related lockdowns on Emergency demand 9.50am Drew Richardson1, William Zhou1 ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 drew.richardson@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION: The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) had a successful public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with 118 cases during 2020 and 3200 in the first 20 weeks of the 2021 Delta wave. AIM: To compare the effects of the two waves of the pandemic on demand in the Canberra Hospital ED. METHODS: Prospective descriptive study of two consecutive 10-week periods from 06:00 11 Aug 2021 (Lockdown, Post- lockdown) compared to the same periods from 11 Mar 2020 with retrospective controls including Baseline figures from the preceding 10 weeks and the same periods in 2017-2019. RESUL TS: Both study periods had significantly different (P<0.0001) daily presentations from expected values: Lockdown -24.4%, Post Lockdown -11.3%, very similar to the 2020 experience of Lockdown -24.2% and -12.1%. For patients aged over 65 the figures were -26.6% and -8.3%, again similar to -24.5%, and -8.2%, and for those aged under 15 -38.8% and -22.4 %, showing more return in the post lockdown period: -37.6% and -36.8% in 2020. The major clinical difference was the workload of regional COVID-19 cases: 104 were admitted to hospital, 73 through ED during Lockdown and 20 (15) during Post-lockdown. CONCLUSION: Both outbreaks led to an initial marked reduction in ED demand during the lockdown period, with numbers of the elderly and admissions recovering before numbers of presentations. Respiratory disease, particularly in the paediatric population appears to have been a major driver. SIGNIFICANCE: A successful public health effort was associated with reductions in ED workload followed by a return to normal.ORAL PRESENTATIONS28 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingEnsuring equity of access to COVID-19 vaccines in the ACT - working through trusted networks 10.00am Sarah Jane L Olsen, Celeste K Marsh, Anne L Jenkins, Stacey M Burns ACT Health Directorate, Phillip, ACT , 2606 anne.jenkins@act.gov.au One aim of the Australian COVID-19 vaccination program is to ensure equity of vaccine access and uptake. The ACT Equity to Access Program (the Program) aimed to ensure equitable COVID-19 vaccine access to cohorts more likely to experience a disproportionate burden of disease and barriers to accessing mainstream services. Working in partnership with trusted community health organisations, the Program offered vaccinations in a culturally safe, accessible way particularly for people systematically marginalised. A mixed- methods summative evaluation assessed the Program against its objectives. A Program clinic attendee survey conducted between October and December, 2021 collected information on demographics, enablers and barriers to access and factors important in decision-making around vaccine uptake. Partner organisations completed a questionnaire also measuring satisfaction with the Program. Targeted clinics (servicing particular groups) and non-targeted clinics (general population) were compared. 640 attendees and 14 partners returned questionnaires. Targeted attendees were less likely to have sought vaccination (influenza) in the past and placed higher importance on feeling 'safe' in the vaccination environment. Perceived ease of access was notably higher amongst the 'non-targeted' attendees yet targeted attendees reported that the Program helped them overcome barriers including transport and online booking difficulties. Partners unanimously agreed that the Program was very effective in helping their communities access vaccination. By 22 December 2021, the Territory's second dose vaccination rates were high (98.4% for 12+ years). Findings indicate the Program successfully contributed to raising vaccination rates in marginalised population subgroups through a novel service delivery approach. Lessons learned from this Evaluation could inform the design of future programs for COVID-19 and other vaccines. Canberran healthcare workers' experiences of personal protective equipment during COVID-19: A rapid qualitative appraisal 10.10am Sarah Fitzgerald1, Cathy Banwell2, Anna Olsen1, Chad Kaye1, Timothy Walter1, Christine Phillips1 1. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 2. Research School of Population health, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 u7089992@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : One of the key issues facing healthcare workers (HCWs) during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic was the availability and clinical utility of personal protective equipment (PPE). AIMS : Embedded within a large multi-national project on HCWs' experiences of COVID-19, this study aimed to better understand Canberran frontline HCWs' experiences with PPE at the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS : A rapid qualitative appraisal study using semi- structured interviews enabled real-time empirical data on workers' attitudes, experiences and reflections. A purposive sample of HCWs (n=17) working in ACT health facilities were interviewed between July 2020 - May 2021. An inductive and deductive thematic analysis was used to interpret the findings. RESUL TS : Four major themes framed the ways in which HCWs discussed PPE in relation to COVID-19: (1) fear of accessing appropriate PPE at the beginning of the outbreak; (2) variable confidence in PPE related to training, peer support and the clinical setting; (3) PPE created barriers to patient care; and (4) perceptions of safety and risk centred around concerns for family. CONCLUSION : This study found that ACT HCWs shared similar experiences to their international counterparts including initial difficulties accessing PPE; fears concerning risk to personal safety due to inadequate PPE; and a reported sense of duty to protect the community from COVID-19. Participants reported high levels of confidence in the ACT's COVID-19 response plan. SIGNIFICANCE : This study is one of the first to detail Australian HCWs' perceptions and experiences of PPE during the COVID-19 outbreak, providing novel information on the local healthcare system and the wellbeing of our ACT workforce.26 - 29 July 2022 | 29 ORAL PRESENTATIONSIllustrating the experience of visual art for people living with mild to moderate vision loss: A mixed-methods pilot study 10.50am Meredith Maddess2, Jo Lane4 1.

National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, College of Health and Medicine, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 meredith.cheng@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Visual art can enhance quality of life (QoL), yet common vision problems resulting in mild-to-moderate vision loss pose barriers to the experience of visual art. Over 13 million Australians live with chronic eye conditions, with global studies demonstrating that milder forms of vision loss dominate the spectrum of vision impairment. AIMS /Question: Given the significant burden of mild-to- moderate vision loss, this study aims to understand the experience of visual art for people living with mild-to- moderate vision loss and the impact of impaired vision on interactions with art and subsequent QoL. METHODS : Eight participants with difficulties seeing art completed a mixed-methods study comprising: a semi- structured interview on their visual art experience; eye examination; and questionnaires on visual functioning, well- being, and QoL. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed. : Correlations were found acuity and everyday visual functioning (r=0.82, p=0.013), as well as poorer quality of life and psychological distress (r=-0.98, p<0.001). The experience of art for participants was influenced by their visual perception, dependent on elements of art, viewing conditions, and personal art preferences. Participants also described the emotional impact of impaired art perception, including ongoing vision concerns and the social aspects of art. CONCLUSION : Many interrelated factors associated with vision, viewing conditions and perception can contribute to the experience of visual art for people with mild-to-moderate vision loss. SIGNIFICANCE : Understanding the factors and removing the barriers that contribute to the experience of art is likely to improve interactions with art and QoL for those with mild-to- moderate vision loss who appreciate and like to engage with art.What are the functional outcomes for intensive care survivors in an intensive care unit with an established early mobility culture? 11.00am Frank van Haren1 1.

Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 4. School of Public Health and Preventative Medicine, Monash University, Clayton, Vic., 3800 vince.marzano@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Survival for patients requiring intensive care has improved with advances in care, however survivors demonstrate deterioration in functional abilities on discharge from acute care. AIM : To describe the functional outcomes and discharge destinations of patients admitted to a tertiary ICU with established early mobility practices. Design: Retrospective observational study METHOD : Adults (18 years) admitted to Canberra Hospital between July 1 2018 to 30 June 2019 were included if ICU length of stay 72 hours. Data was extracted from the patient file included demographics, APACHE 3 and clinical frailty score (ICU admission) and invasive ventilation time. Physical function (Acute Care Index of Function) was calculated on ICU discharge and hospital discharge. Discharge destination was extracted from hospital records. RESUL TS : Across 674 patients, the mean age was 63 (18- 94) SD 17, 39% being female. The median APACHE 3 score was 62 (IQR 32), and 52% required mechanical ventilation. Median ICU length of stay was 125 hours (IQR 105) and median hospital stay was 405 hours (IQR 523). The median frailty score of 3 (IQR 1) indicated patients were typically managing well prior to admission. Median ACIF was 0.4/1.0 (IQR 0.33) at ICU discharge, and 0.88/1.0 (IQR 0.4) on hospital discharge. 49.7% discharged home, 10.3% to rehabilitation and 16.3% died. CONCLUSION : In a moderately ill cohort of ICU patients, most patients discharged from ICU were able to stand and most were discharged home. SIGNIFICANCE : In an ICU with early mobilisation, most patients are discharged home and 10% require inpatient rehabilitation with large improvements in physical function between ICU and hospital discharge.ORAL PRESENTATIONS30 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingTesting the validity and reliability of the Caregiver-Patient Activation Measure in a population of informal caregivers of people with chronic illness 11.10am Katherine Carleton-Eagleton1, Iain Walker2, Diane Gibson3, Nicole Freene3, Stuart Semple3,4 1.

Institute for Sport & Exercise, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 u3179444@uni.canberra.edu.au INTRODUCTION /Background: Informal caregivers are often involved in the management of care of people with chronic illness, including heart disease, and their level of activation may be a predictor of success. While there are a number of valid tools assessing caregiver activation, the Caregiver- Patient Activation Measure (CG-PAM) has not been formally tested for reliability or validity. AIM : To test the reliability and validity of the CG-PAM. METHODS : Based on the psychometric testing of the original Patient Activation Measure (PAM), three assessments of reliability and validity were completed. Internal consistency was measured through a test-retest at zero and two weeks (n=23). Criterion validity was assessed through participant interviews from the test-retest cohort (n=10), with their transcripts assessed by health experts (n=3) to classify the activation level of the interviewee. Construct validity was assessed through a survey (n=193) consisting of demographic questions, the CG-PAM and a four instruments measuring concepts hypothesised to be related to caregiver activation. RESUL TS : Internal consistency of the CG-PAM was strong at Cronbach's alpha of 0.893, but there was poor criterion validity demonstrated. Construct validity demonstrated significant relationships found between caregiver activation and weekly hours of care provided, relationship satisfaction and dyad typology, but not with perceived levels of stress or social support. CONCLUSION : This study was unable to confirm the reliability and validity of the CG-PAM. SIGNIFICANCE : Future research will need to consider the dynamic nature of caring and the importance of the relationship between the caregiver/recipient when conceptualising caregiver activation.Identifying the unmet supportive care needs of men affected by testicular cancer: An integrative systematic review 11.20am Renee Doyle1, P Murray Turner4, Catherine Paterson1,4,5,6 1.

SYNERGY Nursing and Midwifery Research Centre, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 u3158868@uni.canberra.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Unmet supportive care directly impacts quality of life in people affected by cancer. AIM : To identify the unmet supportive care needs of individuals affected by testicular cancer to inform clinical practice and future research directions. METHODS : A registered priori systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. CINAHL, PSYCHInfo and MEDLINE were searched for quantitative and qualitative studies using Boolean logic and a wide range of search terms (such as testicular neoplasm\" , \"supportive care\" and \"health information\"). Articles were double screened according to the eligibility criteria. Reference lists of the final included studies were checked for further eligible studies. Data from the studies was extracted, methodological quality appraisal conducted, and reported using narrative synthesis. RESUL TS : Of the 72 papers identified; 36 studies were included. Reported needs related to psychological/ emotional (24/36), personal/intimacy (4/36), family related needs (2/36), spiritual needs (1/36) and daily living (0/36) domains. CONCLUSION : Individuals affected by testicular cancer were found to experience complex unmet supportive care needs from diagnosis into survivorship. The experience of needs varied in terms of frequency and distress and was commonly influenced by the biological age of the individual and persisted after one-year post treatment.26 - 29 July 2022 | 31 ORAL PRESENTATIONSSIGNIFICANCE : This study identified gaps in current practice that are failing to meet the person-centred supportive care needs in this young population affected by testicular cancer. To improve patient outcomes, current practice must be re- evaluated. How does health-related quality of life change over time in patients affected by cancer following an admission to ICU? An integrative review 11.30am Shalyn Rourke1,2,3, Catherine Paterson1,2,3,4 1. School of Nursing, Midwifery and Public Health, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 2.

SYNERGY Nursing and Midwifery Research Centre, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 4. Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, Scotland, UK shalyn.rourke@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Cancer survivors account for 15-20% of all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions. In general ICU populations, patients are known to experience reduced Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). However, little is known about HRQoL impacts among cancer survivors following a critical illness in ICU. AIM : The aim of this study was to critically synthesise the evidence to further understand the impact of a critical illness and ICU admission in cancer survivors. METHODS : An Integrative review was conducted and reported according to the Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis (PRSIMA) guidelines. Three electronic databases were searched (Medline, CINHAL and EMBASE) using keywords and Boolean logic. Quality appraisal, data extraction, and a narrative synthesis were completed for all included studies by two reviewers. RESUL TS : Eleven publications met inclusion criteria. HRQoL domains most frequently reported in cancer survivors after discharge from ICU included: physical function limitations, physical symptoms, and anxiety/depression. CONCLUSION : HRQoL decreased immediately after the admission to ICU with a gradual increase in the three to 12 months following. Cancer survivors are vulnerable to physical limitations, pain, and social isolation after an admission to ICU. SIGNIFICANCE : Cancer survivors who have been affected by a critical illness are at risk of reduced HRQoL after an admission to ICU. This integrative review will help clinicians and researchers to develop patient centred models of care during the recovery of critical illness, which are currently lacking in service delivery.Using participatory methods to develop a place-based system dynamics model for the ACT youth mental health system 11.40am Louise Freebairn1,2, Elizabeth J.

Centre for Health and Medical Research, Woden, ACT , 2606 louise.freebairn@sydney.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Mental ill-health remains a significant and intractable issue impacting on young people globally. The drivers for youth mental ill-health span multiple service sectors including social services, education, employment, housing and health. AIMS : The Right care, first time, where you live program of research is a partnership between University of Sydney and the ACT Office for Mental Health and Wellbeing to implement participatory system modelling for youth mental health to better understand local challenges and inform program and policy decision. METHODS : Key stakeholders have been identified and invited to engage in a series of interactive participatory workshops and discussions to elucidate the local drivers of mental ill-health, map the service system and explore the potential impact of interventions as prioritized through the process. RESUL TS : This presentation will outline the participatory system dynamic modelling process that is being implemented. The process involves engaging a wide range of participants including young people with lived experience of mental ill-health, professionals from health and other sectors such as education, carers and other community leaders from local groups with an interest or stake in the youth mental health system. CONCLUSION : Advanced decision support methods, at multiple levels of scale, are needed to better understand the complex and dynamic interactions between the social ORAL PRESENTATIONS32 | Canberra Health Annual Research Meetingdeterminants of mental ill-health and the service needs for communities. SIGNIFICANCE : The program engages stakeholders prior to, during and after the participatory modelling process to build local capacity in the use of system dynamics models and maximize the potential benefits of the research program for the communities involved. Individual characteristics associated with outcomes following combined first-line interventions for knee osteoarthritis: A systematic review 1.50pm Jacqui M. Couldrick1, Andrew P. Woodward1, M.

University, Bundoora, Vic., 3086 jacqui.couldrick@canberra.edu.au INTRODUCTION : First-line interventions of exercise therapy, osteoarthritis education and weight loss are recommended in people with knee osteoarthritis before undertaking total knee replacement. Despite most demonstrating improvements in pain and function outcomes, not all people improve. Predicting those who may benefit from these first- line interventions for knee osteoarthritis may improve the timeliness and suitability for total joint replacement surgery AIM : Identify individual characteristics associated with outcomes following combined first-line interventions for knee osteoarthritis. METHODS : Included studies reported an association between baseline factors and pain and function following exercise therapy, OA education and weight loss intervention for knee osteoarthritis. Risk of bias was assessed using Quality in Prognostic Factor Studies. A systematic review and data visualisation were conducted for age, sex, BMI, comorbidity, and depression RESUL TS : Low-certainty evidence suggests that females had up to 2-3 times the odds of a positive response than males. Moderate certainty evidence indicates that older age reduced the odds of responding. This small effect (less than 10% reduction) is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Very low-certainty evidence was found to conclude whether BMI, comorbidity and depression were associated with pain and function outcomes following a combined first-line intervention for knee OA. CONCLUSION : Females appear to respond positively, and age is unlikely to be of clinical relevance in predicting the response to a first-line intervention for knee OA. The evidence for BMI, comorbidity and depression is limited. SIGNIFICANCE : Clinicians should continue to recommend first-line interventions of exercise therapy, OA education and weight-loss irrespective of age, sex, BMI, comorbidity and depression. Investigating the utility and sensitivity of Inertial measurement units in tracking mobility after hip fracture 2.00pm Corinne Coulter1, Madelaine Byrne1, Joe Lynch2,3 1. Physiotherapy Hospital, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 2. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 3. Trauma and Orthopaedic Research Unit, Garran, ACT , 2605 Corinne.Coulter@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION /Background: Inertial measurement units (IMU) have the ability to provide functional measures similar to those captured with three-dimensional gait analysis, including spatiotemporal characteristics. As such, they are becoming a common tool to track outcomes following joint replacement. However, this technology has not yet been used to the assess early outcomes of patients following a hip fracture, in which they typically have reduced mobility. AIM : The aim was to assess whether novel IMUs sensors can detect mobility and progress in mobility in a group of patients following hip fracture. METHODS : A consecutive sample of patients who were undergoing surgery following a hip fracture were recruited. IMU's were fitted to the participant's left and right lower tibia on the first day they could mobilise following surgery. The sensors collected both acceleration and positional data during straight line walking. Information on step count, length and symmetry, and impact load (accelerations), were calculated and exported for analysis. RESUL TS : Preliminary results showed that patients operative leg has a shorter stride length, shorter period of double support, and a longer stance time. Furthermore, these patients loaded their operative leg more compared to their non-operative leg (2.56g vs 0.67g). CONCLUSION : During the early period of rehabilitation follow surgery for hip fracture, patients walk with asymmetrical gait and loading patterns. SIGNIFICANCE : IMU's have the ability to track early recovery following hip fracture. Unsurprisingly there were 26 - 29 July 2022 | 33 ORAL PRESENTATIONSnoticeable differences between legs in their early period of rehabilitation. Future work will aim to assess the longer-term recovery in gait patterns both in hospital and at home. Statistical shape modelling reveals age- associated bony changes in Nguyen1, Joseph T.

Trauma and Orthopaedic Research Unit, The Canberra Hospital, Garran, ACT , 2605 katherine.nguyen@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Osteoarthritis (OA) causes bony shape changes within the knee. Furthermore, the risk of developing OA increases with age. However, age alone does not cause OA. It is therefore important to understand the healthy age- related trajectories of knee shape before attributing these changes to OA. AIM/QUESTION: The aim of this study was to determine the association between bony knee shape and age using statistical-shape modelling (SSM). METHODS : 109 participants (52 females, 57 males) with no history of OA or knee injury received a CT of their knee. Three-dimensional models were created by manual segmentation. Separate SSM's for both the femur and tibia were created. SSM is a technique which enables the detection of subtle differences in 3D geometry. Linear regression models were used to assess the association between age and femoral and tibial shape. RESUL TS : Fourteen modes femoral and tibial SSM's, captured 66.6% and 72.7% shape variation, respectively. Only femoral mode 1 and tibial modes 1, 2, 6 and 14 were associated with age. Older age was related to larger femoral and tibial bone size and increased medial and lateral femoral condylar height. Furthermore, increased age was associated with medial tibial plateau expansion. CONCLUSION : Aspects bony femoral and tibial shape were significantly associated with aging, including femoral and tibial bone size, femoral condylar heights, and medial tibial plateau areas. SIGNIFICANCE : Changes in knee morphology occur as a normal process of aging and always not OA development. This is likely due to mechanical loading over time. Understanding the optimum loading environment may help to prevent or slow OA progression.Identifying at risk morphotypes in patellofemoral osteoarthritis: A comparison of patella shape in males and females 2.20pm Jo Menard1, Joe Lynch2,3, Catherine R.

School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, UNSW, Kensington, NSW, 2052 laura.wilson@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability in adults. Patellofemoral OA, specifically, is more common in women compared to men, but the reasons are not fully understood. Differences in patellar morphology may help explain why this occurs. AIM : We AIM ed to quantify differences between male and female patella morphology in both healthy and OA populations. METHODS : 3D models of the patella were segmented from computed tomography scans of 109 healthy and 81 OA knees. We used 3D shape methods to quantify articular surface shape and linear measurements to extract the dimensions of the medial and lateral facet, and facet angle. RESUL TS : Our results indicated that healthy females and males shared similar facet angle (t = 1.027, P = 0.155). Healthy females had greater curvature of the lateral facet close to the central pole and shallower curvature of the medial facet closest to the medial border compared to males (along Principal Component 2, 18.4% variance). Healthy males showed higher magnitudes of shape variance in both the lateral facet (t = 6.18, P <0.003) and medial facet (t = 3.56, P = 0.001) compared to females. CONCLUSION : Only lateral facet differences were correlated with size, indicating that females are less variable in medial facet shape, exhibiting a shallow facet morphotype. SIGNIFICANCE : Differences between the sexes in the amount and patterning of facet shape variance supports the inclusion of patella articular shape into future models for identifying OA risk in the patellofemoral joint, aimed at understanding which individuals are candidates for preventative measures.ORAL PRESENTATIONS34 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingA rheumatology multidisciplinary model category 3 triage and assessment pathway utilising advanced practice nurse and 2605 carol.mccrum@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Pressure on Rheumatology services has been long standing, with waiting times for appointments escalated by COVID-19. Category 3 referrals are commonly for non-inflammatory conditions with low likelihood of inflammatory disease. Research has shown the value and safety of using non-medical Advanced Practitioner expertise in patient assessment and management pathways, however there is limited evidence for this clinical initiative in Rheumatology services. AIM /Objectives: To evaluate Multidisciplinary (MDT) Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) and Physiotherapist (APP) Category 3 triage and assessment clinics undertaken with Rheumatologist supervision. METHOD : The Advanced Practice Nurse and Physiotherapist e-triaged the Category 3 waitlist using available medical information and then telephoned patients to update their clinical status. Criteria were applied to identify patients suitable for their assessment clinics. Findings were discussed with the Rheumatologist, seen if needed, and next steps agreed and implemented. Data was collected on triage outcomes and analysed using descriptive statistics. OUTCOMES: At July 2021, 214 referrals were waiting appointment (207/214 waiting over 1 year, with 103 of these waiting over 2 years). Triage clinic outcomes included: 68 % (n=133/214) discharged with self-management resources or redirected (n=6/214) remained as Category 3; 5% (n=12) escalated to Category 2. There have been no GP re-referrals and 143 Consultant initial appointments have been saved. CONCLUSION : Referrals for non-inflammatory conditions with low probability of underlying autoimmune conditions may be safely, effectively, and efficiently managed in an MDT model using Advanced Practice Nurse and Physiotherapist expertise. SIGNIFICANCE : Utilising non-medical Advanced Practitioner expertise can support improved access, service efficiencies and value-added input for Rheumatology Category 3 referrals.Interprofessional collaboration of general practice teams following the inclusion of non-dispensing pharmacists 3.10pm Thilini Sudeshika1, M. Peterson1,2, Sam Kosari1 1. Discipline of Pharmacy, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 2. School of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Tasmania, Hobart, TAS, 7005 thilini.salpahewage@canberra.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Pharmacists have been included in general practice teams to provide non-dispensing services in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) since 2016. The extent of interprofessional collaboration in general practice teams after including these pharmacists is not well studied. AIM : This study was designed to explore the factors that impacted the development of interprofessional collaboration after including pharmacists in general practice. METHODS : A multiphase mixed-method study was conducted to explore collaboration between pharmacists, general practitioners (GPs), and other health professionals in eight general practices in the ACT where pharmacists were included in their teams. A previously validated survey was adapted and utilised at baseline and 12 months. Semi- structured interviews were also conducted for a purposeful sample of participants at 10 - 12 months. Thematic analysis was performed to analyse interviews. RESUL TS : In total, 56 participants completed the survey at the baseline, 41 participants completed the survey at 12 months, and 21 participated in interviews. The survey found that pharmacists were highly collaborative and more active contributors in initiating collaborative relationships than GPs or other health professionals. Interviews generated four main themes: professional working relationships, trust, commitment to collaboration, and barriers to collaboration. Trust was integral to professional working relationships and commitment to collaboration. CONCLUSION : Findings highlighted that increasing relationship initiation with pharmacists, identifying specific roles for pharmacists and dedicating time to spend with pharmacists could be beneficial to improve trust and advance collaboration between the pharmacist and health professionals of general practice teams. SIGNIFICANCE : The findings provide an insight to improve collaborative care between the pharmacist and general practice teams.26 - 29 July 2022 | 35 ORAL PRESENTATIONSThe effectiveness of allied health clinical supervision at Canberra Health Services 3.20pm Jo Cole1, Rebecca Neilson1, Nick Brown2 1. Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 2. University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 Jo.Cole@act.go.au INTRODUCTION : Clinical supervision (CS) is an important part of the clinical governance structure within allied health in Canberra Health Services (CHS), assisting with the delivery of safe and quality health services. CHS has created and implemented CS guidelines, a training calendar for supervisors and supervisees, and a set of CS resources. These establish best practice CS and provide minimum standards for provision and receipt of CS for allied health professionals (AHPs) in CHS. AIMS : This study aims to measure effectiveness of CS in CHS for AHPs, measured by the Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale-26 (MCSS-26\u00a9). This 26-item self-report questionnaire measures the effectiveness of clinical supervision from the perspective of the supervisee (White & Winstanley, 2020). METHODS : Participants (n=98) completed an online version of the MCSS-26\u00a9 and a short questionnaire describing their work and their supervision arrangements. RESUL TS : CS overall was rated as \"effective\" when compared to the threshold score provided by White and Winstanley (2020) of 73. CHS AHPs scored an average of 80.1. A difference between Inpatient (n = 30) and Community (n = 40) based staff was predicted, in line with other Australian allied health CS research. This prediction was supported, with greater effectiveness ratings in the community group. CONCLUSION : CS for AHPs in CHS is effective and well- supported, with those in community settings reporting more effective CS than those working in inpatient settings. SIGNIFICANCE : This research provides a baseline for future CS research, and supports the ongoing work to provide training and procedures supporting CS for AHPs.Behaviour change techniques in cardiovascular disease smartphone apps to improve physical activity: Systematic review and Woodward4, Nicole Freene1, 5 1.

Physiotherapy, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 kacie.patterson@canberra.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Smartphone apps are increasingly used to deliver physical activity behaviour change interventions for people with cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, it is unclear which specific behaviour change techniques (BCTs) are being included in apps and how effective they are. AIMS : 1) to identify BCTs used in apps targeting physical activity; 2) to investigate the association of the identified BCTs on physical activity. METHODS : Six databases (Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Sports Discus, EMBASE) were searched from 2007-October 2020. Eligible studies tested a smartphone app intervention for people with CVD and reported a physical activity outcome. The BCTs used for increasing physical activity were identified using the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy (v1). The association between BCTs and physical activity outcomes were examined using meta-regression. RESUL TS : Forty BCTs were identified across 19 app-based interventions. The most frequently used technique was 'self-monitoring medium positive associations with physical activity. Participants in interventions that used 'self-monitoring outcome(s) of behaviour' (i.e. appeared to do less physical activity. In multivariable analyses, none of the BCTs had a clear association with physical activity. CONCLUSION /SIGNIFICANCE : Smartphone apps for people with CVD use a range of BCTs to influence physical activity. The BCTs 'action planning' and 'graded tasks' may be useful in future experimental app designs to increase physical activity.ORAL PRESENTATIONS36 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingSelf protection skills of children with intellectual disability Prasanthi Nattala2, Shekhar P.

Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, NIMHANS, Bangalore, India, 560029 4. IMHANS, Kerala, India, 673008 natasha.jojo@canberra.edu.au BACKGROUND: Sexual abuse of children with intellectual disabilities is a global concern. The rate of sexual abuse among children with intellectual disabilities is two to eight times the rate in the general population. AIM : The study aimed to investigate the knowledge of sexual abuse and resistance ability among children aged between 10 to 19 with intellectual disabilities. METHOD : We adopted a cross-sectional design to assess the knowledge and resistance ability. Our study was approved by Institutional Ethics Committee. The study was conducted among 120 children with mild or moderate intellectual disability. Personal Safety Questionnaire and Modified What If Situation Test were administered verbally during individual interviews. RESUL TS : Current study suggests that children with intellectual disabilities have average knowledge regarding sexual abuse. Although children exhibited good knowledge in differentiating appropriate from inappropriate touch requests, the majority of them reported they will not disclose this incident to anyone, and more than 90% of children demonstrated poor reporting skills. CONCLUSION : This study strongly suggests the need for a structured training program for children with intellectual disabilities to increase their knowledge and improve their resistance ability in preventing sexual abuse. SIGNIFICANCE : This study fills the gap in the literature regarding the protection skills of children with intellectual disabilities and strongly recommends sexual abuse prevention programs tailored to meet the complex needs of children with intellectual disability.Clinical decision making and the nursing process in digital health systems: An integrated systematic review 3.50pm Laura E.

SYNERGY Nursing and Midwifery Research Centre, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 u3202062@uni.canberra.edu.au INTRODUCTION : The Digital Health Record system implementation across ACT public hospitals in late 2022 aims to capture all patient data in one accessible location to enhance nurse clinical decision-making in care. AIMS /Question: To identify how the nursing process (assessment, planning, intervention, and outcomes) has been incorporated into digital health systems worldwide (electronic medical records, electronic care plans, and clinical decision support systems) to understand how nurses' decision-making processes are utilised. METHODS : An integrative systematic review was conducted using a search strategy to extract relevant articles from databases. RESUL TS : 3321 articles were generated from the search strategy. 27 articles were included for final data extraction after a comprehensive screening process. The review found that elements of the nursing process have been incorporated into various digital health systems using standardised nursing language and taxonomy. However, a consistent finding was that the whole nursing process is not being captured or applied comprehensively by nurses in practice when digital systems are used. CONCLUSION : The least reported stages of the nursing process when digital health systems were utilised included planning and outcome evaluation of patient care. The nursing process stage of evaluating outcomes is crucial in clinical practice as this allows nurses to use clinical decision making to evaluate whether desired outcomes have been met through effective assessments, planning and care interventions, or whether changes need to be implemented. SIGNIFICANCE : Findings inform the need for future qualitative research to be conducted on user nurses to evaluate what aspects of digital systems support or hinder the use of the nursing process and clinical reasoning in practice.26 - 29 July 2022 | 37 ORAL PRESENTATIONSAmino acid transporter (Slc6a19) deficiency prevents diet-induced hyperinsulinaemic type Christopher 1.

Research School of Biology, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 4. Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Canberra Garran, ACT , 2605 muhammad.shamoon@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION /Background: Primary hyperinsulinaemia has been proposed to be upstream from insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of severe insulin resistant type 2 diabetes (SIR-T2D) subtype, and a putative target for novel therapies. Amino-acids (AA) augment glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, such that limiting their availability in blood through inhibition of intestinal and renal AA transporters warrants investigation. AIM : To determine if deficiency of the broad neutral amino acid transporter (Slc6a19) prevents hyperinsulinaemia and the development of SIR-T2D in the Western diet (WD) fed NODk mouse model of this condition. METHODS : Male NODk.Slc6a19 WT and knock-out (KO) mice were randomised to short-term (4 weeks) and longer term (24 weeks) of chow diet (CD) or WD feeding protocols and their metabolic phenotypes were assessed. RESUL TS : Marked aminoaciduria was confirmed in NODk.Slc6a19 KO mice. WD-induced weight gain from 6 to 30 weeks of age was reduced (48.7\u00b10.6 vs 52.0\u00b10.8 g, respectively, p=0.01), glucose intolerance was prevented (intraperitoneal glucose tolerance (ipGTT) AUCglu after 4 weeks on diet, 1338\u00b158 vs 1903\u00b1125 mM*min, p=0.0003; and 17 p=0.001) and insulinaemia was reduced on diet, 69\u00b15 vs 129\u00b114 ng/ml*min, p=0.001) in KO compared to WT mice. Slc6a19 deficiency prevented WD-induced diabetes in NODk mice fed WD for 24 weeks (fed blood glucose at age 30 weeks, 8.7\u00b10.2 vs 14.0\u00b10.7 mM, KO vs WT , p<0.0001). CONCLUSION : Slc6a19 deficiency mitigated WD-induced hyperinsulinaemia, weight gain, glucose intolerance and completely prevented diabetes in NODk mice. These findings show Slc6a19 to be a promising target for drug discovery to prevent and treat SIR-T2D.A new model for understanding maternal 1.

Diabetes Research Laboratory, ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, ACT , 2601 3. Cancer and Vascular Biology, John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University, ACT 2601 ruth.arkell@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : The diabetes epidemic is one of the most challenging global health concerns. Currently, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and co-morbidities, including obesity, are occurring more often in women of childbearing age than ever before. AIM /Question: Despite reproducible evidence that maternal pregestational diabetes increases the risk of an embryo developing congenital defects, termed diabetic embryopathy, few studies of type 2 diabetic-pregnancy have been published and the molecular mechanism of T2D-associated embryopathies remains entirely unexplored. There exists an unmet need for models of maternal pregestational T2D, and we have made a significant breakthrough by creating the first murine model of T2D-like embryopathy. METHODS : The model uses NODk mice in which male NODk animals, when fed a Western diet (WD), develop T2D. In contrast, NODk females are less studied but our data show that females fed a WD, develop mild hyperglycaemia and impaired glucose tolerance (p<0.01 two-way T-test) in early pregnancy. RESUL TS : Initial analysis of this model identified congenital heart defects (CHDs) as the most frequent embryopathy. Additionally, it showed that the maternal T2D-associated CHDs are of the same type as those that arise from decreased activity of the NODAL signal transduction pathway, which controls the earliest steps in mammalian heart development. CONCLUSION : Our new model will fuel understanding of how and why maternal pregestational diabetes alters embryogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE : Without this knowledge, no new prevention strategies or therapeutic interventions can be devised to counteract the effects of the maternal diabetes milieu on early pregnancy, and the burden of diabetic embryopathies will continue to increase with diabetes incidence.ORAL PRESENTATIONS38 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingSpatial vulnerability of the optic chiasm to compression by a pituitary tumour: Towards explaining bitemporal 9.40am Pratap J.

Department of Neurology, The Canberra Hospital, Garran, ACT , 2605 3. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 p.pawar@unsw.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Finite Element Modelling (FEM) supports the hypothesized selective susceptibility of contralateral/ crossing nerve fibres in the optic chiasm but does not account for the microanatomy, specifically the multiple crossings throughout the chiasm, including the crossings of ipsilateral/uncrossed fibres. AIM /Question: This study aimed to graphically simulate the anatomy of optic nerve fibres in the optic chiasm to determine spatial vulnerability across the optic chiasm based on the number and angle of crossings. METHODS : A program was developed in MATLAB to simulate the pathways of optic nerve fibres based on the known geometrical boundary of the chiasm. The output displayed nerve fibre intersections, allowing the development of spatial maps with sufficient definition to determine both the number of, and the angle of, crossings at individual anatomical locations. Plots displaying the normalized cumulative angle (NCA) of crossings along the course of nerve fibres were also derived. RESUL TS : The nerve fibre crossings were concentrated in the paracentral regions of the chiasm, consistent with known anatomy. The NCA of crossings along the course of nerve fibres showed a very high value for contralateral fibres compared to ipsilateral fibres. CONCLUSION : This model provides a visual representation of the spatial vulnerability to compression across the chiasm in an axial plane. The model helps provide an explanation for the differential susceptibility of crossed and uncrossed fibres manifested clinically in the form of bitemporal hemianopia. SIGNIFICANCE : These results provide a greater understanding of the differential anatomical susceptibility of individual nerve fibres to external compression. The concept is transferable to neural compression at other sites.A novel primary immune deficiency syndrome caused by 1.

Cambridge Institute of therapeutic immunology and infectious disease, University of Cambridge, UK raquel.hernandezgallardo@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : L-Plastin (LPL), encoded by LCP1, is an actin-bundling protein involved in the stabilization of the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion and migration. It mainly expressed in immune cells, and shown to be critical for normal immune responses. Recently, our lab identified a family with an undiagnosed immunodeficiency phenotype, characterised by neutropenia and identified a novel mutation in LCP1 gene, which segregated with the immune deficiency phenotype. AIMS : To analyse the mutated transcript and the defect LPL protein in patients and the precise CRISPR/cas9 mice, and to dissect its functional impact on immune cells lineages RESUL TS : Patients' results: and Sanger Sequencing confirmed that. HEK293 cell line transfected with this variant expressed a truncated protein affecting the binding domains. Leukocytes analysed by flow cytometry revealed an increase in transitional B cells and circulating T follicular helper cells; and a Trans-well migration assay demonstrated impairment in their migration. Early results from the mouse model presented leukopenia. CONCLUSION : Our results support the hypothesis that the novel LCP1 mutation may be associated with a new immune deficiency syndrome. And our mouse model will help us to determine the mechanism of the disease. SIGNIFICANCE : This project is part of the personalised immunology program and aims to identify a new human disease, and to explain the pathogenesis of the new syndrome. 26 - 29 July 2022 | 39 ORAL PRESENTATIONSMonk attenuates autoimmune nephritis and modifies Lea-Henry1, Giles Walters1,2, Simon Jiang1,2 1.

Department of Renal Medicine, The Canberra Hospital, Garran, ACT , 2605 tom.lea-henry@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterised by immune mediated organ injury. One of the most severe complications of SLE is lupus nephritis (LN). We have identified rare variants in the B cell genes LYN and MONK through whole exome sequencing in a family with multiple autoimmune conditions. The loss of function (LoF) Monk variant (Monk-var) modifies auto- reactive B cells in a mouse model of SLE and prevents lupus nephritis. AIMS /Question: What is the impact of the Monk-var on autoimmunity in Lyn-deficient mice? METHODS : A bespoke Monk-var mouse was created using CRISPR-Cas9 editing and crossed to SLE-prone Lyn deficient (Lyn-/-) mice. These mice underwent immunophenotyping including lymphocyte analysis by flow cytometry, : In Lyn-/- mice, Monk-var causes changes in both B cell receptor and Toll-like receptor signalling. These changes alter B cell development and maturation. Lyn-/- crossed to Monk-var mice developed autoantibodies yet did not develop the glomerulonephritis observed in the Lyn-/- mice. This is likely due to a novel role for Monk in MyD88 signalling. CONCLUSION : Monk-var alters autoimmunity in SLE-prone Lyn-/- mice and ameliorates nephritis. This reveals a new potential therapeutic target of Monk inhibition as treatment for LN and is the subject of preliminary drug development. SIGNIFICANCE : We identify Monk as a novel mechanism for treating nephritis in SLE. We demonstrate a novel immune role for Monk in TLR signalling and highlight the advantages of new translational approaches in understanding severe manifestations of SLE.Serum for age-related , 2601 riemke.aggio-bruce@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in Australia. While advances have been made in understanding the underlying risk factors and pathogenesis current clinical grading has limited prognostic capabilities and is often only able to detect from intermediate stages of disease, once degeneration has already begun. AIM : We aimed to determine if serum microRNA changes reflected retinal changes prior to sever pathology. METHODS : Serum samples from a pilot clinical cohort of n = 5-10 of with early and late AMD and a mouse photo-oxidative damage model of early and late degeneration we're analysed for microRNA expression using OpenArrays. Differential expression was determined using the HT-qPCR package in R and pathway analysis was conducted using mirnet. RESUL TS : We showed that microRNA changes could be detected at wary time points of photo-oxidative damage and in early AMD patients. Further, while specific microRNA did not overlap between mouse and human samples we found similar pathways involved in inflammation and central nervous system processes such as neurogenesis to be changing in both. CONCLUSION : This data demonstrates the applicability of serum microRNA as early indicators of retinal degeneration. SIGNIFICANCE : This work lays foundations for the development of better prognostic and diagnostic capabilities for AMD. Further, microRNA identified here may lead to potential therapeutic targets in the future.ORAL PRESENTATIONS40 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingAdequacy of clinical information in anatomical pathology request in a tertiary hospital 10.50am Hana A Kawatu1 , Jane E Dahlstrom1 Department Pathology, ACT Pathology, Woden, ACT , 2606 hana.kawatu@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Absent or inadequate clinical history on pathology request forms contributes to pre-analytical errors that might affect patient safety. AIMS : To audit the adequacy of clinical history on histopathology request forms and analyse the effectiveness of a targeted intervention to improve clinical history provision. METHODS : This was an interventional, single-centre study over 6 months. A mandatory field was created in laboratory information system (LIS), where the reporting pathologist scored the history provided as either adequate or non-adequate (absent, inadequate or misleading clinical history). Inadequate history was defined as the requirement for additional information before a diagnosis could be rendered. Data was collected monthly. After 2 months the data was provided to individual clinicians from two outlier departments (targeted subjects) with an explanation of the audit purpose as part of the intervention. Chi-squared analysis was used to compare adequacy before and after the intervention. RESUL TS : Preintervention, 3039 request forms non-adequate forms [of these 46% were inadequate, 12% were misleading and 42% had no clinical history]. The targeted clinicians from two departments had 109 (25%) non-adequate requests prior to the intervention; after the intervention, 47 (8.4%) were non- adequate (P=<0.001). CONCLUSION : Targeted intervention can significantly improve the adequacy of clinical information in Anatomical Pathology request forms. SIGNIFICANCE : A simple audit and targeted intervention can significantly improve the adequacy of clinical information in Anatomical Pathology request forms to improve patient safety.An audit of a Quality Improvement Bundle of Jennifer Bath, Jennifer Hartley, Andrew Deacon Department of Anaesthesia and Pain Medicine, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 dharan.sukumar@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : method of peri-operative opioid-sparing analgesia. However, attaining consistent and reliable nerve blockade can be difficult. A quality improvement initiative was introduced in 2017: standardised fixative device, standardised solution, patient-controlled program, and twice-daily review. AIMS : The primary aim was to compare thoracic epidural failure rates before and after QI-STEAM. Secondary aims were to compare analgesia, complication rates, and epidural drug prescription. METHODS : A retrospective analysis of 627 patients who received a peri-operative thoracic epidural from 2012 to 2021 was done, comparing Pre-Intervention with Post- Intervention. Data was collected from electronic clinical records for patient demographics, surgery, procedure, prescription, pain scores, complications, and removal reason. RESUL TS : Cohorts were comparable in size and demographics. Fewer epidurals were removed due to failure (26.8% Pre- Intervention vs 16.2% Post-Intervention, p<0.001), and specifically there were fewer dressing failures (11.5% Pre- vs 4.1% Post-, p<0.001). For any given time point, epidurals Pre-Intervention had a 3.6-fold risk of dressing failure (Hazard Ratio 0.272, p<0.0001). Pre-Intervention prescriptions were widely variable, while 96.7% prescriptions Post-Intervention used the standardised solution (p<0.001), and 98.6% used the intended patient- controlled program (p<0.001). Pain scores were not significantly different. Fewer patients required rescue opioids (54.0% Pre- Implementation reduced failure rates, while providing non-inferior analgesia, reducing epidural complication rates, and increasing prescription standardisation. SIGNIFICANCE : Marginal gains of each intervention cumulate to improve thoracic epidural analgesia efficacy and reduced complications.26 - 29 July 2022 | 41 ORAL PRESENTATIONSA novel decision-making algorithm for evaluating appropriateness of ordering urine cultures from the Emergency Department 11.10am Yi Tong Vincent Aw1,2, Jessica Yi Han Aw2, Gnana Wijethilake3, Teisa Holani4, Phillip Whiley5,2 1.

Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 5. Division of Surgery, The Canberra Hospital, Garran, ACT , 2605 vincent.aw@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Urine analysis (UA) is a bedside-screening tool used to determine whether Urine Microscopy, Culture and Sensitivities (UMCS) should be ordered to investigate symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs). Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is distinct from UTI due to lack of symptoms despite positive UMCS. National and International guidelines recommend against screening for ASB in the general population. Anecdotally, asymptomatic patients with positive UA are regularly inappropriately investigated with UMCS, leading to UTI misdiagnosis, over-treatment and contribution to antimicrobial resistance without clinical benefit. AIM : We aimed to construct a novel decision-making algorithm for ordering UMCS and evaluate its effectiveness for UTI diagnosis compared to using UA. METHODS : We conducted a retrospective analysis of 562 consecutive patients who had UMCS in January 2018 from the Canberra Hospital Emergency Department. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression identified factors associated with UTI which were used to construct the algorithm. Sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing UTI was calculated for the algorithm and UA. RESUL TS : Multivariate regression identified several clinical symptoms significantly associated with UTI diagnosis. No combination of UA results were associated with UTI diagnosis, but negative UA was associated with no UTI. Significant factors were included in the algorithm- which demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 69.8 % specificity for UTI diagnosis. In comparison, UA parameters had 92-100% sensitivity and 29.7-53.8% specificity. The algorithm would have avoided 58.9% of inappropriately ordered UMCS- equating to AU$69,500 annual cost-savings- without missing any UTI diagnoses. CONCLUSION : The algorithm is superior to UA for UTI diagnosisSIGNIFICANCE : This novel algorithm may lead to significant cost-savings while improving UTI diagnosis standard of care.

Department of Anaesthesiology, Canberra Health Services, Garran, Act, 2605 3. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS), Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 chyi.tho@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Patients undergoing colorectal surgery require considerable hospital resources with potential of complications. Standardised Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) care pathways are known to reduce hospital length of stay and patient complications. AIMS : The primary aim was to compare the difference between actual and predicted hospital length of stay for adult patients undergoing major elective colorectal surgery at Canberra Hospital pre- and post-ERAS. The secondary aims were to compare 30-day readmission, ICU admissions and complication rates. METHODS : A standardised perioperative care pathway was developed through multidisciplinary literature, employment of a nursing coordinator, development of a REDCap database, and continual audit. Retrospective data on patients managed before introduction of ERAS on February 15, 2021, was compared to patients managed one year after. Actual versus predicted length of stay was compared using the American College of Surgeons Surgical Risk Calculator. Complications and ICU admissions were also compared. RESUL TS : 190 patients managed pre-ERAS were compared to 77 post-ERAS. The mean difference between actual and predicted length of stay decreased by 4.0 days (median decrease of 1.9). Patients staying 14 days or longer decreased from 20% to 6%, with no significant change in readmission rates (11% pre-ERAS, 13% post). ICU admission rate has fallen from 29% to 12%, with unplanned admissions falling from 15% to 6%. Medical complications decreased from 31% to 22%. CONCLUSION : Results following introduction of ERAS in elective colorectal surgery patients show improvement in length of stay, ICU admissions rate, and complications without change to readmission rates. SIGNIFICANCE : This translates to improved hospital efficiency. Ongoing audit will address compliance to ERAS.ORAL PRESENTATIONS42 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingThe mysterious case of missing adverse drug reaction reports: The proof is in the codes 11.30am Melissa Faehrmann1, Yee Ching Ng1,2,3 1. Pharmacy Department, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 2. ACT Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Committee, Garran, ACT , 2605 3. Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 melissa.faehrmann@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Adequate adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting and follow-up is essential in optimising patient care. There were organisational concerns that ADRs are under-reported by clinicians. AIM /Objective(s): To investigate whether reports, received via the online spontaneous reporting system, reflect the incidence of ADRs occurring within the organisation, as retrieved using targeted International Classification of Diseases revision 10 (ICD-10) codes. METHODS : Medical records were retrospectively identified based on the ICD-10 codes for skin-related ADRs to antimicrobials, and anaphylactic shock to all medicines that occurred during, or resulted in, admission between July and December 2018. Additional ICD-10 codes for severe cutaneous ADRs to antimicrobials were also used. ADR reports submitted spontaneously in the same period were retrieved for comparison. Given the exploratory nature of this study, results were summarised using simple descriptive statistics. RESUL TS : During the study period 52 ADRs were identified by ICD-10 codes of interest, compared to 6 relevant ADRs spontaneously reported. Of the relevant 48 ADRs identified using ICD-10 codes, only four (8%) had been reported via the organisation's spontaneous reporting system. ADRs that were spontaneously reported, in comparison to those not reported, had better documentation rates amongst discharge paperwork (100% vs 89%) and across the various electronic medical records platforms (5% and 30% vs 17% and 83%). CONCLUSION : ADRs are considerably under-reported and inconsistently documented within the organisation, which may adversely impact future patient care. SIGNIFICANCE : The organisation has begun supplementing spontaneous ADR reports by those retrieved from medical records using relevant ICD-10 coding, resulting in up to 300% more patients reviewed by the ACT ADR Reporting Committee.Combating antimicrobial resistance: The need for accurate epidemiology 11.40am Frances Sheehan1,2, Kathryn Daveson2 1. The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 2. The Canberra Hospital, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 Frances.sheehan@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : The multi-sectorial response to antimicrobial resistance needs to be underpinned by accurate epidemiology. Current Australian healthcare- associated infection surveillance guideline classifications are time-based, defining blood stream infections as hospital or community onset. Surveillance definitions classify the rise in extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteraemia to be driven by community acquired infection. Using ESBL E. coli as a pilot, we are investigating whether misleading impressions are being drawn from surveillance data. AIMS /Question: Are time-based surveillance classifications providing misleading impressions from surveillance data? METHODS : Using laboratory data from ACT Pathology, we identified all ESBL E. coli blood stream isolate episodes from 2016 - 2020. By reviewing patient records, we classified isolates according to our enhanced surveillance framework. We then compared our classifications with the current time- based classifications. RESUL TS : A total of 152 ESBL E. coli blood stream isolates were reviewed. Current time-based surveillance classifications defined 77.6% (118/152) as community onset. However, our enhanced surveillance framework identified only 16.4% (25/152) as community associated. We found that 27.6% (42/152) had an acute health care interaction within 30 days prior to infection and a further 8.5% (13/152) within 90 days prior to infection. We found 7.2% (11/152) were aged care associated. CONCLUSION : Time-based classifications cause misleading impressions from surveillance data. An enhanced surveillance dataset including recent interactions with acute health care or aged care services, travel, and previous infections provides more accurate epidemiology. Accurately assessing trends of antimicrobial resistance will better inform strategic planning priorities, focus resource allocation, and target infection prevention and control strategies. SIGNIFICANCE : Healthcare-associated infection surveillance guidelines need revision. 26 - 29 July 2022 | 43 ORAL PRESENTATIONSBirth plans: A systematic integrative review 1.50pm Catherine H Bell, Deborah Davis, Sally Muggleton Department of Midwifery, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 catherine.bell@canberra.edu.au INTRODUCTION /Background: The birth plan was introduced in the 1980s to facilitate communication between maternity care providers and women and increase agency for childbearing women in the face of medicalised birth. Forty years on, the birth plan is a heterogeneous document with uncertainty surrounding its purpose, process, and impact. AIM : The aim of this review was to synthesise the evidence and improve understanding of the purpose, process and impact of the birth plan on childbearing women's experiences and outcomes. METHODS : This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search strategy was designed and applied to electronic databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov . Articles were appraised using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool and a five-step integrative approach to analysis followed. RESUL TS /Findings: Eleven articles were identified, all quantitative in nature. It is clear that the general purpose of birth plans is communication, with decision making a key factor. Even though the processes of birth planning were varied, having a birth plan was associated with generally positive birth outcomes. CONCLUSION : Despite the heterogeneity of birth plans, birth plans were associated with positive outcomes for childbearing women when developed in collaboration with care providers. The act of collaboratively creating a birth plan may improve obstetric outcomes, aid realistic expectations, and improve satisfaction and the sense of control. SIGNIFICANCE : The purpose and process of birth plans have not previously been explored in reviews of birth plans. Understanding these aspects of birth plans enables a better understanding of the impacts of birth plans on childbearing women.Probiotic supplementation in healthy pre-schoolers: Prevalence J Currie2, Deborah Davis2,3 1. Hospital for Women and Children, Garran, ACT , 2605 2. Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 3. ACT Health Directorate, Garran, ACT , 2605 Nicola.Irwin@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Probiotics have been shown to prevent or treat a number of paediatric health problems, however not much is known about how probiotics are used in the community. AIM : This study aimed to describe the prevalence and main predictors of probiotic supplementation among healthy preschool-aged children. METHODS : Parents of 4 or 5-year-olds residing in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire between February and May 2020. There were 469 responses concerning 494 children eligible for analysis. Prevalence was categorised as lifetime exposure and recent exposure. Predictors were determined through multiple logistic regression modelling. RESUL TS : Almost half (47.4%) of the children had ever been exposed to probiotics and 14.9% had taken probiotics in the previous month. The strongest predictors of lifetime probiotic exposure were parental lifetime probiotic use (OR 13.3; 95% CI 7.4-24.1) and an interaction between functional food consumption and parental lifetime probiotic use (OR 5.6; 95% CI 2.6-12.1). The strongest predictor of recent probiotic exposure was parental recent probiotic use (OR 13.3; 95% CI 5.7-30.8). CONCLUSION : This study illustrates the high prevalence of probiotic exposure among healthy preschool-aged children in the ACT and emphasises the relationship between parental use of probiotics and exposure in children. SIGNIFICANCE : These findings will allow comparison and analysis of trends over time, and contribute to the emerging body of work around the use of probiotics in the community. Practitioners should be aware of the evidence for and against probiotics as these findings suggest a high level of acceptability among parents.ORAL PRESENTATIONS44 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingGlucose lowering therapies and exercise capacity: A systematic review 2.10pm Eleanor Gundry1, Roy Romeo1, Christopher Nolan1, Suzanne Estaphan1 ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 Eleanor.Gundry@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Exercise capacity (EC) is a well-known mortality predictor. While exercise interventions are recommended in the clinical management of patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), little is known about the impact of the use of glucose-lowering drugs on EC. AIM : To investigate the current literature to evaluate the effect of glucose-lowering drugs on various parameters of EC (peak oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio, rating of perceived exertion, and anaerobic threshold). METHODS : A systematic approach searching four databases was conducted for studies reporting effect of glucose- lowering drugs on EC parameters. Meta-analysis using random-effects modelling [RevMan.v5] will be conducted, including in subgroups according to study duration, participant characteristics, and the glucose-lowering drug used. RESUL TS : Twenty studies were eligible for inclusion. Preliminary findings showed that fourteen studies explored the effect of metformin on EC, while only few studies investigated other glucose-lowering the studies that explored metformin, seven were of healthy participants with six reporting no significant effects of metformin on EC and one showing impairment of EC. Of the other studies that explored metformin, two were of subjects with T2DM and four were of subjects with non- diabetes comorbidities, both positive and negative effects on EC were reported. CONCLUSION : At this stage of analysis, a negative effect of metformin on EC cannot be excluded. There are too few studies to allow any conclusions to be drawn on any other glucose-lowering drugs. SIGNIFICANCE : This research highlights the paucity of research on the interactions between glucose-lowering drugs and exercise capacity.The relationship between metabolically healthy obesity and cognitive function: a systematic review of observational studies 1.

Department of Nutritional Sciences, The BIO5 Institute, University of Arizona, T ucson, AZ, USA nenad.naumovski@canberra.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) is an established model to investigate the mechanisms linking obesity and its complications, including cognitive impairment, in the absence of metabolic aberrations. AIMS : The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate whether MHO represents a risk factor for cognitive decline, with a particular focus on dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset. METHODS : Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature search was performed using PubMed and Scopus. RESUL TS : Only two studies (n=365,131 participants) met the eligibility criteria. The first study used data from National Health Insurance System (NHIS) of Korea, while the second used data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort from USA. Study heterogeneity was mostly attributed to: a. study design (retrospective vs. prospective), b. target population (middle-aged vs. older adults) and c. categorization of combined weight and metabolic status (normo-weight grouped with overweight vs. obese grouped with overweight), respectively. The NHIS study revealed that MHO subjects had the lowest odds of developing dementia compared to normo-weight (irrespective of their metabolic status) and metabolically unhealthy obese. Multivariate analysis revealed that MHO resulted in 15% and 13% lower likelihood for dementia and AD, respectively, compared with normo-weight healthy subjects (All p's<0.05). In ADNI study, compared with healthy overweight/obese, healthy normo-weight, normo-weight and unhealthy overweight/obese, had 36%, 72% and 34% higher risk for AD (All p's<0.05). CONCLUSION : The combined analysis suggests that individuals with excess weight yet metabolically healthy have lower risk of dementia and AD compared to unhealthy participants or even healthy participants with normal weight.26 - 29 July 2022 | 45 ORAL PRESENTATIONSExploring healthy ageing through longitudinal studies: From evidence Helen Skeat1, Matthew Kelly1, Ginny Sargent1 National Centre for Epidemiology and Population health, ANU College of Health and Medicine, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 ayesha.a.alhassan@gmail.com INTRODUCTION : This project explores existing data sets and how they can be used to inform policy, with a focus on the added value of longitudinal studies. We use the policy area of healthy aging to explore how different longitudinal data sets can be used by policymakers to inform decisions regarding healthy ageing policy within the ACT . AIM : We aimed to identify which longitudinal studies might be useful to inform population health policy for healthy ageing and how different longitudinal data sets can answer important policy questions in the ACT context. METHOD : A scoping review was conducted that identified 10 existing studies that had a longitudinal design, that sampled the ACT population and included participants that were 45 and over. The coverage of each data source was summarised in a table, and variables categorised into broad domains relevant to healthy ageing policy. Each study varied in their coverage and depth regarding different topics including personal, health, economic, environmental, and behavioural factors. Reported variables were extracted and consolidated into seven domains which will be covered in the presentation. CONCLUSION : Healthy ageing can be conceptualised across the life course and policy responses will be supported by studies that track people over a period, an important feature of longitudinal studies. With a focus on healthy ageing in the ACT , this study provides a summary of relevant longitudinal studies, and some examples of how these data can be used to provide an evidence-based approach to inform policy. Establishment of a single-cell digital droplet PCR methodology for quantitative analysis of cellular virological state 3.10pm Xiaonan Zhang Faculty of Science and Technology, UNSW Canberra, Canberra, ACT , 2610 Xiaonan.Zhang@canberra.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Due to the highly heterogenous nature of viral infection, absolute quantification of virological state at a single-cell level is instrumental for a deeper understanding of the mechanism of the virus propagation and persistence. Although molecular pathology methods such as In Situ Hybridisation can provide single-cell and spatially resolved results, they can rarely achieve single-molecule sensitivity thus undermining its applicability. AIMS : To establish a digital droplet PCR methodology that achieves the enumeration of cells harbouring the DNA of interest METHODS : We developed a novel method that involves single-cell droplet formation, in-droplet cell digestion, and digital PCR in a streamlined fashion. Dual target amplification (one for host genomic DNA, the other for the target of choice) allows facile quantification of the positive rate of the particular nucleic acid, e.g. HBV DNA. RESUL TS : This method allows for partitioning of single cells into droplets which are then digested in situ. The remaining DNA with the droplets is then amplified using the standard digital droplet PCR method and analysed quantitatively. We used HBV (-) HepG2 and HBV (+) HepAD38 cells to validate this methodology. They were mixed in different ratios and assayed to test the linearity of the method. We found that this assay is highly specific, and its sensitivity can be lower than 0.16%. Furthermore, excellent linearity is observed. CONCLUSION : We successfully established a method that shows high specificity, sensitivity, and exceptional linearity for detecting single-molecule DNA within individual cells. SIGNIFICANCE : This methodology can be applied in many scenarios such as persistent viral infection, population dynamics in the gut microbiota and environmental monitoring. ORAL PRESENTATIONS46 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingA meta analysis of the efficiency of peri-tonsillar infiltration of tramadol administered with analgesia in the control NSW, 2580 2. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 u7088913@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : The exquisite sensitivity of the tonsillar fossae represents a significant challenge in achieving adequate control of post-tonsillectomy pain. Tramadol is primarily used as a centrally acting opioid agonist, yet its local anaesthetic activity renders it an opportune avenue for management of post-tonsillectomy pain. AIM : To evaluate the efficacy of peritonsillar infiltration of tramadol administered with anaesthesia in the control of post-tonsillectomy pain compared with normal saline. METHODS : All randomized controlled trials comparing peritonsillar infiltration of tramadol with normal saline were included for analysis. Continuous data was analysed using standardized mean difference (SMD). The primary outcome was time to first analgesic request; secondary outcomes were pain scores (CHEOPS) at 1, 2, 4 and 24 hours post-operatively, and time to commencement of liquid diet. Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan Version 5.1. RESUL TS : 12 trials published between 2001-2022, including patients aged 3-48 years were identified. Time to request first analgesia [SMD 1.75, p<0.001], CHEOPS p= 0.02] favoured the experimental group liquid diet [SMD -0.87, -0.04, p= 0.04] when compared : Intra-operative peritonsillar infiltration of tramadol yielded significantly greater control of post- tonsillectomy pain across all measured outcomes when compared to patients who received normal saline. This included prolonged time to first request of analgesia, lower CHEOPS and earlier commencement of liquid diet. SIGNIFICANCE : These are encouraging results supportive of the use of tramadol as a novel avenue for the management of post-tonsillectomy pain.Incidence and severity of diabetic retinopathy at first presentation to vitreoretinal services in Bhutan: A national study G.

Moran Eye Centre, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT , USA, 84132 bhim.rai@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major complication of diabetes, which remains a leading cause of visual loss. AIM : To determine the incidence and severity of DR at first presentation among the diabetic patients attending the national vitreoretinal (VR) services in Bhutan. METHODS : This retrospective cross-sectional study included all diabetic patients presenting for retinal evaluation for the first time over 3 years (2013-2016). Data included demography, clinical details, diagnostic tests, and clinical staging of DR was performed. RESUL TS : We enrolled 843 diabetic patients aged 57.2 \u00b1 12.0 years. The majority were males (452, 53.6% cf. 391, 46.4%, p=0.14), from urban settings (570, 67.6% cf. 273, 32.4%), and did not attend modern schooling (555, 65.8%). The most common reason for presentation was for a routine eye check-up (246, 29.2%), and hypertension was the most common systemic co-morbidity (501, 59.4%). The incidence of DR among the diabetic patients was 42.7%. Mild non- proliferative DR (NPDR) was the most common (187, 51.9%), followed by moderate NPDR (88, 24.4%), and proliferative DR (PDR) (45, 12.5%). A logistic regression model indicated the major determinant of DR was the duration of diabetes, the odds rising by 1.27\u00d7 with every year of disease (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: The incidence of DR was high despite a national DR screening program is established. There is need to accelerate health education, community screening and referral system to reduce blindness and prevalence of DR. SIGNIFICANCE : Knowing of demographic characteristics and prevalence of disease is pivotal in planning program. This study was the first of its kind to inform the national health policy in Bhutan.26 - 29 July 2022 | 47 ORAL PRESENTATIONSEvaluation of a pilot to provide free nicotine replacement therapy in ACT Alcohol and Other Drug Services 3.40pm Claudia E. der Sterren2 1. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 2. Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs ACT (ATODA), Kaleen, ACT , 2617 claudia.reed@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Tobacco smoking is the leading contributor to morbidity and mortality nationwide. In the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), 77% of alcohol and other drug (AOD) service users smoke, which accounts for approximately 14% of all ACT smokers. Targeted interventions are a clinical priority. Promising subsidised nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) programs have been trialled in interstate services. AIMS : We aimed to describe the extent and predictors of quality quit attempts (QQAs) in a pilot program providing NRT to AOD service users in the ACT . METHODS : Eligible service users at seven AOD services in the ACT were provided subsidised NRT vouchers redeemable at five participating pharmacies. Responses to a pre-program survey covering demographics, clinical characteristics and previous cessation experiences were compared to the primary outcome of accessing NRT sufficient to make a QQA. RESUL TS : Of 265 redeemed vouchers, 238 (90%) were redeemed for NRT sufficient to make a QQA. Positive predictors for making a QQA were previous experience with NRT (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.10-6.87, p=0.03) and scoring lower on the Heaviness of Smoking Index (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.48-1.01, p=0.054). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of AOD users made QQAs when provided with cost-free NRT . Previous experiences with NRT may be a useful predictor of QQAs in AOD service users in the ACT . SIGNIFICANCE : This is the first program providing cost-free NRT to AOD service users in the ACT . It contributes local information to the growing evidence base for the utility of targeted smoking cessation interventions in AOD services, which may significantly reduce the smoking burden overall in the ACT .Is non-occupational HIV Post Exposure Prophylaxis (nPEP) still used for HIV prevention? An exploration of nPEP use in the Australian Capital Territory since widespread availability of HIV Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis 3.50pm Shannon C Woodward1, Anne M Baynes1, Hayley A Tyson1,2, William A Dunlop2, Sarah J Martin1,2 1. Canberra Sexual Health Centre, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 2. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, , 2601 shannon.woodward@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Non-occupational Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (nPEP) is an effective HIV prevention strategy in gay and bisexual men (GBM) taken after possible exposure. HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is also a highly effective HIV prevention strategy. AIM : This study aims to determine whether nPEP usage by GBM in the ACT changed after PrEP availability via clinical trial and listing on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. METHODS : A retrospective audit of medical records of GBM presenting to a sexual health centre and provided with nPEP compared two periods to determine if nPEP usage changed following availability of PrEP . In the first period (P1) PrEP was available through extended trials. In the second period (P2) PrEP became more accessible through the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Period comparisons were performed using a two-population test of proportions with one-tailed testing and significance set at p<.05 using SPSS Statistics Version 25. RESUL TS : There were 232 GBM provided with nPEP in P1, and 202 in P2. A two-population test of proportions demonstrated that GBM presentations for nPEP decreased significantly from 302/4779 (6.3%) of visits to 221/ PrEP was p<.001). PrEP uptake after presenting for nPEP increased from 30 (12.9%) of total GBM visits in P1 to 69 (34.2%) in P2 (Z=5.26, p<.001). CONCLUSION : GBM accessing nPEP decreased with statistical significance post introduction of PBS PrEP . SIGNIFICANCE : This study reinforced that nPEP still needs to be available from public health services and nPEP policy should remain current continuing the multipronged approach to prevention and ultimate eradication of HIV.DAY FOUR ABSTRACTS48 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingDAY FOUR FRIDAY 29 JULY 2022 3 MINUTE THESIS COMPETITION AND WORKSHOPS3 MINUTE THESIS26 - 29 July 2022 | 49 3 MINUTE THESIS 9.00am The Three Minute Thesis (3MT\u00ae) competition celebrates the exciting research conducted by Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) students.

Medication and counselling can help with some schizophrenia symptoms, such as hallucinations and paranoia, however, cognitive issues like memory loss are currently untreatable. This is because there is a lack of understanding of the exact underlying synaptic mechanisms - the chemical transmissions in brain cells - involved in schizophrenia. I aim to better understand the role of one neurotransmitter found to be implicated in schizophrenia (glycine) to contribute to the improvement of current pharmaceutical options which target the underlying cause of schizophrenia. Clinical decision making and the nursing process in digital health systems: An integrated systematic review Laura Hants University of Canberra The nursing process framework continues to be used within the nursing profession to assess, plan, implement interventions and evaluate patient care outcomes. However, there are significant gaps in the comprehensive documentation of this nursing process within digital health systems. Conflicting information from the literature has identified that the complete nursing process is not effectively being incorporated into digital health systems. Importantly, patient care planning and evaluation of patient outcomes were the least reported stages of the nursing process. A risk to patient safety is evident as digital systems are unable to facilitate nurses' ability to effectively apply clinical reasoning.3 MINUTE THESIS50 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingA mutation in protein IRF4 result in Primary Immunodeficiency Disorders (PID) Zhijia Yu The Australian National University Primary immunodeficiency Disorders (PID) is a partial or whole immune system failure that due to a mutation in proteins involved in immune systems. The mutations can be inherited, or de novo mutated. Most PID patients are young children suffering recurrent and persistent infections due to a non-functional immune system. One PID patient has been identified with a mutation in protein IRF4, which leads to a very low B cell number (the cell source for antibody production) and very low antibody productions. My goal of research is to use mouse models to determine how mutated IRF4 result in the clinical features. Identifying with your field of study: Academic and wellbeing benefits Mila Knezevic The Australian National University Clarity is lacking regarding how social identities and deep learning approaches, two concepts integral to tertiary education, operate and translate to new contexts. I aim to address limitations which contribute to this lack of clarity, and to engage stakeholders in a collaborative learning process that utilizes the benefits of social identification and deep learning behaviours. The overarching theme of translating research findings and understanding underlying processes is extended to wellbeing benefits associated with social identification and deep learning to highlight potential for cross-disciplinary collaboration and the wider application and relevance of findings to spheres relevant to students' wellbeing. General practice pharmacists: A luxury or a necessity? Thilini Sudeshika Salpahewage University of Canberra With the expansion of pharmacists' roles, pharmacists have been included in general practice teams to improve medicine safety by providing non-dispensing services. However, Australia still lags in widening the role of pharmacists in general practice. This thesis aims to explore various aspects of the general practice pharmacist service model in Australia. This includes synthesising literature related to Australian general practice pharmacists, assessing pharmacists' activities, exploring collaboration and team effectiveness of general practice teams after including a pharmacist, and investigating patient views towards pharmacist-led services. The findings could guide future interventions in expanding pharmacists' services in the general practice setting. What does 'psychosocial disability' mean, and who decides that? Terri Warne The Australian National University The use of the term 'psychosocial disability' has increased in Australia since the introduction of the NDIS, but the same can't be said for clarity about how it is defined. My research takes the position that the knowledge is produced by many different sources. It investigates whether different groups have different ideas about what it does and should mean, and what the NDIS' construction of the term has meant for policy and for the people affected. The shape of cells: Restoring neuronal changes in Autism Spectrum Disorder Rhea Laverock The Australian National University Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a condition that affects approximately 1% of the Australian population, and yet, so much about the condition is still poorly understood. ASD causes significant behavioural and cognitive impairments, especially in young children, resulting in detrimental impacts on patients' quality of life. My research at ANU involves investigating a new therapeutic that, in initial investigations, has worked to restore behavioural deficits in severely autistic mice. I will further look to see if these incredible results are working via a mechanism where the abnormal anatomy of neurons, responsible for these ASD specific behaviours, are restored. 3 MINUTE THESIS26 - 29 July 2022 | 51 Feasibility of the Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance Approach to improve performance and participation for children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) Catherine Hilly Australian Catholic University Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) describe a spectrum of brain injuries, birth defects and developmental disabilities caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Global prevalence of FASD is estimated to be 7.7 per 1000 population of children and youth. People with FASD experience lifelong mild to severe impairments in neurocognitive, behavioural, social, academic, language and physical functioning. These impairments result in participation restrictions impacting all occupations including schooling, leisure, and self-care. This research aims to explore the feasibility of the Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) ApproachTM to improve occupational performance and participation in daily activities for children with FASD. A roadblock of bacterial infection Anyang Zhao The Australian National University The human pathogen Listeria is found in many types of food. Listeria can cause life-threating sepsis. In my research, I found that Listeria can take advantage of the immune system to promote its ability to infect and spread. Listeria enters and replicates in immune cells, causing them to explode. The explosive cell death allows Listeria to infect other cells in the tissue and spread. My research shows that stopping Listeria from entering cells by removing its \"invasion\" genes can prevent infection. Blocking bacteria from invading our cells are a novel way to prevent sepsis.The life and death of mRNAs and how to exploit it for therapeutic benefits Sasanan Trakansuebkul The Australian National University Our genome is like a cookbook and our mRNAs are like the ingredients in a recipe. Recipes can be wrong, either missing an ingredient or an addition of an ingredient, such as mutated mRNA that causes uncontrollable growth leading to cancer. What if we can destroy these haywire mRNAs so that they don't cause cancer? Or perhaps prolong the lives of the mRNAs that prevent cancer. My research aims to understand how mRNAs are created and destroyed. Through this knowledge, we can make beneficial mRNAs that prevent diseases live longer and get rid of disease-causing mRNAs before they cause problems. What's morality got to do with it? Victoria Thomas The Australian National University Moral Injury (MI) results when the choices we make, the things we witness or the betrayals we experience violate our core values of what's right. In the wake of COVID the concept of MI resonates with more occupations than ever before. My PhD delineates the MI construct in occupational settings beyond the military (where it arose), and offers one of the first scales to capture the experiences of these groups. Results suggest that emotional distress in response to having our core values violated is adaptive, and the way workers are supported may be the key to protecting their mental health. SSRI anxiety: Shifting Serotonergic Roles in anxiety Lachlan Kimption The Australian National University Anxiety is one of the leading mental health issues across Australia, disproportionality affecting young adults. Currently, therapeutics aiming to treat the spectrum of symptoms presented is a developing field, largely to address the profoundly debilitating social and economic impacts presented. One such method focuses on targeting transmission pathways within the brain involving the neurotransmitter, serotonin. My research investigates a therapeutic preliminary data has shown to modulate this system, addressing a neurological basis for anxiety. I hope to determine whether it is therefore vital in the fine-tuning of the serotonergic system, characterised by its dysregulation in disease states.WORKSHOPS52 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingWORKSHOPS Consumer participation in research from the ground up Join the Health Care Consumers' Association for a workshop about consumer participation in research.

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS), Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 chiahowe.tan@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : A standardised Enhance Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) care pathway for patients undergoing hysterectomy was developed and implemented in Canberra Hospital in February 2021. In the same study that established the ERAS pathway, improvement in the length of stay was shown based on early results. In current study, the effect of ERAS program after a year of implementation was audited. AIMS: The primary aim was to compare patient length of stay before and after the introduction of ERAS pathway. Secondary aim was to compare 30-day readmission rate and post-operative medical complications. METHODS: ERAS pathway was developed through collaboration with changes included in patient care pre- , intra-, and post-operatively, employment of a nursing coordinator, development of a REDCap database, and continual audit. Retrospective data on patients managed from January 2021 - before the introduction of ERAS on February 15, 2021 - was compared to patients managed for 12 months after. Actual length of stay was compared to predicted length of stay from the American College of Surgeons Surgical Risk Calculator. RESUL TS: The mean difference between actual and predicted length of stay fell to 0.9 days from 1.7 days post- ERAS. In terms of re-admission rate, it was lower in post-ERAS albeit by merely 1%. However, overall medical complication post-ERAS dropped to 4.5% from 7%. CONCLUSION: ERAS program has decreased hysterectomy patient length of stay and medical complications with comparable 30-day readmission rate. SIGNIFICANCE: A hysterectomy ERAS program reduces medical complication and hospital stay thereby improves hospital efficiency. These findings support the expanded inclusion of ERAS care pathway in other surgical disciplines.Evaluating the effectiveness of various pre-test probability-adjusted D-dimer approaches for acute pulmonary embolism diagnosis of Medicine, The Canberra Hospital, Garran, ACT , 2605 2. Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, The Canberra Hospital, Garran, ACT , 2605 3. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 4. Canberra Health Services, Garran, 2605 vincent.aw@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : D-dimer above 0.5 mg/L has high sensitivity for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis, which is confirmed with Computerised Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) imaging. However, elevated D-dimer often results in negative CTPAs due to low specificity- incurring high costs and unnecessary risks. Landmark studies have shown that age-adjusted increase specificity without sacrificing sensitivity. Anecdotally, these are not widely incorporated into local practice. AIMS : To investigate the diagnostic efficacy of AADD, CPADD, YDD, and fixed cut-off approaches, and estimate cost-savings from implementing the most effective approach. METHODS : Retrospective analysis was conducted on 226 consecutive adult, non-pregnant patients with suspected PE, D-dimer and imaging performed at Canberra Hospital Emergency Department from December 2019-March 2020. AADD, CPADD, and YDD approaches were used to calculate sensitivity and specificity for PE diagnosis. RESUL TS : 0.5 mg/L 1.0 and 100% and and specificity. 95.8% and 62.9% specificity. YDD had 100% sensitivity and 57.4% specificity. A novel combined approach using YDD and 0.75 mg/L cut-off (0.75YDD) had the highest sensitivity (100%) and specificity (63.4%). The 0.75YDD approach would have avoided 56.6% of CTPAs- equating up to AUD$218,000 annual cost-savings. CONCLUSION : CPADD and YDD approaches were superior to AADD and 0.5 mg/L cut-off for PE diagnosis. 0.75YDD approach was superior to other approaches. SIGNIFICANCE : Utilising the 0.75YDD approach may improve PE diagnosis- potentially leading to substantial cost-savings without missed PEs.POSTER PRESENTATIONS26 - 29 July 2022 | 55 An innovative model for gestational diabetes mellitus using NODk mice fed a Western diet Ingrid B.

Department of Anatomical Pathology, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 u6388247@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION /Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus affects 15% of pregnancies and increases maternal and perinatal morbidity and long-term metabolic disease risk. There is no animal model that appropriately mimics the human maternal and fetal phenotype. AIM : We explored whether NODk mice fed Western diet (WD) before and during pregnancy develop a GDM pregnancy maternal and fetal phenotype. METHODS : Six-week-old virgin female NODk mice were randomised to WD or CHOW (C) diet for 4 weeks preconception and during pregnancy. Females were timed mated. Weekly food intake, body weight and blood glucose (BG) were measured. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (ipGTT) were conducted at gestational (G) days G9.5, and G17.5 and post-natal (PN) day 21. Following euthanasia at timepoints, maternal/pup organ histology and fetal abnormalities were assessed. Data were analysed by ANOVA with cohort as random effect; p<0.05 considered significant. RESUL TS : WD fed female mice gained more weight pre- pregnancy (7.0 \u00b10.5 vs 3.6 \u00b10.6 g, WD n=22 vs C n=17, p<0.001), but gained less weight to vs 20.6\u00b10.4g, p<0.01, WD n=9 to C mice at G9.5 and G17.5, glucose tolerance was impaired (Area under both pregnancy timepoints, there was evidence of macro and micro hepatic steatosis in WD dams which improved by the PN timepoint. CONCLUSION /SIGNIFICANCE : Preliminary results show that WD fed NODk mice mimic the human GDM maternal phenotype and may be a model for assessing mechanisms of diabetes induced congenital anomalies as well as maternal effects from GDM. Targeting extracellular histones with small polyanions to Christopher R. Parish1 Genome Science and Cancer Division, The John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 viviane.augusto@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Activated neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formed by DNA entwined with histones (HIS), that eliminate pathogens. However, excessive release of NETs/HIS results in bystander cellular damage, with young children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and COVID-19 having high levels of circulating NETs/HIS. We also found that in vitro, compared to endothelial cells (EC), pancreatic -cells are highly susceptible to HIS-induced injury. We recently developed a small polyanion (SPA), methyl -cellobioside per-O-sulfate (mCBS), that has NET / HIS neutralising properties. In this study, we aimed to investigate the ability of mCBS to prevent and/or rescue HIS- damaged -cells. METHODS : We measured endothelial (HMEC-1) and (INS832/13) and visualized in real-time morphological changes induced by HIS microscopy and high-resolution label-free glycolytic activity (~60%), whereas in -cells it induced a severe reduction in both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (~80%). mCBS completely neutralised the metabolic effects of HIS when incubated together, with later addition of mCBS inhibiting the steady reduction in -cell metabolic activity. HIS reduced EC height and blocked membrane protrusions, but membrane integrity was maintained together with vesicle trafficking and intracellular organelles. In -cells HIS promoted membrane retraction, loss of cell mobility, and formation of bleb-like structures, resulting in cell death. CONCLUSION s: SPA mCBS can protect metabolic and morphological alterations induced by HIS in both EC and -cells. SIGNIFICANCE : This study provides preclinical data supporting the involvement of HIS in islet -cell injury and demonstrates the therapeutic potential of SPAs to prevent and/or reduce such injury.POSTER PRESENTATIONS56 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingA pupil-based brain computer interface Xinyi Lyu1, Aidan P. van Kleef1 Eccles Institute of Neuroscience, The John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 u713883@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) infer intentions directly from neural signals and provide an alternative way to communicate with motor-impaired patients. Invasive BCIs that use electrodes implanted in the brain produce greater information transmission rates but pupil-based BCIs are surgery-free and non-contact making them more accessible and easier to operate. AIM : To design a simple pupil-based BCI that discriminates choice from covert spatial attention and study the effects of learning, stimulus colour and pupil (left or right) on success rate. METHODS : Subjects (4 na\u00efve and 1 expert) fixated on a central cross while covertly attending visual stimuli located at four spatial positions within the visual field (left, right, top and bottom). Each stimulus oscillated in luminance at a unique frequency (0.4, 0.6, 0.8 or 1 Hz) while the pupil responses were measured at 60 Hz for 10 seconds. Changes in pupil responses due to attention were assessed against baseline responses obtained when subjects attended a central cross. RESUL TS : Our tests reached mean success rates of 55-60%, while the percentage of significant results ranged from 56-76 %. There were no significant differences in success rates between left and right pupil, or between different stimulus colours. There was no significant learning effect in the three test sessions, however, the expert user outperformed na\u00efve subjects. CONCLUSIONS : Pupil visual gain, modulated by attention, can be used to design a successful four-choice BCI. The results are largely independent of the colour or pupil used. Learning occurs over more than three sessions. SIGNIFICANCE : Pupil responses are useful signals for inferring intentions.Predicting - a preliminary observational study Nicolo Malagutti School of Engineering, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 nicolo.malagutti@anu.edu.au AIM /Question: Leveraging Bispectral Index (BIS) measurements Inference to conduct bedside estimation of patient-specific propofol individualised forecasting of sedation in Total Intravenous Anaesthesia. METHODS : We conducted a small-cohort observational study to investigate the performance of a novel computing algorithm for the estimation of patient-specific propofol pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models. Adult day surgery patients undergoing propofol anaesthesia at Canberra Hospital were monitored from induction through to recovery. Co-administration of volatile anaesthetics was excluded, while analgesics were accepted. Age, weight, depth-of-anaesthesia settings and duration of procedure were not controlled. We captured and processed time series data for BIS and propofol infusion rate. The algorithm performed pharmacological model personalisation during the first half of each procedure, and was evaluated for its BIS forecasting performance during the latter half. We compared the ability of the personalised approach to accurately predict BIS trends through the later maintenance and recovery periods of a procedure with that of a published population-based pharmacological model. RESUL TS : 40 patient datasets were collected. Cohort-level comparisons revealed a highly statistically significant improvement in both prediction bias (mean error) and accuracy (mean absolute error) for the personalised forecasts over the population-based approach. On an individual subject basis, we observed on-par or improved performance in 96% of patients. CONCLUSION : In the population considered, Bayesian Inference was shown to be a clinically viable tool for bedside real-time estimation of personalised models of propofol pharmacology. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE : Our methodology can be further developed to strengthen the advisory value of brain spectral measures to anaesthetists, improve the predictive reliability of model-based tools such as Target-Controlled Infusion, and support advances in closed-loop anaesthesia.POSTER PRESENTATIONS26 - 29 July 2022 | 57 Understanding immune evasion in squamous cell carcinoma Barry Thompson1 The John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 barry.thompson@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Yes-associated a transcriptional co-activator that binds to TEAD family DNA binding proteins to drive skin wound healing, regeneration and cancer. The role of YAP in epithelial cell proliferation and stromal fibroblast activation is well characterised, but less is known about how YAP controls the immune infiltrate. RESUL TS : Here we report that, prior to tumour formation, YAP drives an inflamed but expressing MDSC markers & PD-L1) but relatively few lymphoid cells (except for some Tregs and Th2 cells that also express PD-L1). YAP activation also induces fibrosis as well as secretion of cytokines and chemokines characteristic of an inflammatory type 2 immune response. Accordingly, chronic low-level YAP activation with a YAPC transgene causes / eczema phenotype. CONCLUSION : Thus, YAP activation drives a type 2 immune contexture common to wound healing, chronic inflammation, and cancer.

Department of Nutrition-Dietetics, School of Health and Education, Harokopio University, Athens, Greece, 176 71 nenad.naumovski@canberra.edu.auINTRODUCTION : The worldwide prevalence of obesity is increasing along with its comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). From a patho-physiological perspective, T2DM arises as a consequence of insulin resistance and pancreatic -cell dysfunction which together induces chronic hyperglycemia. The pharmacological treatment of T2DM, specifically focuses on its management, rather than remission, with a lack of pharmacological agents to prevent the onset of the disease. Considering the role of unhealthy dietary patterns on the development of T2DM, identifying novel food ingredients and bioactives may provide novel avenues to address the T2DM epidemic. AIM : The aim of this review was to summarize the latest findings on the consumption of the prickly pear (PP; Opuntia spp.) cladode as a potential nutritional tool for management of hyperglycemia. METHODS : The literature search was performed in four online electronic databases. RESUL TS : The consumption of PP was reported to exert hypoglycemic effects making it a potential cost-effective nutritional intervention for the management of T2DM. Several studies have demonstrated that consumption of cladode and its products reduced post-prandial glucose levels. CONCLUSION : The cladodes high fibre content may be implicated in improving glycemic control, by affecting glucose absorption and effectively slowing its release into the circulation. Given these potential hypoglycemic effects, the cladode may represent a potential functional food ingredient to improve glycemic control and counter the negative metabolic effects of the modern Western diet. Nonetheless, in consideration of the lack of evidence on the chronic effects of PP cladode future research aimed at evaluating its long- term effects on glycemic control is warranted.POSTER PRESENTATIONS58 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingFactor Xa promotes amyloid precursor protein processing on platelets Oliver, A. J. Hervir1, Hayden Matthews1,2, Elizabeth E. Gardiner1 1. Genome Sciences and Cancer Division, John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 2. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 oliver.hervir@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Platelet mediated cleavage by A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase (ADAM) 10, producing a soluble 33 kDa fragment (sAPP). ADAM10 also cleaves glycoprotein (GP) VI from or FXa- activated platelets, to produce soluble GPVI (sGPVI). AIM : To evaluate how ADAM10-activating conditions regulate proteolysis of platelet APP . METHODS : Blood collected from healthy donors in anticoagulant was centrifuged to yield platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or washed platelets (WP). WP (5 \u00d7 108 platelet/mL in Tyrode's buffer) or PRP were GPVI agonists (convulxin and collagen-related peptide), FXa (by Viper Venom), or 5,000 - 15,000 s-1 shear stress for 5 min in a by flow cytometry. sGPVI and sAPP levels were quantified by ELISA. Platelet ADAM10 activity was quantified using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. RESUL TS : Alongside increased granule markers, membrane APP levels increased 5-15-fold on platelets treated with GPVI agonists relative to resting platelets. sAPP release increased when PRP was recalcified or exposed to FXa, independent of thrombin, but required ADAM10 activity as sAPP was reduced by 40% upon GI254023X addition. ADAM10 activity did not significantly change upon recalcification, addition of GPVI agonists or FXa, or exposure to shear. CONCLUSION : Activated platelets generate an ADAM10- mediated release of sAPP . FXa may contribute to regulated sAPP generation. SIGNIFICANCE : Therapeutic use of direct oral FX inhibitors as anticoagulants may disrupt normal processing of platelet APP .Dietary patterns and caloric restrictions for management of cardiovascular disease and cancer: A narrative literature Foods and Nutrition Research (FFNR) Laboratory, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 2.

School of Nutritional Sciences and Wellness, University of Arizona, T ucson, AZ, 85721, USA heidi.bochenek@canberra.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Cardiovascular disease and cancers overall are identified as the two most prevalent non-communicable diseases globally. Their prevention and potential reversal (particularly cardiovascular disease risk) was seen effective with the modification of dietary intake that was applied in several different populations. Although the findings from epidemiological studies provide support that adhering to dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet can reduce incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease and some forms of cancer, the mechanistic aspects of disease modulation associated with both diseases can be seen in dietary management. AIM : This review aims to summarise and conceptualize the current understanding relating to healthy dietary patterns, and briefly discuss the opportunities that epigenetic research may bring and how it may assist to further interpret epidemiological and clinical evidence. RESUL TS : Several studies have already explored the potential modes of action of certain nutrients in well- controlled large clinical trials. However, the clinical trials designed to determine the effects of adhering to a particular diet are relatively hard to conduct and these studies are faced with several obstacles particularly in the populations that are identified with a high risk of cardiovascular disease or different cancers. CONCLUSION : The review highlights the potential underlying and shared mechanisms of action and to explore how healthy dietary patterns may modulate the occurrence, initiation, and progression of such diseases.POSTER PRESENTATIONS26 - 29 July 2022 | 59 SIGNIFICANCE : Our current knowledge does not adequately describe the underlying mechanisms associated with disease-modulating dietary patterns. With better understanding we may address the unmet needs surrounding these two significantly prevalent diseases and provide evidence-based disease-preventative strategies. Are dietary patterns becoming more processed? The effects of different dietary patterns on cognition: A review Brittany Harriden1,2, Nathan M. D'Cunha1,2, Isbel1,2, Demosthenes B.

Department of Nutrition-Dietetics, School of Health and Education, Harokopio University, Athens, Greece, 176 71 nenad.naumovski@canberra.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Identifying dietary patterns that promote healthy aging has become increasingly important due to changes in food processing and consumption of processed foods. Recently, the effects of these foods and unhealthy dietary patterns on cognitive function have become more widely recognized. AIM : The aim of this review is to discuss the association between various dietary patterns and cognition in older age, while also highlighting growing evidence that ultra processed food (UPF) may negatively impact healthy aging. METHODS : We have performed a non-systematic literature review searches in Google Scholar electronic database with pre-defined terms relating to UPF, diet, dietary patterns, cognition and ageing. RESUL TS : The most prevalent diets in the literature include the Western, Mediterranean, Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurogenerative Delay (MIND), Japanese, Nordic, and plant- based diets. Based on the findings, higher intakes of fresh fruit and vegetables, wholegrains and oily fish are common components of dietary patterns that are positively associated with better cognitive function. In contrast, the characteristics of a Western style dietary pattern, consisting of high amounts of UPF's, are increasing in many countries even where the staple dietary pattern was identified as healthy (i.e., Japan). CONCLUSION : The consumption of UPF, classified by the NOVA food classification system as industrially manufactured foods containing high levels of starches, vegetable oils, sugar, emulsifiers, and foods additives, has a negative impact on the overall nutritional quality of individual diets.Tele-testing in the ACT: A review of asymptomatic telehealth testing during the ACT COVID-19 lockdown Rose Evans1, Shannon Woodward1, Justine Shuck1, Sarah Martin1,2 4. Canberra Sexual Health Centre, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 5. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 rose.evans@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : During the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) COVID-19 lockdown the Sexual Health Centre (CSHC) limited in-clinic appointments to urgent and symptomatic care. Telehealth consultations were offered for sexually transmitted infection (STI) and blood borne virus (BBV) screening for asymptomatic patients. AIM : Is telehealth an acceptable method for asymptomatic STI and BBV screening? METHODS : Patients who contacted CSHC requesting asymptomatic screening were offered telehealth consultation. A phone consult was conducted and with patient consent a pathology pack was posted to their address with the following components: An instruction sheet on sample collection ACT Pathology Centre locations and opening times ACT Pathology request form Labelled urine jar, throat swab, rectal swab and/or vaginal swab. RESUL TS : Data was collected from 6 September to 2 December 2021. During this time 801 telehealth appointments were provided to asymptomatic patients. Testing was completed by 662 (82.6%). 8.5% of patients tested received a positive result for at least one STI. Post testing 325 patients received a satisfaction survey via SMS, with 91 completing the survey (28% response rate). Responses were positive with 84.6% of participants stating that care received via telehealth was comparable with an in- clinic consultation; 94.3% of respondents would recommend telehealth to others and 91% would use telehealth again. CONCLUSION : Telehealth provided a COVID-19 safe alternative for asymptomatic patients to have STI and BBV screening undertaken during lockdown. SIGNIFICANCE : Telehealth was deemed to be a viable alternative to face-to-face consultations and continues to be offered to asymptomatic patients. This method may be replicated by other sexual health services in the future.POSTER PRESENTATIONS60 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingEvidence informed generalist palliative care content for undergraduate nursing curriculum: An integrative review Sylvia Nilsson1, Jo Gibson1, Catherine Paterson1, Patrick Crookes1 School of Nursing, Midwifery and Public Health, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 Sylvia.nilsson@canberra.edu.au INTRODUCTION / Background: Palliative care is a specialty area within healthcare which undergraduate nursing students report feeling inadequately prepared to provide safe and effective care for individuals at the end of life. AIM /Objectives: To identify existing empirical evidence which has informed generalist palliative care content within international undergraduate nursing curriculums and to synthesize existing generalist palliative care topics. METHOD / Design: An integrative systematic review was conducted and reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. RESUL TS : Of the 1014 papers, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria (n=8 quantitative descriptive, n=5 mixed method). Most studies were published in high income countries with developed economies. Methods used to obtain data include survey, extraction of secondary data and expert consensus- based methods. Generalist palliative care topics were presented as a list reporting frequency taught/discussed/ cited (n=10), competencies (n=2), and modules (n=1). Across all papers there was a large variety of topics identified with differing levels of detail and clear disparities in topics identified globally. Overall, the most frequently mentioned generalist palliative care topics were related to pain and symptom management (n=12), grief loss & bereavement (n=12) and communication (n=11). CONCLUSION s: This review contributes by informing clinicians and educational providers on existing evidence on generalist palliative care curriculum content for undergraduate nursing programs. Recommendations: In existing empirical evidence, there was significant heterogeneity on generalist palliative care topics for the undergraduate nurse. It is recommended for future research to use international expert consensus-based approaches to inform and develop internationally agreed on educational topics to optimise patient care at the point of nurse registration.Factors that contribute to occupational distress among emergency nurses: An review Rebecca Susan Nursing and Midwifery, University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, 2050 2. Emergency Department, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 3. School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 4. SYNERGY Nursing and Midwifery Research Centre, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 rcau5654@uni.sydney.edu.au INTRODUCTION : The recruitment and retention of specialist emergency nurses represents a vital aspect of high-quality health care delivery. Evidence identifies multiple factors contributing to occupational distress in this context which may contribute towards reduced job satisfaction and intention to leave within this specialty field. AIMS /question: This integrative systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence on factors that precede and contribute to the occupational distress among emergency nurses. METHODS : A review of CINAHL, MEDLINE, Psych INFO, Embase, Australian Digital Thesis Network and Google Scholar between 2014 and 2021. The review has been reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Search terms explored the contributions of compassion fatigue, burnout, acute and post-traumatic stress disorder, and secondary traumatic stress/vicarious trauma to occupational distress. RESUL TS : A total of 16 studies were included: (quantitative (7), qualitative (6) and mixed methods (3) studies) underscoring that this is an emergent clinical area of focus. Factors identified that contributed to the development of occupational distress included: 1) individual characteristics of nurses, 2) organisational governance, and 3) the inherent emergency nurse role. CONCLUSION s: Health care organisations should consider timely supportive interventions to address occupational distress. Emergency nurses experience significant exposure to several unique factors which have been found to contribute to occupational distress. SIGNIFICANCE : While sources of occupational distress are identified, the development, and research implementation of timely interventions are needed, particularly as global healthcare organisations experience ongoing difficulties with recruitment and retention of specialist emergency nurses. Strategies are needed to address these shortcomings to positively impact healthcare professionals for a sustainable workforce.POSTER PRESENTATIONS26 - 29 July 2022 | 61 Do we DARE? Improving ano-rectal examination in men who have sex with men living with HIV: A quality improvement initiative Shannon C Woodward1, Hayley A Tyson1,2, Sarah J Martin1,2 1. Canberra Sexual Health Centre, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 2. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 shannon.woodward@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV are at increased risk of anal cancer with annual screening via digital ano-rectal examination (DARE) recommended in those aged 50 and over. AIM : The aim of this study is to determine whether the number of patients with DARE offered and accepted can be improved in line with national recommendations METHODS : Baseline audit was undertaken of records of MSM living with HIV aged 50 and above (n=85) from 1/1/17 - 31/12/18. Data collection included whether DARE was discussed, offered, accepted, or declined. We provided training and altered clinical proformas aiming to increase DARE. Audit cycle 2 was undertaken of eligible MSM (n=86) attending between 1/1/19 - 31/12/20. RESUL TS : In Audit cycle 1 DARE was discussed and offered to 7/85 individuals (8%), and in Audit cycle 2, 55/86 (64%) individuals were offered DARE (p <0.001). DARE was done in 4/85 individuals (4.7%) in Audit cycle 1, and 36 out of 86 individuals (41.8%) in Audit cycle 2 (p< 0,001). For the subset offered DARE in cycle 1, 4/7 (57%) had DARE done and in cycle 2, 36 of the 55 men (65%) offered DARE accepted (2 not significant). One third of patients offered DARE in both cycles declined. CONCLUSION : Clinical audit as part of the quality cycle is essential in evaluating and enhancing care. Following baseline audit, education and proforma changes, DARE increased at our service. SIGNIFICANCE : This study adds to the evidence on DARE for cancer screening in the Australian context and may be replicated in similar services.Clinical signs and symptoms of diaper dermatitis in newborn, infants and young children: A scoping review.

There is a need for a standardised set of related descriptors to enable communication between health care providers about diagnosis and treatment. The study aimed to review the literature for descriptive words to define the clinical signs and symptoms and characteristics including anatomical locations and assessment scales in this population who have been diagnosed with Diaper Dermatitis. METHODS : Systematic review process utilising PRISMA guidelines was conducted using advanced search techniques to analyse the terms from the database thesauri and keywords. Data bases including Ovid MEDLINE and EPub Ahead of Print, in-Process & other Non-Indexed citations, Daily and versions were searched from 1946 to March 18, 2021. Cochrane handbook Searching for and selecting studies were used as a guide and as best practice to conduct the search. RESUL TS : Of the 551 publications originally identified, 55 full text publications were examined and 21 met the inclusion criteria. The wide range of descriptors used in the literature for Diaper Dermatitis supports the need for a clearer approach to report the signs and systems and severity.POSTER PRESENTATIONS62 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingCONCLUSION : These findings point to the gaps in the literature, both in recording signs and symptoms of Diaper Dermatitis and features such as wetness, infection, anatomical location, severity and pain in newborns, infants and young children. There is a need to develop a robust methodological tool to bridge the gap and link a common terminology of signs and symptoms diagnosis of the severity of Diaper Dermatitis. Nurse experiences of triadic partnership when caring for children with long-term conditions and their families: A qualitative systematic review Macey M. Barratt, Kasia K. Bail1, Catherine C. Paterson School of Nursing, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 Macey.barratt@canberra.edu.au INTRODUCTION / Background: Children with long-term conditions often have frequent hospital admissions and varying health care needs. Nurses need to be able to successful partner with children and their families to enhance the attributes of triadic partnership (shared roles and decision making, parental participation, mutual trust and respect, communication and negotiation) to reduce adverse patient health outcomes. How nurses perceive these experiences can inform service design. METHODS : A qualitative meta-aggregation review followed Joanna Briggs Institute meta-aggregation approach. Studies were assessed according to the pre-determined inclusion criteria. Qualitative findings with illustrative participant quotes were extracted from included studies and grouped into categories to inform the synthesised findings. RESUL TS / Findings: A total of 38 studies were included in the meta-aggregation. Five overarching synthesised findings were developed: a) Nurses who partner with parents are able to empower them, b) Nurses perceived threats to their power and at times, c) Nurses recognised that successful triadic partnership needed to be individualised for the patient and family, d) Nurses caring for children with long- term conditions valued adequate training and knowledge to successfully partner with children and their families, and e) Nurses recognised that children should be more involved in the decision-making process. CONCLUSION : Nurses recognised the need for triadic partnership in their nursing practice, but voiced that they needed further knowledge and training about how to successfully partner with children and their families, as well as the long-term conditions they are exposed to. Further research is required as to how nurses subjectively decide how a child is mature and competent enough to be involved in their own health care.Rapid implementation of a multidisciplined specialist nursing in reach team to provide patient centric solutions in vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic: a case study Rebekah Ogilvie1,2,3, Caroline Bain1, Annie McLaughlin1, Jacqualine Monaghan1, Amy Faden1 REaCH Team, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 2. SYNERGY Nursing and Midwifery Centre 3. ACT Health Directorate, Phillip, ACT , 2606 amy.faden@act.gov.au AIM : The aim of this paper is to detail the novel adaptations and rapid implementation of a multidisciplined specialist nursing in reach team to provide patient centric solutions to COVID positive people and close contacts in the ACT . METHOD: The COVID Rapid Evaluation and Care in the Home (REaCH) team began as an initial developing social housing outbreak response, evolving as the needs of the community emerged. Due to known vulnerability within these settings, a specialist team of primary health (PH), mental health (MH) and alcohol and other drug (AOD) nurses was established to meet the needs of this community and to assist in spread containment through in-reach supported healthcare. RESUL TS : Between 22 August and 7 December 2021, 166 (106/60) individuals were reviewed by the COVID REaCH Team in social housing estates and formal quarantine facilities. Of these, 65 individuals were treated for PH issues, 37 for AOD issues, 34 for MH issues and 33 for a combination of issues. There were 1003 (630/373) occasions of service, 15 occasions where the individual was transferred to ED for assessment, and 4 admissions to hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a specialist multidisciplinary nursing service for vulnerable populations affected by COVID-19 exemplify the successful adaptation of the traditional primary and urgent healthcare. Working together with GPs, acute hospital, community services, and nongovernment organisations, the REaCH team successfully reduced Emergency Department (ED) presentations, hospital admissions, and prevented deterioration within quarantined home and formal settings. Further research is required to examine the impact of innovative applications of nurse-led multi-specialist models of care in the vulnerable communities.POSTER PRESENTATIONS26 - 29 July 2022 | 63 Effect of intrathecal morphine on systemic opioids administration in patients Peter Scott2, Katie McCloy3, Kimberly Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 2. Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Centenary Hospital for Women and Children, Garran, ACT , 2605 3. Department of Anaesthesiology, Canberra Health Services, Garran, Act, 2605 4. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS), Canberra Health Services, ACT is opioid-sparing compared to systemic opioids. These benefits see it recommended as an analgesic technique in Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Guidelines and incorporated into a local Canberra Hospital protocol for women undergoing hysterectomy. AIMS : The primary aim is to analyse the correlation between ITM and systemic opioids administered intraoperatively and postoperatively in patients undergoing hysterectomy as part of the ERAS program at Canberra Hospital. METHODS : Retrospective data from 82 patients who underwent hysterectomy between February 2021 to December 2021 were analysed. The ANZCA opioid dose equivalent calculator was used to convert systemic opioids to an oral morphine equivalent dose. We equate IV 30mg : 50 patients received ITM and had a lower mean oral morphine equivalents of 4.26mg(SD 9.39) compared to 19.78mg(SD18.29) in 32 patients who received general anaesthesia (GA) with systemic opioids intraoperatively. The median of the ITM group and GA group is 0mg and 30mg respectively. 72% of patients who had ITM did not receive systemic opioids post-operatively in post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU). The mean systemic opioids administered in PACU were 6.7mg and 23.9mg in the ITM and GA groups respectively. CONCLUSION : Patients who received neuraxial anaesthesia had a larger opioid-sparing effect and required less systemic opioids during their admission compared to patients receiving GA and systemic opioids. SIGNIFICANCE : A multimodal analgesia technique incorporating neuraxial anaesthesia with ITM reduces systemic opioid requirements in patients undergoing hysterectomy. This opioid-sparing effect may reduce unpleasant opioid side effects such as constipation which delay recovery.A retrospective review of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with radiation \u00b1 concurrent chemotherapy at The Canberra Hospital Emma L S Carnuccio1, Andrew Lee2, Nicole Gordard2 1. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 2. Department of Medical Oncology, The Canberra Hospital, Garran, ACT , 2605 emma.carnuccio@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas are the 7th leading cause of cancer in Australia. Despite presenting as locoregionally advanced disease, oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) are typically managed with curative intent for which radiation \u00b1 chemotherapy is standard treatment. AIM : To examine the success of application of standard radiation \u00b1 chemotherapy treatments in patients with OPSCC treated at The Canberra Hospital and benchmark this against the literature. METHODS : Data of patients treated for OPSCC between January 2015-December 2019 was extracted from oncology databases and recorded. A Cox-proportional hazards model was applied for univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors on overall and disease-free survival. The Kaplan-Meier method, and log-rank tests were also used for survival analysis. RESUL TS : Of 133 patients enrolled, 97 (72.9%) received combined chemoradiotherapy which was associated with a significantly reduced risk of death (HR= .244; p= .001) and disease recurrence (HR= .280; p= .002). Treatment compliance was acceptable with 95.5% of patients completing prescribed radiation, and 85.4% that received concurrent cisplatin, receiving a cumulative dose of at least 200mg/m2. Median overall survival was 2.3 years. Those with human papilloma virus positive tumours (73.7%) were associated with a significantly reduced risk of death (HR= .246; p= .002) and disease recurrence (HR= .311; p< .001). CONCLUSION : The delivery of radiation \u00b1 chemotherapy and treatment outcomes for OPSCC were acceptable and similar to the literature. SIGNIFICANCE : Our results provide valuable insight into the successful application of radiotherapy \u00b1 chemotherapy for OPSCC in our diverse patient population at The Canberra Hospital, and reassurance they are consistent with other institutions.POSTER PRESENTATIONS64 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingTreating refractory sarcoidosis with TNF-inhibitor therapy: Experience from The Canberra Hospital Sarcoidosis Clinic cohort Yi Tong Vincent Aw1,2, Jessica of Medicine, The Canberra Hospital, Garran, ACT , 2605 2. Department of Immunology, The Canberra Hospital, Garran, ACT , 2605 3. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 4. Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 5. Division of Surgery, The Canberra Hospital, Garran, ACT , 2605 6. The Canberra Hospital, Garran, INTRODUCTION : Sarcoidosis is an granulomatous disease that is self-remitting in most patients. 10-30% of patients require immunomodulatory treatment to halt progression, while a subset have refractory sarcoidosis with inadequate response to second-line therapies. Previous studies have shown efficacy of Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFI) for improving pulmonary function, symptoms and disease biomarkers in refractory sarcoidosis. The Canberra Hospital Sarcoidosis Clinic (TCHSC) manages predominantly extra-pulmonary sarcoidosis patients and have been using TNFI for refractory sarcoidosis over the last decade. AIMS : We aimed to describe TNFI efficacy from TCHSC experience and identify clinical variables predicting TNFI response. METHODS : We conducted a retrospective analysis of 89 TCHSC patients active in May 2021. Univariate logistic regression and Fisher's exact tests were performed on variables for TNFI and non-TNFI groups. T-tests were performed for rapid TNFI-response (RTR) and limited TNFI- response (L TR) groups. RESUL TS : Of 9 patients on TNFI, 67% had RTR- 3 had rapid sustained response; 3 had rapid but non-sustained response. 33% had L TR- 2 had delayed response; 1 had no response. There was no statistical significance between RTR and L TR groups for baseline C-Reactive Protein, Angiotensin- Converting Enzyme, Immunoglobulin A and Immunoglobulin M. Trend toward significance was observed for higher Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (p=0.054) and Immunoglobulin G (p=0.098) in TNFI groups. CONCLUSIONS: TNFI are effective for sarcoidosis but with heterogeneous responses. Elevated IgG and ESR may predict RTR. SIGNIFICANCE : This observational study describes local experience with TNFI for refractory sarcoidosis and is hypothesis-generating for future studies evaluating predictive variables for TNFI response. Bronchiolitis in Canberra Hospital ED during the COVID-19 pandemic Drew Richardson1, Ellen Brown1, Karina Kennedy2 1. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 2. ACT Pathology, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 drew.richardson@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : The COVID-19 pandemic in the Australian Capital Territory was associated with two major lockdowns and other changes in population mobility which could impact the transmissibility of respiratory illness. AIM : To describe changes in ED bronchiolitis diagnoses during the pandemic in Canberra Hospital. METHODS : Prospective descriptive study of all patients given the clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis in 2020 and 2021 in the Canberra Hospital with historical controls from 2017-2019. Each year was divided into consecutive four 10-week and one 12-week periods, and weekly numbers compared using the t-test (unequal variance). RESUL TS : Control periods showed a regular early winter peak (weeks 21-30) averaging 23.5 weekly cases compared to 5.1 in weeks 1-10. In 2020, this peak was absent, averaging 2.8 per week (P<0.0001), but there was an unexpected peak at the end of the year (weeks 41-52), averaging 18.5 weekly (peak of 33) compared to 7.2 controls, extending into early 2021. The winter peak in 2021 was not statistically different over the 10-week period, but individual week analysis showed a late peak which terminated just after lockdown started. During the last 12 weeks of 2021, average weekly diagnoses were the lowest ever at 2.2 (P<0.0001). Microbiological data supported the patterns with corresponding peaks and troughs of Respiratory Syncytial Virus diagnoses on viral swabs. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a marked decrease in bronchiolitis during and immediately after lockdown periods, and one unexpected summer peak. SIGNIFICANCE : Community precautions against respiratory transmission for COVID-19 have a significant effect on viral prevalence and ED workload.POSTER PRESENTATIONS26 - 29 July 2022 | 65 Improved outcomes for patients with rib fractures since the INTRODUCTION of a chest injury pathway Scott Jones1,2, Andrew Deacon1,3, Shelley Wang1, Frank Van Haren1,4 1. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT 2601 2. Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 3. Department of Anaesthesia, The Canberra Hospital, Garran, 2605 4. St George Hospital, Kogarah, NSW, 2217 scott.jones@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Rib fractures are common injuries and occur in up to 40% of patients that experience significant blunt thoracic trauma and are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Several jurisdictions have implemented multidisciplinary chest injury pathways (ChIP) but data on their effectiveness remains lacking. In February 2019 a ChIP was introduced at Canberra Hospital and comprised of 4 main components: physiotherapy, non- steroidal flow nasal prong (HFNP) oxygen. AIMS : We performed a retrospective observational study of 507 patients, 223 pre-ChIP and 284 post-ChIP from the year pre and post pathway implementation to compare the incidence of pneumonia, ICU admission, MET calls, mortality and hospital length of stay. RESUL TS : We found a greater proportion of the post-ChIP group received more components of ChIP care, the largest differences being the provision of thoracic wall analgesia (29% vs 9%) and NSAIDs (76% vs 55%). ChIP was also associated with an appreciable reduction in the rates of pneumonia, ICU admission, MET calls and death. Hospital length of stay also significantly decreased for more severe injuries eg, bilateral rib fractures (15 days vs 27 days; p < 0.05), flail chest (13 vs 27 days; p < 0.05), pneumothorax (13 vs 24 days; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION s: Taken together, outcomes for patients following thoracic trauma have improved dramatically post the introduction of ChIP . SIGNIFICANCE : This study adds to the emerging evidence that clinical pathways for chest injury are effective in the management of trauma patients with rib fractures.A phase I proof of concept study evaluating the addition of an LSD1 inhibitor to nab-paclitaxel in advanced Siew Lim3, Abel Y.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety of combination, nab-paclitaxel and phenelzine (irreversible LSD1 inhibitor) in patients with metastatic breast cancer (mBC). METHODS : Eligible patients were treated with nab-paclitaxel (100mg/m2) weekly for 3 weeks with one week break in a 28-day cycle. Dose escalation of phenelzine (45mg to 90mg) followed the Cumulative Cohort Design and phenelzine treatment commenced from day 2 of first cycle. RESUL TS : Eleven patients were screened and 8 were eligible. The Optimum Biological Dose was established at 60mg of phenelzine in combination with nab-paclitaxel and considered as the recommended phase 2 dose. Most (95%) of adverse events were grade 1/2 with two grade 3 events (diarrhea and neutropenia) with no unexpected toxicity/deaths. Common toxicities were fatigue (n=4,50%), dizziness (n=6,75%), neutropenia (n=3,37.5%), POSTER | Meetingneuropathy (n=3,37.5%), diarrhea (n=2,25%), and hallucination (n=2,25%). Median follow up was 113 weeks. All patients showed disease progression on trial with 4 alive at the time of data cut off, including one patient with triple negative mBC. Median progression-free survival was 34 weeks. Significant inhibition of LSD1 and suppression of mesenchymal markers in circulating tumour cells were noted. CONCLUSION /SIGNIFICANCE : Phenelzine in combination with nab-paclitaxel was well tolerated, without any unexpected toxicities in patients with mBC and demonstrated evidence of antitumour activity. This proof-of- concept study showed in-vivo inhibition of LSD1 suppressed mesenchymal markers, which are known to facilitate generation of cancer stem cells with metastatic potential. Alcohol and methamphetamine- related presentations in Australasia 2018-2021 Drew Richardson1, Daniel Fatovich2, Diana Egerton-Warburton3 1. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 2. University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, 6009 3. Monash University, Clayton, Vic., 3800 drew.richardson@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine funds voluntary \"snapshot\" point prevalence studies of the contribution of alcohol-related and methamphetamine-related presentations at 02:00 local time on the Saturday before Christmas. AIM : To describe changes in occupancy and drug-related presentations 2018-2021. METHODS : Analysis of responses from hospitals answering all of the last 4 \"snapshot\" binational studies. Results were analysed by jurisdiction. RESUL TS 78/152 eligible hospitals answered all studies (51%, 95%CI 42-58). Mean ED Occupancy rose non- significantly in the 60 Australian EDs from 36.9 in 2020 to 37.9 in 2021, some 23% growth since 30.9 in 2018 (P=0.003, paired t-test). There were no statistically significant changes in mean total occupancy in the 17 reporting New Zealand hospitals, but a decrease in Observation Unit patients from 3.65 in 2020 to 1.41 in 2021 (P=0.03). The proportion of alcohol-related cases rose non-significantly in from 10.6% (95%CI 9.4-12.0) in 2020 to 12.1% (10.8-13.6) in 2021, but the proportion in New Zealand fell from 15.4% (12.4-19.0) to 11.7% (8.7-15.3) to no longer be significantly different from Australia. Methamphetamine-related cases remained consistent at 2.0% (1.5-2.7) in Australia and 0.76% (0.2-2.4) in New Zealand, with only the jurisdiction of Western Australia showing a consistent decrease.CONCLUSION s: Alcohol-related presentations have remained steady in Australia and decreased slightly in New Zealand and consistently comprise a much greater issue than Methamphetamine in EDs. SIGNIFICANCE : The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a marked rise in ED occupancy in Australia whilst alcohol and drug presentations remained unchanged. Positive patient experiences and satisfaction with a Multidisciplinary model Advanced Practice Nurse and Physiotherapist Rheumatology Category Clinics Carol McCrum, carol.mccrum@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Category 3 Rheumatology referrals are non-inflammatory or medically non-urgent, and lower priority referrals. Category 3 assessments are traditionally undertaken by doctors, however service pressures escalated by COVID19 result in long wait times. A Reboot-funded initiative introduced Multidisciplinary (MDT) Advanced Practice Nurse and Physiotherapist Category 3 Triage clinics under Rheumatologist supervision. AIM /Objective: To evaluate patient experiences and satisfaction with an MDT model Category 3 Triage clinics utilising Advanced Practice Nurse and Physiotherapist expertise. METHOD : Clinic attendees were invited to complete an anonymous 10-item questionnaire following appointments via QR-code or paper versions. Items included: Views and concerns listened to; Individual needs met; Feeling cared for; Decision involvement; Being informed; Quality of treatment and care; Knowledge support; and Service recommendation. Ratings used 5-point Likert scales: Always-Never, Very Good- Very Poor or Yes/No as appropriate. Free-text feedback was sought on improvement suggestions and what was well done. RESUL TS : Sixty-nine questionnaires (81% of attendees) have been received. Experiences have been rated highly positive ('Always' and 'Very good') in over 90% of responses and 100% would recommend the service. Improvement suggestions mostly offered praise (24/31) including high satisfaction and continuing the service. Other themes included directions/ signage/parking (4) and waiting times (1). Responses to what was well done included: Helping access; Valued knowledge, explanations, and clinical advice; Being listened to, respected, and reassured; Kind, thorough and professional service.POSTER PRESENTATIONS26 - 29 July 2022 | 67 CONCLUSION : Patient experiences and satisfaction with Rheumatology Advanced Practitioner triage clinics were highly positive and expressed strong support for continuation. SIGNIFICANCE : Utilising Advanced Practice Nurse and Physiotherapist expertise to triage Category 3 Rheumatology referrals is considered acceptable and positive. Antiemetic prophylaxis and post- operative nausea and vomiting in patients hysterectomy Amery Ng1, Peter Scott2, Katie McCloy3, Kimberly Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 2. Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Centenary Hospital for Women and Children, Garran, ACT , 2605 3. Department of Anaesthesiology, Canberra Health Services, Garran, Act, 2605 4. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS), Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 amery.ng@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common adverse effect and may prolong hospital admission. Patients undergoing hysterectomy are at high risk and prophylactic medications decrease the incidence. A local Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) clinical pathway recommends at least two prophylactic antiemetics be administered intraoperatively. AIMS : The primary aim is to assess the compliance of administering two prophylactic antiemetics intraoperatively as recommended. The secondary aims are to assess the incidence of PONV and rescue antiemetics administered, and the duration of post-anaesthetic care unit (PACU) stay longer than two hours. METHODS : Retrospective data on 84 patients were obtained from February 2021 to December 2021. The number of prophylactic antiemetics administered was compared to the incidence of PONV based on antiemetics administered on the PACU medication chart. RESUL TS : 73% of patients received at least 2 prophylactic antiemetics and had lower incidence of PONV at 24% compared to 39% in patients who had 1 prophylactic antiemetic. The average length of PACU stay was 2.12hours and 1.87hours in patients who received one prophylactic antiemetic compared to two prophylactic antiemetics respectively. 29% of patients with PONV required more than 2 rescue antiemetics, where 71% of these patients had a PACU stay longer than 2 hours. CONCLUSION : Administration of at least 2 prophylactic antiemetics in patients undergoing hysterectomy showed a decrease in PONV incidence. Patients requiring more rescue antiemetics were correlated to a longer length of PACU stay. SIGNIFICANCE : PONV is an unpleasant adverse effect that may increase complications and prolonged hospital stay. Reduction in PONV improves recovery and potentially reduces the length of hospital stay. Clinical audit of the evaluation of paediatric abdominal pain in The Canberra Hospital Emergency Department Syamand Hasam1, Prince Sebastian1, Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 2. The Canberra Hospital, Garran, ACT , 2605 u6903431@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Paediatric abdominal pain is a common presenting complaint in the emergency setting, with acute appendicitis being the most common surgical cause of abdominal pain in children. The performance of The Canberra Hospital Emergency Department (TCH-ED) in evaluating this presentation has not been fully investigated. AIM : This is a clinical audit project aiming to evaluate TCH- ED performance in the evaluation of abdominal pain, to establish a baseline for future comparison. METHODS : We retrospectively identified a cohort of 100 children aged 5-15 who presented to TCH-ED with abdominal pain from September November 2019. We extracted times to review by a doctor, discharge from the department, imaging, investigations and surgical review for each patient. Patient data were de-identified before analysis. RESUL TS : Out of 100 children presenting with abdominal pain, 82 were discharged without admission, 8 were admitted to a ward, 4 were sent to the short-stay unit, and 6 left the department before formal discharge. The median time to review by a doctor was 103 minutes. The median time to discharge was 239 minutes. 16 patients required imaging, and the median time to imaging was 811 minutes. 9 patients required surgical review, and the median time to surgical review was 259 minutes. CONCLUSION : The evaluation of abdominal pain in children relies predominantly on clinical findings, because imaging, investigations and surgical review involve a significant time delay. SIGNIFICANCE : We have established a baseline for TCH ED performance in evaluating paediatric abdominal pain. The implementation of a validated formal decision-making tool may potentially streamline the process and improve the department's performance.POSTER PRESENTATIONS68 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingThe rise of heated humidified high flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in NSW and ACT from 2007 to 2020 in preterm babies (PBs) <28 weeks gestational age (GA) D.

NSW & ACT (NICUS), St Leonards, NSW, 2065 David.Todd@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Over the past decade there has been an increased usage of HHHFNC in PBs together with an associated increase in Chronic Lung Disease (CLD). AIMS : To compare the use of HHHFNC and CPAP in NSW and the ACT over a 13year period in PBs<28 wks GA and assess their outcomes. METHOD : This study compared prospectively collected data on surviving PBs<28 wks GA from 2007 to 2020 from the NICUS database. Comparisons were undertaken between those who did and did not receive HHHFNC and CPAP over the 13year period. Data were analysed using Fishers Exact Test (FET). RESUL TS : There were 3097/3765(82.3%) PBs<28 wks GA who survived during this period while this ranged from 207/256(80.9%) to 219/255(82.5%) from 2007 to 2020 respectively (FETp=0.15). During this period PBs on CPAP at 36 wks post conceptual age (PCA) has significantly increased from 45/207(21.7%) to 68/219(31.3%) respectively (FETp=0.037), while HHHFNC use at 36 wks PCA increased from 6/207(2.9%) to 108/219(49.3%) respectively (FETp<0.0001). However, PBs requiring oxygen at 36 wks PCA has reduced from 21/207(10.1%) to 8/219(3.7%) respectively (FETp=0.011). Although, the PCA at discharge has extended by 1 week over this period from a median of 39 wks PCA in 2007 to 40 wks PCA in 2020. CONCLUSION : There has been a significant increase and prolonged use HHHFNC together with a prolonged use of CPAP from 2007 to 2020 in NSW and the ACT in PB's<28 wks GA. SIGNIFICANCE : This has resulted in a prolonged admission time but less PBs in oxygen at 36 wks PCA.Decreasing ED and inpatient COVID-19 demand with rising vaccination coverage William Zhou1, Drew Richardson1, 2, Ian Marr,2 1. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 2. Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 william.zhou@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) experienced a COVID-19 Delta Strain outbreak Aug-Nov 2021 with 2004 cases (11 deaths). This occurred during a major vaccination drive which saw fully vaccinated rates rise from 26% to 98% during the outbreak as lockdown measures eased. AIMS/QUESTIONS: This study aimed to describe the influence of COVID-19 vaccination on the rates of Emergency Department (ED) visits and hospital admissions in this highly vaccinated jurisdiction. METHODS : Retrospective cohort study of ACT cases diagnosed in four-consecutive four-week periods from 9-Aug. ED visits were defined as those who made ED visits while infectious. Admissions defined as admissions to the ward for COVID-19 symptoms who spent at least one night in hospital. RESUL TS : Presentation rates to ED were 9.18% for the period of 9-Aug, 13.5% for 4-October and 2.35% for 1-Nov. From 6-Sep the rate of each period was significantly less than the last (p<0.05). The admission rate was 6.45% for 9-Aug, 4.32% for 4-Oct a fully-vaccinated-rates of 35.3%, 56.9% 81.1% and 96.5%. The rate for 4-Oct was borderline significantly lower than 6-Sep (p=0.051) while the rate for 1-Nov was significantly lower than the last (p< 0.05). There was no significant change in admission rate for unvaccinated adults across the 4 periods (p>0.05). Median LOS was constant at 5 days for 9-Aug, 5-Sep, 4-Oct with insufficient data for 1-Nov. CONCLUSION : The rate of ED visits and admissions decreased as vaccinations increased in consecutive time periods during the outbreak with no observed difference in LOS.POSTER PRESENTATIONS26 - 29 July 2022 | 69 The workload of paediatric patients for Omicron on the Emergency Department of a tertiary referral hospital William Zhou1, Drew Richardson1, 2, Ian Marr2 1. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 2. Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 william.zhou@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) with a population of 431000 serviced by 2 Emergency Departments (EDs), experienced a COVID-19 outbreak of the Omicron strain with 26136 cases (7 deaths). AIMS /Question: With the literature raising concern of Omicron being more severe in children, this study aimed to describe the workload of paediatric patients positive for Omicron on the Emergency Department of a tertiary referral hospital. METHOD : Retrospective cohort study of ACT cases diagnosed during the Omicron outbreak (13-Dec - 23-Jan 2022) who visited The Canberra Hospital, a tertiary referral centre. ED visits were defined as patients with one or more ED visits between 1 day before a positive test and clinically cleared date regardless of state of residence, admissions as those admitted while infectious. Wilson score intervals were used to approximate 95% confidence intervals. RESUL TS : 1589 paediatric patients made 1776 presentations to ED during the study period. Of these, 70 patients (4.41%, 95% CI 3.50-5.53) were positive for COVID-19, making 73 presentations (4.11%, 95% CI 3.28- 5.14) and resulting in 28 admissions. 21.7% (95% CI 17.6-26.4) of all ED presentations positive with COVID-19 were paediatric. 16% of all paediatric ED presentations (n=46) with diagnoses commonly associated with COVID-19, were positive. 15 admissions had the primary diagnosis of \"COVID-19\" with a median LOS of 1 night and 4 were surgical admissions with median LOS of 0.5 nights. CONCLUSIONS: Paediatric patients represented a substantial proportion of ED presentations while infectious with the Omicron strain of COVID-19.Predictors of acceptance and outcome for non-invasive therapy in PAP acclimatisation clinic Anurag Arora, Carol Huang, Rosianna Wee Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, The Canberra Hospital, Garran, ACT , 2605 anurag.arora@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is one of the mainstays in management of acute and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. NIV predictors of success have been studied in acute settings, but little is known about predictors of NIV acceptance for long-term use. AIM/OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study is to identify the predictors of NIV acceptance. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS : This study is a retrospective consecutive case series analysis of registry data collected from patients attending the Canberra Hospital Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) Acclimatisation Clinic. Data on patient demographics, polysomnography (PSG) results, NIV device download and NIV acceptance were collected. Analysis of variance and chi-square were used to assess associations between clinical characteristics and NIV acceptance. RESUL TS : 89 patients were eligible for inclusion. 85% of patients (76/89) accepted NIV with median period of 35 days. The most common indication for long-term NIV in this cohort is obesity hypoventilation syndrome or obstructive sleep apnoea. 13% (10/76) required more than 8 weeks of acclimatisation prior to accepting NIV. Higher EPAP at NIV commencement, peak transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO2) 46-64mmHg during PSG, PAP na\u00efve, and higher NIV usage at 2 weeks are associated with NIV acceptance. Prolonged NIV acclimatisation is associated with lower sleep latency, lower oxygen saturation nadir, higher TcCO2 prior to sleep onset, higher peak TcCO2 on PSG as well as higher mask leak and female gender. CONCLUSION : NIV acceptance rate is high in our cohort, but some patients require a longer acclimatisation phase despite intensive follow-up. The need for prolonged acclimatisation appears to be associated with severe sleep-disordered breathing as well as increased mask leak.POSTER PRESENTATIONS70 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingThe introduction of Sotrovimab, a SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody during the outbreak Thomas McNeill2, Ashwin Swaminathan1,2, Drew Richardson1,2, Ian Marr2 1. ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 2. Canberra Health Services, Garran, 2605 : antibody that neutralises SARS-CoV-2. Early randomised control trials demonstrated a reduction in the progression of Covid-19 in unvaccinated patients with mild-moderate disease. The TGA granted provisional approval of Sotrovimab in August-2021 and select patients in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) began to receive the drug. AIMS : This study aimed to describe the rollout of Sotrovimab in the ACT during the delta outbreak of Covid-19; in the context of a vaccination drive. METHODS : Retrospective cohort study of patients in the ACT receiving Sotrovimab from 09-August - 12-December 2021. Pharmacy dispensing data and datasets were utilised and verified with EMR. RESUL TS : 133 doses of Sotrovimab were administered. The rollout can be described by 2 time periods - early-Delta & late-Delta. The early Delta wave (9-August to 3-October) saw 61 doses administered to mostly under-vaccinated patients (62%-unvaccinated). Clinicians reporting high uptake to those offered therapy. This corresponded with low vaccination coverage (47% 16+ fully-vaccinated) across the ACT. The late Delta wave (4-October to 12-December) was characterised by high vaccination coverage (91% fully vaccinated) and a smaller population of unvaccinated patients (47%) given Sotrovimab (n=72). Clinicians reported lower uptake likely confounded by patients opting out in a similar manner to their choice not to be vaccinated Selection of candidates was guided by National COVID-19 Taskforce guidelines which encompassed a range of risk factors for disease progression. Obesity (n=79), advanced age (n=28), COPD (n=20) and diabetes (n=19) were the most common comorbidities justified. CONCLUSION : Sotrovimab was successfully introduced in the ACT . Its role and recipients changed throughout the pandemic.Assessing participation and outcomes for patients attending the Canberra Obesity Management Service Ryan T Burns1, Elise M Firman1,2, Hsin-Chia Carol Huang1,3,4 1. Obesity Management Service, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 2. Gold Coast Public Health Unit, Queensland Health, Carrara, QLD, 4211 3. Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 4. College of Health and Medicine, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 ryan.burns@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : In response to the growing obesity epidemic in Australia, specialised obesity services have been proposed as a potential public health strategy. The Canberra Obesity Management Service (COMS) is the only dedicated public obesity service in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and offers a comprehensive program based on an individualised case management and chronic disease care model. AIMS /Question: To evaluate COMS with regards to patient demographics and clinical outcomes. METHODS : A retrospective chart review was carried out on patients attending initial assessment at COMS between July 2018 - June 2019. Existing patients attending follow- up reviews were excluded. Patient data collected on standardised templates were recorded, de-identified and underwent descriptive analyses. RESUL TS : 234 patients with a mean age of 45.6 (SD \u00b1 13.9) and a female majority (72.2%) were analysed. Patients who did not attend COMS beyond initial review (n = 19) had a higher mean BMI (53.4 \u00b1 11.2kg/m2) than those who did (n = 215, 49.8 \u00b1 8.3kg/m2). 165 patients attended follow-up medical appointments and 41.2% experienced weight loss of 5% (68/165), with 27.9% losing 10% (46/165). Among interventions, sleeve gastrectomy was associated with the largest mean weight reduction (15.6% weight loss at 6 months [n = 18]). CONCLUSION : The provision of a multidisciplinary obesity service is an effective means of managing obesity from both clinical and public health perspectives, and access to bariatric surgery is a significant factor in such settings. SIGNIFICANCE : This study highlights the effectiveness of COMS as a comprehensive obesity service and the potential benefits of improving patient access to such services in the future.POSTER PRESENTATIONS26 - 29 July 2022 | 71 Assessing stakeholder perceptions of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) using text mining Yu Zhang, Satish Chand, Hang Thanh Bui School of Business, UNSW Canberra, Canberra, ACT , 2612 m.yuzhang@unsw.edu.au INTRODUCTION : The Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) has four significant stakeholders: the participants who are the clients of the scheme; the service-providers who serve the clients; the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) that intermediates between the above-mentioned; and the taxpayers who fund the scheme. AIM : There is misalignment in the perceptions of these stakeholders on the NDIS, yet no literature has assessed the extent of such misalignment. This research addresses this gap by measuring the differences between the perceptions of different stakeholders. METHODS : Text data since early 2020 has been collated from Facebook. There were 810 posts published by the NDIS Facebook account that in turn solicited a further 4,398 comments and replies from the public. An extensive text analysis is conducted on these responses, and a rule-based sentiment mining model is proposed to identify stakeholders expressing views on specific services of the NDIS. RESUL TS : Our analysis reveals three key results: 1) there is a large gulf across stakeholders in their perceptions of the NDIS implementation; 2) there are more negative comments towards posts introducing new policies or campaign activities compared to those sharing individual stories; and 3) there is polarisation in views of the NDIS with regards to a core set of issues. Specifically, issues surrounding \"choice and control\" , \"independent assessment\" , \"access\" and \"agency\" have surfaced frequently amongst the participants but less so within the NDIA. CONCLUSION : The analysis measures the difference between the perceptions of the NDIA and participants. SIGNIFICANCE : It is of value to sharing perceptions amongst the multiple stakeholders on the efficacy of the NDIS.Trends in weight status, 2007- 2021: Findings from ACT multi-year population health surveys Sommer Sherwood, Pramod Adhikari, Warren Holroyd1, Chalker ACT Health Directorate, Phillip, ACT , 2606 healthsurvey@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Body weight that is higher than what is considered healthy for a given height is described as overweight or obesity. Research has shown that people who are overweight or obese are at increased risk for many serious diseases and health conditions. These include hypertension, Type 2 Diabetes, heart diseases and osteoarthritis. AIM : In this study, trends in weight status, based on Body Mass Index (BMI) categorisation, between 2007 and 2021 were investigated in an ACT sample using routinely collected population health survey data. METHOD : The analyses are based on a multi-year dataset comprising 22,657 participants aged 18 years and over (44.3% males) who participated in the ACT General Health Survey between 2007 and 2021. Respondents were asked to self-report their height and weight. RESUL TS : Between 2007 and 2021, average height has remained relatively stable while there has been an increase in average weight over the same period. Trends in BMI categorisation varied, with those in the healthy weight category declining; those in the overweight category generally declining between 2007 and 2014, then trending upwards between 2015 and 2021; and those categorised as obese also trending up. CONCLUSION : Self-reported data on height and weight show that overweight and obesity are increasing over time, but the increase is not statistically significant. The routine collection of BMI can be a powerful indicator to monitor risk factors in the population as well as a program evaluation tool. SIGNIFICANCE : There are many health programs that aim to reduce unhealthy weight. The monitoring of BMI over time will help inform the impact of these programs.POSTER PRESENTATIONS72 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingFuture risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 mellitus in adults experiencing intimate partner violence - systematic review meta-analysis Samarawickrema1 1.

Discipline of Occupational Therapy, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 Indira.Samarawickrema@canberra.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Intimate partner violence leads to physical and mental health issues for the victim. There is a gap in the evidence in the cardiometabolic risk in the adults experiencing intimate partner violence. AIM : We aim to quantify the future risk of coronary heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, and type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults who have experienced intimate partner violence with a systematic review and a meta-analysis. METHODS : The review question is 'what are the risk estimates for coronary heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, and type 2 diabetes mellitus among adults who experienced intimate partner violence compared to those who never experienced intimate partner violence?' Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines guides the protocol which will be registered at PROSPERO. We will search for full-text peer-reviewed cohort, and observational studies, trials among adults published from 1990 to 31 May 2022 in CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, SAGE Journals and ScienceDirect databases using the The search results will be screened using the inclusion and exclusion criteria, reviewed, quality appraised and data extracted independently by two reviewers in Covidence software. A third reviewer will resolve any disagreements. The quality appraisal tools will be Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and ROB-2. Random effects forest plots will calculate the risk estimates in Stata 17.1. We will explore the confounding variables and bias from heterogeneity and publication bias of the studies. The risk estimates will inform future secondary prevention among those experiencing intimate partner violence.Staff barriers to the introduction of extended scope roles for pharmacy support staff Monica Rayson Pharmacy Department, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 monica.rayson@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : There is strong evidence for extending the scope of practice of trained pharmacy technicians (PTs) to perform the final accuracy check of dispensed medicines. Research has consistently found that Pharmacy Accuracy Checking Technicians (PACTs) are more accurate than pharmacists and the use of PACTs increases the time available for pharmacists to provide direct patient care and cognitive services. Internationally, PACTs have been used for decades. In Australia, many barriers have been proposed that prohibit the implementation of extended scope PACT roles. AIM : To explore the perceptions of pharmacy staff towards implementing extended scope roles, such as PACTs, for Pharmacy Technicians. METHODS : Separate questionnaires were circulated to pharmacists and PTs employed at Canberra Health Services pharmacies. The questionnaires focussed on two domains:- staff support for extended scope roles, and -perceived barriers. Statistical and thematic analysis of the responses was completed. RESUL TS : The questionnaire was completed by 32 of 59 (54.2%) of Pharmacists and 17 of 25 (68%) of PTs. 90% of Pharmacists supported PTs working in extended scope roles, such as PACTs. The main barriers identified by Pharmacists were patient safety, professional liability, scope creep, workforce resourcing, and training. 88% of PT respondents agreed that they would like to work in an extended scope role, such as PACT . The most common barriers identified by PTs were lack of support and lack of qualification/experience CONCLUSION : There is strong staff support for extended scope PT roles, although several barriers have been identified for implementing these roles. SIGNIFICANCE : Provides insight into the perceived barriers for introducing extended scope roles for pharmacy support staff. POSTER PRESENTATIONS26 - 29 July 2022 | 73 What are the unmet supportive care needs of people affected by cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic: An integrative review Helen Legge1, Phil Kavanagh1, Kellie Toohey1,2, Catherine Paterson1,2,3 1. Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 2. Prehabilitation, Activity, Cancer, Exercise and Survivorship (PACES) Research Group, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 3. Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, UK, AB107QB u3189687@uni.canberra.edu.au BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on holistic person-centred supportive care needs among people affected by cancer. Understanding patients' needs is important to informed future research and interventions to optimise quality of life and rehabilitation. AIM : To critically synthesis evidence in relation to the experiences of unmet supportive care needs of those living with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS : An integrative systematic review followed a registered priori protocol and has been reported according to the PRISMA Guidelines. Three electronic databases were searched using key words. All qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies were included irrespective of research design according to a pre-determined eligibility criterion. Studies reporting supportive care needs of people affected by cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic were included irrespective of age, cancer type, stage, or treatment. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted in parallel, and a narrative synthesis conducted. RESUL TS : 19 publications were included. Individuals affected by cancer reported a range of physical, psychological, social and health system unmet needs during the global pandemic. There was fear of the unknown of the long-term impact that the pandemic would have on cancer treatment outcomes, care follow-up, clinical service delays, and the overall impact that this would have on them in the future. CONCLUSION : Many domains of unmet supportive care needs were intertwined and complex. Future research is urgently needed to explore the experiences among those living with cancer in the Australia context. SIGNIFICANCE : Clinicians are encouraged to use these findings to identify the individual person-centred needs to optimise recovery in clinical practice.What are the short- and long-term effects of SS on stiffness of the TFL and ITB and hip ROM? Daniel Myrrylainen1, Peter Preston2, Jaquelin A Bousie1 1. Discipline of Physiotherapy, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 2. Discipline of Medical Radiation Science, Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 jaquelin.bousie@canberra.edu.au INTRODUCTION : Static stretching (SS) fascia latae (TFL) and iliotibial band (ITB) is commonly implemented in rehabilitation, despite limited understanding of its role in influencing muscle stiffness and range of motion (ROM). AIMS : To assess the short- and long-term effects of SS on stiffness of the TFL and ITB and hip ROM. METHODS : Short-term effects of a 300-second bout of SS targeting the TFL and ITB were assessed in 28 healthy males. Hip extension and adduction ROM, and TFL and ITB stiffness quantified via shear wave ultrasound elastography, were measured directly after SS, and at five, 15, and 30-minutes. Long-term effects were assessed via the same outcome measures, with 13 males completing a five-week targeted SS program (300-seconds, three times per week) compared with 14 controls. RESUL TS : A 300-second bout of SS immediately increased hip extension (MD=3.68o-1.86o, p<0.001-0.004) and adduction (MD=41.79mm-13.57mm, p<0.001-0.017) ROM at all timepoints with large to medium effect sizes noted. A five-week SS program significantly increased hip extension (MD=7.08, p<0.001) and adduction (MD=32.31, p=0.018) ROM compared to controls with a very large (1.32) and large (0.82) effect size noted, respectively. No changes in TFL or ITB stiffness were identified following either short-term or long- term SS. CONCLUSION : SS of TFL and ITB increased hip extension and adduction ROM in both the short- and long-term while not significantly altering TFL or ITB stiffness in healthy males. SIGNIFICANCE : SS appears to increase hip ROM while not altering muscle stiffness. Future research is needed to better understand the physiological mechanisms behind SS, and investigate these effects in clinical populations.POSTER PRESENTATIONS74 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingUsing cluster analysis to describe profiles of pharmacists working during COVID-19 Karlee Johnston ANU Medical School, The Australian National University, Acton, ACT , 2601 karlee.johnston@anu.edu.au INTRODUCTION : COVID-19 has seen pharmacists reporting a high level of burnout and work-related stress. Cluster analysis is a statistical method used to determine profiles using the interaction of variables on a particular outcome. AIMS : To use cluster analysis to describe profiles of pharmacists and their experience of burnout during COVID-19 to tailor interventions to improve pharmacists' wellbeing. METHODS : An online survey was sent to Australian pharmacists in 2020 measuring burnout and possible related factors. A two-step cluster analysis was performed on the results. RESUL TS : A total of 647 responses were analysed using cluster analysis that resulted in the formation of two distinct clusters, with 10 distinct variables being important predictors of the cluster formation (Figure 1). The first cluster- 'The affected pharmacist' represented a community pharmacist with high burnout scores, experiencing incivility and rudeness, increased workload and working overtime. The second cluster 'The business-as-usual pharmacist' represented a profile of a hospital pharmacist without an increase in workload, not experiencing incivility, and reporting sufficient precautionary measures in their workplace. The distinct profiles are a reflection of the lived-experiences of pharmacists working during COVID-19. Whilst there are other ways to report the factors associated with burnout in pharmacists, no other forms of multivariate analysis have the advantage of considering the whole person experience rather than just the numbers. CONCLUSION : These two profiles help to illustrate the factors that have affected pharmacists and their burnout during COVID-19. SIGNIFICANCE : These results can assist with identifying pharmacists likely to benefit from interventions and to help develop tailored interventions to support pharmacists' wellbeing.Could less be more in pain management? Nick Dennett1, Paula P. O. Ozola2 1. Pain Management Unit, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 2. Mental Health, Justice Health and Alcohol and Drug Services, Canberra Health Service, Garran, ACT , 2605 nick.dennett@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Multi-disciplinary Pain Management Programs (PMPs) are evidence-based treatment programs for people experiencing persistent pain. The Pain Management Unit (PMU) has offered Medium Intensity Programs (MIPs), however there have been barriers to attendance, including the 40hour time commitment for a MIP . AIMS/OBJECTIVES: In order to address this barrier, the PMU allied health team developed a 24hr Low Intensity Program (LIP). The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of the LIP vs MIP . METHODS : LIP was developed and four LIPs were offered in 2021. Participants provided qualitative feedback and completed pre- and post-measures assessing pain catastrophising, self-efficacy, depression, stress and anxiety. Both qualitative and quantitative clinical outcomes were then compared between LIPs and MIPs. RESUL TS : The data from 21 LIP participants were compared to the outcome data of 37 MIP participants. The qualitative feedback from both programs was positive. When comparing the quantitative outcomes, it was evident that both types of programs resulted in positive clinical change across several domains, however the positive changes after LIPs were of a lesser magnitude than after MIPs. CONCLUSION : The preliminary results suggest that LIPs may be more beneficial for patients who experience less severe pain-associated symptoms at baseline, may be more appealing to patients and lead to increased uptake of the service. However, MIPs may be more effective overall in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life for patients with more severe pain-related disability. PRACTICE IMPLICATION/SIGNIFICANCE: Across both LIPs and MIPs the patient feedback and clinical outcomes are positive, indicating that ongoing efforts in delivering PMPs are valuable, necessary and worthwhile.POSTER PRESENTATIONS26 - 29 July 2022 | 75 PREHABILITATION: FIT FOR CANCER SURGERY. Improving pre-operative physical activity levels to enhance physical reserve for optimal post- operative outcomes in gastrointestinal cancer patients. Jackie Freeman1, Dave Turner2, Andrew Slattery2 1. Exercise Physiology Department, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 2. Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 jackie.freeman@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Major surgical procedures lead to acute decline in physiological reserve; though recovery is common, complications exist in high-risk subgroups, diminishing quality of life (QoL), and increasing length of stay (LOS), readmission and mortality, but 'Prehabilitation' may enhance preoperative status, improving postoperative outcomes and retain function and QoL long term (Tew et al., 2018). AIMS : Canberra Health Services' (CHS) 'NEW' multidisciplinary Prehabilitation service encompassing Nutrition, Exercise, and Wellbeing aims to enhance patient preoperative physical reserve for optimal outcomes in gastrointestinal cancer surgical procedures. METHODS : 1. Eligible patients were screened from the surgical waitlist and enrolled 2 weeks pre-surgery. 2. Exercise Physiologist and Dietitian assessed baseline risk- profile, health status, and outcome measures. 3. Individualised intervention was prescribed, including: -Home exercise program and oral nutrition supplementation -Weekly follow-up for intervention progression and education; -Support overcome barriers accessing psychosocial services 4. Intervention was evaluated by repeat measures pre- surgery, supplemented with postoperative outcomes including LOS and satisfaction scores. RESUL TS : Preoperative physical reserve appeared to improve, indicated by: 1. Improved GSL TPAQ mean scores: -Moderate, and 116.2%, respectively. -Active' ratings by 72.2%. 2. Satisfaction scores achieved 4/5 in all domains. 3. Reduced postoperative LOS by 2.38 days versus control.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The 'NEW' CHS Prehabilitation shows preliminary benefits, specifically increasing PA levels, which may enhance preoperative physical reserve and be linked to reduced postoperative LOS observed. Therefore, future service is warranted with developments focused on improving referral pathways and interprofessional relationships to benefit program efficiency, intervention duration and positive outcomes, potentially optimising CHS healthcare costs and overall patient experience. Culturally appropriate food choices for a better inpatient experience for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People Taryn Billing1, Daniel Farias2, Department, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 2. Food Services, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 3. Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander Liaison Service, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 taryn.billing@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Access to equitable health care influences the health outcomes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (First Nations) people, who may have more complex social, medical and cultural requirements than non-Indigenous people. Many First Nations people have a close connection to Country and cultural norms, including diet. In a survey of First Nations Canberra Hospital inpatients, 73% reported that the current menu did not meet their cultural expectations or requirements. AIMS : To develop an additional menu offering culturally appropriate foods to First Nations consumers. METHODS : In consultation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Consumer Reference Group, Food Services and Nutrition developed 4 new main meals. These were offered alongside culturally familiar sauces and sides on an additional First Nations short-order menu. The menu included meals appropriate for therapeutic diets more commonly required by First Nations consumers including low sodium and diabetic. Aboriginal Liaison Officers provided the menu to consumers during their admission. Food Services prepared the meals and delivered to consumers on request. RESUL TS : 100% of consumers who used the First Nations menu felt it met their cultural requirements. CONCLUSION : A range of familiar foods are now offered to First Nations consumers which contributes to supporting their cultural needs.POSTER PRESENTATIONS76 | Canberra Health Annual Research MeetingSIGNIFICANCE : Provision of culturally sensitive services contributes to meeting the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Agreement 2019-2028 and meets NSQHS standards 5.28 and 2.13 by partnering with First Nations consumers to meet their nutritional needs. Provision of culturally sensitive services can positively impact on an individual's hospital admission, uptake of treatment and, overall, may contribute to improved health outcomes. Increasing ICU Physiotherapy staffing with a 7-day roster Katie Goodsell, Courtney Perman, Katie Erwin AAHS Physiotherapy Department, Division of Allied Health, Canberra Health Services, Garran, ACT , 2605 Katherine.goodsell@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Over recent years, incremental bed growth has occurred in Canberra Health Services (CHS) Intensive Care Unit (ICU) without additional physiotherapy staffing. CHS ICU Physiotherapy full time equivalent (FTE) to bed ratios are well below national and international guidelines of 1:6. A 6-month pilot was conducted to increase FTE in ICU across 7 days. AIM : The pilot aimed to increase FTE: bed ratios; increase consistency of physiotherapy service provided to patients across 7 days; support staff education and training; and improve job satisfaction and workplace culture. METHOD : The pilot introduced an additional HP3 physiotherapist and rotating developmental HP2 physiotherapist to existing ICU staffing. It introduced a 7-day roster for the ICU Physiotherapy team. RESUL TS : FTE: bed ratios improved from 1:16 to 1:10 on weekdays and from 1:21 to 1:12 on weekends. Physiotherapy occasions of service and time spent with patients increased by 40% across 7 days, demonstrating more consistent service provision, particularly on weekends. This resulted in improvements in patients' functional outcomes, measured using Acute Care Index of Function and ICU Mobility Scale. Staff evaluation surveys demonstrated increased job satisfaction and reported increased capacity to provide optimal therapy to patients. CONCLUSION : Increasing Physiotherapy FTE and implementing a 7-day staffing model in ICU improved patient care and functional outcomes and was well received by staff. Future growth in ICU should include funding for additional physiotherapy to maintain these benefits. SIGNIFICANCE : Physiotherapy FTE now better aligns with published guidelines to support more consistent physiotherapy care across 7 days and patients' functional outcomes.Improving dietetic service provision to gastroenterology outpatients Jemma Corrigan Nutrition Department, The Canberra Hospital, Garran, ACT 2605 Jemma.Corrigan@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Guidelines for multiple Gastroenterological conditions recommend Specialist Dietitian's as key members of the Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT). The existing Dietitian clinic experienced high DNA rates and long waiting times. A Specialist Gastroenterology Dietitian was recruited to facilitate clinics in Gastroenterology Outpatients, allowing drop-in appointments and accepting direct referrals from the M DT. AIMS : Increase Specialist Dietetic services to meet best practice guidelines. Improve relations between Dietetics and the Gastroenterology MDT . Increase patient engagement and satisfaction by: Reducing waiting times. Accepting drop-in appointments. Providing specialist, tailored nutrition advice. METHODS : Referrals, DNA rates and wait times for appointments from June-September 2021 were compared to clinic data from the same time-frame in 2021. Randomised patient satisfaction questionnaires were completed and the service was compared to existing guidelines for Dietetic service provision. RESUL TS : A six fold increase in clinic bookings was observed. DNA rate fell from 25% to 5%. Referrals from Gastroenterologists increased fourteen fold. Wait times reduced from 76 days to 13 and the provision of expert, tailored nutrition advice in the context of an MDT has demonstrated high levels of patient satisfaction. The service provided is also approaching the guidelines for the Dietetic management of IBD, Liver disease and other complex Gastrointestinal conditions. CONCLUSION : Incorporating a Specialist Dietitian as part of a Gastroenterology MDT can improve patient engagement, satisfaction, reduce waiting times and provide evidence based services to Gastroenterology patients in the ACT . SIGNIFICANCE : The trial demonstrated the need for this service on an ongoing basis. Funding has been secured to provide the service for two years.POSTER PRESENTATIONS26 - 29 July 2022 | 77 Nutrition in prehabilitation: Fit for cancer surgery Jenny Hawke, Andrew Slattery Allied Health, Canberra Health Services, Garran ACT , 2605 Jennifer.Hawke@act.gov.au INTRODUCTION : Major surgery is associated with a significant decline in functional capacity, common among 'high-risk' elderly oncology patients with multiple co- morbidities, leading to increase risks in postoperative complications, readmission, and mortality. Prehabilitation is the practice of enhancing a patient's functional capacity preoperatively, to improve postoperative outcomes. Preliminary data at TCH demonstrates the mean hospital length of stay (LOS) is 10.11 days, for oncology patients undergoing elective surgery, increasing postoperative complications, recovery and return to baseline nutritional status. AIMS : To provide a patient led service targeting preoperative nutrition, exercise and anxiety reduction amongst oncology patients undergoing elective colorectal and gastrointestinal surgery at TCH. To increase a patient's functional and nutritional status preoperatively to improve postoperative outcomes. METHODS : A dietitian assessed each patient's baseline nutrition status through risk assessments, Malnutrition Screening Tools and assessment of Body Mass Index. Individualised nutrition interventions were prescribed, targeting increased protein uptake, supported by oral nutrition supplements and education resources. Preoperative nutrition measures were repeated 3-5 business days prior to admission and postoperatively to assess for effectiveness. Consumers were invited to complete patient satisfaction feedback surveys. RESUL TS : Reduction in mean postoperative hospital LOS by 2.38 days at TCH. Improved nutrition status from baseline by +1.3kg/m2 preoperatively and +0.4kg/m2 postoperatively. Prevention ileus, intrabdominal collections and anastomotic leak. High level of patient satisfaction scoring 4.8/5 and positive patient experiences. CONCLUSION : Prehabilitation successfully improved nutritional status pre and postoperatively and reduced postoperative outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE : Prehabilitation shows preliminary improvements in enhancing preoperative optimisation and postoperative outcomes to achieve comprehensive care.Protocol: Inspiratory muscle training for people with Parkinson's disease - a randomised controlled trial Juliana Fernandes Barreto Mendonca1, Elizabeth Preston1, Flynn1, Karen Strickland2, Bernie Bissett1 1. of Physiotherapy, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT , 2617 2. School of Nursing and Midwifery, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, WA, 6027 u3220564@uni.canberra.edu.au INTRODUCTION people with Parkinson's disease (PD), 39% experience dyspnoea, which can limit physical activity and quality of life. Inspiratory muscle weakness is a known consequence of PD and a potential contributor to dyspnoea. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is feasible and effective in reducing dyspnoea and increasing exercise capacity in some patients. However, IMT has received little attention in people with PD, and it is not known how this training affects dyspnoea, quality of life or functional outcomes. Past research that examined IMT in PD has not incorporated participants' personal experiences and views when testing outcomes of an intervention. Therefore, a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach is needed. METHODS AND ANALYSIS : This single centre randomised controlled trial will use concealed allocation to either treatment (IMT) or usual care (current management for PD). Primary outcome is respiratory muscle strength (maximum inspiratory pressure). Secondary outcomes include motor experience of daily living (MDS-UPDRS part II), rate of perceived exertion (Borg Scale), exercise capacity (6MWT) and quality of life (PDQ-39). Individual interviews will be conducted with participants who underwent IMT after intervention. Quantitative data will be analysed using an intention to treat approach, while thematic analysis will be used to interpret qualitative data. Ethics and Dissemination: Ethics approval has been obtained from the University of Canberra Human Research Ethics Committee. The results will inform physiotherapists regarding the treatment of dyspnoea in people with PD and will be relevant to clinicians and patients around the world.

AIMS : The Sustainable Personalised Interventions for Cognition, Care, and Engagement (SPICE) program aims to evaluate a comprehensive program of evidence-based therapeutic activities for people with dementia and carers. METHODS : The project is a collaboration between Canberra Health Services and the University of Canberra, and aims to recruit 24 dyads to participate in a twelve-week, twice per week support program using a randomised waiting-list study design. The intervention will be delivered by allied health professionals and includes physical activity, cognitive stimulation therapy, and nutrition assessment for the person with dementia. Carers will receive support aimed at promoting capacity building, self-care, and strategies to manage behavioural changes. The dyad will also receive the Care of People with Dementia in their Environments (COPE) program, which focuses on problem-solving and goal setting in the home. RESUL TS : The primary outcome is quality of life of the person with dementia using the health-related quality of life (DEMQOL) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes will assess cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, health and functional ability, physical function assessments, carer quality of life, and program satisfaction. CONCLUSION : The SPICE program has the potential to promote quality of life of people with dementia and potentially delay cognitive decline while also providing a toolkit for carers to reduce carer burden. SIGNIFICANCE : If successful, the outcomes have the potential to improve post-diagnostic care and clinical practice for people with dementia and their carers in the Canberra region and to inform services nationwide.26 - 29 July 2022 | 79 COMMITTES AND SPONSORS80 | Canberra Health Annual Research Meeting PROGRAM COMMITTEE Prof Chris Nolan (Co Chair) The Australian National University, Canberra Health Services Dr Alison Oakleigh (Co Chair) ACT Health Directorate Prof Nick Brown University of Canberra, Canberra Health Services Dr Fiona Buick UNSW Canberra Prof Deborah Davis Canberra Health Services, University of Canberra Mr Anthony Dombkins ACT Health Directorate Prof Russell Gruen The Australian National University Ms Peta Harbour Australian Catholic University Prof Imogen Mitchell Canberra Health Services Prof Catherine Patterson University of Canberra Prof Jennie Scarvell University of Canberra A/Prof Bruce Shadbolt ACT Health Directorate Ms Cath Rollinson (Secretariat) ACT Health Directorate SCIENTIFIC REVIEW COMMITTEE Bernie Bissett University of Canberra Margaret Broom Canberra Health Services Louise Broomhead ACT Health Directorate Sharon Brownie University of Canberra Hannah Clarke ACT Health Directorate Morgan Downes The Australian National University Viviane Delghingaro-Augusto The Australian National University Glenn Draper ACT Health Directorate Bola Fasugba Australian Catholic University Yuwei Hao The Australian National University Simon Jiang The Australian National University Ned Jelbart Canberra Institute of Technology Natasha Jojo University of Canberra Joe Lynch Canberra Health Services Catherine McGrory ACT Health Directorate Andrew McKune University of Canberra Bahar Miraghazadeh The Australian National University Imogen Mitchell Canberra Health Services Chris Nolan The Australian National University Alison Oakleigh ACT Health Directorate Claire O'Brien University of Canberra James O'Connor The Australian National University Catherine Paterson University of Canberra Rebecca Phillips ACT Health Directorate Katherine Rae University of Canberra Indira Samarawickrema University of Canberra Robert Schmedli Canberra Health Services Bruce Shadbolt ACT Health Directorate Rosalyn Stanton Canberra Health Services Jutta Thwaites Canberra Health Services26 - 29 July 2022 | 81 PLATINUM SPONSORS82 | Canberra Health Annual Research Meeting GOLD SPONSORS26 - 29 July 2022 | 83 BRONZE SPONSORS NETWORKING EVENTS 84 | Canberra Health Annual Research Meeting AWARD SPONSORS Office of Professional Leadership and Education Canberra Hospital Private Practice Fund Radiation Oncology Private Practice Trust FundHARC 26 - 29 July 2022 | 85 SPONSORED RESEARCH AWARDS University of Canberra Award for the Best Allied Health Poster University of Canberra Award for the Best Allied Health Oral Presentation Canberra Hospital Private Practice Fund Award for the Best Clinical Poster Canberra Hospital Private Practice Fund Award for the Best Clinical Oral Presentation Radiation Oncology Private Practice Trust Fund Award for the Best Pre-Clinical Poster Radiation Oncology Private Practice Trust Fund Award for the Best Pre-Clinical Oral Presentation ACT Health Directorate Office of Professional Leadership and Education Award for the Best Nursing or Midwifery Poster ACT Health Directorate Office of Professional Leadership and Education Award for the Best Nursing or Midwifery Oral Presentation HARC Award for the Most Impactful Research Paper Canberra Hospital Foundation Award for the 3 Minute Thesis Winner Canberra Hospital Foundation Award for CHARM 3 Minute Thesis Second Place Canberra Hospital Foundation Award for CHARM 3 Minute Thesis Third Place Australian Association of Gerontology Award for the Best 3 Minute Thesis Related to Ageing Australian Association of Gerontology Award for the Best Poster Related to Ageing86 | Canberra Health Annual Research Meeting NOTES26 - 29 July 2022 | 87 NOTES88 | Canberra Health Annual Research Meeting "}
