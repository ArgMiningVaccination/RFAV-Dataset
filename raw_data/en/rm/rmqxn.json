Flu vaccination can reduce flu illnesses, doctors' visits, and missed work and school (even virtual school) due to flu, as well as prevent flu-related hospitalizations and deaths. The Howard County Health Department will update the list below with upcoming community flu clinics, which will begin in late September or early October depending on when flu vaccine ships. The annual flu vaccine is also available from most local healthcare providers, pharmacies, urgent care centers and many large retail locations. Note: For the 2023-24 flu season the Health Department will offer both Flulaval Quadrivalent flu vaccine (for the general population ages 6 months and older) and a limited supply of Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent flu vaccine (for individuals 65 years and older). Please continue to check this page for information on registering to receive your flu shot from the Health Department. If enrolled in Medicare, please have your Medicare number available when attending any HCHD flu vaccination clinic. There will be no charge to you, and by allowing HCHD to recover a portion of the vaccination cost from Medicare you help us extend our services to even more community members to keep Howard County healthy. |Flu Vaccine Clinic Location||Date & Time||Registration| |Howard County Health Department | 8930 Stanford Blvd., Columbia, MD 21045 | | STANDING CLINIC Monday - Friday |No registration required | Call 410-313-7500 to confirm availability Are you a senior who needs a ride to your flu shot?

It is now recommended that this age group get vaccinated with a high dose or adjuvanted flu vaccine if they are available. These types of vaccine have been shown to produce stronger immune responses in this age group. (Flu vaccines brands in this group include Fluzone High-Dose, Flublok, and Fluad.) If the high-dose flu vaccine is not available, ACIP still recommends that all people over 6 months old should get any accessible brand of quadrivalent flu vaccine. Howard County Health Department does not offer high-dose (or adjuvanted flu vaccines) at our clinics as vaccine was purchased well before the ACIP recommendation. We will plan on having this next flu season. We encourage community members 65 years and older to ask their doctor or pharmacist about getting a high-dose flu vaccine for the best protection this flu season. You can locate area flu vaccination sites that carry a high dose flu vaccine using [Vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/find-vaccines/). The best way to protect yourself and your family is to get your seasonal flu vaccine.

(Your fever should be gone for 24 hours without the use of a fever-reducing medicine.) - Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.

Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses. Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two.
