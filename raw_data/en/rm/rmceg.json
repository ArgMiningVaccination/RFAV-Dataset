If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Learn more. Verywell Health/ Peter Ardito Collagen is an important, structural protein that makes up our skin, bones, cartilage, muscles, and tendons. As we age, our body produces less collagen, resulting in decreased skin elasticity and more wrinkles. Collagen consumed in whole foods or as a supplement may improve skin appearance and joint pain.Additionally, some evidence suggests that collagen supplementation may improve hair and nail strength, however, there is limited research. Aside from these potential benefits, some collagen powders are a good source of protein that can easily be added to beverages or smoothies, to help boost your protein intake. To determine the best collagen supplements on the market, our registered dietitians combed through the research and used their clinical expertise. We also tested 20 collagen powders and rated each product for taste, texture, smell, third-party testing, nutrition, and value. When deciding which collagen supplement is best for you, consider the form, type of collagen (different types are correlated with different potential benefits), source, dose, flavor, and budget that best suit your needs. Also, if you are looking to collagen for a protein boost, be sure to check the nutrition label, as not all collagen supplements are a good source of protein. While collagen supplements may provide added benefits, keep in mind that your body makes its own collagen, so it's not necessary to consume collagen supplements. And, since collagen is derived from animal tissues, it is not appropriate for vegans and vegetarians, though there are fish-derived sources suitable for pescatarians. Editor's Note Our team of registered dietitians reviews and evaluates every single supplement we recommend according to our dietary supplement methodology. From there, a registered dietitian on our Medical Expert Board reviews each article for scientific accuracy. Always speak with a healthcare professional before adding a supplement to your routine to ensure that the supplement is appropriate for your individual needs and which dosage to take.

These collagen peptides are from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine, and the product is certified kosher. It also contains vitamin C and hyaluronic acid to support your skin appearance. Vital Proteins is NSF Certified for Sport, meaning it does not contain substances prohibited by sports organizations and has the ingredient amounts listed on the label. It is also free from gluten, dairy, and sweeteners. Vital Proteins has both flavored and unflavored options that can be added to either hot or cold beverages. However, we found that the unflavored collagen dissolves better in hot liquids. We also noticed that the unflavored version is best mixed into coffee, tea, smoothies, or soups, to mask the slightly unpleasant taste we noticed when mixed with just plain water. Alternatively, Vital Proteins has a lemon flavor that tastes great in plain water or mixed into herbal teas and smoothies. In fact, when mixed with plain cold or hot water, it tasted and smelled pleasant similar to lemonade. This collagen supplement contains collagen types I and III which are meant to support your skin, hair, and nails.

This pig-derived collagen supplement has been tested in placebo-controlled studies and has shown modest improvement in wrinkles after eight weeks. It comes in powdered form and requires mixing 2 teaspoons into your beverage of choice daily, providing 2.9 grams of collagen per serving. The only ingredient in this supplement is collagen, and it does not contain any fillers or additives and is also third-party tested for purity and potency. However, given that this product is derived from pigs, this product may not be suitable if you do not consume pig products. It's also a smaller serving size compared to other powders. Price at time of publication: $23 ($0.68 per serving) Form: Powder | Collagen Type: Types I and III | Source: Pig | Potential Allergens: None | Serving Size: 2 teaspoons | Collagen per serving: 2.9 grams | Protein per serving: 2.6 grams Best for Pregnancy Needed Collagen Protein Powder Amazon View On Amazon View On Thisisneeded.com Pros Third-party tested Good source of protein Contains just hydrolyzed bovine collagen from grass-fed, pasture-raised cows Cons Expensive If you are looking for a pregnancy-safe collagen powder, try Needed Collagen Protein Powder. We like that this product is third-party tested for heavy metals, pesticides, allergens, microbes and other contaminants and is also hormone-free, and free of additives and common food allergens, making it a safe option for those that are trying to conceive, pregnant or breastfeeding. This supplement contains just hydrolyzed bovine collagen, sourced from grass-fed, pasture-raised cows. Hydrolyzed collagen is a form that is easier for your body to digest and absorb. Because the powder is unflavored and dissolves well in any fluid, it can easily be added to beverages, soups, smoothies and more. During pregnancy, protein needs increase, so if you are unable to consume adequate protein from food alone, protein supplements can be a good option to help boost your intake. Needed Collagen Protein provides 14 grams of protein per serving and is also rich in the amino acid, glycine, which may be especially beneficial in late-stage pregnancy.

This supplement contains type I collagen, which is meant to support your skin, hair, and nails. We like Natural Force's transparency for testing their products to ensure purity of ingredients and no contaminants. Each batch of Natural Force Marine Collagen peptides is third-party tested by Covance, and they offer a Certificate of Analysis for each batch. Given that this is marine-derived collagen, it is not suitable if you have a fish allergy. We noticed this powder takes a bit longer to dissolve. It took a little more stirring, but it did dissolve without residual sediment. It is recommended to mix this powder with warm or hot water first, and then add ice or chill in the refrigerator if you want to drink it cold. Alternatively, you can add it directly to smoothies without any premixing required. We love that despite a slight fish smell upon opening the package, it has a completely neutral taste (and no aftertaste) in both hot and cold beverages, including in plain water.

This product provides 90 milligrams of vitamin C, 100% of the Daily Value, to aid in collagen production. Each serving also contains the soil-based organism (SBO) Bacillus coagulans probiotic strain. This probiotic is generally considered safe for most people, but if you are pregnant, breast feeding, taking antibiotics or take other probiotic supplements, talk to a healthcare provider before taking this supplement. Ancient Nutrition Multi Collagen Protein contains a blend of five types of collagen, meant to support the health of your skin, hair, nails, joints, and bones. The cows are grass-fed and pasture-raised, and the supplement is non-GMO, dairy, nut, soy, and gluten-free. While Ancient Nutrition Multi Collagen Protein provides many collagen types, it does contain fish and egg, which are major dietary allergens. While this powder does have a slightly chalky smell, we liked that this collagen is flavorless especially in hot beverages and dissolves quickly. The smell is less noticeable when mixed into a flavored or hot beverage compared to cold water, and there is no aftertaste.

This supplement contains Verisol collagen, which has showed benefits for skin health in several placebo-controlled studies. This supplement is also third-party tested for purity and potency. The recommended dose is four capsules per day. These collagen peptides contain porcine-derived collagen, so they may not be suitable if you do not consume pig products.

This supplement contains collagen from grass-fed cows, cage-free chickens, wild-caught fish, and eggshell membrane, providing five types of collagen. It is NSF Certified for Sport making it a great option for athletes. It is also non-GMO and gluten-free. The recommended dose is one scoop per 50 pounds of body weight, with one scoop providing you with 7.8 grams of collagen. Therefore, unlike other collagen supplements, the recommended dosing will vary based on your weight. While CB Multi Collagen Protein supplement offers many benefits, it is a more expensive choice. We recommend mixing this product in hot beverages, as it does not dissolve well in cold beverages. We noticed it left behind some clumps at the bottom of the glass when mixed with cold water. It does dissolve completely in hot beverages, but it takes a couple of minutes of stirring. We also noticed a slight dairy-like taste when mixed in plain water, but the flavor went undetected in coffee. In addition to the standard packaging, they offer travel packets, convenient for on-the-go.

It provides 40 milligrams of UC-II cartilage which contains 10 milligrams of collagen. While it is convenient the recommended serving is just one pill a day, it is recommended to specifically take on an empty stomach before bedtime instead of anytime throughout the day. Healthy Origins Natural UC-II supplements come in capsule form, so you cannot mix them into liquids, and it is meant to be taken once daily. This product is non-GMO, gluten-free, and has been tested and approved through ConsumerLab.com's voluntary certification program, and was included in ConsumerLab.com's 2023 Collagen Supplements Review. The packaging on this supplement is a little confusing because it highlights that the capsule is vegetarian. While the capsule the collagen is cased in is vegetarian, the collagen itself is derived from chicken cartilage.

If you experience joint pain, this particular supplement may be especially beneficial since it contains FORTIGEL collagen hydrolysate which may help reduce joint pain in healthy athletes. The recommended time to take this collagen supplement is one hour before exercise for best results which may be hard to remember. Momentous is NSF certified for sport, a reputable and rigorous third party certification that verifies the supplement contains what it says it contains with no harmful contaminants and no substances banned for competitive athletes. It's also Informed Sport Certified, a certification that tests supplements for hundreds of substances banned for sport. It contains 15 grams of protein and over 50% of the daily value of vitamin C to enhance collagen production. The 60 milligrams of sodium is a small amount but may help replenish some of the sodium lost in sweat. This product dissolves best in hot beverages with thorough mixing for about a minute. Note that when you mix this powder into either hot and cold beverages, it gives it a slightly thicker texture to the liquid; however, it is mostly tasteless.

We like Vital Proteins Collagen Water because it provides 10 grams of collagen per 12 fluid ounce bottle and has simple ingredients without anything artificial. The lemon slice flavor only contains reverse osmosis filtered water, lemon juice, and collagen peptides. Other flavors include lemon ginger, blackberry hibiscus, strawberry lemon and are lightly sweetened with fruit juice or monk fruit extract. Each flavor has less than 3 grams of sugar and no artificial flavors or sweeteners. Because of this, there is just a hint of flavor for these waters which some may find underwhelming. However, the collagen water can be added to smoothies or mixed with other beverages if you desire a stronger flavor. This pre-mixed drink has the same bovine collagen peptides in the Vital Proteins collagen powder in our best overall pick. While the Vital Proteins powder is NSF Certified for Sport, the collagen water is not clearly third-party tested. Also, this liquid collagen has half the collagen per serving compared to the collagen peptide powder form. Price at time of publication: $15 ($3.75 per 12 fluid once serving) Form: Liquid | Collagen Type: Types I & III | Source: Bovine | Potential Allergens: None | Serving Size: 12 fluid ounces | Collagen per serving: 10grams | Protein per serving: 10 grams Are Collagen Supplements Beneficial? Skin appearance: Studies suggest that certain types of collagen may modesty help improve the appearance of aging skin. Various placebo-controlled studies conducted using hydrolyzed pig or fish-derived type I and type III collagen have demonstrated reduced wrinkle appearance, particularly around the eyes, and improved skin elasticity. Hair and Nails: Small studies support the claim that collagen supplements will lead to modestly increased hair density, while there are mixed results regarding the impact of collagen on nails. Some studies report increased nail growth and reduction in brittleness, while others show no change. Larger long-term studies are required.Joint pain: When it comes to joint pain, studies show supplementing with various forms of collagen, typically type II, for at least three to six months may modestly reduce joint stiffness or pain. However, some studies show no benefit.Postmenopausal people with reduced bone mineral density: If you experience age-related declines in bone mineral density, supplementing with collagen peptides for at least 12 months may support increased bone formation.Pregnant people: Collagen supplements may be beneficial if you are in the late stages of pregnancy when there is greater demand for the amino acid glycine. Collagen contains high levels of glycine, so you might consider using a supplement to ensure you obtain adequate amounts. It is best to consult your healthcare professional before using any supplements while pregnant. Who May Not Benefit from Collagen Supplements Collagen supplements are generally well tolerated. Some people report mild symptoms, including gastrointestinal upset, headaches, dizziness, insomnia, lack of appetite, itchy skin, and canker sores. Those with a history of kidney stones: Though it has not been proven, it is theoretically possible that consuming collagen supplements in high doses may increase the risk of kidney stones. If you have a history of kidney stones, it is best to consult with your healthcare provider before using collagen supplements.Those with certain dietary restrictions: Collagen supplements are derived from animal sources. If you are vegan or vegetarian or refrain from eating certain animals, you should avoid collagen supplements.Those with certain allergies: If you have allergies to fish, shellfish, or eggs, you should avoid collagen supplements derived from fish sources or eggshell membranes. How We Select and Test Supplements Our team works hard to be transparent about why we recommend certain supplements; you can read more about our dietary supplement methodology here. We support supplements that are evidence-based and rooted in science. We value certain product attributes that we find to be associated with the highest quality products. We prioritize products that are third-party tested and certified by one of three independent, third party certifiers: USP, NSF, or ConsumerLab.com. We consulted experts, like Kylie Ivanir, MS, RD, for their insights regarding collagen supplements. It's important to note that the FDA does not review dietary supplements for safety and effectiveness before they go to market. Our team of experts has created a detailed, science-backed methodology to choose the supplements we recommend. In addition to our research, we tested 20 of the top collagen powders in the Verywell Testing Lab to rate each product for taste, texture, smell, dissolubility, and value. We noted how long (or if) each powder took to dissolve and if there was any off-putting odors or flavors. We did this by mixing a serving of each powder into cold water and a hot beverage (tea or coffee). We then combined these ratings with a nutrition and third-party testing score from our nutrition editor to get an overall rating for each pick. We Also Tested While not a top pick for any category, we also tested these collagen powders and think they are still worth highlighting. Great Lakes Wellness Quick Dissolve Collagen Peptides: We like that this collagen powder is just from grass-fed cows and dissolves quickly in both cold and hot drinks. But, we picked up a slightly earthy smell and taste in both hot and cold drinks. Nordic Naturals Marine Collagen Powder: We love the strong third-party testing and nutrition profile from Nordic Naturals products, but we noticed a stronger, earthy flavor in particular when we mixed this in a hot drink. Gnarly Collagen Pro: This powder has strong third-party testing, and we like that it has added vitamin C and zinc. However, we could detect a zinc flavor in both beverages, and it didn't dissolve well in cold water. What to Look for in a Collagen Supplement Third-party Testing Supplements that are third-party tested are sent to a lab where they are tested to ensure they contain what they say they contain and are not contaminated with specific high-risk, common contaminants. However, it's important to note: Third-party testing does not test to see if a product is effective or safe for everyone, and it does not ensure the supplement will not interact with other supplements or medications. Not all third-party testing is created equally. It is not uncommon for supplement companies to pay labs for certificates after conducting minimal to no testing. The third-party certifications we can trust are ConsumerLab.com, NSF, and USP. However, these certifications are difficult to obtain and/or expensive, so many companies choose not to get their products tested by one of these three organizations. Sometimes products tested by these three companies are more expensive to try to offset the cost they pay for certification. Just because a supplement is not tested by one of these three companies does not mean it's a bad product. We recommend doing some research on the reputability of the manufacturer and calling up the manufacturer and their testing lab to determine their protocols and decide if you feel comfortable consuming the supplement. While not common, collagen supplements may contain contaminants such as lead, arsenic, or cadmium\u2014a carcinogen and kidney toxin. Kylie Ivanir, MS, RD, says, \"You should always ask for a Certificate of Analysis. This report should be provided by the company. If they don't, I wouldn't use the product.\" You should therefore aim to choose a collagen supplement that has been third-party tested. Form Collagen supplements are sold as powders, tablets, capsules, chews, and liquids. Collagen supplements can usually be found in three forms: Collagen peptides: Collagen peptides are the type of collagen you will see most often in supplements. These peptides are collagen that has been broken down for better absorption. Gelatin: Partially hydrolyzed collagen, or gelatin, dissolves in hot but not cold water. Raw or undenatured collagen: Collagen can also come in raw or undenatured form, as in UC-II collagen, which is used for joint pain. Collagen supplements typically contain either type I, II, III, or a combination. Type I and III are used for hair, skin, and nails, while type II is used for joint health. Certain supplements may also contain type V and type X, which are involved in muscle, lung, liver, placenta, and bone health. If you are interested in giving it a try and it feels like a worthy investment, you can add collagen powder to smoothies, baked goods, yogurt, oatmeal, gummies, and even soups. Ingredients & Potential Interactions It is essential to carefully read the ingredient list and nutrition facts panel of a supplement to know which ingredients and how much of each ingredient is included relative to the recommended daily value of that ingredient. Please bring the supplement label to your healthcare provider to review the different ingredients contained in the supplement and any potential interactions between these ingredients and other supplements and medications you are taking. If you have allergies to fish or eggs you should avoid collagen supplements derived from marine sources or eggshell membranes, respectively. Marine-derived collagen supplements may also lower blood sugar. Thus, if you are taking blood-sugar-lowering medication including insulin, metformin, glyburide, and others, you should be cautious. It is always best to consult with your healthcare provider to review any potential interactions between supplements and medications you are taking. Collagen Supplement Dosage Always speak with a healthcare professional before adding a supplement to your routine to ensure that the supplement is appropriate for your individual needs and which dosage to take. The recommended dose for collagen supplements varies. For wrinkles or joint pain, the typical recommended daily dosage of collagen peptides is 2.5 to 15 grams, though it is safe to consume more than this. You can take this once or in divided doses, with or without food. If you are using undenatured type II collagen for joint pain, the recommended dose is smaller at 40 milligrams per day. You should follow the recommended dose on your supplement of choice as this will vary. How Much Is Too Much? Collagen supplements are generally well tolerated. Some people report mild symptoms, including gastrointestinal upset, headaches, dizziness, insomnia, lack of appetite, itchy skin, and canker sores. Research has shown that as 36% of your daily protein intake can come from collagen peptides without sacrificing protein quality, so we do not recommend consuming more than 36% of your daily protein from a collagen supplement. Frequently Asked Questions How long does it take for collagen supplements to work? According to available studies, collagen supplements may take around eight weeks for wrinkle improvement. They may take three to six months to help alleviate joint pain. For other benefits such as increased bone strength, results may take up to 12 months. Results will vary based on the individual, as well as the type and dosage of collagen. What happens when you stop taking collagen supplements? You should not experience any side effects when you stop taking collagen supplements. The benefits experienced while using the supplements may gradually fade, although it may take a few weeks. Can collagen supplements cause joint pain? Small studies demonstrate collagen supplements may help alleviate joint pain. There are no current large-scale studies backing the claim that collagen supplements cause joint pain. What does hydrolyzed mean? Collagen supplements are often hydrolyzed. This means the protein is broken down via heat or enzymes into amino acids or chains of amino acids, known as peptides. This makes it easier for our bodies to absorb and allows it to easily mix into liquids. Why does my collagen powder include vitamin C and hyaluronic acid? Collagen powder may include vitamin C due to the role of vitamin C in collagen production in our bodies, namely by adding a hydroxyl group to proline to form the amino acid hydroxyproline, a component of collagen. However, most people are not deficient in vitamin C, so this addition does not necessarily provide extra benefit. Furthermore, supplements meant for skin often combine collagen with hyaluronic acid, a component of skin, joints, and eyes that helps maintain hydration and lubrication. How much do collagen supplements cost? The cost of collagen supplements will vary based on the form of the supplement, ingredients used and size of the container. Collagen tablets usually have a low price point at less than $1 per recommended daily serving. Collagen protein powders can range between $1 to $3 per recommended daily serving. For example, our best overall pick Vital Proteins collagen peptides is around $1.77 per serving. Liquid collagen, while convenient, can be most expensive at closer to $4 per serving.
