If you're a fan of the phenomenon that is [Chiva-Som](https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/why-chiva-som-remains-one-of-the-worlds-best-spa-hotels), the legendary [Thai retreat](https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/hotels-thailand) that has played host to royalty and rock stars since its arrival on the [wellness](https://www.cntraveller.com/article/wellness-travel-trends) scene 28 years ago, you'll feel right at home at its Middle East outpost Zulal Wellness Resort. Opened in early 2022, Zula has tethered the original spirit of Chiva-Som, yet has very much put its own regional stamp on wellness, spotlighting Traditional Arabic Islamic medicine (TAIM) for the first time in a top-drawer wellness setting. It's also the world's first [holistic](https://www.cntraveller.com/article/wellbeing-practitioners-to-know-about) health retreat that caters for families, with young guests taken care of with the same personalised care and attention as their parents within Zulal Wellness Resort's \"retreat within a retreat\" concept. What's the backstory? Zulal Wellness Resort's developer Msheireb is the commercial arm of the Qatar Foundation, a non-profit organisation tasked with developing the country's education, research and innovation ambitions. Qatar's vision is for its population to become more [sustainable](https://www.cntraveller.com/article/how-to-travel-sustainably) and healthier (obesity rates are among the highest globally) so Zulal Wellness Resort fits neatly into both this remit and the Chiva-Som management philosophy. Just 90 minutes from the capital Doha, on the very northern tip of Qatar, surrounded by mile upon mile of virgin desert plains, Zulal Wellness Resort's architecture seamlessly blends into this landscape. Once through the rustic gates, you get a first glimpse of the idyllic coast with its ever-changing vista between expansive beaches to tropical mangrove forests depending on the tides. Zulal takes its name from the Arabic for \"pure water\" and in that it lives up to its name with falaj irrigation waterfalls flowing into a majestic saltwater lagoon that meanders throughout the retreat fashioned as a traditional village. Split into two distinct areas in a butterfly shape, one \"wing\" of Zulal Wellness Resort is Zulal Discovery, for [families](https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/best-family-holidays-europe) and those exploring the practices of holistic wellness and the other, Zulal Serenity, is an adults-only environment for more seasoned devotees. They're anchored in the centre by restaurants, wellness, spa and exercise facilities with smaller studios for yoga and healing fashioned as traditional village houses. Guest rooms are simply, yet seamlessly, thought out. Serenity Suites have a plunge pool and outdoor shower with interiors focused on natural fabrics and minimally distracting d\u00e9cor as the order of the day. An aluminium drinking bottle engraved with your name is a first-day treat as is a sturdy tote bag. There's also a pretty white, pyjama set so you can go between treatments in comfort, with scant need for your own wardrobe. Discovery rooms and suites, many adjoining, are similarly accoutered and perfectly set up around the main pool where many families gather, close to the Discovery Oasis (\"This is definitely not a Kids Club,\" I was told, regularly). What's the wellness concept? Traditional Arabic Islamic medicine (TAIM) is based on the ancient \"theory of humours\" led by Hippocrates and enhanced by physician Ibn Sina in the 10th Century, with his Canon of Medicine becoming a focus for medics for the next few hundred years. It puts humans into one of the four elements: Earth, Water, Fire and Air, each with its own physical, spiritual and psychological strengths and weaknesses. A TAIM consultation is scheduled early in your visit, with your permission, and your programme is then tailored to the most beneficial nutrition, spiritual healing and mind-body therapy plan complete with herbal infusions and medicines from the on-site apothecary. Apart from the TAIM practitioners, there's also a hefty slew of modern medical doctors, nutritionists and physiotherapists, dermatologists and an army of wellness therapists. They minister to a broad church of guests, from those recuperating from illness or injury, or stress and burnout, to those simply looking for a few days pampering and to drop a few kilos as a happy by-product. Programmes run from three days upwards and include full board, daily therapies and run of all the [wellness](https://www.cntraveller.com/topic/wellness-and-spas) facilities. What are the signature treatments? Many from the exhaustive list of treatments you will have experienced before in some iteration, whether Far Eastern, Swedish or Ayurvedic. The difference here is the use of regional herbs, oils and techniques. No desert retreat would be complete without experiencing the Camel Milk Body Mask, with locally inspired ingredients including Neem and Sidr leaf, and infused with fragrant essential oils, to gently heat the skin to enhance metabolism and detoxification. The Full Body Tadleek, a body massage, was an almost-daily treat during my stay, with choice herbal-infused oils to tick the wellbeing box while the massage technique helped with lymphatic drainage and muscle tone. For turbo-boosted muscle relaxation, there's a hot stone variation, which is sublime. It would be a shame to pack your day with treatments though, and miss out on time lingering in the outstanding spa with its Himalayan Salt Room, feeding your lungs with rich minerals to settle your nervous system, aid sleep and contribute to overall wellness - while your job is just to relax. Until you jump into the hydrotherapy pools, complete with an Ice Cave that is - which, given the temperatures of 40-plus degrees in Qatar in [July](https://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/where-to-go-on-holiday-in-july) - deserves to be busier than it is. Which therapist should I book? Many of the therapists are seasoned veterans of Chiva-Som, so you get an idea of the standard of skill, care and attention. My daily go-tos were Phanchita Malikhun, for her deft Full Body Tadleek, and Plubplung Jankaew for her magic touch with an Invigorating Massage, both instinctively knowing what my body needed. What makes it different? Wellness for families is taken seriously here. The Discovery Oasis is run by child psychologists, and every family has a check-in consultation with activities centred around bonding to get children off their screens (devices, in fact, are discouraged throughout the entire resort). Enjoying time with each other is the goal, whether that's through treatments, exercise, cookery classes, fun around the fire pits in the secluded majlis-style tents dotted around the retreat, or out on the water for sports or education in nature and sustainability on the Mangrove deck. When they need a break, children can enjoy each other's company with guided activities by age group in the Montessori-style Oasis, leaving adults free to do their own thing. Anything else to mention? Dining is a true tour de force. Chefs have turned chemists and alchemists to turn out [Michelin](https://www.cntraveller.com/article/michelin-star-restaurants-uk)-worthy morsels that bely their calorie deficit from open kitchens that are gluten, dairy and sugar-free. Yes, portions are small (and admittedly control is a big learning curve for many guests here) but so varied, nutritionally sound and superbly plated there's no yawning emptiness when you leave the table. This concept has been perfected by the fine dining restaurant Acacia, which needs to take its extensive menu of Mediterranean Arabic fusion international. Restaurant staff have meticulous notes of every guest's wellness nutrition plan, passed between the four restaurants (two in the summer low season). Guests in Serenity won't want to miss a few hours reposing with tea in the House of Wisdom, a soaring space of a library furnished with thousands of books donated by the National Library and dominated by the ideal meditation prop, a central sculpture, Void, by Anish Kapoor. The final word Once you're checked into Zulal Wellness Resort you're fully immersed in the business of wellness with no jaunty off-site excursions to souks, attractions or dune bashing on offer. But that's okay. Because once down that desert highway, to misquote the song, you can check in any time you like, but in the case of Zulal Wellness Resort by Chiva-Som, you might never want to leave. Healing Holidays ( [healingholidays.com](http://healingholidays.com/); 020 7843 3592) can arrange a five-night Taste of Zulal Wellness Resort programme from \u00a33,388 per person sharing, including transfers, full board, accommodation and inclusions of the programme.
