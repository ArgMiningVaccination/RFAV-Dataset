Mind Body sessions are 90 minutes, and incorporate both SE and acupuncture in a process led by the body's innate intelligence. They are effective for any problem with a neurologic/ emotional component. These very gentle, integrative appointments look like a restful meditation, but they are a powerful treatment for deeply ingrained patterns and health issues. Mind Body Acupuncture activates your deepest healing reserves, and supports you to finally embody the life you've been building.
