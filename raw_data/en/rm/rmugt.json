When done with the right support from an acupuncturist near me, detoxing can help improve your digestion, immune function, fertility, and many other aspects of your health. Store bought colon cleanse products or a juice cleanse won't really do the job, though. A [detox program with acupuncture](https://myartofwellness.com/new-years-cleaning-detox/) and Chinese herbs will do more to optimize your health than just a [detox diet](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/detox-diets-why-to-do-one-what-to-eat) will. When we recommend our Detox Program at Art of Wellness, we are not talking about fasting or detox drinks, like a master cleanse. The goal of our program is to detoxify the organ systems of the body: it's a liver detox, kidney cleanse, lungs, heart, and spleen. This is a [full body cleanse](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-detox-your-body#1.-Limit-Alcohol) designed to give you a health reset. According to TCM philosophy, your body knows how to repair and renew itself, but it cannot do this job when it is congested and out of balance. In TCM, we have a broad concept of what \"toxins\" are and how they can affect our bodies and our health. Toxic chemicals that come from our [environment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18075622/), such as food additives, pesticides, cleaning products, and [beauty and hygiene products](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/harmful-chemicals-in-personal-care-products/) are certainly part of the problem. Drugs, medicines, alcohol, and unhealthy foods can also be toxic. So can behavioral habits, like sitting and looking at our [screens and devices](https://www.verywellmind.com/why-and-how-to-do-a-digital-detox-4771321) too long. But our own bodies produce toxins, too. The waste products our organs create are \"toxic,\" and if they are held in the body too long without being adequately cleared out, they can negatively impact organ function. Imbalances in the system can cause conditions of excess heat or phlegm, which can lead to all kinds of problems with both your physical and [mental health](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-improve-mental-health-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). [Stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), lack of sleep, and extreme emotions can also contribute to toxic conditions in the body and mind. When the organ systems are out of balance, the body is under constant pressure to keep functioning, but we do not feel our best. Signs you need to detox include: [Fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), low energy, tired all the time - Foggy head, [memory problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [trouble concentrating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Constipation - Trouble sleeping, [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/) - Weight gain - Hair loss - Hormone imbalances - Signs of rapid aging - Skin rash, [acne](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-acne-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Fingernails are brittle, lined symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/menopause/) retention, edema, swelling in extremities [Inflammation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/) is largely created by toxic conditions in the body, and most pain conditions and chronic illnesses stem, at least in part, from inflammation somewhere. Why You Need a Liver Detox In conventional medicine, we think of the liver as being a sort of filter that removes toxins from the blood and helps metabolize fat. In TCM theory, we consider the liver to be the storehouse and distributor of blood; therefore, it also plays a crucial role in the menstrual cycle. The liver is also strongly connected to a person's emotional life. Stress, lack of sleep, too much sugar, alcohol, fatty, fried foods, pharmaceutical medicines, and recreational drugs all tax the liver above and beyond what it needs to do just to keep the blood flowing to nourish the body. When too many demands are placed on the liver, it can cause all kinds of symptoms, including: fatigue, insomnia, and headaches. Feelings of anger, frustration, anxiety, and irritability may arise. Conversely, when a person is feeling bitter and resentful, and isn't able to express it, those unresolved emotions may begin to cause trouble with liver function. Just as the liver governs the blood, in TCM, the kidneys govern the water of the body, controlling elimination through the bladder, and maintaining [blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/hypertension/) by keeping the right amount of water in the bloodstream. Signs that the kidneys are not balanced include: [problems with blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/), edema, puffiness in the face or extremities, [UTIs](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), chronic fatigue, and [menopause symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menopause-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), like dryness and hot flashes. Detoxing the organ systems, including the liver and kidneys especially, can help rejuvenate the digestion and allow better nutrition to reach all parts of the body, as the quality and flow of blood and other bodily fluids will be improved. Making sure that your excretory system is in good working order before starting a cleanse is important. If you are already having problems with constipation, for example, we will want to make sure we get things moving before we start cleansing the organs. Our detox also focuses on the body's largest excretory organ: the skin. Top 10 Reasons To Detox It is a good idea for everyone to detox periodically; detoxing every six months is reasonable for most people.

In order for the body to do its routine daily work of removing toxic waste, it needs plenty of sleep.

When your body is functioning well, your sleep will be of better quality, more restful and refreshing. [Improve skin](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-aging-skin-with-cosmetic-acupuncture/)and hair - Dull eyes and skin, dark circles or bags, puffiness, and thinning hair are signs of stagnant blood and Qi.
