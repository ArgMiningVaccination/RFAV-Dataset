You know who you are. Here are a few examples of some of our great experiences together at The Healing Cuisine over the years. \"My wife and I have spent years dealing with the challenges of raising two children with severe food allergies. We have to be on constant guard, monitoring everything they put into their mouths. Joanne was a godsend. We would turn our child's food care over to Joanne and know that she was going to create not just allergy safe dishes for them, but beautiful meals that would delight them. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even dessert she would deliver new surprises that our children loved. Our youngest still talks about her key lime pie as the best he has ever had!\"Bryan T Father of 3 \"Her high standards and enthusiasm for healthy living are evident in all that she does. We found her to be reliable, thoughtful in her work, and flexible as our needs changed. During her time with our family Joanne focused on menus which would promote overall health and wellbeing, taking into consideration our specific nutritional goals. Most remarkably, my three young children, loved everything she prepared. She went above and beyond, even creating healthy candy bars and ice cream. Her time with us proved invaluable. Joanne is simply wonderful to work with. She would be an asset to any family or organization she works with in the future and I highly recommend her.\"Amandine Freidheim NYC \"LOVE Joanne!! She has such an amazing energy and is a wealth of knowledge. She kept it light and fun with so much delicious food!\"Julia Murray Olympic Athlete, Ski Racer \"Jo's 5 day detox we like heaven to my body. Never felt so revitalized and full of energy after the program. She is an incredible chef and one of the reasons I fell in love with Santa Teresa, Costa Rica. Her passion for food and her extraordinary care to create the most nutritious meals left me craving for more and never was I disappointed.\"Alina Ilie Model, NYC/LA \"I am writing to tell anyone who will listen about my experience with Joanne Gerrard and the Healing Cuisine. I have been interested in and persistently, pursuing news about the newest discoveries in wellness for over 15 years, I have also been experimenting with my diet for as long to see what works for me. I can honestly say that The Healing Cuisine's juice fast cleanse far surpasses any other I have ever done! I have never had such incredible releases in on any other cleanse. And finally, I think Joanne is one of the most caring, nurturing people I have ever come across and this coupled with her extensive knowledge of food as medicine makes what she offers unbeatable.\"Alice Kabukuru Supermodel, NYC \"Thank you for a wonderful week of juices and learning. We are all well and continue to talk about the cleanse week as life changing. My PET CT last month showed that I am completely Cancer free!! Yahoo!!\"Louise Davies Artist, Canada \"Every time I go to Costa Rica I do a cleanse with Joanne! I feel amazing and light and everyone notices a glow in my skin. Joanne paces it so well that you never feel hungry. When you come off it, your whole attitude to food changes. You want healthy and live food in your system. Thanks Joanne!\"Nadia Narain Yogi, UK \"Although I have eaten raw food and have completed cleanse programs before, I was a little apprehensive to undertake a juice fast. I had heard great things about The Healing Cuisine and their programs and after receiving our first raw breakfast I was convinced that cleansing with Joanne's raw food could be a delight in itself. I quickly realized how it helped me to define and refine my body while meeting all of my nutritional needs. The mental clarity, balance and definition I achieved is incomparable. I would highly recommend The Healing Cuisine cleanse programs.\"Julia Stegner Victoria's Secret Model, NYC, New York \"Joanne catered our wedding in Costa Rica. She did an amazing job and the food was delicious. It was all fresh and beautifully presented and there wasn't one person in the party that didn't rave about the food. Along with the main course she designed a mouth watering dessert bar. Joanne was so personable and truly made the celebration one to remember.\"Chad & Janee Salt Lake City, Utah \"We had the absolute honor and pleasure of hiring Joanne as our private chef during our beach house stay in Santa Teresa. We are picky New Yorkers who are all super healthy eaters and I, myself, have a lot of dietary restrictions. What happened when Joanne arrived for the first meal during our stay absolutely blew my mind. Joanne is a lovely person with fantastic positive energy surround her. The first meal she prepared in our home as well as the following 10 meals were some of the most delicious meals I have ever eaten. Each meal, Joanne prepared with the utmost quality and care. Her quality of dishes and her actual presentation of the table and of each plate was truly top tier. We were a group of 6 and all of us have dined in the best restaurants in the world. I'd say Joanne's food was on par with or even surpassing some of those fine dining restaurants. I literally cannot say enough about her cooking and presentation. It was exceptional.Meg Blundelf CEOMother, New York City \"Food for the Soul! This was such a fantastic and spiritual experience...I was not prepared for how I would feel. Each day brought tasty juices and raw foods, all of which were explained in depth by Joanne on how they benefit the body. Eating healthy is one thing, but when you're eating with the right intentions and of foods made with love it makes a world of difference. Also, the raw pizza and pancakes are stuck in my mind forever, delicious!! Much love and gratitude for Joanne\"Jules Francis Holistic Health Coach \"This truly was one of the best meals we have had. Throughout the meal Joanne was attentive, kind, and very funny - but what really struck me was the amount of care Joanne put into the meal. Weeks prior to the meal Joanne was communicating with me back and forth about our taste preferences, allergies, favorite foods, etc. She really went the extra step to make sure the dinner was up to our expectations. She didn't just cook us a fabulous meal, but she made an entire experience out of eating dinner. You do not want to miss out on an opportunity to eat with Joanne.\"Clare Richardson Barlow Washington, DC Joanne is an amazing person as well a personal chef. Her culinary skills are so unreal. We had hired her for 9 days to stock our fridge full of amazing homemade goodies and it was well worth it. Later I found myself on a secluded beach for a surprise sunset dinner cooked and served by Joanne and her husband. The experience was out of this world. My couldn't have hired a better chef to share this surprise experience with. Joanne's skills should be known throughout the culinary world for her creativity, passion, choice of ingredients, commitment to quality and your customer focus. It was truly an amazing experience.Jason Rogowski New York City \"Jo is an amazingly talented, knowledgeable and conscientious chef and it translates into her delicious food. She has a wide range of cuisine with an uncanny ability to make these foods accessible and delicious to even the most picky or meat-loving of eaters. We generally request vegetarian menus (her homemade dressings and sauces are divine); however, Jo has prepared everything for a full traditional Thanksgiving dinner. She is professional, hard-working and not afraid of experimenting with new requests. She is a patient teacher and has a natural gift in conveying information about food and nutrition to her clients. Anyone would be lucky to have her in their kitchen or their home.\"Mei Mei Hu Director & CEO \"I am so inspired and excited about raw food thanks to Joanne Gerrard Young. I now know raw food is not just for the hippies and extremist and is a delicious, energizing way to enjoy the true essence of food. Try it, it is amazing! PS: I still love bacon :-)\"Victoria Ross Surfer/Snowboarder/Marketing Guru, Australia \"Being on a retreat with Joanne is a treat for your whole being. She has a unique gift in her seemingly intuitive comprehension of how to combine ingredients to make food tasty, nutritious and beautiful. Not one single time during my three-day juice cleanse did I feel hunger and transitioning back to eating was smooth thanks to Joanne's care. I wish everyone in this world could experience what I did. The warm, loving and supportive environment made me step out of my shell to become the woman that I am. It was a true life changing experience. In so many aspects!\"Emma Ingan\u00e4s Business Owner, Author \"Joanne speaks to the needs of the world population.

I was on a very strict cleanse and she met all my food requirements while creating the yummiest tasting dishes. I felt so healthy and alive eating her meals.
