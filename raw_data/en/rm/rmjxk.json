The causes of pulmonary fibrosis are not fully understood, but the condition is marked [...] [Read more \u00bb](https://bme.umich.edu/new-treatments-for-deadly-lung-disease-could-be-revealed-by-3d-modeling/) [Brain interface pioneers find meaningful signal in the grey matter noise](https://bme.umich.edu/brain-interface-pioneers-find-meaningful-signal-in-the-grey-matter-noise/) July 28, 2020 by Dan Newman, Michigan Robotics Institute By tuning into a subset of brain waves, University of Michigan researchers have dramatically reduced the power requirements of neural interfaces while improving their accuracy. This discovery could lead to long-lasting brain implants that can both treat neurological diseases and enable mind-controlled prosthetics and machines. The team, led by Cynthia [...] [Read more \u00bb](https://bme.umich.edu/brain-interface-pioneers-find-meaningful-signal-in-the-grey-matter-noise/) [Improving Flexible Neural Probe Delivery Published in Nature: Microsystems & Nanoengineering](https://bme.umich.edu/improving-flexible-neural-probe-delivery-published-in-nature-microsystems-nanoengineering/) July 9, 2020 BME Prof. Tim Bruns, Affiliated Faculty members Euisik Yoon and John Seymour and their labs have developed a novel diamond shuttle to deliver a flexible neural probe that reduces surrounding tissue compression and blood vessel damage. The collaboration between faculty and students in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering included BME PhD "}
