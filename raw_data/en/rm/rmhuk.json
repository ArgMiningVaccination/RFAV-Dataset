Based on that aspiration and commitment, Indonesia hereby delivers the third Voluntary National Review (VNR), after the first and the second in 2017 and 2019 respectively. The journey to implement SDGs in Indonesia has been shared in the first and the second VNRs, both of which have been appreciated at the global level and become a source of pride for Indonesia. After the assessment of its 2017 VNR, Indonesia was selected to be one of the six countries to participate in the SDG Investment Fair in 2019 organized by the UN; the Director of Financing for Sustainable Development Office at the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) sent the invitation via a letter to the government of Indonesia on 19 October 2018. Indonesia was deemed to have promising investment policies and projects and to have been able to identify gaps in investment needs. In addition, Indonesia's 2019 VNR also received appreciation for having covered a majority of the SDG16 targets with disaggregated data that specifically display the role of women in the implementation thereof, as well as providing concrete examples of women and youth participation towards the same. Both achievements have encouraged Indonesia to share its achievements in the first five years of SDG implementation through its 2021 VNR, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Between 2019 and early 2021, quite a number of achievements have been attained by Indonesia in addition to the achievements of each Goal, including revision for the Metadata Indikator SDGs Indonesia (Indonesia's SDG Indicators Metadata) in its 2nd edition as a basis for the development of the 2020-2024 National PREFACE Action Plan and the 2021 VNR; updating of the guidelines on the development of action plans and on monitoring, evaluation, and reporting. Concurrently with the development of the 2021 VNR, Indonesia has been drafting the 2020-2024 National Action Plan, formalizing the integration of the SDGs into the 2020-2024 National Medium Term Development Plan (RPJMN). In the current VNR, Indonesia focuses on nine primary Goals under the theme of the 2021 HLPF \" Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda\" , namely Goals 1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 13, 16, and 17namely Goals 1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 13, 16, and 17. The inter-linkages between the nine Goals underlie the development of the current VNR, as set out in the framework for report analyses. The report analyses are on reform policies established in the 2021 Annual Work Plan to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the analyses of the nine Goals, a snapshot of the achievements of the other eight Goals is also provided, complemented with a complete statistical annex on the achievements of all SDG indicators in Indonesia. Despite being limited to virtual meetings, an inclusive development process managed to reach more stakeholders and the public in discussion meetings and to provide input through public consultation.

Suharso Monoarfa Minister of National Development Planning/ Head of the National Development Planning Agency iii OPENING STATEMENT Minister of National Development Planning/ Head of National Development Planning Agency The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda provides a historic opportunity for Indonesia to prepare a population that will grow and develop in a sustainable, inclusive, prosperous, resilient, and integrated manner, \"leaving no one behind\". Indonesia is committed to the 2030 Agenda: Sustainable Development Goals through the enactment of Presidential Regulation No. 59 Year 2017 on the Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. Under the mandate of the Regulation, Indonesia has mainstreamed the targets and indicators of sustainable development to the 2017-2019 and 2020-2024 Medium Term National Development Plan (RPJMN), localizing sustainable development in subnational level, and the development of the Sustainable Development Goals Roadmap Towards 2030. The inclusivity principle has remained an anchor in implementing Sustainable Development Goals, which do not only involve ministries and institutions, but also encourage the partnership of non-governmental organizations, philanthropy and business, universities, the media, and the parliament. In the development planning multi-stakeholder consultation forum (Musrenbang) of 2021, the President of Indonesia delivered his directive based on his commitment to the implementation of SDGs. First, with large tropical forests and mangrove forests, Indonesia must harness this for the well-being of the population. Second, Indonesia must participate in the global trend towards the green economy. Therefore, transformation of energy towards new and renewable energy sources is essential in strengthening Indonesia's national energy security and its global competitiveness. Third, Indonesia also has the world's richest maritime biodiversity, which must be harnessed to power sustainable blue economy in all coastal areas. Fourth, Indonesia's economic growth must be inclusive, equitable; and economic fairness being the foundations to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. Based on the directive, Indonesia's 2021 Voluntary National Report is a documentation on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, submitted to the United Nations High-level Political Forum for the third time. Indonesia first submitted the VNR in 2017 and followed by the second submission in 2019. This third review does not only cover the highlight of the country's progress, but also identifies challenges, emerging issues, partnership with the civil society, and subnational governments, with regard to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a major shock in which the world, including Indonesia, experienced economic contraction, decreased public purchasing power, increased unemployment, increased poverty, increased inequality, deteriorating food security and population nutrition, and the overstretching of healthcare services. The government quickly anticipated the impacts of COVID-19 through social protection programs by providing various kinds of assistance, such as provision of staple INDONESIA VNR 2021 iv foods, conditional cash assistance (Program Keluarga Harapan), electricity subsidies, LPG subsidies, tuition subsidies (Program Indonesia Pintar), and the pre-employment card (Kartu Prakerja). In 2020, the government provided IDR 381 billion for social protection throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Build Forward Better is Indonesia's strategy in accelerating economic recovery and social reforms in 2021 to ensure concurrent response to COVID-19 and economic recovery. COVID-19 response is focused on managing COVID-19 transmission through cooperation with stakeholders, reducing the reproductive rate of the virus, and rolling out mass vaccination campaigns free of charge as per the standards from WHO. The 2021 VNR theme is Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic that promotes the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Indonesia reports on the policy strategy for development reform to be the basis for a resilient and sustainable social, economic, and environmental recovery for the achievement of the 2030 targets. Achievement of decent work and economic growth (Goal 8) and responsible consumption and production (Goal 12) towards economic recovery and reforms, aligned with the National Health System Reforms supported by zero hunger (Goal 2) and good health and well-being (Goal 3), whereas social protection reforms will be attained through no poverty (Goal 1) and reduced inequality (Goal 10), and disaster resilience system reforms through climate action (Goal 13). Furthermore, the four policy reforms implemented in Indonesia to build a better future are as follows: (a) Economic recovery and reforms to strengthen economic resilience and quality development, enabling economic transformation from reliance on natural resources to manufacturing competitiveness, modern services, and high added values; (b) Health system reforms to strengthen promotive and preventive measures, reinforcing health security and fulfilment of health resources (facilities and infrastructures, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices) and health workforce needs; (c) Social protection system reforms to improve and expand mechanisms and coverage of social assistance and social security, enhancing adaptive financing and social protection; and (4) Disaster resilience reforms, specific strategies for disaster resilience through the strengthening of the system and natural and non-natural disaster early warning response for communicable disease/pandemic prevention preparedness. It is my fervent hope that Indonesia's third report on the implementation of SDGs in Indonesia can be a reference for the global community to attain the 2030 Agenda amid the threats of COVID-19 pandemic on the life of humankind all over the world. To that end, Indonesia will continue international collaboration in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic, and I hope that the 2021 High-level Political Forum may become an occasion where countries learn together and reinforce efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda.

INDONESIA VNR 2021 vi VNR Review Process Indonesia's Voluntary National Review was prepared by operationalizing the inclusivity and transparency principles and involving four partnership platforms, namely national and sub-national governments, civil organizations and media, philanthropy and business, as well as universities and experts. The VNR development process was also reviewed by the Audit Board of the Republic of Indonesia and consulted with the parliament. The UN system, as well as UN ESCAP, under the coordination of the UN Resident Coordinator facilitated and complemented the analysis of nine Goals under review in the 2021 VNR. Moreover, the UN system also supported the processing of statistical data by Statistics Indonesia including disaggregated data to analyze SDG achievements in vulnerable groups, including the poor, women, children, and people with disability. Status and Development of SDG Achievement The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be a challenge for global efforts towards the achievement of SDGs and has called attention to the needs of greater international cooperation. To ensure a sustainable and resilient recovery, Indonesia is undertaking systematic reforms in four sectors, namely social protection system, national health system, disaster resilience system, and recovery of industry, tourism, and investment towards the green economy, supported by low-carbon development. Despite large and micro scale social restrictions and health protocol implementation in several provinces, Indonesia developed the 2021 VNR under an inclusive approach through intensive online consultations. Progresses in the achievement of SDGs, impacts of the pandemic, and recovery efforts in Indonesia include::Social Protection System The national poverty level decreased from 11.13% in 2015 to 9.22% in 2019 but then increased to 10.19% in 2020 due to the pandemic in the past year, setting back the poverty level to three years ago. Women, rural population, and the elderly are groups most affected, and poverty among children has increased from 11.76% in 2019 to 12.23% in 2020. From 2015 to 2019, the Gini ratio has narrowed from 0.402 to 0.380 but due to the pandemic it has widened to 0.385 in 2020. Indonesia has increased social protection expenditure rate from 12.3% in 2019 to 12.7% in 2020 in the national expenditure budget\u2014the highest rate ever allocated to date. National Health System The COVID-19 pandemic has put enormous pressure on the national health system. As of 18 May 2021, as many as 1.748 million Indonesians have been infected with COVID-19, causing the health system's primary focus to shift to handling the pandemic. As a result of the pandemic, essential health services such as maternal and child health, nutrition, noncommunicable disease prevention, and other infectious disease management have been affected. Although the number of births in health care facilities has grown, coverage of prenatal care at posyandu has declined by nearly half. Furthermore, 55% of posyandu reported delays in vaccination procedures. The incidence of tuberculosis decreased from 316 (2018) to 312 per 100,000 population (2019). However, the pandemic poses a challenge to reduce the incidence of TB by 272 per 100,000 population by 2020. This condition is considered to be caused by the decline in essential TB services such as the utilization of molecular rapid test kits and the vii assignment of TB program staff for handling COVID-19. Prevalence of undernourishment has decreased from 10.73% in 2015 to 7.63% in 2019 but increased to 8.34% in 2020. Prevalence of stunting in under five children has declined from 37.2% in 2013 to 27.67% in 2019, whereas that of wasting also dropped from 12.1% in 2013 to 7.44% in 2019. Prevalence of food insecurity, as measured with the Food Insecurity Experience Scale, decreased from 8.66% in 2017 to 5.12% in 2020. The National Health Insurance (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional) has covered 222.5 million people (82.51%) of the population in 2020, but unmet needs for healthcare has increased from 4.66% in 2015 to 5.44% in 2020. However, strengthening of health system is maintained, marked by the increase in puskesmas with standard types of health workers from 23% (2019) to 39.9% (2020), district/city hospitals which have 4 basic specialists and 3 other specialists from 61.7% (2019) to 75.04% (2020), as well as qualified drugs from 78.6 (2019) to 90.6% (2020). The national health system reform will cover eight main aspects, namely: (1) strengthening health workers' education and placement; (2) strengthening of primary health care; (3) improving the capacity of hospitals and health services in isolated, border and small island areas; (4) increasing country's independence in pharmaceuticals and medical equipment; (5) strengthening health security and resilience; (6) disease control and immunization; (7) increasing the effectiveness of health financing; and (8) development of information technology, digitization and community empowerment including the cultivation of the Healthy Life Style Community Movement (Germas).Disaster Resilience System The pandemic is also a momentum for Indonesia to strengthen its disaster resilience system, in addition to continuing its response to climate change through low-carbon development and increasing community resilience to climate change. Regarding disaster management in 2020, as many as 409 people died or lost, and 6,451,439 people were affected by and/or displaced due to disasters. Government of Indonesia cq. Ministry of National Development Planning has issued a policy document for Climate Resilience Development as a guide for the implementation of Presidential Regulation No. 18 of 2020, National Priority 6 and Priority Program 2. GHG (Green House Gas) emissions in 2019 reached 1,866,500 GT of CO2. During the 2010-2019 period, the potential reduction in GHG emission was 23.46% from the baseline. Meanwhile, in 2019, the GHG emission reduction was 20.51% from the baseline, or 401,822.53 thousand tons of CO2e and the reduction the GHG emission intensity was 20.77% in 2019 from the baseline, or 420 tons CO2e/billion rupiah. The total government budget allocated for low-carbon development activities for 2018-2020 was IDR 54.57 billion. Recovery of Industry, Tourism, and Investment towards the Green Economy The Pandemic has caused contraction in economic growth, from 5.02% in 2019 to -2.07% in 2020. This has implicated reduced income per head from USD4,174.9 in 2019 to USD3,911.7 in 2020; the informal economy has expanded to 60.47% in 2020; the unemployment rate has increased from 5.23% in 2019 to 7.07% in 2020; youth not in employment, education, or training (NEET) has increased from 21.77% in 2019 to 24.28% in 2020, including the NEET INDONESIA VNR 2021 viii youth with disability from 52.32% in 2019 to 53.37% in 2020 and the NEET in non-disabled youth from 21,21% in 2019 to 23,85% in 2020; foreign tourist visits have decreased from 16.1 million in 2019 to 4.1 million in 2020. In 2019, reduction and processing of waste have reached 14.58% and 67.40% respectively, whereas 68.35% of hazardous and toxic waste materials was treated. Around 100 companies have published a sustainability report in 2020, including 55 banks. Until 2020, as many as 2,038 companies participated in the PROPER assessment, which contributed to a reduction in pollutant loads of 46.16 million tons, a reduction in non-B3 waste 3R activities of 5,029,181 tons, a reduction in GHG emissions of 131.2 million tons of CO2e, and an increase in water efficiency of 339,529.963 m3. Furthermore, between 2020 and 2019, 895 industrial businesses obtained green industry certification certificates. According to data from the 2019 Green Industry Awards, energy and water savings totaled IDR 3.5 trillion and IDR 228.9 billion, respectively. . Enabling Environment and Means of Implementation Several enabling environments and means of implementation of SDGs in Indonesia are indicated among others with the increasing anti-corruption awareness in the public, increases in the number of information organizations and in the Press Freedom Index by 1.56 points scoring from 73.71 in 2018 to 75.27 in 2020; expansion of legal assistance (77% in 2019 and 89% in 2020 litigation; 80% non-litigation in 2019 and 77% in 2020); and an increase in the number of legal identity ownership reaching up to 77.38% for under-five children and 58.03% for infants under 1 year old in 2020. 73.7% of the population was Internet users in 2019, thereof remaining digital divide and literacy challenges. The role of data is essential for pandemic response, supported by a successful implementation of the internet-based population census in 2020 due to collaboration with relevant stakeholders. Focus on Integration and Interlinkages of Integration of the economic, social, and environmental dimensions is key to achieving sustainable development towards sustainable recovery and ensuring resilience against crises in the present and the future. Inclusive and sustainable economic growth policies (SDG 8) will result in reduction in poverty (SDG 1) and inequality (SDG 10) through strengthening of various social protection systems. Further, economic growth from recovery of industry, tourism, and investment towards the green economy will also benefit from the strengthening of the circular economy (SDG 12) which is to be undertaken through low-carbon development and the strengthening of the natural and non-natural disaster resilience system (SDG 13). Disaster resilience will affect food availability and nutrition (SDG 2) and the strengthening of the national health system. Implementation of multi-sectoral policies of the seven Goals will be based on the achievements of the enabling environment target (SDG 16) which focuses on enhancing good governance and a corruption-free environment, as well as means of implementation (SDG 17). Implementation of the Principles of Inclusivity and Leaving No One Behind In implementing and monitoring sustainable development, the government have always involved all stakeholders simultaneously in a transparent and accountable manner. Likewise, sustainable development targets were set in consideration of vulnerable groups, including children, youth, women, the elderly, labors, and people with disability that the Leaving No One Behind principle would be fully implemented. ix INDONESIA VNR 2021x \u00a9 UNICEF/ UNI308950/IjazahGood Practices Online and offline selection of good practices resulted in around 200 activities initiated by various stakeholders both in and outside the government. Among these, the SONJO movement initiated by the sub-national government of DI Yogyakarta Province in 24 March 2020 was a humanitarian movement to help members of the public affected by the pandemic through mobilization of non-financial resources, such as time and labor. The movement is coordinated with nine WhatsApp Groups with a total membership of 500 individuals. Eight programs under this movement fall into the health, economic, and education sectors. This movement is inclusive as it engages all elements of the civil society and people with disability. Another good practice was initiated by the Bogor City Government in 2018, which is a program to reduce plastic bags at modern shopping centers and shop complexes, with a target of Bogor City being a zero-plastic bag-zone by Kantong Plastik (No Plastic Bag Bogor) has been undertaken since August 2018, engaging environmental groups and NGOs. Since its initiation, the volume of plastic wastes transported to the Galuga landfill decreased by 7% (50 ton) per day from 650 to 600 ton in 2019. Challenges To address disruption in the achievements of SDG targets, institutional governance and collaboration among all stakeholders and a non-business as usual approach are required. The challenge lies in concentrating all efforts towards achieving SDGs in an inclusive manner from national to decentralized sub-national levels. Another challenge is financing for SDG implementation. Prior to the pandemic, through the SDGs Roadmap, the estimated gap in high scenario financing needs was calculated at IDR 14.108 trillion. The pandemic has even widened the SDG financing gap. On the other hand, funds from tax revenue and a variety of other income sources have dwindled. In general, SDG indicator data from censuses or surveys by Statistics Indonesia has been of good quality, especially at the national and provincial levels. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, data collection faced challenges in multiple fronts, such as officer training which could not be held in person, limited facilities (laptops, devices, and mobile phones) and infrastructure (Wi-Fi) inequity between regions, requirement for PCR or antigen testing for officers, and rejection from respondents. In addition, weaknesses were common in statistical data by sector collected by ministries and institutions, especially with regards to data collection, sampling method, processing system, the certainty of data continuity, and lack of statistics education. xi Areas Requiring Support The institutional governance of SDGs implementation at local levels needs full support from local government as well as support from universities through the establishment of SDGs Centers as an enabler, catalyst, and think tank in terms of both research and implementation. However, since not every province has an SDG center, the establishment of such center in other provinces will be continued. Furthermore, capacity building regarding SDG principles and implementation for sub-national governments and non-state actors needs to continue, especially for SDGs based on multi stakeholder partnership. SDGs have been implemented in the last five years into the Decade of Action, therefore our experiences and knowledge can be shared among countries; in a manner that is greener, human rights-based, fair, and equitable economic development; mobilization of finances; or any other matter requiring facilitation by the UN system. Other supports required from UN custodian agencies are facilitation to develop SDGs' proxy indicators as per the global (UNSTAT) standards and capacity building for statisticians that quality, accurate, and timely data can be collected. .

As in the previous RPJMN, the 2030 Agenda has been mainstreamed in the 2020-2024 RPJMN to ensure sustainable development be translated into the programs and activities of the national government and become a reference point for those of sub-national governments. The targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of no poverty, zero hunger, good health, and quality education are reflected in the national development priorities for qualified and competitive workforce. Likewise, climate change, maritime and terrestrial environments, consumption, production, cities, and sustainable housing are integrated into the national development priorities for the environment and disaster resilience. In general, SDG targets have been part of the 2020-2024 RPJMN national development priorities. Thus, SDGs are now an integral agenda in Indonesia's development; 94 SDG targets have been mainstreamed in the RPJMN, increased to 124 in the 2020-2024 RPJMN. RPJMN is a guide for development planning for ministries and institutions and sub-national governments. This means that implementing SDGs is implementing the national development agenda. Therefore, financing SDGs is aligned with national priorities and government programs and activities. By implementing SDGs, Indonesia kills two birds with one stone, namely the implementation of the national development agenda while maintaining our global commitment. Another highly strategic 1 component in the SDGs is the inclusivity principle, which means that SDGs are a collective movement by the government and non-state actors. Development clearly cannot be achieved successfully if carried out by the government alone. Together with businesses, philanthropy, civil organizations, the media, and universities, the government works to achieve SDGs. Mainstreaming SDGs in the planning documents of the SDG National Action Plan (RAN) and the Sub-national Action Plans (RADs) is in line with the five yearly development agenda (RPJMN) and Medium Term Sub-National Development Plan (RPJMD). Currently, Indonesia is developing the 2020-2024 SDGs RAN with reference to the second edition of the SDG indicator metadata, published in 2020, aligned with the updated metadata by UNSTAT. This second edition of the metadata has more national indicators that are equivalent to indicators global - 135 indicators compared to 85 in the first edition. At the sub-national level, currently there are 29 RADs in 34 provinces in Indonesia, covering district-level programs and activities. Meanwhile, the RADs in five other provinces are being finalized. Sustainable development is a necessity for a better life in harmony with nature and is increasingly relevant now to enable social, economic, and environmental resilience in the face of shocks and crises due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Indonesia continues recovering from impacts of the pandemic within the SDG framework to build forward better in the communal spirit of gotong royong, which is the characteristic of Indonesia 1.2 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND ENVIRONMENT POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION Indonesia is committed to implementing sustainable development which integrates economic, social, and environmental dimensions. This is further translated in the policies of Climate Resilient Development and Low-Carbon Development, which is manifested from the ratification of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in support of the green economy. The green economy is an important economic transformation strategy for Indonesia's targets to become a developed country and to accelerate economic recovery due to the pandemic. At the implementation level in sub-national areas, the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued an RPJMD (Sub-national Medium Term Development Plan) regulation on strategic environmental assessment which mainstreams SDGs. In addition, new regulations have been applied to sub-national governments to develop inclusive SDGs' RADs (Sub-national Action Plan). Furthermore, the Ministry of Village, Development of Disadvantaged Regions, and Transmigration has also issued regulations on \"Rural SDGs\" as a guidance for the village fund disbursements that is SDGs-based for planning, monitoring, and evaluation of performance. For non-state actors, the Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas has worked together with the Financial Services Authority, the Indonesian Stock Exchange, and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) in developing a planning format for the achievement of SDGs and sustainable reporting for companies. In philanthropy, SDGs mainstreaming continues. Intensive meetings, capacity development, and mentoring for philanthropy to use SDGs as reference for strategic organizational planning have proceeded quite well and will continue. SDGs Centers, which are SDGs centers of excellence at universities, continue to grow; currently there are 23 Centers established in Indonesia. SDGs Centers facilitate universities to teach, deliver social responsibility activities, develop knowledge, conduct research, and provide inter-disciplinary recommendations on policies. In addition, SDGs Centers also serve as catalysts, facilitators, and capacity development agents for SDGs implementers in an inclusive manner, engaging all stakeholders, especially those in sub-national areas. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 2 Among civil organizations, a Coalition of Civil Organizations for SDGs Achievement has been formed at the national level as a means of coordination and advocacy in SDGs implementation. This coalition actively and critically voice policy recommendations for better and more inclusive SDGs implementation, including the engagement of vulnerable groups. Other relevant stakeholders are also engaged in financing SDGs in Indonesia. There are wide gaps of SDGs financing, which has worsened due to the pandemic. The national and sub-national governments do not have the sufficient funds for SDGs achievements. Therefore, various instruments for innovative financing are needed, including philanthropy; green bonds/green sukuk; social impact investing; faith-based funds such as zakat, infaq, and alms; and crowdfunding. Indonesia is currently developing an SDGs Financing hub as a platform to facilitate various innovative financing schemes and initiatives. Implementation of these innovative schemes of financing is a manifestation of the Financing for Development agreement in the Addis Ababa Actions Agenda.1.3 ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE INDONESIAN SDG IMPLEMENTATION COMMITMENT Indonesia continues to reflect its commitment in achieving SDGs by strengthening existing reporting mechanisms at the national, regional, and international levels. At the national level, monitoring and evaluation are carried out regularly on the achievements of SDGs RAN and RAD targets by both the government and non-state actors. This provides the opportunity for improved policy, program, and activity planning and implementation for achieving SDGs. Monitoring is carried out each semester, whereas evaluation is conducted annually. At the national level, ministries and government institutions and non-state actors deliver progress reports of their respective program and activity implementation to the Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas as the national coordinator for SDGs implementation. At sub-national levels, governors, as a representative of the national government, coordinates monitoring and evaluation of SDGs implementation in districts within their provinces and reports SDGs implementation to the Minister of National Development Planning/Head of Bappenas and the Minister of Home Affairs. 3 At the regional level, Indonesia is involved in the Asia Pacific Forum for Sustainable Development (APFSD) organized by United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia Pacific (UN ESCAP), which serves as a means for sharing experience, lessons learned, and best practices in the progress to achieving SDGs in Asia-Pacific region countries. In 2021, Indonesia actively participated in the forum to deliver its SDGs achievements amid the pandemic as a momentum to build forward better through SDGs implementation. The APFSD is also a regional forum to strengthen the preparation of the VNR, to be delivered in the HLPF organized by UN ECOSOC in the same year. In developing the 2021 VNR, Indonesia continues its effort in engaging more stakeholders to leave no one behind and with the support of UN agencies in Indonesia under the coordination of the UNRC. In addition, Indonesia is engaging in bilateral cooperation for peer review of the 2021 VNR with Norway to encourage transparency, sharing of innovations, and sharing of lessons for both countries. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 4 2REVIEW METHODOLOGY AND PREPARATION 2.1 METHODOLOGY IN THE REVIEW As previously conducted in the development of the 2017 and 2019 VNRs, Indonesia consistently adopts the references set by UN DESA in developing this 2021 VNR. In-depth discussion in Chapter 4 herein is made for nine Goals that are the primary foci of the 2021 VNR analysis. Indonesia also formulates inter-linkages among the nine reported Goals, as well as presenting data trends for other Goals for which no analysis is made in detail herein except in the form of statistical annex. The discussion under each Goal of the VNR is made based on indicators that have already been defined within the Indonesian SDGs' metadata and availability of data and information. Analyses on data disaggregated by household expenditure, sex, age group, rural and urban, people with disabilities and people with no disabilities and provinces are made to reflect the principle of No One Left Behind in the implementation of SDGs. Data sources used in the development of the VNR comprise of basic statistical data from Statistics Indonesia, statistical data by sector from technical ministries/agencies, and data from reports by other research organizations, civil organizations, and higher education institutions. In the analysis of the 2021 VNR, Indonesia also references research and studies by ministries/agencies, non-government organizations, and development partners related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as relevant to the nine Goals under review. Trend analyses up to 2019 become the main discussion to present the progress of each nine Goals, followed by analyses on the achievements of the nine Goals as affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall discussion concerns to the principles of data disaggregation; inclusivity; Leaving No One Behind; inter-linkages of social, economic, and environmental dimensions; people-centered; gender-sensitive; and human rights perspective, especially with regards to vulnerable groups. 5 Analyses under each Goal includes trend analyses to 2019 prior to the COVID-19 and of policies affecting said trends and good practices implemented by government and non-state actors contributing to the Indonesia's progress achievements of the SDGs. Discussions on the pre-pandemic trend analyses serves as the baseline for measuring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on progresses made by Indonesia thus far. The 2020 SDGs achievement analyses have in-depth discussion on highly relevant indicators affected by the pandemic. The 2021 VNR discusses in detail how the conditions in 2020 affected SDGs achievements. Considering that basic statistical data and survey results to portray the conditions in 2020 will not have been obtained comprehensively at the time of this VNR's delivery, Indonesia uses data and information from research and studies during the COVID-19 pandemic from government and non-state actors as references in the analyses of each indicator. Policy responses, initiatives, and good practices as a response of the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed in depth under the nine analyzed Goals, especially in indicators of which the trends up to 2019 have been analyzed. Discussion of the inter-linkages among the nine Goals in the in-depth analysis is also presented in the 2021 VNR, referring to the analytical framework developed by Indonesia under policy reforms set by the government for 2021 in ensuring sustainable and resilient recovery from COVID-19, which is also a reference in the analysis of the 2021 VNR. Discussion on the inter-linkages among goals under each Goal's analysis is also made to highlight the impacts of synergy, mutual benefit, and trade offs. Chapter 4 of the Indonesian 2021 VNR also presents challenges, gaps, emerging issues, and prospects of recovery from COVID-19 under each foci Goal. Each foci Goal is concluded with policy responses by the government in 2021 and the plan going forward to overcome challenges, fill in gaps and face emerging issues towards ensuring recovery and resilience that SDGs remain on track as planned in Indonesia's SDGs Roadmap towards 2030. 2.2 FORMULATION OF AN INCLUSIVE AND TRANSPARENT VNR Indonesia's VNR has been formulated based on inclusive, participatory, and transparent principles. This VNR was formulated by the SDGs four participation platforms, namely national and sub-national governments, civil society organizations, philanthropy and business, and academicians and experts. The formulation has been reviewed by the Audit Board of the Republic of Indonesia, overseen by development partners, and in consultation with the parliament. In addition to the development of the VNR, the UN System, under coordination of the UN Resident Coordinator, also facilitated the in-depth analysis of the nine Goals under review, including specific processing of disaggregated statistical data sourced from Statistics Indonesia, to ensure analyses includes data of vulnerable groups, including the poorest, women, children, and people with disabilities, provided result of the Survey Report on Volunteering in Indonesia, which encompasses all Goals - volunteering as cross cutting. The UN System also supported the development of a video that will be presented by the Minister of National Development Planning/Head of National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) in the 2021 HLPF meeting. The primary principles undergirding formulation of Indonesia's 2021 VNR to ensure inclusive implementation include the following: 1. The Indonesian VNR is a national report to the global level owned by all relevant stakeholders under the coordination of the government, which is the Ministry of National Development Planning/ Bappenas (country-led); 2. The framework for 2021 VNR, schedule and formulation methodology were INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 6 discussed with the four participation platforms. All stakeholders were encouraged to be involved in formulating the VNR by participating on the meetings and discussing the relevant research and studies; 3. Public campaigns were conducted to encourage active participation by all stakeholders throughout the development process; 4. Various communication strategies, especially online, were utilized to provide the most opportunities for stakeholders's inputs; 5. All stakeholders, from government or non-state actors such as academicians and experts, philanthropy and business, civil society organizations, and the media, were engaged to ensure representation of all public groups or elements, especially vulnerable groups which include children, youth, the elderly, and people with disabilities; 6. Documentation and publication were made to ensure accountability and transparency in the consultation processes taking place; 7. Principles of people-centered and gender sensitive, and upholding human rights, especially the poorest and the vulnerable were implemented; and 8. Accessible language was used to reduce information gaps among involved stakeholders. Kick off Meeting on the Formulation of Indonesia's Voluntary National Review (VNR) 2021 and the 2020-2024 SDGs National Action Plan 7 2.3 THE VNR FORMULATION STAGES The stages in the formulation of the Indonesian 2021 VNR are as illustrated in Figure 2.1 Flow of the Indonesia's 2021 VNR Formulation. Figure 2.1 Flow of the Indonesia's 2021 VNR Formulation Figure 2.2 The Minister of Development Planning /Head of National Development Planning Agency in the 2021 VNR development kick-off meetingThe VNR formulation began with a kick-off meeting to ensure common understanding of relevant stakeholders, led by the Minister of National Development Planning/Head of Bappenas as the coordinator of SDGs implementation in Indonesia. This meeting was attended by more than 500 members of the National SDGs Coordination Team and representatives of sub-national governments and the UN System in Indonesia. This virtual meeting, allowing a larger audience, differed from the offline 2017 and 2019 plenary meetings, in which space had been a limitation: the 2019 VNR face-to-face meeting was attended by 250 participants. After the kick-off meeting, the heads of the working groups under the four SDGs development pillars met with INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 8 Figure 2.3 Invitation to the public for participation in the 2021 VNR development by way of reporting good practiceseach pillar members, also attended by the UN System. With the existing teams under the national coordination team, which comprised representatives of each participation platform, the sub-working groups for each Goal under reviewed prepared and formulated the drafts. Focus group discussions in each sub-working group under each VNR-focus Goals were conducted from mid-February to March 2021. In addition, focus group discussions involving philanthropy and business were also conducted in drafting the current VNR to complement focus group discussions in each sub-working group. The focus group discussions were a joint initiative between philanthropy and business platform and the Indonesian SDGs Implementing Team to ensure an inclusive process and to engage more philanthropy and business in the development of the VNR. In addition to the nine Goals analyzed in depth by each corresponding sub-working group, as with VNR 2019, the current VNR reports achievements, challenges, and policy responses from the other eight Goals that are excluded from in-depth analyses, beyond the framework as per the theme of the 2021 VNR, namely Goals 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, and 15. This is to paint a big picture of the achievements of the 17 Goals in Indonesia. The discussion in the current VNR also presented in greater depth the inter-linkages among Goals under review. The inter-linkages among the nine Goals were reviewed at the levels of Goal, target, and indicator. The inter-linkages review is presented in the chapter on Policies and Enabling Environment. To further support the in-depth analyses, all relevant stakeholders were encouraged to share their experiences and good practices as their contribution in achieving SDGs, especially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Public was reached out for their participation in the 2021 VNR via web site http://sdgs.bappenas.go.id and social media platforms such as Instagram (@sdgs_indonesia) and Facebook (SDGs Indonesia) (Figure 2.3). In addition to ensuring an inclusive development process engaging all stakeholders, this was also intended to obtain relevant information to then share to other stakeholders. Up to early April 2021, around 200 good practices' documents have been received, enriching the analysis and showcased good practices to be replicated and scaled up by other stakeholders. Each organization reporting their good practices had to complete a standardized format of the Good Practices and Lessons Learned Form (Figure 2.4), submitted online 9 1. Name of Goal under SDGs 2. Name of Institution 3. Name of Program 4. Activity Place and Time 5. Background 6. Implementation (strategies, parties involved, recipients, etc) 7. Results and Impacts 8. Challenges and Lessons 9. Replicability Remarks: Maximum one page including graphics, photos, location (coordinates), website, etc. Figure 2.4 Good Practices and Lessons Learned Form The good practices' documents were selected to identify those that are relevant to the analysis of the Goal under review and the theme of the VNR (Figure 2.5 Selection process for good practices to be included in the 2021 VNR). The selection looked at complete information, as required in the Good Practices and Lessons Learned Form, and its content, with selection criteria in regards to the 2021 VNR theme, as relevant to the targets and indicators under review, as well as its impact and replicability. The results of the initial selection would be brought to focus group discussions with independent team consisting of representatives of stakeholders, heads of sub-working groups, and the SDGs National Secretariat. Stakeholders representatives include experts and leaders of civil society organizations, philanthropy, business, and academicians with expansive experience in their respective fields. In the discussions, the independent team emphasized that good practices included in the analysis discussion in the 2021 VNR as shown in the box must show sustainability, promote local wisdom, nurture social capital, reflect social diversity, target vulnerable groups, encourage movements in the public, including community volunteering, be a good and replicable example, not only domestically but also for internationally if possible, and reflect innovation. In addition to good practices included in support of the in-depth analyses of the nine 2021 VNR-focus goals, Indonesia also presents other good practices in the annex. The statistical annex containing all data of each SDGs indicator in Indonesia is an inseparable part of the VNR. Trends and disaggregated data are presented in a statistical annex with updated data, although there were amended of data measurement methods in 2019 for several indicators, such that only data from the past two years are presented, for example data on adequate water and sanitation, whereas other indicators are presented in accordance with the second edition of the Indonesian SDGs Indicator Metadata. Another annex includes lists of policies during the COVID-19, stakeholders involved in the development of the current VNR, and the syntax of measurements of several indicators such as Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) and Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU), considering Indonesia is advanced in measuring the two indicators. All formulation stages of the VNR was communicated to the stakeholders by email and was published for feedback through online forms. Public consultation was delivered via email blast to more than 700 members of the Indonesian National SDGs Coordinating Team and the public through all official social media accounts of SDGs Indonesia. Public consultation on the first draft was conducted to ensure the involvement of all stakeholders in the development of VNR 2021 in a transparent manner as a form of government accountability to the public as well as to capture even more inputs. Consultations in the form of focus group discussion were also conducted with representatives from vulnerable groups, including children, youth, and labor organizations, as well as consultations and INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 10 Figure 2.5 Selection process for good practices to be included in the 2021 VNR orientations on the importance of the human rights perspective in each VNR analysis with the support of UN OHCHR. Based on the experiences from the 2017 and 2019 VNRs, consultations with vulnerable groups should be conducted in greater depth that the principle of Leaving No One Behind is implemented and monitored properly both in the processes and in the discussion. According to the consultations with youths and adolescents, the COVID-19 pandemic has to a great degree affected youths and adolescents, personally and their activities related to SDGs implementation. The pandemic inevitably has limited types of activities conducted by youth and adolescent organizations in implementing SDGs in their respective areas. However, it also has provided opportunities, including increased utilization of online devices. Several challenges that they have felt arising during the pandemic include challenges in remote learning, especially those who are undertaking vocational and practice-based education, difficulties in securing jobs, mental health challenges due to extended staying at home periods, and challenges for youths and adolescents with disabilities.Focus group discussions with 28 volunteers involving organizations and 5 volunteers were also organized as part of the 'Survey Report on Volunteering in Indonesia' by the IndoRelawan and with support of UNV. Participants shared their experience while implementing volunteer programmes and volunteering for socio-economic and environmental activities. Numerous good practices of volunteering related to education, COVID-19 response, environment were shared. Mutual benefits of volunteering for society as well as recommendations to further nurture volunteering culture in Indonesia were also collected to enable more citizen to take part in acceleration of SDGs implementation through volunteering. Discussions of these online public consultations and focus groups complemented the VNR drafts. The final draft was discussed in the final plenary meeting involving all stakeholders who were invited to the kick-off meeting. In addition to inputs from public consultations, the inclusive process of VNR development also considered the surveys from the development of Voluntary Subnational Reviews (VSR) carried out by ITB SDGs Network with the support of 11 United Cities and Local Government Asia-Pacific (UCLG ASPAC). The VSRs were conducted in 13 provinces, nine cities, and three regencies, involving the Indonesian District Government Association, Indonesian Provincial Government Association and Indonesian District Parliament Association. The method implemented therein includes interview with subnational governments on the implementation of SDGs; questionnaires with emphases on appraisal of the sub-national government's capacities in implementing SDGs, setting priorities for SDGs-aligned development, and understanding of SDGs; and focus group discussions for experience sharing. The 2021 VSR was the first for Indonesia. The Indonesia's 2021 VNR also accommodates results from the Voluntary Local Review (VLR) conducted by the city government of Surabaya, East Java Province. In addition to subnational's commitment on SDGs implementation, this process has been encouraged by the integration of SDGs into the mid-term development planning of the city government. The Surabaya VLR was conducted in three stages: planning, consultations, and data compilations, before its formulation. The Surabaya government, with the support of UCLG-ASPAC and UN ESCAP had the initiative to conduct Indonesia's first VLR. The process and stages of the Indonesia's 2021 VNR were also reviewed by the Audit Board of the Republic of Indonesia, with the aim of assuring the quality of the development of the current VNR report. The review was conducted in two weeks, on 19-30 April 2021. The Audit Board assessed whether the Indonesian government has developed the 2021 SDGs VNR in line with those in 2017 and 2019, considered audit results of the Audit Board related to the achievements of SDGs in Indonesia, and conducted due process in line with the guidance issued by UN DESA (Handbook for the Preparation of VNR 2021). BOX 2.1 2021: TOWARDS A MORE RIGOROUS AND EVIDENCE-BASED VNR \"They will be rigorous and based on evidence, informed by country-led evaluations and data which is high-quality, accessible, timely, reliable and disaggregated by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, migration status, disability and geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts\" (Paragraph 74 of the 2030 Agenda document concerning \"follow-up and review processes\" for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in letter g). In supporting the follow-up and review process for the preparation of a more rigorous In supporting the follow-up and review process for the preparation of a more rigorous and proper evidence-backed VNR, the Audit Board of the Republic of Indonesia (Badan Pemeriksa Keuangan or the Audit Board) has fulfilled the request of the INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 12 Government of the Republic of Indonesia through the Minister of National Development Planning/Head of the National Planning Agency (Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional or Bappenas) to conduct a review of the preparation of the Indonesian VNR 2021. In line with the efforts to build a culture of Accountability for All, the Audit Board appreciates the request for a VNR review as a form of commitment, transparency, and government accountability in the preparation of the Indonesian VNR 2021. The Audit Board review is a real contribution to providing assurance for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in Indonesia as well as lessons learned for the international community. The Audit Board has established a criteria framework for reviewing Indonesia's VNR 2021, consisting of (i) consistency of VNR 2021 with the VNR 2017 and 2019, (ii) data validation and analysis of VNR 2021 with the audit results of the Audit Board, and (iii) alignment of due process with Handbook for the Preparation of VNR- The 2021 Edition. The review was carried out on the initial draft of Indonesian VNR 2021, which contains the Progress of the Goals and Targets or Chapter 4 of the Structure and Content of the report for HLPF, which is contained in Annex 2 of the Handbook for the Preparation of VNR - The 2021 Edition document. The results of the review show that the government has maintained the continuity and harmony of information disclosure and analysis in accordance with the VNR 2017 and 2019 and the Handbook for the Preparation of VNR 2021 Edition. However, the government should pay attention to the sustainability of resources as well as the relevance of data and information; the results and follow-up of the Audit Board audits; and the due processes in accordance with the Handbook for the Preparation of VNR 2021 Edition. As an added value to the Indonesia's VNR 2021, the Audit Board recommends the government to ensure the disclosure of the sustainability of resources and the relevance of data and information; reveal the importance of alignment of information and analysis of each achievement of the Goals and targets with the results and follow-up of the Audit Board audits; ensure the preparation process of the SDGs VNR 2021 13 Indonesia's VNR development has also been reviewed by the government of Norway through the country peer-reviewed report mechanism, the government of Indonesia also reviewed the draft Norwegian 2021 VNR document. This process is intended to ensure the principles of inclusivity and experience- and good practice-sharing in the VNR, both in the development process and in the analysis foci. The Indonesian government has also been involved in the review processes at the regional and international levels through involvement in discussions and workshops on the preparation of the 2021 VNR held by UN ESCAP, UN DESA, and UN Statistics Division (UNSD), in addition to dialogues on VNR preparation in an occasion of the 20th session of the Committee of Experts on Public Administration (CEPA). 2.4 LIMITATION As with all countries reporting their VNR in 2021, VNR discussions could only be held online or on virtual platforms. This proved to be a limitation neither for the process nor substance, but it instead facilitated greater outreach and participation of the National SDGs Coordination Team in the kick-off meeting, series of discussions, and plenary meeting for finalization and endorsement. More inputs were received for the 2021 VNR through virtual platforms; although virtual platforms were utilized for the previous two VNRs, the public have now become more accustomed to the use of applications and online forms, resulting in a significant increase in the input received. Higher public enthusiasm for participation in the discussion and provision of feedback has also been apparent. Considering that the theme of the 2021 VNR relates to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, analyses include data and information during the pandemic. Survey results of Statistics Indonesia published in 2020 portrayed pre-pandemic conditions. The National Economic and Social Survey (Susenas) in the first quarter of 2020, conducted in March, did not fully illustrate the impacts of the pandemic, but the Susenas in September 2020 did so, especially in terms of poverty and gini ratio. This report presents data up to 2020, but the 2020 data have to consider several factors, since the 2020 data were collected during the pandemic. Transition from face-to-face data collection methods to virtual ones affect the findings. There are two possibilities, first, in terms of the formulation, presentation framework, and documentation process. The government, represented by the Ministry of National Development Planning/ Bappenas, gives positive responses to the results of the review. As a concrete step, the government immediately follows up on the results and recommendations of the Audit Board review on improving the final version of the Indonesia's VNR 2021 document In accordance with Principle 12 of INTOSAI, the Audit Board expects that the Indonesian VNR 2021 review will be the first step of further constructive collaboration between the government and auditing agencies to strengthen the VNR and as good practices that can be used as lessons learned for other countries and auditing agencies. The Audit Board and the government has agreed to increase constructive collaboration in the future to strengthen the follow-up and review process for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Indonesia. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 14 the virtual methods have greater access for the public to be involved, report and/or reached by the interviewer. Those who previously would have faced physical access limitations during data collection or surveys would have flexibility of online access. Second, the virtual methods actually limit access for the public to be involved, report and/or reached by the interviewer. Automated online data collection captured data from individuals with access to digital technologies or those already registered in the data system (e.g., having an identity number so as to be registered in the population registry). As also experienced by other countries in the world during the COVID-19 pandemic, Indonesia faced difficulties in collecting data for some indicators, such as stunting. The initial plan was that stunting data would be collected by integrating the March 2020 Susenas and the 2020 Indonesian Nutrition Status Survey. About 345,000 households sampled in the March 2020 Susenas who had been interviewed by the Susenas data collection officers would be visited again by Ministry of Health officers in April to May 2020 for stunting data collection. Collection of stunting data required details of the age of the infant and measurements of height and weight. Considering the high health risks for the infants and their families of such activities during the pandemic, such contacts are no longer feasible. Other data that was not possible to be collected in 2020 include infant mortality rate, neonatal mortality rate, and proportion of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) whose demand for family planning satisfied by modern contraception methods. Such data should have been collected from the Indonesian Demographic and Health Surveys (SDKI), which had been planned for 2020, but postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, in the case of the maternal mortality rate, the data source is the Inter-censal Population Survey (SUPAS), which can be updated only after the long-form 2020 population survey, planned in September 2021. The latest maternal mortality rate available is sourced from the 2015 SUPAS. Despite these limitations, the Indonesia's 2021 VNR manages to present data for several global SDGs indicators, including indicators under Goal 2 such as indicators 2.1.1 Prevalence of Undernourishment, 2.1.2 Prevalence of Food Insecurity based on Food Insecurity Experience Scale or FIES, 2.c.1 Indicator of Food Price Anomalies, and 2.3.2 Average Income of Small-Scale Food Producers by sub-sector. The data processing syntax of those indicators are presented in the statistical annex. These limitations have not negatively impact the substance in the current VNR; instead, under such conditions, secondary data and information from other research and studies by stakeholders under the initiatives of government, non-state actors such as higher education institutions, CSOs, and research institutions have been referenced to in the formulation of the current VNR. Some research and studies were the results of collaboration between the government and non-state actors, including development partners, academicians, and CSOs. These suggest increased cooperation, collaboration, and ownership towards the 2021 VNR. 15 INDONESIA'S VNR 202116 3POLICY AND ENABLING ENVIRONMENT In the fifth year of SDGs implementation in Indonesia, commitment to achieving SDGs is stronger, from both government and non-state actors, mainstreamed to the village level. The stronger collective ownership among the stakeholders is a reflection of the implementation of the SDGs principles that are inclusive, participatory and transparent so as to foster mutual trust among all stakeholders. Thus, approaches initiated by the government in SDGs implementation have been supported by stakeholders, and SDGs is not only mainstreamed in development planning, but also in program planning of non-state actors. With the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to strengthen the enabling environment so that the implementation of the SDGs is in line with economic transformation agenda in response to the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. 3.1 BUILDING COLLECTIVE OWNERSHIP As a country that has reported VNR for the third time, Indonesia strives to ensure that the principles of SDGs that are inclusive, participative and transparent are always prioritized, better implemented and its quality continues to be improved. Maintaining collective ownership in the implementation of the SDGs is necessary as a reflection of Indonesia's commitment to SDGs implementation, demonstrating strong partnership among stakeholders. A. COORDINATION OF SDG s IMPLEMENTATION The SDGs National Coordination Team has been established since 2017 as mandated by the Presidential Regulation (Perpres) Number 59 Year 2017 on the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Four participation platforms consisting of (1) national and subnational governments, (2) civil society organizations, (3) philanthropy and business, and (4) academicians and experts, since 2017 have jointly demonstrated their contribution and cooperation in the implementation of the SDGs in Indonesia. 17 To create and build collective ownership, Indonesia has always involved all participation platforms in every process, from planning, implementing, monitoring, evaluating and reporting on the implementation of the SDGs. There is great enthusiasm of stakeholders to be involved in SDGs implementation, therefore the coordination mechanism implemented in the SDGs National Coordination Team is imperative. The tiered process of the Working Group (WG) for each development pillar and Sub-Working Group (Sub-WG) for each Goal, encourages stronger involvement of all stakeholders. Stakeholders can participate in several relevant pillars and several relevant sub-working groups simultaneously according to their own concern and interest. This mechanism is intended to continue to build trust and cooperation between stakeholders. This is also replicated at the subnational level through the SDGs Subnational Coordination Team. B. EVIDENCE OF INCLUSIVE COLLECTIVE OWNERSHIP Inclusive collective ownership that has been carried out by Indonesia, among others, in the following process: Planning, monitoring and reporting of the 2017-2019 National Action Plan (Rencana Aksi Nasional or RAN) as well as the 2017 and 2019 VNR reporting and the 2019 National SDGs Annual Report. The 2017-2019 RAN also included 108 action plans of non-state actors, and it is expected that this number will increase for the 2020-2024 RAN, which at the time of the preparation of 2021 VNR, was in the process of drafting. At the subnational level, shared ownership is reflected in the formulation of 29 SDGs Subnational Action Plans (Rencana Aksi Daerah or RAD) from a total of 34 provinces in Indonesia by the provincial level government together with district/city governments and their respective non-state actors. All SDGs RADs are stipulated by Governor Regulations. The remaining five provinces are currently in the process of finalizing its SDGs RADs. It is expected that soon all provinces will have their own SDGs RAD as a reference for the implementation of SDGs in subnational level and ensure that SDGs can be carried out immediately to the village level and as a National Movement. Some of the SDGs RADs were developed with support from SDGs Centers established in universities. There are currently 23 SDGs Centers established. This number has increased significantly compared to 2019 with 9 SDGs Centers. SDGs Centers, which are centers of excellence, have also contributed to the extensive dissemination of SDGs, in campus and off campus public outreach. With the integration of SDGs into the curriculum as the main course in several universities such as Padjadjaran University in West Java and Bengkulu University in Bengkulu, and it has also become a thematic in the student-based university community service programs (Kuliah Kerja Nyata or KKN) in several in Artha Wacana University Tenggara and Diponegoro University in Central Java. To further encourage the youth and the community in campus to understand about SDGs, 11 universities have had SDGs Campus Ambassadors since 2020. The role of Campus Ambassadors is to disseminate and promote SDGs in campus and off campus public outreach by implementing SDGs-related programs and activities in and off campus. The selection process for Campus Ambassadors was carried out at the same time as the 2020 Annual SDGs Conference. The preparation of 2021 VNR was also supported by academics and SDGs Centers, who actively provided input and recommendations for in-depth analysis. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 18 Figure 3.1. SDGs Centers (Data per April 2021) The commitment of the President of the Republic of Indonesia and the Indonesian government to implement SDGs to the grassroot level is demonstrated by the launch of Village SDGs by the Ministry of Villages, Development of Disadvantaged Areas and Transmigration in 2020. Village SDGs as a form of localization of SDGs will be able to reach the community down to the grassroots level. Thus, shared ownership of the achievement of the SDGs can be truly created and developed. The Philanthropy and Business Platform for SDGs has also shown their increased participation in the SDGs. Compared to VNR 2017 where Indonesia reported 11 associations with members of more than 700 companies involved in the Philanthropy and Business Platform for SDGs (Filantropi and Bisnis untuk SDGs or FBI4SDGs), in VNR 2019 and until now there has been 15 associations with members of more than 1500 companies. These 15 associations consist of organizations engaged in philanthropy, CSR and trade committees, employers' associations, and organizations covering companies with a similar focus, such as agriculture or oil and gas. The role of philanthropy and business actors is not only shown by the increasing number of associations involved in the SDGs but also their commitment to implementing sustainable programs and activities in their business process. With the issuance of the Financial Services Authority Regulation Number 51 Year 2017 (POJK Number 51/POJK.03/2017) on the Implementation of Sustainable Finance for Financial Service Institutions, Listed Companies, and Public Companies, companies are required to submit their Sustainability Report. Through these regulations and companies' Sustainability Reports, the Ministry of National Development Planning/National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas), Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan or OJK), the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI), and the FBI4SDGs supported by the Global Report Initiative (GRI) have prepared guidelines for companies to list their contribution to the implementation of the Indonesian SDGs within the SDGs Action Plan. The Guidelines for the Preparation of the SDGs Action Plan were also developed by both government and non-state actors in an inclusive manner. One of the users of this guideline is state-owned enterprises (SOEs) coordinated by the Ministry of SOEs to conduct training for more than 100 SOEs to be involved in the preparation of the Indonesia's 2020-2024 SDGs National Action Plan. 19 In Indonesia, with nearly 400,000 Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) at the national and subnational levels, the involvement and contribution of CSOs is significant in achieving the SDGs. Among the social organizations that are able to reach out to the community and even remote areas of Indonesia are faith based CSOs. Major Islamic religious organizations in Indonesia, such as Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah, have made SDGs an integrated part of their programs and activity plans at the community level. Apart from Islam, which is the largest religion in Indonesia, five other official religions in Indonesia, namely Christianity, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism, also have an important role in disseminating SDGs to their disciples. Youth organizations and organizations of people with disabilities are also actively involved in the implementation of SDGs in Indonesia. UNFPA and UNICEF Indonesia actively facilitate youth groups, including youth groups with disabilities, to disseminate SDGs and are involved in consultations for the preparation of VNR 2021. Youth organizations such as Kitong Bisa are among those that actively disseminate SDGs for youth in eastern parts of Indonesia such as Papua, West Papua, Maluku and North Maluku and the surrounding provinces. To support greater outreach of the dissemination of SDGs, the Minister of National Development Planning as the coordinator of SDGs implementation in Indonesia appointed 3 SDGs Ambassadors to represent 3 regions. They also support the dissemination of SDGs through their networks, advocacy to strengthen SDGs commitment at subnational levels, raising awareness and promoting their main areas of concern in regards to SDGs, such as religious tolerance, education and environmental pollution. Volunteers' contributions in Indonesia for acceleration of SDGs are significant. Volunteering survey was carried out by IndoRelawan and UNV covered 129 volunteer organizations and 351 volunteers across the country. The survey report shows the trends of volunteering, with various examples, in Indonesia between 2019 and early 2021 including in times of COVID-19 pandemic. It is the first if its kind report on volunteering in Indonesia produced through online survey conducted throughout the country. In the time frame between 2019 and the beginning of 2021, 31,91% spent less than 10 hours, 24,78% of respondents spent more than 90 hours in total when volunteering. The pandemic did not stop volunteers' spirit and actions. Most of volunteering activities during the COVID-19 were targeted at Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 4, Goal 16, and Goal 17 in the form of educational campaigns through social media (59,5%), distribution of health safety equipment (53,7%) and packages (52,4%), fundraising for the cause (42,9%), and conducting online classes (27,4%). All these efforts targeted poor communities, children, the elderly, vulnerable. Support from development partners is also important in the implementation of the SDGs in Indonesia, in the form of technical assistance, programs and studies. Support from development partners during 2020 include support in the preparation of National and Subnational Action Plans; development and analysis of Indonesian SDGs E-Monev which is integrated with the government's E-Monev; SDGs dashboard development and disaggregated data collection; development of Second Edition of Indonesian SDGs Indicator Metadata; encouraging participation of non-state actors, in this case, CSOs, in planning, implementing and monitoring and evaluation of the SDGs; and the development of SDGs Financing Hub and SDGs Bond. Other stakeholder playing an important role in the implementation of the SDGs in Indonesia are the Parliament and the Audit Board of the Republic of Indonesia ( Badan Pemeriksa Keuangan or BPK). The Indonesian parliament is also active in voicing the issue of sustainable development both in the internal parliament in Indonesia and in cooperation with other parliaments, including by hosting the World Parliamentary Forum on Sustainable Development. BPK Indonesia has been actively conducting audits of the preparation for the implementation of the SDGs in Indonesia and ensuring that BPK recommendations for improving the implementation of SDGs in Indonesia can be implemented. In the preparation of VNR Indonesia 2021, BPK conducts a review of the VNR preparation process with the aim of improving the quality of its analysis and reports. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 20 3.2 MAINSTREAMING SDGS INTO DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK In 2019, Indonesia intensively prepared a five-year development plan document for the 2020-2024 period. Indonesia ensures that more SDGs targets are mainstreamed Year 2017 include 94 SDGs targets that are mainstreamed in the RPJMN. In the 2020-2024 RPJMN, the number of SDGs targets that were mainstreamed is now 124. All 17 Goals have been mainstreamed in the seven Development Agenda 2020-2024. This is a reflection of the strong commitment of the Government of Indonesia to mainstream SDGs in development planning (Figure 3.2). Figure 3.2 Mainstreaming SDGs in the 2020-2024 RPJMN1 QUALITY AND COMPETITIVE HUMAN RESOURCE2 NATIONAL CHARACTER3 ECONOMIC RESILIENCE FOR QUALITY GROWTH4 REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EQUITY 5 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND BASIC SERVICES 6 STABILITY OF POLITICS, LAW, DEFENSE, SECURITY AND PUBLIC SERVICE TRANSFORMATION 7 ENVIRONMENT AND DISASTER RESILIENCEDEVELOPMENT AGENDA 2020-2024 21 METADATA Edition I The number of targets according to the RPJMN according to each pillar The number of targets according to the the 2015-2019 RPJMNThe number of targets according to the the 2020-2024 RPJMNMETADATA Edition II The number of targets according to the RPJMN according to each pillar SOCIAL PILLAR 25 TargetsSOCIAL PILLAR 38 Targets ECONOMIC PILLAR 30 TargetsECONOMIC PILLAR 37 Targets ENVIRONMENTAL PILLAR 31 TargetsENVIRONMENTAL PILLAR 38 Targets JUSTICE & GOVER- NANCE PILLAR 8 TargetsJUSTICE & GOVER- NANCE PILLAR 11 Targets 94 Targets124 TargetsFurthermore, Indonesia has also updated the Indonesian SDGs Indicator Metadata in the second edition in 2020 which is in accordance with the revision of the global metadata by UN STAT. This metadata is the basis for mainstreaming the SDGs in the RPJMN document. Figure 3.3 Updating Metadata for Indonesian SDGs Indicators By mainstreaming the SDGs targets into the RPJMN, annual programs and activities related to the achievement of the SDGs and their budget allocations are listed in the Government Work Plan ( Rencana Kerja Pemerintah or Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara or RAPBN). Thus, it is expected that the SDGs targets can be achieved by 2030, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. In line with the national level, subnational governments have also mainstreamed SDGs into their subnational medium-term development planning document that is in line with the tenure of the head of government in each province/district/city. SDGs mainstreaming in the development planning document is illustrated in the SDGs National Action Plan (RAN) and Subnational Action Plans (RADs). Currently, Indonesia is preparing its second SDGs RAN and there are 29 RADs at the provincial level which also contains programs and activities at the district/city level. Indonesia has specific guidelines for the preparation of the SDGs Action Plan for the national and subnational levels which also includes guidelines for all participation platforms. The guidelines for the preparation of the SDGs action plan have been updated in 2020. The second edition of the guideline provides more specific guidance for subnational governments in presenting their program of activities on a format different from the national government. The second edition of the guidelines also provides opportunity for business to present their programs and activities in a separate format from the format for civil society organizations and philanthropy, which in the first edition were displayed in the same format (Figure 3.4). Thus, Indonesia's SDGs action plan have accommodated all stakeholders. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 22 Following the updates of the guidelines for the preparation of action plans, the guidelines for monitoring, evaluation and reporting were also updated (Figure 3.5). This is to ensure that all stakeholders are involved in planning, implementing, monitoring, evaluating and reporting the SDGs in a more transparent and accountable manner. This mechanism is also intended to strengthen integration between Technical Guidelines for Preparation of Indonesian SDGs Action Plans Figure 3.5 Technical Guidelines for Monitoring and Evaluation of Indonesian SDGs The alignment of the SDGs with the 2015-2019 RPJMN has been reported in the SDGs Annual Report 2019. Of the 280 reported indicators and data available, 70% have been achieved with tendencies of improvement. Figure 3.6 Status of Achievement of the SDGs Indicators in 20197 IMPROVEDNEED ATTENTION Quality and Competitive Human Resource39 Indicators 23 Indicators 34 Indicators National Character 30 Indicators 9 Indicators 11 Indicators Economic resiliencefor quality growth6 Indicators 2 Indicators 8 Indicators Regional Developmentfor Equity24 Indicators 2 Indicators 16 Indicators Economic Development Infrastructure and Basic Services17 Indicators 6 Indicators 16 Indicators Stability of Politics, Law, Defense, Security and Public ServiceTransformation 17 Indicators23 Indicators9 Indicators Environment and DisasterResilience30 Indicators 8 Indicators 6 Indicators Total: 280 Indicators146 Indicators (52%)50 Indicators (18%)84 Indicators (30%) 23 By mainstreaming the SDGs at the subnational level that are in the Subnational Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMD), the SDGs are also included in the programs and activities in the SDGs RAD. The implementation of SDGs actions at the subnational level are monitored and evaluated based on the SDGs monitoring, evaluation and reporting guidelines. Each province reports SDGs monitoring every semester to be submitted to the SDGs National Coordination Team at the national level, and published to public through available media. The DKI Jakarta Government is one of the subnational governments that has mainstreamed the SDGs in its RPJMD and regularly reports every semester the monitoring of the implementation of SDGs achievement based on established guidelines and submit to the SDGs National Coordination Team for feedback. Mainstreaming SDGs up to the Village LevelMMainstreaming SDGs into development planning documents is a way to localize SDGs both at the national and subnational levels. With strong commitment in implementing the SDGs, having launched the Village SDGs, Indonesia continues to mainstream SDGs at village level. The Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas collaborates and coordinates with the Ministry of Home Affairs to ensure the mainstreaming of SDGs in the Provincial and District/City RPJMDs. Furthermore, working together with the Ministry of Villages, Development of Disadvantaged Areas, and Transmigration to ensure the implementation of SDGs to the community through the Village SDGs. With the number of villages in Indonesia totaling 74,954 (89%) of the total number of villages and sub-districts, namely 83,820 in 2019 (Statistics Indonesia and the Ministry of Villages, 2019), development in villages contributes significantly to the achievement of Indonesia's SDGs. It is estimated that villages are able to contribute 74% to the achievement of the SDGs in Indonesia, thus the Village SDGs program encourages SDGs mainstreaming in the planning and uses of the Village Fund is critical. 3.3 THE INTEGRATION OF THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF DEVELOPMENT Integration of economic, social and environmental dimensions is the key to achieving sustainable development. In order to carry out sustainable recovery and resilience from the COVID-19 pandemic for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, the synergy of achievement between the goals and targets in the VNR SDGs 2021 plays an important role. The national development agenda has focused on 4 priority policies carrying out sustainable recovery and resilience from the COVID-19 pandemic, namely (1) Recovery the Industry, Tourism and Investment towards a green economy; (2) Strengthened the disaster resilience system; (3) Strengthened national health system; and (4) Strengthened the social protection system. The four policies are expected to leverage the acceleration of sustainable recovery and resilience from the COVID-19 pandemic. Each policy contributes to the achievement of the SDGs Goals and Targets in the VNR which focuses on 9 (nine) Goals according to the VNR 2021 theme (Figure 3.7) Indonesia's 2021 VNR SDGs The nine goals under review in the 2021 VNR are part of the policy for achieving the VNR theme include: Goal 1 for No Poverty, Goal 2 for Zero Hunger, Goal 3 for Good Health and Well-Being, Goal 8 for Decent Work and Economic Growth, Goal 10 for Reduced Inequality, Goal 12 for Responsible Consumption and Production, Goal 13 for Climate Action, Goal 16 for Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions, and Goal 17 for Partnerships for the Goals. The results of the several studies show that the goals and targets of the SDGs are interrelated (Le Blanc 2015, Zhou and Moinuddin 2017, Bappenas 2018, Singh et al 2018, Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas 2019). Additionally, there is also a sectoral relationship among goals as summarized by Fran\u00e7ois Bourguignon which describes the relationship between economic growth, poverty and inequality or the growth-poverty-inequality triangle (8-1-10 triangle). Furthermore, each goal consists of various achievement targets in which the measurements are translated into SDGs indicators. The interrrelation among targets under one goal and targets with other targets in different goals has a more complicated relationship because it involves 169 targets in the 17 Goals. The illustration of the the interrelation between SDGs target in framework of the 2021 VNR is complicated because it involves 97 SDGs targets from goals under review. Based on this, the 2021 VNR framework is established with the 9 goals under review and selected 42 selected in regards to the 4 priority policies in carrying out sustainable recovery and resilience from the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. By referencing a study conducted by IGES (Zhou and Moinuddin 2017), which has also been used in the preparation of the Indonesian SDGs Roadmap Towards 2030 (Kurniawan 2019, Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas 2019), the linkages between SDGs targets of those under review in the 2021 VNR has been analyzed. The positive relations between targets and trade-offs of the 42 selected targets (light blue color) is presented in Figure 3.8.Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID- 19 pandemic for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda Reforms Industry Recovery, Tourism and Investment towards Green Economy National Health SystemSocial Protection System Disaster Resilience System 8.1 8.3 8.5 8.68.9Economic Growth.Micro, Small and Climate Change.2.12.22.32.4 2.a 2.cAccess to Food.

Some examples of this linkage include Goal 2 in ensuring access to food availability (Target 2.1) which supports the achievement of poverty alleviation (Targets 1.1 and 1.2). Other positive relations are on the information disclosure (Target 16.10), which can support data availability (Target 17.19), increase access for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to financial services (Target 8.3), and reduce unemployment (Targets 8.5 and 8.6). Meanwhile, the trade-offs between targets occurs in the efforts to maintain economic growth (Target 8.1), if the implementation is not green, it can negatively affect the sustainable food production system and infrastructure (Targets 2.4 and 2.a) which can increase pollution in the form of GHG (Figure 3.9). Based on the positive relations and trade-offs between these targets, relevant priority policies in the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic are aligned with several SDGs target achievements. Figure 3.9 Positive relations between targets (black line) and trade-offs (red line) INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 26 First, the social protection system policy to achieve Goal 1 for No Poverty and Goal 10 for Reduced Inequalities, especially in achieving targets for increasing social protection (Targets 1.3 and 10.4), as well as eradicating extreme poverty (Target 1.1) and reducing national poverty (Target 1.2), and reducing inequality (Target 10.1) is affected by the achievement of other SDGs targets. Some of the achievement of the SDGs targets that is related to the relevant policies include: efforts to guarantee access to food for the community (Target 2.1), eliminating all forms of malnutrition (Target 2.2), increasing food production and farmers' income (Target 2.3), improving maternal health (Target 3.1), increasing the proportion of health facilities that have a core set of relevan essential medicines (Target 3.b), sustaining economic growth (Target 8.1), in accordance with adequate data availability (Target 17.19), to strengthen capacity of disaster resilience (Target 13.1) and strengthen capacity of adaptation and mitigation to the impacts of climate change (Target 13.2). Furthermore, the achievement of the targets in Goal 1 is also influenced by anti-corruption (Target 16.5) and non-discrimination (Target 16.b), by accountable and good governance of government institutions (Target 16.6). This integrated policy also requires support of the state budget allocation to end poverty (Target 1.a) and increase the tax revenue ratio (Target 17.1) as its main source of financing. The government policy that has been implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is to immediately strengthen existing social assistance programs and create new programs related to social assistance. During 2020, the government provided at least an additional IDR 153 trillion (with a total of IDR 381 trillion or 13% of the APBN) funds for social protection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Another policy to reduce poverty rate during the pandemic is through the provision of social assistance through the Family Hope Program (Program Keluarga Harapan or PKH) to 10 million beneficiary families by 2020. During 2020, the aid index for each component was increased by 25%. The PKH provides access for poor families, especially pregnant women, school children, people with disabilities and the elderly to access health service facilities and educational service facilities available for them. Second, the national health system policy to support the achievement of Goal 3 for Good Health and Well-Being and Goal 2 Zero Hunger, especially on the target of reducing maternal mortality (Target 3.1), ending the incidence of TB and malaria (Target 3.3), reducing unmet need (Target 3.8) and increasing the proportion of health facilities (Target 3.b), accompanied by efforts to improve community food security (Targets 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.a) and fulfillment of community nutrition (Target 2.2) are also related to the achievement of targets in other SDGs Goals. Some of the achievement of the SDGs targets that is related to the relevant policies include: targets in improving social protection (Target 1.3), ensuring access to basic services (Target 1.4), sustaining economic growth (Target 8.1), increasing MSME access to financial services (Target 8.3), reducing unemployment (Target 8.5), reducing inequality (Target 10.1), to encourage the growth of non-oil and gas exports (Target 17.11), especially for the marketing of agricultural products. Capacity for disaster resilience (Target 13.1) and adaptation and mitigation capacity to the impacts of climate change (Target 13.2) can affect food security (Targets 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.a) as well as reduce and manage national and global health risk (Target 3.d). This policy must also be managed properly, free from corruption (Target 16.5) by accountable and good governance of government institutions (Target 16.6). In 27 addition, this policy requires internet support (Targets 17.6 and 17.8) both as a facility for weather information and marketing on food issues, as well as a facility of information and communication on health issues. The policies that have been implemented by the government include prioritizing the fulfillment of food needs from domestic production in a sustainable manner. The food production process involves 27.68 million households of agricultural business ( Rumah Tangga Usaha Pertanian or RTUP) that work in the sub-sectors of food crops, horticulture, plantations, animal husbandry, fisheries and forestry. As much as 10.34% of the RTUP are headed by women. It is expected that RUTPs can provide food from domestic production while improving the welfare of the community, especially vulnerable groups. Meanwhile, on health issues, the government has included \"Accelerate the Reduction of Maternal Mortality and Stunting\" as one of the strategic priority projects in the national development agenda. The funds allocated for this project are IDR187.1 trillion. Moreover, to meet the availability and distribution of health workers, 4,588 teams and 9,211 health workers have been deployed through the Nusantara Sehat scheme. Third, policies for recovery of industry, tourism and investment towards a green economy to support the achievement of Goal 8 for Decent Work and Economic Growth and Goal 12 for Responsible Consumption and Production, especially on targets for sustaining economic growth, developing sectors of employment and tourism (Targets 8.1, 8.3, 8.5, 8.6, 8.9), and the adopting of sustainable consumption and production patterns (Targets 12.4, 12.6, 12.8) are also related to the achievement of other SDGs targets. Some of the SDGs target achievements that is related to the relevant policies include: increasing sustainable food production (Targets 2.3, 2.4), increasing information disclosure (Target 16.10), implementing non-discrimination policies (Target 16.b), increasing tax ratios (Target 17.1), increasing non-oil and gas exports (Target 17.11), and increasing data availability (Target 17.19). Policies that have been implemented by the government include increasing economic value added; strengthening economic growth, productivity and competitiveness. One of them, in the tourism sector, 10 Priority Tourist Destinations (Destinasi Wisata Prioritas or DPP) have been accelerated, some of which have become world heritage, such as Lake Toba and its surroundings, Raja Ampat, Lombok-Mandalika, Bangka Belitung, as well as the development of 8 other potential tourism destinations, such as Banyuwangi, Bukittinggi-Padang, Batam-Bintan, and Bandung-Halimun-Ciletuh. It is expected that this help boost the community's economy, especially those obtained in a green manner. In order to increase productive employment opportunities and decent work, the government has allocated in the State Budget for the pre-employment card program of around IDR 20 trillion. This program aims to help 5.6 million informal workers, job seekers and workers who have experienced layoffs and owners of micro or small businesses. Moreover, wage subsidies of IDR. 29.4 trillion were provided to 12.24 million workers who received a maximum wage of IDR. 5 million per month. Regarding MSMEs affected by the pandemic, IDR. 34.15 trillion was allocated for 60.66 million accounts to loosen debt payments and credit interest subsidies through people's business credit ( Kredit Usaha Rakyat membina ekonomi keluarga sejahtera or fostering a prosperous family economy), banking and private housing loan providers. Meanwhile, efforts to implement sustainable consumption and production, especially in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, are carried out through management of hazardous and toxic medical waste and general waste. In 2020, medical waste treatment facilities were built in Aceh (300 kg/hour capacity), West Sumatra (300 kg/hour), South East Nusa Tenggara (150 kg/hour). Fourth, the disaster resilience system policy to support the achievement of Goal 13 on Climate Action, especially on the targets in increasing capacity of disaster resilience (Target 13.1) and capacity of adaptation and mitigation to the impacts of climate change (Target 13.2) are also related to the achievement of other SDGs targets. Some of the achievement of the SDGs targets that is related to the relevant policies include: increasing sustainable food production (Targets 2.3, 2.4), increasing economic growth (Targets 8.1, 8.3, 8.5, 8.6, 8.9), reducing inequality (Target 10.1) and increasing social protection (Target 10.4) which is properly managed and free from corruption (Target 16.5) by accountable and good governance of government institutions (Target 16.6) supported by increased information disclosure (Target 16.10). Moreover, disaster preparedness requires adequate internet support (Targets 17.6 and 17.8) and increased data availability (Target 17.19). Policies to reduce community vulnerability to disasters through improving community welfare with economic activities that are not green, often generate trade-offs. Efforts to reduce the trade-offs for achieving the SDGs includes the low carbon development initiatives (LCDI) and climate resilience development (CRD) towards green economy in the national development agenda. The Low Carbon Development Initiative Report shows that the LCDI and CRD can produce a projected economic growth of 6% per year by 2045 while reducing poverty, creating jobs and reducing air pollution. Furthermore, this policy is estimated to prevent the loss of 16 million hectares of forest land, reduce GHG emissions and improve air quality while reducing the potential for thousands of deaths due to pollution each year. Job creation is estimated at 15 million jobs, so that it is quite significant in increasing the standard of living of the community. Meanwhile, in the macroeconomic context, it is estimated that it will be able to reduce the ratio of investment to GDP with an additional GDP of more than USD 5.4 trillion which in turn will encourage GDP growth of 6% per year (Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas, 2021). 3.4 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NO ONE LEFT BEHIND PRINCIPLE With the increasing ownership of SDGs in Indonesia, the efforts to ensure the implementation of leaving no one behind is everyone's responsibility. Moreover, in the COVID-19 pandemic situation, policy responses are prioritizing vulnerable groups, which requires the involvement of all stakeholders. The implementation of SDG 16+ which emphasizes justice, no discrimination, and good governance applies to all of the other Goals, in particular the nine Goals which are under review in VNR 2021, are becoming increasingly important in times of pandemic. A. FOCUS ON VULNERABLE GROUPS The crucial aspect in implementing the no one left behind principle is ensuring the provision of disaggregated data so that government intervention in efforts for sustainable recovery and resilience from the COVID-19 pandemic is targeted for those most in need. The National Committee for the COVID-19 Response and Economic Recovery ( Pemulihan Ekonomi Nasional or PEN) together with the COVID-19 Task Force (Satgas COVID-19) ensures integrated data covering all affected groups and communities, especially vulnerable groups, in the form of social assistance to poor families, workers or laborers affected by lay-offs, electricity subsidies, and assistance for Small and Micro Enterprises (SMEs). Assistance has also been strengthened to groups of people with disabilities and elderly groups, especially those who work in the informal sector as recipients of the distribution of the COVID-19 stimulus in the form of the PKH program and basic 29 food assistance. Assistance is also provided to children and youth with \"School from Home\" or Distance Learning ( Pembelajaran Jarak Jauh or PJJ) in the form of internet packages to 39.78 million pupils and 8.24 million university students. All of these efforts are intended to ensure that no one is left behind in development, especially amid the COVID-19. B. DATA TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND Although in previous years Indonesia has made a lot of progress in development, gaps still exist and in the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic these gaps are widening. Strengthened efforts are needed to make sure comprehensive information and data on the inequality experienced by vulnerable groups is recorded in the main statistics in Indonesia. Therefore, the inclusion of children, adolescents, youth, women, elderly groups, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups in the policy monitoring can be assured, especially during the pandemic. The challenges in overcoming inequality, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, is illustrated in three types of vulnerability. At the first level, inequality is due to limited access to basic services and economic opportunities. This occurs due to poverty and remoteness, which is reflected the income inequality and regional disparity. At the second level, inequality occurs due to the unpreparedness for public services to reach all people without discrimination. In Indonesia, the quality and capacity of public services in responding to the needs of vulnerable groups varies. At the third level, inequality is experienced by those who are systematically marginalized due to their socio-economic status, such as women, children, persons with disabilities, and groups with certain religious and ethnic identities. The deeper the layers of inequality, the more difficult it will be for the Government to obtain adequate data and information as a basis for designing inclusive responses and recovery. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the policy priorities aimed at vulnerable groups are more expansive, considering that more people are now vulnerable due to the COVID-19 pandemic, depending on the policies as its response. Policies that are specifically targeted to vulnerable groups can reduce vulnerabilities that existed before the COVID-19 pandemic. In mitigating the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency responses, recovery services and inclusive, responsive and accountable governance is the foundation for carrying out the pandemic response and prevention that support inequality reduction. The role of Goal 16 as an enabler to ensure that no one is left behind becomes highly significant in achieving justice and equity for vulnerable and excluded groups. For this reason, responding to data limitations down to the smallest unit is critical. Since VNR 2019, Indonesia has reported that the Small Area Estimation (SAE) is one of the efforts to obtain data on the smallest administrative area. This is because the implementation of the household survey conducted by the Statistics Indonesia has a limited sample, making it impossible to obtain certain SDGs indicator data at the district/city level with sufficient accuracy, for example the relative standard error (RSE) value reaches a value of more than 25%. Initiative for measurement using SAE has been carried out since 2017, which was measured in 2019 and 2020. In 2020, with limitations due to the COVID-2019 pandemic, the suitability of the results of SAE in district/city level cannot be verified on the field. The calculation training using the SAE technique that was conducted in 2019 resulted in 56 SDGs indicators for the district/city level. The calculation of the SDGs indicators using the SAE technique will continue in 2020 with the support of UNICEF, which results in additional calculations of 13 SDGs indicators as well as 6 sub-district level performance indicators such as indicators of poverty, unemployment, Human Development Index (HDI), migration, and economic growth. Statistics Indonesia also collaborated with the INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 30 Food Security Agency and support from WFP using the SAE method to calculate down to the sub- district level for indicators of Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) and Desirable Dietary Pattern. 3.5 INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM Since 2017, Indonesia has established the SDGs National Coordination Team ( Tim Koordinasi Nasional or TKN) consisting of a Steering Committee, Implementing Team, Working Group, Sub-Working Group and Expert Team, each comprising of four participation platforms. The involvement of non-state actors is not limited to those who are members of the TKN or the Subnational Coordination Team (Tim Koordinasi Daerah or TKD). From the many existing non-state actors, the nominations for representatives of TKN members are selected among non-state actors themselves in representing their interests and issues. Although the institutional mechanism has been formally established, however, in every process of implementing the SDGs, the roles and contributions of all stakeholders are not limited to TKN members, in which all stakeholders can participate and contribute in planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and reporting. This is to ensure that the principles of inclusion, participation and transparency are implemented to foster and maintain trust among the parties. Figure 3.10 SDGs National Coordination Team 31 Apart from the national level, at the subnational level the involvement and role of all stakeholders is also strengthened by the establishment of a Subnational Coordination Team (TKD) which is stipulated by a Governor Regulation. There are 29 TKDs at the provincial level from total of 34 provinces in Indonesia which also involve non-state actors from philanthropy and business, academicians and civil society organizations. 3.6 S TRUCTURAL ISSUES \"Currently, achieving the SDGs target is more challenging. The pandemic caused a health and economic crisis that hampered the achievements of our SDGs, and also on the global level. However, this challenge should not dampen our enthusiasm and should not lower our SDGs target. We have to find new ways, we have to find new breakthroughs, so that we can take a leap in achieving the SDGs targets\" (Speech of the President of the Republic of Indonesia, SDGs Annual Conference 2020 Indonesia, 17 December 2020) The speech of the President of the Republic of Indonesia - Joko Widodo, at the 2020 SDGs Annual Conference Indonesia which was held on December 17, 2020, is a reflection that the efforts of Indonesia's commitment to achieving the SDGs targets will not be reduced even though the COVID-19 pandemic affects the achievement of the SDGs in 2020. Indonesia continues efforts in achieving Indonesia's vision for 2045 despite the COVID-19 pandemic, including the achievement of the SDGs targets. In his State Address on August 16, 2020, a day before the commemoration of Indonesian Independent Day, the President of the Republic of Indonesia Joko Widodo emphasized \"This is the time for us to fundamentally improve, make major transformations, implement big strategies. Major strategies in the fields of economy, law, government, social, culture, including health and education. It is time for us to hack the momentum of this crisis to take big leaps. At the age of 75 this year, we have become an upper middle-income country. And, 25 years from now, at a century-old of the Republic of Indonesia, we must achieve great progress, making Indonesia a developed country\" Likewise, other countries believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is a \"wake up call\" to be better. Indonesia believes that \"Build Forward Better\" or \"Building a Better Future\" is a must and the SDGs is a framework that can be a direction for sustainable development for future generations. Indonesia uses the pandemic as a trigger to become \"game changer\" by making transformations in the health system, accelerating automation and digitization, increasing the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data, following changes in the Global Value Chain, preparing for an increase in telework trends, and implementing Green Recovery. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Indonesia needs a redesign of economic transformation. Business as usual without economic transformation, Indonesia's potential economic growth will continue to fall below 5 percent (5%) and the level of productivity (Total Factor Productivity) will continue to decline and could become the lowest in regional Asia. Indonesia needs a growth of 6 percent (6%) to escape the middle-income trap before and becoming a developed country before 2045. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 32 Redesign of Indonesia's economic transformation is also required to bring Indonesia's poverty level back to single digit and and reduce vulnerability of Indonesia's population to poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the poverty rate in Indonesia to return to double-digit levels or to 10.19% in September 2020 compared to 9.22% in September 2019. Currently 140 million (53%) of Indonesia's population are still vulnerable to poverty, especially those who are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Indonesia continues efforts in economic transformation, for economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and economic trajectory. Economic transformation is carried out to ensure a longer-term recovery that meets both demand and production side, such as increased level, capital and labor productivity. Economic transformation should utilize SDGs as the framework for integrating planning and implementation in the medium-long-term development plan that uses the approach of multi-stakeholder, multi-sectoral, harmonized and aligned among regions, and across all levels of government administration. Indonesia is also working to develop new sources of growth that are not dependent on natural resources. Creative economy or sustainable tourism will be developed in line with improving conditions amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Biodiversity economy and the knowledge and services sector will be further developed in underdeveloped areas for inclusive and sustainable job creation. 33 INDONESIA'S VNR 202134 4ACHIEVEMENT PROGRESS OF SDG s GOALS AND TARGETS 4.1. VOLUNTARY NATIONAL R EVIEW (VNR) 2021 Overall, the annual achievement of SDG targets from 2016 to 2019 has been encouraging. Targets of SDG indicators can be achieved gradually, although strengthened efforts are needed to achieve several targets. The achievement can also be observed from the ongoing intervention and policy innovation that have been continuously carried out through various government flagship programs and supports from all SDGs' actors, including the private sector, philanthropy, civil society organizations, academic, and all communities. Reporting the progress of SDGs achievement in 2021 takes into consideration the situation of the global COVID-19 pandemic that has hit the world includes Indonesia, with no exception. Since the first COVID-19 case was officially announced on March 2, 2020, the Government of Indonesia together with development partners and civil society have immediately prioritized the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is worth noting that at that time, there was no government have experienced an epidemic crisis of this scale in the 21st century. Indonesia also has no previous experience, although the country has built quite a lot of infrastructure and strengthened the governance for managing and preventing natural disasters. The crisis that originally started with the spread of the SARS COV- 2 virus, quickly expanded into an economic and social crisis. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic is directly and indirectly related to the obstruction of the creation of a peaceful society; access to justice without exception; and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions. Therefore, the development goals to reduce poverty (SDG 1) and inequality (SDG 10), end hunger (SDG 2), ensure health and well-being (SDG 3), promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth (SDG 8) and sustainable consumption and production (SDG 12), and efforts 35 to address the impacts of climate change (SDG 13), on the basis of peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG 16), supported by partnerships for the goals (SDG 17) reported in this voluntary national review. VNR 2021 becomes very strategic to see how far the SDGs achievement has been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This chapter presents the discussions of goals under review in the 2021 VNR, namely Goal 1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 13, 16, and 17. This report refers to the VNR 2021 theme of \"Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic for the achievement of the 2030 agenda.\" For each goal under review, it describes the trend of SDGs' achievement at least in the last five years, with analysis on the policy that plays a role in the target achievement. Furthermore, it describes the condition of SDGs' achievement during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, to see how the pandemic has disrupted the progress of SDGs. Each goal also discusses challenges of the SDGs' achievement gap as well as emerging issues and actions to overcome the challenges including the good practices. Finally, each goal elaborates various policy response to at least recover the SDGs' achievement that has been disrupted by the pandemic, or even better, to accelerate the progress to achieve SDGs targets. The whole discussion in Chapter 4 pays attention to the principles of inclusive and no one left behind. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 36 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 calls for an end to poverty in all its manifestation. This agenda is translated into various targets and indicators. In terms of SDG 1 achievement as well as other SDGs goal, the year 2020 has been different since the COVID-19 pandemic has hit the world, including Indonesia and triggered a multi-dimensional crisis. A. TREND ANALYSIS AND IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 1. ABSOLUTE POVERTY a. Poverty rate based on the national poverty line From 2015 to 2020, four years after the SDGs were inaugurated in September 2015, the Indonesian poverty rate based on the national poverty line decreased from 11.13% in 2015 to 9.22% in 2019. The annual rate reduction was 0.48%. The year 2018 was an important milestone for Indonesia as the poverty rate has touched a single-digit figure for the first time. Figure Error!

However, since poverty reduction is getting more difficult (the so-called the last mile problem), the reduction rate of 0.48% per year can be considered progressive. There are several factors contribute to the consistent reduction in poverty (before COVID-19). First the stable economic growth. Consistent and stable growth before the pandemic has been a major factor in reducing the incidence of poverty. Second, consistent decrease in inequality during the 2015-2019 period. Economic growth an d a reduction in inequality are signs of inclusive economic growth where the poor have b enefited sufficiently from this growth. Third , the Government's social assistance programs targeted to the poor. From 2015 to 2019, g overnment spending allocated for social assistance has doubled, from only 0.47% of GDP in 2 015 to 0.94% of GDP. b. Poverty rate based on the PPP international poverty line of $ 1.9 per person per day In line with the reduction of poverty rate based on the national poverty line, the extreme poverty rate decreased from 7.2% in 2015 to 3.7% in 2019. Interestingly, the annual reduction rate in the extreme poverty is much faster than the annual reduction rate in poverty rate at the national poverty line. For four years, the annual reduction rate in the extreme poverty was -0.87%. At this rate, eliminating extreme poverty is quite feasible in the short-term. It could be the reason for the recent Government's aspiration of extreme poverty eradication in 2024. To a large extent, the rapid reduction of extreme poverty can be attributed to the expansion of government social assistance, especially the family hope program (PKH). c. Poverty rate by gender In 2019, the poverty rate for women (9.6%) was slightly higher than men (9.2%), but during 2015-2019 the annual reduction rate in the poverty rate for women (-0.47% per year) was slightly faster than for men (-0.4% per year). d. Poverty rate by area of residence There was a significant difference in poverty rate between urban and rural areas. From 2015 to 2019, poverty rate in rural area was almost twice as high as the urban's poverty rate. The development of rural areas needs to be taken seriously to reduce poverty in a sustainable manner. In the last five years, the poverty rate worsened at least twice (Figure 4.3.(b)). First, in 2015 when there was an increase in poverty in rural areas, by 0.33 percentage points from the previous year. This condition may be affected by the policy transition from PNPM (National Community Empowerment Program in rural areas) to Dana Desa (Village Fund). Second, in 2020 when there was an increase in urban poverty by 1.32 percentage points from the previous year (September 2019), largely due to the impact of the imposition of the Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) policy to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Poverty rates by age group In 2019, the poverty rate in the population aged under 18 years was much higher (11.8%) than the population aged 18 years and over (8.3%). However, the reduction rate in the poverty rate of the two groups during 2015-2019 was similar. The poverty rate has decreased by 1.4% over the four years for both groups, so that there is no convergence. Figure 4.4 Poverty rates by age (<18 years and 18 years) Source: Core Susenas (Statistics Indonesia) Figure 4.5 Trends in the poverty rate of the elderly ( 60) and non-elderly (<60) population Source: Core Susenas (Statistics Indonesia) Figure 4.5 shows that the poverty rate in elderly (population aged 60 years and over) is higher than the national poverty rate and the poverty rate for non-elderly population 1. It indicates that elderly poverty contributes to the national poverty rate. Therefore, reducing the poverty rate in elderly will help achieving the target of poverty eradication by 2030 through the expansion of social assistance and social insurance coverage, such as the expansion of BPJS Pension Security and Old-Age Security. 1 National Socio -Economic Survey (Susenas) data also shows that according to age group, it can also be seen that the older the elderly, the higher the poverty level. In 2019, the poverty rate for elderly people 80 years and over was about twice the poverty rate for young seniors 60-69 years). INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 40 BOX 4.1 FINANCING SOURCES FOR THE ELDERLY Generally, the source of household financing come from income earned by working household members. The role of transfers (money/goods), especially from the return to investments and pensions, is relatively small. For the elderly, various financing sources can be seen in the figure below. It shows how the dependence of elderly women on transfers is higher than men and this dependence increases at older ages. For the younger elderly, the source of household financing generally comes from their own income or from working household members. The older elderly relies more on transfers from children and other family members. The COVID-19 pandemic raises concerns regarding the ability of children and other relatives to continously making transfers to their parents. Therefore, the Government is undertaking social protection reforms to expand the coverage of social insurance for employment programme for formal and informal workers in parallel with the improvement of targeting of social assistance program, especially for the elderly population. There are still many rooms to improve social protection, such as health insurance targeted for the elderly.

This effort needs to be appreciated. However, the targeting accuracy of premium assistance beneficiaries (PBI) still needs to be improved. Only 54 per cent of the elderly from the lowest 40% group received premium assistance for health insurance from the government (PBI). Moreover, there are still cases where the elderly population from the upper-middle income group receive premium assistance. Only 23% of all elderly (60 year and above) whose health insurance premiums are paid by themselves. There are eight per cent of the poor also pay their premiums. The number of people who pay their own contribution to health insurance is greater among the middle and richest group. This information can be used to improve the targeting accuracy further. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 42 BOX 4.2 CHILD POVERTY2 Using a microsimulation method, UNICEF and the Fiscal Policy Agency of the Ministry of Finance analysed the impact of COVID-19 on child poverty and how social protection programs may mitigate the impact. The analysis shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed an additional 1.3 million children into poverty. Meanwhile, the level of vulnerability (defined as children living above the poverty line but less than 1.5 times the poverty line) increases by two million children. The scenario that takes social protection into account shows that the average poverty rate for children will fall to 10 per cent, 3.5% lower than the scenario with no mitigation measures. 2 Sour ce: BKF & UNICEF (2020), Policy Brief on the Impact of COVID-19 on Poverty and Child Mobility in Indonesia Url: https://www.unicef.org/indonesia/id/coronavirus/leport/ringkasan-keb-Policy-dampak-covid-19-poverty-mobility-chil- dren The impact of COVID-19 and the policy response to child poverty Source: BKF and UNICEF (2020)Child Poverty Rate Child Vulnerability Rate 43 Changes in poverty in certain periods can be driven by two main factors: economic growth and inequality changes. Poverty will decrease rapidly if economic growth is high and inequality is reduced because this indicates that economic growth is benefitting the poor. On the other hand, if economic growth is declined and inequality is increased, then poverty will increase quite drastically. The second case is predicted to happen during the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused inequality widening in society since the lower socioeconomic status groups (such as informal workers) have been more severely affected than upper socioeconomic status groups (such as those who are still working from home). The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has disrupted the progress of poverty reduction, and as a result, Indonesia's poverty rate in 2020 has returned to more or less equal to the poverty rate in 2017 (three years setback). The similar situation occurs in the extreme poverty rate. The extreme poverty rate was 3.7% in 2019, but in 2020 it increased to 4.2%. It was more or less equivalent to the extreme poverty rate in 2018. The COVID-19 crisis also had a heterogeneous impact on the increasing poverty. For example, men experienced a greater increase in the poverty rate (0.4%) than women (0.3%). Population aged under 18 years experienced an increase in the poverty rate by 0.5%, but the increase in population aged 18 years and over was only 0.3%. It shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has a greater impact on the well-being of young people. Figure 4.6 Change in the number of urban poor people September 2019-September 2020 (thousand) Source: Statistics Indonesia During the COVID-19 pandemic (from September 2019 to September 2020), poverty increased from 9.22% to 10.19%. Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas' analysis shows that the increase in the number of poor people due to the COVID-19 pandemic could have been larger if the Government did not intervene through extensive social assistance. Within one year, there was an increase in the number of poor people by 2.7 million people nationally. Of these 2.7 million people, 2.2 million (79%) live in urban areas (Figure 4.6). It is consistent with the fact that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is more intensive in cities. Of the 2.2 million people, nearly 80% (1.7 million people) live in densely populated provinces in Java Island. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 44 Figure 4.7 Correlation between mobility and urban poverty rise (%) Source: Statistics Indonesia Figure 4.7 also shows that provinces experiencing a decrease in mobility (in this case, to the workplace) due to the imposition of Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) tend to experience a higher increase in poverty rates.

Various indicators related to the poverty experienced a setback by 1.1 years to 3.1 years. Poverty rate at national poverty line experienced the largest setback (3.1 years), followed by poverty among population aged 18 years and over (2.2 years). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government quickly responded to the potential impact on poverty by commissioning the National Economic Recovery Program. The Government started by strengthening the existing social assistance programs (through expanding targets and increasing the amount of assistance), creating special programs and indirectly assist the poor through various other economic recovery programs. Table 4.1 provides a list of the various government programs to mitigate the social impact of the pandemic with comparison to existing programs (before COVID-19). Overall, during the year 2020, the Government provided at least an additional IDR 153 trillion (out of a total IDR 381 trillion) of funds for social protection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the simulation conducted by the Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas, without additional intervention from the Government, the COVID-19 pandemic would have increased the number of poor people by 5.2 million, or an increase of 1.9% points compared to the position in September 2019. However, considering the various government programs, especially social assistance, the poverty rate can be reduced within the range of 9.7-10.2% by the end of 2020. One of the Government's programs to reduce poverty rate during a pandemic is through social assistance through the Family Hope Program (PKH) to 10 million beneficiary families by 2020. In 2020, the size of the assistance was increased by 25 % than previous scheme. PKH improves access for poor families, especially pregnant women, children, people with disabilities and the elderly, to health and education service facilities. The distribution of the PKH program was concentrated in a poor family in Java, East Java and Central Java (Figure 4.9). Initiatives to overcome hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic also came from non-government institutions and communities.

POVERTY IN VARIOUS DIMENSIONS a. Inadequate food consumption and morbidity The prevalence of undernourishment continued to decrease from 10.73% in 2015 to 7.63% in 2019, then rose again to 8.34% in 2020. There was a decline of -3% for four years or, on average - 0.75% per year. However, there remains a gap in the progress between the bottom 40% of the population and the better-off groups in 2017-2020. In 2020, the prevalence of undernourishment in vulnerable groups was almost 4% points higher than the national average and almost 10% points higher than the richest group. The percentage of the population experiencing health problems decreased from 16.4% in 2015 to 15.4% in 2019. During the five years, the reduction was 1.74% or an average of -0.185% per year. This progress appears to be relatively slow compared to other indicators such as food consumption or poverty rates. During the 2017-2020 period (Figure 4.11), there was slow progress in the reduction of prevalence of undernourishment, especially for the bottom 40%. In 2017, the prevalence was 12.6%, and in 2020 it stood at 12.3%. This condition might be attributed to least two factors: the slow progress before the COVID-19 pandemic and the large adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is quite alarming. Across all socioeconomic status groups, the prevalence of undernourishment increased rapidly from 2019 to 2020. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 50 Figure Error!

Percentage of households without access to electricity During the 2015-2019 period, the proportion of households without access to electricity has declined. Households who did not have access to electricity decrease from 2.5% in 2015 to only 1.15% in 2019. Access to electricity is a basic need and a necessary means to move out of poverty. However, access to electrification has not been equally distributed among the socioeconomic group. The poorest group (quintile 1), for example, still has the most limited access to electricity compared to other groups.In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of undernourishment increased by almost 1%. The increase in the prevalence of undernourishment during the COVID-19 pandemic period is quite severe because the 2020 prevalence rate is equivalent to the prevalence rate in 2016 or 4 years (3.7 years to be precise). The increase in prevalence of undernourishment during COVID-19 might be attributed to the disruption of food supply chains and loss of income due to COVID-19 that affected the insufficient food consumption to meet the minimum dietary energy requirement. Meanwhile, during 2020 (COVID-19), the morbidity rate was stable. Morbidity 51 Figure Error!

Ownership of a birth certificate Birth certificate is essential for accessing various social protection programs. There has been considerable progress over the five years (2015 to 2019) in reducing the percentage of the population aged 0-17 who do not have a birth certificate. The population who did not have a birth certificate decrease by 8.4% in just five years, from almost 20% in 2015 to only 11.7% in in 2020. Recent data suggests that there has been no disruption in the progress of birth certificate ownership during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Years of schooling by based on socioeconomic status Years of schooling for the poorest (bottom 20%) are still much lower than the richest group (top 20%). In 2020, years of schooling for the top 20% group was 11.4 years, while the bottom 20% was only 7.0 years. However, during the 2015-2020 period, the increase in years of schooling for the lowest 20% group was 13%, much progressive than the top 20% group which was only 1.5%. This indicates the tendency for smaller gap or convergence to occur. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no significant disruption to the improvement of years of schooling across socioeconomic groups Similarly, the gap of school continuation rate between the poorest groups (particularly the bottom 20%) and other expenditure quintiles has been widening for junior and senior secondary education level. It means that the equal opportunity for children from lower socioeconomic status to achieve their schooling potential remains a challenge. In the long run, this condition may hinder the agenda of poverty reduction. Figure 4.15 Years of Schooling by Expenditure Group (years) Source: Core Susenas (Statistics Indonesia) Figure Error!

BASIC SERVICES Access to basic services has yet to reach universality. Access to basic sanitation services has reached 79.5%, and access to basic hygiene facilities3 has reached 78.3% (2020). However, the proportion of households with access to drinking water services4 that is safely managed from a physical aspect is still less than half (42.3%). In addition, there is still a notable gap between the poor and rich population in terms of access to basic services. Households from the bottom 40% group still have considerably lower access than middle-and top-income groups, especially for basic sanitation services and basic hygiene facilities. Meanwhile, there is no longer gap in the access to drinking water services. This relatively equal access was achieved through various community-based drinking water supply programs and expansion of water distribution connections for low-income communities. A relatively encouraging trend is access to basic sanitation services, which shows a significant increase from 2015 (61.6%) to 2020 (79.5%). 3 Access to basic hy giene facilities refers to the availability of hand washing facilities with soap and water. 4 Access to drinking w ater services is measured as the use of drinking water from improved water sources, located on premises, available when needed (no shortage within 24 hours), and meet the quality requirement of free of physical contamination (not cloudy, colored, or foamy). Therefore, it can be categorized as access to safely managed drinking water services from a physical aspect.Figure 4.17 Proportion of population/household with access to basic services Source: Core Susenas (Statistics Indonesia) Figure Error!

However, it appears that the gap has drastically declined during the 2015 to 2020 period. The gap in access to basic sanitation services between urban and rural areas has decreased from almost 30% in 2015 to only 10% in 2020. However, there was no significant gap between urban-rural gap in terms of access to drinking water services and basic hygiene facilities Figure 4.19 Proportion of population/household with access to basic services by expenditure quintile Source: Core Susenas (Statistics Indonesia) Figure Error!

The gap is quite notable in terms of access to basic sanitation services. In 2020, for example, access to basic sanitation services in the bottom 20% of the population was 66%, while in the richest 20% group the access was almost 90%. However, the gap in access between the bottom 20% and the top 20% groups seems to decline over time. The gap between these two groups has decreased from 40% in 2015 to 20% in 2020. Meanwhile, access to basic hygiene facilities still shows some disparity, but not as big a disparity in access to basic sanitation services. The gap in access to basic sanitation services and basic hygiene facilities also seems to decline over time. Figure 4.20 Proportion of population/household with access to basic services by expenditure quintile Source: Core Susenas (Statistics Indonesia) Looking at the bottom 40% of the population, it appears that there have been fairly consistent improvements in access to drinking water services and access to basic sanitation services. However, improvements in access to basic hygiene facilities tended to be stagnant, especially in the last three years (2018-2020). From 2015 to 2019, there was a slight decrease in households with self-owned houses (from 82.63% to 80.1%) and an increase in the proportion of households living in rented houses (from 8.08% to 9.27. %). During the 2018-2020 period, the proportion of people from the bottom 40% groups who own houses tended to be higher than those of the middle-and richest income groups. Households who live in rented houses are concentrated among the richest 20% of the population. This phenomenon may have been related to urbanization, where people who migrate to cities decide to rent houses because owning a house is more expensive. Moreover, it is also likely that living in big cities is more consistent with renting instead of owning property. Figure Error!

VULNERABILITY TO DISASTERS The trend in the number of victims who died and missing due to disasters (per 100,000 people) during 2015-2020 has not changed significantly if victims of the COVID-19 pandemic are not included. The year 2018 is rather notable because there was quite a significant increase in the number of victims who died and missing due to disasters. Based on National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB) data in BPS report (2020) 5, this happened because, in 2018, more than five major natural disasters occurred in Indonesia, including landslides in Central Java (Brebes), earthquakes in West Nusa Tenggara, flash floods in North Sumatra (Mandailing), and earthquakes in Sulawesi (Palu and Donggala). In 2020, taking into account excess deaths associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of dead and missing victims increased significantly from 0.15 per 100,000 to 8.34 per 100,000 people. 5 BPS (2020), Sus tainable Development Indicators59 Figure Error!

Proportion of government spending/spending on basic services and social protection The proportion of government spending on social protection (of the total government expenditure) in 2019 was already larger than in 2015. In 2019 the proportion of government expenditure on social protection was 16.4%, significantly higher than in 2015, which was only 13.7%. The increase from 2015 to 2019 is relatively consistent. There is a significant increase in 2020 due to additional social protection budgets to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 60 B. CHALLENGES AND ACTIONS TO OVERCOME 1. CHALLENGES Although there has been encouraging progress in poverty reduction in particular and the achievement of the SDG 1 targets in general, there remains some challenges as follows: 1. The last mile problem. The lower the poverty rate, the reduction becomes more difficult. It happens because poverty alleviation measures need to reach the farthest pockets of poverty and other hard-to-reach vulnerable groups. 2. Targeting accuracy of social protection program. There remain challenges in reducing inclusion and exclusion errors in the target database for program beneficiaries. Efforts are needed to update the Integrated Social Welfare Data (DTKS) in all districts/municipalities. 3. Achieving high and inclusive economic growth. Economic growth is required to mobilize resources for poverty reduction. Although Indonesia's economy is currently entering the \"new normal\" phase, resuming the economic growth of 7% as in the 1980-1990 period is very challenging. 4. High inequality, that occurs not only in monetary terms as seen from the non-inclusive economic growth, but also related to the unequal access to basic services and infrastructure, especially for the poorest group. Inequality creates unfavorable situation for a short-term (monetary aspects) and longer-term (multi-dimensional) poverty reduction. 5. Low social mobility, that leads to high and persistent inequality. A recent study shows that children from poor families will have 85-90% less income in their adulthood compared to those from better-off families. 6. High informality. Informal workers are more vulnerable to fall into poverty during the COVID-19 pandemic, since they did not have social security to protect them from various shocks. 7. High vulnerability. Even though poverty rate based on the national poverty line reached a single-digit figure in 2018, the vulnerable population, in the economic sense, in Indonesia was still high. Even relatively slight economic and social shocks to this group can be enough to push them into poverty. 2. ACTIONS TO OVERCOME To address the aforementioned challenges, the Government took several initiatives to carry out various policies set out in the 2015-2019 and 2020-2024 national medium-term development plan (RPJMN). Main initiatives related to Goal 1 that have been carried out since 2015 include the following. 1. Reforming fuel prices in early 2015. Removing fuel subsidies could provide additional fiscal space and enable the Government to invest in more productive and priority public spending. 2. Massive investments in infrastructure, especially to enhance remote area connectivity. It helps reduce poverty and inequality as well as reduce the number of underdeveloped areas. 3. In addition to the improvement of data accuracy and expansion of social protection coverage, some 61 other initiatives include developing adaptive social protection against natural disaster, integration of targeted social assistance, digitization of social assistance program's delivery system, and innovative, expansive and sustainable financing schemes. 4. Expansion of various social assistance programs. Over the last few years, there was significant progress in the expansion of the Family Hope Program/PKH (Burke & Siyarnamual, 2019). PKH introduced in 2007, is a conditional cash transfer program that now targets 10 million families. The budget allocated for this program has been increased from IDR 19 trillion in 2018 to IDR 29 trillion ($ 2 trillion) in 2019. In addition to pregnant women and children, conditionalities and benefits for the elderly and people with disabilities were set out for the first time in the Ministry of Social Affairs Regulation Number 1 Year 2018. PKH seems potential as the basis for expanding the social assistance system in the future (Burke & Siyaranamual, 2019). 5. Poverty reduction certainly requires the participation of many elements in society. Initiatives in the form of policies, programs and other activities carried out by various stakeholders will lead to better poverty reduction. The following are examples of good practices that contribute to the achievement of SDG 1 targets. Sonjo Movement Sonjo is a humanitarian movement that focuses on helping vulnerable communities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the Special Region of Yogyakarta. The word Sonjo (Javanese) means friendship and also stands for Sambat Jogja. Sambat is a form of cooperation typically practiced in rural areas in Java to build houses/public facilities. Sonjo uses the Whatsapp Group (WAG) as the main media to coordinate the implementation of various programs. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 62 BOX 4.3 SONJO MOVEMENT7 Sonjo was established on March 24, 2020, and its membership has been growing fast. As of April 17, 2020, 7 WAGs have been formed within the Sonjo movement. Each WAG focuses on a specific area. On June 22, 2020, two other WAGs were formed, making 9 (nine) WAGs in Sonjo with a total membership of more than 500 people. Eight programs have developed at Sonjo, divided into three sectors: health, economy, and education. The Sonjo movement is inclusive, involving all civil society elements in Yogyakarta and includes people with disabilities. Sonjo enables community members to help one another by mobilizing non-financial resources, free time, human resources and providing the benefits needed when communities are affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic. As of November 30, 2020, there are 320 traders registered with the Sonjo Market Trading (EPS) - One of the many programs from Sonjo.

As written by Kompas 8 , the husband-and- wife couple Herdyan Vandra Widyanggara and Lilis Cahyareni are many business owners who suffered during the corona virus outbreak in Indonesia. Their business of selling beef, which they have been working on for decades, almost stopped due to a drastic decline in demand. Then Lilis, who also works at a hospital, offers her meat to her friends via text message apps. Lilis's message then spread until it finally reached the WhatsApp SONJO group. Lilis also joined. After three weeks of joining, his business was greatly helped. \"I have only been in the Sonjo group for three weeks, the first week I shared, opened pre-orders. I was also quite surprised with a growing number of orders from WA at that time,\" he said.Lilis Cahyareni (Source: https://gamabox.id/sonjo/2020/05/03/testimoni-sonjo-pangan/) Alhamdulillah days since I joined Sonjo Pangan, and the food orders began to increase significantly. Due to the COVID-19, food orders have stopped, and only hospital catering supplies are left. Alhamdulillah , I met with Sonjo Pangan which facilitated the traders to meet the consumers. 63 SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND BASIC SERVICES RECOVERY THROUGH THE DISTRIBUTION OF GROCERIES BY ONLINE MOTORCYCLE SERVICES (OJOL) DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN JAKARTA PROVINCE As a response to the health crisis because of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Government has implemented the PSBB (Large-Scale Social Restrictions). It was done to prevent the Pandemic from getting worse. It measures adversely affects the online two-wheeled transportation taxi (online motorcycle taxis). BOX 4.4 SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND BASIC SERVICES RECOVERY THROUGH THE DISTRIBUTION OF GROCERIES BY ONLINE MOTORCYCLE SERVICES (OJOL) DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN JAKARTA PROVINCE The imposition of Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) at the start of the Pandemic was an effort to prevent COVID-19 affected online motorcycle taxi drivers (OJOL). Online motorcycle taxi drivers cannot transport people and can only ship goods, resulting in reduced income. The following activities were organized: 1. E stablish an online motorcycle taxi driver engagement flow mechanism 2. T he groceries come from other parties, and BNPB only provides delivery costs 3.

The women joined the Kelingan COVID-19 group as foster partners. Although it started as a disaster response action by companies, the Kelingan COVID-19 program was designed to be a long-term program. The ultimate objective, of course, is the independence of the group and Kampung Enam Village so they can become a pilot village and become the model on how to respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic in the City of Tarakan, North Kalimantan. The strategic plan for the Kelingan COVID-19 program started in 2020 and is planned to end in 2024. It is expected that at the end of the program, the COVID-19 assisted group will continue their activities. Achievements of the Kelingan COVID-19 program in September 2020: 1.

Geunaseh is a regionally funded social protection program part of an integrated program on maternal and child malnutrition. UNICEF and Flower Aceh provide technical support for policy formulation and guidelines, behaviour change communication, and integrated information systems. BOX 4.6 DELIVERING RESULTS FOR CHILDREN THROUGH A LOCALLY FUNDED SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAM/ GEUNASEH , 2019 The Geunaseh program aims to avoid potential long-term health problems caused by malnutrition by supporting children through social protection schemes that provide cash transfers to households, enabling them to meet their children's nutritional needs and ensuring access to health services. Mandated by the 'Mayor Regulation of Sabang No. 21 of 2019 ', Geunaseh is a locally funded sub-national social protection program that seeks to create a vision of \"Kota Sejahtera\" (Prosperous City), in line with national priorities. Geunaseh started as a pilot program, complementing government social protection programs that benefit children: clean water and sanitation, positive parenting, integrated health management in early childhood, and cash-based scholarship assistance for students aged 7 - 17 years. Its joint initiative makes Sabang the only city in Indonesia with a social protection program for all children under 18. Cash assistance is distributed directly to households with children aged 0 - 6 years who have a birth certificate and are domiciled in Sabang and whose name is written on the family card. Beneficiaries receive cash worth IDR 150,000 (USD 10) per month through a local bank. UNICEF Indonesia fully supports the Sabang City Government and the Planning Agency (Bappeda) and the Geunaseh Secretariat and the District Health Office in its implementation, involving village heads and civil society organizations. The results obtained were 1) Geunaseh reached more than 4,000 children in the early stages and an additional 1,000 children in June 2020, 2) In November 2019, the percentage of children with birth certificates increased to 98%, from 92% in 2018, and 3) Attendance children in Posyandu increased from 63% in August 2019 to 92% in July 2020. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 66 C. POLICY RESPONSE This section discusses immediate policy responses in the context of Indonesia's recovery from the multidimensional crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as set out in the Government Work Plan (RKP) for 2021. The 2021 RKP themed \"Accelerating Economic Recovery and Social Reform\" is is focused on seven national priorities, namely (1) Economic Resilience for Quality and Equitable Growth; (2) Regional Development for Inequality Reduction; (3) Qualified and Competitive Human Resources; (4) Mental Revolution and Cultural Development; (5) Infrastructure for the Economy and Basic Services; (6) Environment, Disaster Resilience, and Climate Change; and (7) Stable Political, Legal, and Security Affairs; and Transformation of Public Services. Two development agenda of quality and equality growth (National Priority 1) and inequality reduction (National Priority 2), RKP 2021 are closely related to Goal 1. To reduce poverty, economic growth needs to be restored so that jobs and a decent life can return to normal. The first national priority, namely economic resilience for quality and equitable growth aims to strengthen economic resilience amid the slow global economic growths due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its implementation includes increasing the availability, access, and quality of food for consumption; meeting energy needs by prioritizing increase in new and renewable energy (EBT); strengthening industry's competitiveness by increasing access to export markets; restoration of national tourism by increasing connectivity, expanding marketing strategies, and diversifying tourism destinations; and strengthening support for business certainty, expanding investment, as well as promoting distribution and trade's efficiency. In the 2021 RKP, targets and macroeconomic policy direction which are relevant to goal 1 include: restoring economic growth to 4.5-5.5 per cent in 2021 and reducing the poverty rate to 9.2-9.7%.To boost economic growth, efforts will be focused on attracting investments through the acceleration of Online Single Submission (OSS) integration, increasing labor market flexibility, providing aftercare services to retain existing investment from leaving, and expanding the investment list. To accelerate the recovery of the worst-hit sectors (such as tourism), several interventions will be carried out as follows: (a) increasings the frequency and route of flights; (b) increasing domestic tourism marketing to gradually recover tourism destinations; (c) increasing sporting events, cultural arts, and Meeting Incentive Convention and Exhibition (MICE); (d) providing incentives for special tour packages in priority destinations; (e) improving infrastructure and service standards; and (f) providing arrangements for annual leave and public holidays for domestic tourists. To help achieve the target of economic growth, the 2021 fiscal policy is designed to be expansive and consolidative to support the socio-economic transition to the \"new normal\" condition. The social protection reform, which aims to eliminate extreme poverty in Indonesia by 2024, are translated into the policy direction and strategies for poverty reduction and social protection as follows: 1. Strengthening the social assistance scheme; implementing integrated social welfare services; improving the targeting of poverty reduction programs through data accuracy improvement; and expansion of the program coverage through 100 per cent socio-economic registration and digitalization of village monographs. Sub-national governments are expected to independently update their database by 2024; 2. Strengthening the adaptive social protection system; 3. Developing the digitization of non-cash social assistance; 67 4. Strengthening the design of non-cash social assistance payments to better facilitate the poor and vulnerable groups; 5. Formulating innovative, expansive and sustainable financing schemes; 6. Establishing integrated social assistance and well-targeted subsidies, including (a) the basic food program that integrate Non-Cash Food Assistance (BPNT), electricity subsidies, and 3 Kg LPG for cooking subsidies, (b) data integration between the Family Hope Program (PKH) and the Smart Indonesia Program (PIP); 7. Strengthening the facilitator' roles in social assistance programs and behaviour change in program's beneficiaries in health, education, and economic. 8. improving education to encourage the beneficiaries' behaviour changes in health, education and economic; 9. Strengthening the National Social Security System (SJSN) for health and employment that is comprehensive and integrated; 10. Improving social welfare of the vulnerable group, especially children, persons with disabilities, and the elderly; and 11. Developing activities to increase economic independence and generate income for the poor and vulnerable groups, including through accelerating the family economy, business assistance, and improving the quality of micro-and-small enterprises, access to low-interest financing, business intermediaries, partnerships, social impacts, and secure tenure rights to land through the implementation of agrarian reform and social forestry. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 68 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. Achievement of the targets of end hunger and ensure access to food for all (2.1) and eliminate all form of malnutrition (2.2) is the impacts or results of sustainable food systems development, improve community nutrition and health services, and community welfare. This objective is achieved if all people, especially low-income communities and those who are in a vulnerable condition including pregnant women, infants, and persons with disabilities, have access to safe, nutritious, and adequate food consumption throughout the year to be able to live a healthy, smart, active and productive life. In the last five years (2015-2019), there is notable progress in the achievement of the several SDG 2 targets, but some indicators still require greater efforts. The positive trend of SDG 2 achievements during the five-year period has Goal 2 No Hunger been disrupted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic poses further challenges in achieving TPB/SDGs Goal 2, among others: barriers to the distribution of agricultural production inputs, decreased purchasing power of farmers in meeting the needs of agricultural production inputs, decreased purchasing power of people as food consumers, and ultimately reduces the quality of food consumption and nutrition intake, especially among the poor and near poor population. To mitigate this impact, the government has expanded the social safety net policy to ensure the fulfillment of people's food needs, protect people's purchasing power and maintain the adequacy of food consumption. Moreover, the imposition of the Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) policy has also resulted in limited public access to health services which further resulted in delays in health services, including child development monitoring services. A. TREND ANALYSIS AND IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC SDG 2 consists of eight targets and 17 indicators, the achievement progress of 14 indicators is discussed in this report. Meanwhile, the data for the other three indicators related to enabling environment for the development of sustainable food systems, such as rural infrastructure investment and distortions of agricultural markets and their prevention (targets 2.a and 2.b) are not available. 69 1. FOOD SECURITY a. Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) Data of the prevalence of insufficient food consumption or undernourishment (PoU) provided by Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS)/Statistics Indonesia was generated from the National Socio-Economic Survey (Susenas) result. In the 2015-2019 period, the PoU had improved, with a significant decrease from 10.73% (2015) to 7.63% (2019). However, this figure was still higher than the target of 6.69% in 2019 (Bappenas 2019a). Although the target was not achieved, the progress was quite significant. This positive trend was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. The PoU in 2020 increased to 8.34%, exceeding the prevalence in 2017 (Figure 4.29). Urban households had a much lower PoU rate (6.56%) than in rural areas (10.47%). The percentage of PoU in the male-headed households was slightly lower (8.09%) compared to the female-headed households (10.01%). Meanwhile, the PoU figure for household's head with no disability was lower than those with disabilities with a fairly wide gap, 8.24% and 12.17% respectively. This data confirms that people who have better access to economic opportunities and food market (in term of physical and economic) are better off, and their food security are predicted to be in a better condition. Figure 4.29 Percentage of PoU, 2015-2020 Source: Statistics Indonesia A wide disparity of PoU occurs across province, ranged from 1.94% to 35.55%. There were seven provinces with PoU below 4.2% (half the national average), started from the lowest figure in DKI Jakarta (1.94%), followed (4.01%). Meanwhile, five provinces with the highest PoU rates were West Kalimantan (19.92%) and four provinces in the eastern part of Indonesia, namely West Papua (23.09%), Papua (31.49%), North Maluku (35.48%), and Maluku (35.55%). This pattern indicated that for the eastern part Indonesia, food security remains the main human development challenge. It also reflected the different level of regional economic development and the poverty eradication progress.TUJUAN 2 Figure Error!

The higher the level of expenditure the smaller (better) the PoU rate. In 2020, the PoU in the lowest expenditure group (bottom 20%) was 14.72%. The figure was slightly lower in the second lowest quintile (9.54%) and continued to decrease in higher income groups. In the fifth quintile (top 20%) the PoU was quite low at 2.27% (Figure 4.30). This indicates that interventions need to be focused on households with low incomes (first and second quintiles). Furthermore, it is quite interesting that in the top 20% income group there were still households who experienced insufficient food consumption, even though the proportion is relatively small (below 2.5%). This condition might be attributed to the unbalance food consumption pattern and limited knowledge of the minimum food and nutrition intake required. b. Prevalence of food insecurity experience scale (FIES) Similar to the PoU figures, the prevalence of people with moderate and severe food insecurity as measured by the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) for the 2017-2019 period decreased (improved) from 8.66% to 5.42%, a rapid decline with annual reduction rate of 1.62%. This achievement was better compared to the target of 5.79% (Bappenas 2019a). This reduction indicated an improvement in the experience of food insecurity by the population. In contrast to the PoU figure, the prevalence of FIES in 2020 was lower (improved) than the previous year (5.12%), although the improvement was quite small (only 0,3%) compared to annual reduction rate of the previous three years (Figure 4.31). This positive trend was partly resulted from the government's rapid response in providing social safety nets in the form of massive assistance to the vulnerable groups, including cash transfers and/or food assistance for low-income households and those who have lost their jobs temporarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If the government assistance was not available or late in distribution, the social impact of this pandemic would be even worse (SMERU, PROSPERA, UNDP, UNICEF, 2021).TUJUAN 2 Figure Error!

The likelihood of experiencing of food insecurity differed by gender and disability status of the household head. The prevalence of FIES of the male-headed households was lower than female-headed households, 4.77% and 6.78% respectively. The prevalence of FIES of household heads with no disability was almost half (5.09%) compared to household heads with disabilities (10.03%). This data shows that people who have the advantage in term of economic opportunities have a better chance of avoiding food insecurity events. This also highlights the importance of inclusive policies for persons with disabilities and gender equality in employment opportunities. The distribution pattern of the prevalence of FIES across provinces differs from PoU, with a narrower interval of 1.84% to 15.46%. The lowest prevalence of FIES was in Bali and the highest in East Nusa Tenggara. Provinces with FIES prevalence West Nusa Maluku and Maluku. Meanwhile, that had FIES prevalence below 3.0% were Bali, Yogyakarta and Central Java. This indicates that the level of regional economic progress may have influenced the prevalence of FIES. Household expenditure has a positive correlation with the prevalence of FIES, the higher the level of expenditure the smaller (better) the prevalence of FIES. In 2020 the prevalence of FIES in the first lowest quintile (bottom 20%) households was 10.64%, almost doubled compared to prevalence in the second lowest quintile (6.75%). The prevalence then decreased steadily in better-off quintiles and in the fifth quintile (top 20%) was 1.32% (Figure 4.32). Similar to the PoU percentage, there were also households in the top expenditure group that have experienced food insecurity, although the percentage of FIES prevalence was very small (below 1.5%). This condition was partly caused by their high dependence on food availability in the market, therefore any shock to food market will create a feeling of food insecurity. TUJUAN 2 Figure Error!

This improvement was in line with economic growth, increase in the per capita income, and stability of food supply and prices. This achievement was also supported by the implementation of the government special efforts to continuously increase domestic food production and build food reserves at central and local governments as well as community food barns. Progress achieved during this period was disrupted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As discussed above, in 2020 the PoU figure increased (worsened) again to a level that exceeds the 2017 figure, meanwhile the prevalence of FIES was still decreasing (improving) but at a very small rate compared to the previous year. Various studies have shown a significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the community food security and nutrition. In general, the pandemic had an impact on the income of individual and households, especially those working in the industrial and informal sectors (PSEKP 2020, ACIAR 2020). This pandemic had caused the lowest 40% of income group facing difficulties in fulfilling the minimum requirement of adequate food consumption and balanced nutrition intake. To meet the population needs of staple food, the decline in income was mitigated by the head of households through reduction of the proportion of non-food expenditures coupled with lowering the quality of food composition (less protein and vitamin sources) (PSEKP 2020). The SMERU survey (2021) found that one third of head of households were worried that they would not be able to provide sufficient food for their families. Concerns of difficulties in fulfilling the households' needs for food arose, especially in the female-headed households. The 2020 Susenas showed that of the eight items to calculate the prevalence of FIES, female-headed households stated that they had more limited access to food for seven items than male-headed of households. Gambar Error! No text 5 73 The Wahana Visi Indonesia study (2020) reported that 53% of households had limitations in providing nutritious food and 96% of children under two years of age were unable to meet their minimum intake needs in terms of food frequency and diversity. The results of a World Bank study (2020) indicated the same trend, 31% of households sample experienced food shortages and 38% claimed to eat less food than they should. Another community group affected by this pandemic were the elderly (60+ years). About 40% of the elderly households experienced a decline in income, and the most effected were the elderly with incomes below IDR 3.0 million (Statistics Indonesia, 2020.). The continuos decrease in the prevalence of FIES during the pandemic means that the government's emergency response to address the negative impacts of this pandemic on the health aspects, economic recovery, and social protection created positive results. The government spending for social protection in 2020 was IDR 203.9 trillion of the total allocated budget for handling the pandemic which was around IDR 695.2 trillion (Deputy for Economic, Ministry of National Development Planning). The government also expanded the beneficiaries of existing social protection programs such as conditional cash transfer (PKH), basic food program for the poor (Program Kartu Sembako) , and electricity cost subsidy; and created new programs such as such as unconditional cash transfers, food assistance, salary subsidy, and the Kartu Prakerja (Pre-Employment Card) program. The Pre-employment Card program is an effort to increase skill and competency of job seekers or those affected by temporary work termination due to the pandemic. In 2020 the beneficiaries of the basic food program (Kartu Sembako) was expanded to 20.0 million households with the assistance value of IDR 200,000 per household/month. In 2019, the number of beneficiaries were 15.6 million families with the assistance value of IDR 150,000 per household/month. A recent survey found that more than 90% of low-income population received at least one social assistance from the government and more than 60% received cash assistance. About two-thirds (67.4%) of government social assistance beneficiaries stated that the assistance was helpful to deal with the impact of declined household incomes due to the COVID-19 pandemic (UNICEF, UNDP, PROSPERA and SMERU 2021). Since the COVID-19 pandemic is still affecting the economic growth, job opportunities, and incomes of vulnerable groups, various forms of social protection including cash transfer and food assistance are still needed. The distribution of social assistance packages needs to be evaluated and strengthened in terms of the continuity and promptness of distribution, accuracy of targeting, effectiveness of assistance, and the completeness of assistance packages. 2. NUTRITIONAL ADEQUACY a. Prevalence of stunting in children under five Stunting is the impaired growth and development that children experience from poor nutrients intake, repeated infections and inadequate psychosocial stimulation. Stunting is indicated by the child's height that is less than the child growth standard median according to their age. The impaired growth experienced by children during the first 1000 days of life (1000 HPK) can lead children fail to achieve their optimal growth potential and the damage is irreversible. For this reason, it is necessary to focus the interventions on 1000 HPK as an effort to prevent stunting. The target of 1000 HPK interventions include pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, to children aged two years. Furthermore, the intervention also targets adolescent girls since their nutrition status will impact the growth and development of their future children. Indonesia has succeeded in reducing the stunting rate from 37.2% (Basic Health Research/Riskesdas 2013) to 27.67% INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 74 Figure 4.33 Prevalence of stunting in children under five years of age by province, 2019 (%) Source: Indonesia's Under Five Nutrition Status Survey (SSGBI) 2019, Ministry of Health Under Five Nutrition Status Survey/SSGBI 2019). If this reduction rate can be maintained, the WHA target of stunting prevalence reduction in children under five, which is to reduce stunting prevalence by 40%, can be achieved by 2025. However, the disparity in stunting prevalence is wide between geographic areas, sex and socioeconomic status. According to WHO standards, Figure 4.33 shows that 13 provinces are in the very high prevalence category (> 30%), 17 provinces are in the high category (20-<30%) and only 4 provinces are in the medium category (10% -<20%) (Ministry of Health: SSGBI 2019). Thus, strengthened efforts are needed to reduce the stunting prevalence to 14% 75 in 2024 in accordance with the National Mid Term Development Plan/RPJMN target. The disaggregation of stunting data in 2018 according to area of residence shows that under five children in rural areas have a higher prevalence of stunting (34.9%) than in urban areas (27.3%). This may be related to income levels, access to nutritious food, and access to better information. Riskesdas 2018 data also shows that the prevalence of stunting in boys under five is higher than girls, 31.7% and 29.7% respectively. Meanwhile, the stunting disparity based on the level of education of parents shows that families with low education (junior high school and below) have a higher prevalence of stunting compared to families with high education (senior secondary school and above). At the district/city level, the stunting rate tends to decline, although it varies widely. In 2013, the average prevalence in 514 districts/cities was 37.2%. By using WHO criteria ( 30%), there are still 418 districts/cities (81.32%) with very high prevalence. In 2018, the prevalence decreased to 30.8% or decreased 6.4 percentage points within 5 years, or 1.28 percentage points per year. In 2019, the prevalence of stunting has constantly declined by 3.2 percentage points to 27.67%. However, the disparity in stunting rates across regions still occurs. There are 214 out of 514 districts/cities (41.6%) classified as having a very high prevalence of stunting (> 30%). For this reason, the stunting reduction strategy needs to be prioritized to these districts To measure the success of stunting prevalence reduction, Statistics Indonesia has developed a Special Index for Stunting Management (IKPS). The IKPS value ranges from 0 to 100, the higher the IKPS value the better the stunting being handled in the area. In the IKPS, there are 12 indicators, which are proxies for efforts to reduce stunting, which are grouped into 6 dimensions, namely health, nutrition, education, food, sanitation and drinking water, and social protection. The IKPS value in 2018 was 63.92, then it increased to 66.08 in 2019, which means that it has shown an improvement. (Statistics Indonesia: 2018-2019 IKPS Report). Looking at the IPKS score between provinces, there are two provinces that are considered high in efforts to reduce stunting prevalence in 2018 and 2019. The indexes achieved respectively are 78.54 and 79.94 for DI Yogyakarta Province, then 70.01 and 72.97 for West Nusa Tenggara Province. Provinces that in 2019 have a score of 70 and above are DKI Jakarta (70.56), Central Java (71.17) and East Java (70.69). Income reduction during to the COVID-19 pandemic leads to a decrease in household access to nutritious food. The Wahana Visi Indonesia study (2020) reports the limited ability of households to meet adequate food consumption and nutrition. Approximately 53 percent of households cannot provide nutritious food and 96 percent of children under two years of age cannot meet their minimum intake needs in terms of meal frequency and dietary diversity. Another study from the World Bank (2020) shows a similar trend, 31 percent of surveyed households experience food shortages and 38 percent admit to consuming less food than they should. This condition in turn can increase the risk of acute malnutrition in children under five and in the long term increase the risk of chronic malnutrition or stunting. The FAO, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO Joint Report (2021) estimates an increase in the prevalence of wasting (moderate and severe wasting) in children under five by 14.3 percent at the global level as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic on food security and nutrition. ACIAR's research results (2020) related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia report several interesting findings. Amid the pandemic, the three burdens of malnutrition, namely underweight, stunting and wasting, are significant challenges. Dietary patterns and people's spending on food are changing, for example, the high consumption of instant food and snacks with poor nutritional quality. Children and mothers will suffer from malnutrition and increase their vulnerability to COVID-19. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 76 Learning from the experience of previous crises, these shocks can have a negative impact on increasing wasting, stunting, obesity and micronutrient deficiencies (ACIAR 2020). b. The prevalence of wasting in children under five Wasting refers to a child who is too thin for his or her height. Wasting is the result of by the rapid weight loss of children under five due to infection, insufficient food intake or eating habits, poor sanitation and hygiene, and dietary intake did not meet the nutritional requirement. Wasting is a very serious form of malnutrition because it can increase the risk of child's death and illness. The mortality rate for children with acute malnutrition (Severe Acute Malnutrition-SAM) is higher than children with better nutrition. If they survived, they will have developmental disorders throughout their lives. Global evidence shows that wasting increases the risk of stunting in children, impaired cognitive development and the risk of developing non-communicable diseases in adulthood. (UNICEF: Nutrition Sector Review). Indonesia has succeeded in reducing the prevalence of wasting from 12.1% in 2013 to 7.4% in 2019. Thus, Indonesia is still on-track to achieve the WHA target, which is to reduce wasting in children under five to less than 5% by 2025, as well as the RPJMN target of 7% in 2024. Nevertheless, there remain disparities between provinces (Figure 4.34). According to WHO standard, there is still one province with a very high wasting prevalence (> 15%), two provinces with a high prevalence category (10% -15%), 30 provinces with a medium prevalence category (5% -10%), and one province that has achieved a low prevalence category, which is below 5%. The 2018 Basic Health Resarch (Riskesdas) shows that the prevalence of wasting in children under five is higher in rural areas (10.7%) than in urban areas (9.8%). The prevalence of wasting in boys (11.1%) is greater than girls (9.2%). The 2013 and 2018 Riskesdas data shows that families with a low level of education (junior secondary school and below) have a higher prevalence of wasting compared to families with higher education (senior secondary school and higher). This may be related to better income and opportunities to obtain information in families with higher education levels. Stunting is closely related to maternal nutritional status during pregnancy. Babies born with low birth weight/LBW (< 2,500 gram) indicates maternal malnutrition problems before and during the pregnancy. LBW is a strong predictor of neonatal mortality. More than 80% of neonatal deaths occur in LBW infants. LBW babies have low levels of body fat, iron and vitamin A, and experience trouble eating, so they are at risk of stunting and wasting. LBW babies also have a risk of suffering from non-communicable diseases and obesity in adulthood. Mothers who experienced stunting in their childhood are at greater risk of giving birth to LBW babies. Data shows that the prevalence of LBW in Indonesia is 6.2%, meanwhile the target of WHA is to reduce LBW by 30% in 2025. Malnutrition that occurs during this life cycle increases a person's risk of suffering from non-communicable diseases in adulthood. (FAO, UNICEF, WFP, WHO: Asia and the Pacific Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition, 2020). To overcome the problem of stunting and wasting, the Government of Indonesia focuses its efforts on specific and sensitive nutrition interventions as set out in the national stunting reduction strategy. 77 Figure 4.34 Prevalence of wasting in children under five years of age by province, 2019 (%) Source: SSGBI 2019, Ministry of Health INDONESIA'S VNR UNICEF/ UNI374578/Fauzan1. SPECIFIC NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTIONS Exclusive breastfeeding The national average for exclusive breastfeeding increased from 44.71% (2019) to 69.62% in 2020 (Susenas, Statistics Indonesia). The WHA set a global target to increase exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months up to at least 50% by 2025. The data shows that Indonesia is on-track in achieving the WHA target, although the rate of exclusive breastfeeding varies between regions in Indonesia. Growth monitoring for children under five The percentage of children under five who attend at least four consecutive weighing sessions a year increased from 44.6% in 2013 to 54.6% in 2018 (Riskesdas). In 2019, the percentage of children who attend weighing sessions was 73.86% per month in average. The highest percentage was in North Sumatra (96.69%), while the lowest percentage was in Papua (30.11%). There are six provinces that have not reported growth monitoring result of under five children, namely Riau, Jambi, Central Java, West Nusa Tenggara, North Maluku, and West Papua Provinces. Strengthened efforts are needed to improve growth monitoring for under five children (Ministry of Health: Indonesia Health Profile, 2019). The COVID-19 pandemic also affects the coverage of children growth monitoring. The imposition of the Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) also hampers Integrated Health Post ( posyandu ) activities. The results of the Balitbangkes survey (2020) show that 37% of posyandu have reduced its services and as many as 43.5% of posyandu have completely delayed the services. In addition, the consistency of coverage in each month needs special attention. The weighing session coverage tends to increase in the national Vitamin A campaign months in February and August but then the coverage returns to a low level outside of these months. Coverage of Vitamin A supplementation for children aged 6-59 months Riskesdas data shows that the coverage of Vitamin A supplementation in children under five decreased from 75.5% in 2013 to 53.5% in 2018. This decline rate raises concerns since the Vitamin A is essential for the functioning of the immune system of infants and children under five. In 2019, the coverage of vitamin A in children under five in Indonesia was 76.68%. The highest rate 79 was DI Yogyakarta (100%), while the lowest was in Papua (31.97%). (Ministry of Health: Indonesia Health Profile 2019). Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) supplementation for adolescent girls In 2018, the coverage of IFA supplementation in adolescent girls was 46.56%. The province with the highest coverage was Bali (99.72%), while the lowest was West Kalimantan (13.03%). (Ministry of Health: Indonesia Health Profile 2019). It takes a comprehensive assessment of the iron supplementation program for adolescent girls, starting from planning, implementation, distribution as well as monitoring and evaluation of its impact on anemia reduction in adolescent girls. This is due to the high prevalence of anemia in women of reproductive age and pregnant women in Indonesia which may start since their adolescence age. Supplementary feeding for chronic energy deficiency pregnant women and underweight children Supplementary feeding ( Pemberian Makanan Tambahan /PMT) is an essential program to address the problem of chronic energy deficiency ( Kurang Energi Kronik /KEK) in pregnant women. In 2019, the coverage of chronic energy deficiency pregnant women receiving supplementary feeding reached 90.52%. The highest coverage was in West Kalimantan, South Sumatra and Gorontalo provinces, while the lowest coverage was in West Nusa Tenggara (71.36%). The 2018 Riskesdas data found that the coverage of supplementary feeding for underweight children was 41%. The 2019 Ministry of Health routine reports in 2019 showed that the national average of underweight children receiving supplementary feeding was 89.64%. The highest coverage was in Gorontalo and East Java, while the lowest was in North Kalimantan (69.53%).From the aforementioned discussions, specific nutrition interventions have been implemented and its coverage showed an increasing trend. This progress is encouraging, especially when linked to sensitive interventions, given the essential role of sensitive interventions in improving the nutritional status of children. From the description above, it can be concluded that specific nutrition interventions have been implemented and show an increasing trend. This gives encouraging hope, especially when linked to sensitive interventions, given the large role sensitive nutrition interventions play in improving the nutritional condition of children. 2. SENSITIVE NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTIONS Sensitive interventions are mainly carried out by sectors outside of health, including various programs and activities such as strengthening food security, especially at the family level, increasing access to nutritious food, increasing access to family planning services, raising awareness and good parenting practices, providing drinking water and proper sanitation services, and improving social protection systems for the poor. One of sensitive interventions that is closely related to the improvement of quality nutrition is food fortification and households' access to drinking water and improved sanitation services. Currently, Indonesia has imposed mandatory fortification on salt (iodine) and wheat flour (iron) as well as vegetable cooking oil (vitamin A). The COVID-19 pandemic had interfered the implementation of mandatory fortification due to disruption in the supply chain of import fortification premixes related to lockdown policies in several countries. After the relaxation of the mandatory fortification of wheat flour and vegetable cooking oil from April to the end of December 2020, the mandatory fortification policy was reintroduced in early 2021. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 80 Development of rice bio-fortification seeds is also being carried out. Moreover, to increase access to fortified food in the poor population, fortified rice has been included in the package of Non-Cash Food Assistance (BPNT), which since 2020 has evolved to basic food program. Stunting is related to household access to drinking water and improved sanitation services. Access to safe drinking water shows an increasing trend from 84.94% (2015) to 90.21% (2020). In the same period, access to improved sanitation services also increased from 67.95% to 79.54% (Statistics Indonesia: Susenas). c. Quality of Food ConsumptionThe quality of food consumption is measured by the Dietary Desirable Pattern (DDP) score. The score is calculated by the Indonesian Agency for Food Security ( Badan Ketahanan Pangan /BKP) of the Ministry of Agriculture using Susenas data from Statistics Indonesia (various years). The ideal DDP score is 100, which describes the composition of the main food groups that can meet the needs of calories and other nutrients to be able to live a healthy, smart, active and productive life (BKP 2020). The PPH score is calculated using the Energy Adequacy Rate (AKE) of 2000 kcal/cap/day based on the 2004 National Food and Nutrition Program (WNPG) VIII. During the 2015-2018 period the national DDP score showed an improving trend from 85.2 to 91.3, then decreased slightly in 2019 with a score of 90.8. Compared to the DDP 2019 target of 92.5%, this achievement was still below the target. In 2020 the DDP score decreased considerably (2.0 points) from the previous year, which was 88.8 and lower than the 2017 position (Figure 4.35). This is because food consumption is still dominated by the grain group, while consumption of animal foods, as well as vegetables and fruit are still lacking. The DDP score decrease from 2019 to 2020 was in line with the decline in PoU percentage at the same time 81 Figure 4.35 The DDP Scores of National, Urban and Rural Indonesia, 2015-2020 Source: BKP, processed and justified from Susenas (March) data Notes: Calculated using the energy adequacy rate (AKE) = 2,000 kcal/cap/day; Year 2020 = temporary figure During the 2015-2019 period, the DDP scores in urban areas were consistently better than that in rural areas. In 2020, the DDP score in urban and rural areas decreased compared to the 2019 score. In 2019 the DDP scores in the two regions were 93.6 and 86.4, respectively. Meanwhile, the DDP score in 2020 fell to 89.6 in rural and 85.4 in urban areas. This information shows that (i) the quality of household food consumption in 2020 both in urban and rural areas had decreased compared to the previous year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and (ii) the quality of food consumption in urban area was better than that in rural area. Higher opportunities to have a job and better access to food markets in urban area have created opportunity for urban residents to earn higher family income and better food quality consumed. So, more efforts are needed to improve the quality of food consumption in rural areas. In 2018, Widyakarya National Food and Nutrition (WNPG) X set an AKE of 2100 kcal/cap/day, so there was a higher energy adequacy rate to calculate of the PPH score. The PPH score calculated by AKE 2100/kcal/day in 2015-2019 increased from 81.5% to 87.9%; but then the score decreased to 86.3% in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is due to a decrease in consumption of animal food sources, as well as vegetables and fruit due to a decrease in people's purchasing power. In 2019 DDP at the provincial level varied, with the highest score was belong to DI Yogyakarta Province (94.8) and the lowest was Maluku Province (70.4) Seven provinces with the highest scores were located along the geographic path, extending from Lampung Province on the southern tip of Sumatra Island, continued into all (five) provinces in Java Island, and continued to the east namely Bali and West Nusa Tenggara provinces. Meanwhile, the seven provinces with the lowest scores were in eastern Indonesia, except for Aceh which is located at the western tip of Indonesia (Figure 4.36). The group of provinces with the DDP scores in the average range (around 85) were mostly located in Sumatera, Kalimantan and Sulawesi islands.

Figure 4.36 Provinces with the seven highest and seven lowest DDP sore, 2019 Source: BKP, processed and justified from Susenas (March) data. Notes: Calculated using the energy adequacy rate (AKE) = 2,000 kcal/cap/day; Year 2020 = temporary figure, The problem of decreasing food security status in 2020 due to the pandemic as discussed above was in line with the dynamics of the poverty rate. For the last ten years (March figures each year), the percentage of poor people in the country had decreased continuously from 12.22% in 2015 to 9.41% in 2019, but in 2020 the poverty rate increased again to 9.78%. In urban areas, poverty increased from 6.69% in 2019 to 7.38% in 2020. Meanwhile, in the same period, the percentage the people under poverty in rural areas continued to improve, although with a slight change, from 12.85% to 12.82%. The agricultural sector which dominates the rural economy has high resilience in facing crises caused by external shocks such as the economic and political crisis in 1997/1998, the international monetary crisis in 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2000 (PSEKP 2020). At the beginning of the pandemic, the agricultural sector and the informal sector in rural areas were able to serve as safety nets to accommodate urban residents who had lost their jobs returning to their villages. In 2020 the performance of food production was not significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Compare to the previous year, 2020 production of rice, corn, chicken eggs were predicted to increase by 0.09%, 9.30%, and 6.10% respectively (Statistics Indonesia, 2021). Total production of vegetables was predicted to increase by 5.31% and the two most important vegetables commodities namely shallot and big chilly production increased by 14.87% and 4.12% respectively. Total fruits production rose by 10.45%, and bananas and mangoes as the two highest fruit production increased by 12.59% and 3.19%. 83 d. Prevalence of Nutritional Anemia in Pregnant Women Anemia in pregnant women occurs when the blood hemoglobin level is below the normal standard for age of pregnancy. Anemia in pregnant women in Indonesia is a nutritional problem that has not been resolved properly. This can be seen from the large prevalence of anemia over time. The prevalence of anemia increased from 37.1% (2013) to 48.9% in 2018. Approximately 84.6% anemia in pregnant women occurred in the 15-24 years age group. The WHA sets a target of a 50% reduction in anemia in women of reproductive age in 2025. Anemia negatively impacts cognitive and motor development and working capacity. Among pregnant women, iron deficiency anemia is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes, including preterm delivery, infants with low birth weight, and decreased iron stores for infants, which can lead to developmental disorders (WHO). Anemia is a global public health problem. This has serious short-term and long-term consequences during and after pregnancy. Anemic conditions are often exacerbated by the presence of other chronic diseases such as malaria, Tuberculosis, HIV, and diabetes. Untreated anemia also leads to greater risks of morbidity and mortality from this chronic condition as well (King Gangopadhyay, Mahantesh Karoshi, Louis Keith). Iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy is associated with increased maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency in pregnant mother can also be associated with neurocognitive deficits in infants. The global burden of maternal anemia suggests that the current iron supplementation strategy is less than optimal. Recent developments provide that understanding of systemic iron homeostasis and placenta can enhance therapeutic effectiveness by changing the dose and frequency of oral iron supplementation. Intravenous iron appears to be a safe treatment for rapidly correcting maternal anemia but patient-centered outcome and cost-effectiveness research is needed. Future trials should be robust enough to assess relevant results for pregnant women (Charlotte S Benson, Akshay Shah, Matthew C Frise and Charlotte J Frize). To prevent anemia in pregnant women, the Ministry of Health implements Iron Folic Acid (IFA) supplementation program of at least 90 tablets during pregnancy. The coverage of IFA> 90 tablets was only 37.7% (Riskesdas 2018). By looking at the current trend of anemia prevalence and considering the impacts of the pandemic, it raises concerns that global and national targets will be difficult to achieve. One of the alternative interventions to overcome anemia is Multiple Micronutrient Supplementation (MMS) which has been proven to be effective in reducing anemia in pregnant women. MMS can also overcome the problem of low birth weight, stunting, MMR and IMR and malnutrition of pregnant women. In the future, it is necessary to formulate a new policy on the use of MMS in Indonesia, by making better preparations regarding the aspects of policy and domestic production capacity, delivery system, and monitoring and evaluation of its impact on anemia reduction. 3. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AND INCOME OF SMALL-SCALE FOOD PRODUCERS a. Productivity and income of small-scale farmers The availability of data for indicators 2.3.1 * and 2.3.2 * of SDGs Goal 2 was limited only for year 2020, that was disaggregated based on agricultural subsectors, and covered only three out of 34 provinces, namely West Java, East Java, and West Nusa Tenggara. The data was obtained from the Integrated INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 84 Agricultural Survey (SITASI) 2020 conducted by Statistics Indonesia (2021). For international comparison, the production value and income of small-scale farming are expressed in USD Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). Small-scale agriculture producer (farmer) is defined as a producer who is structurally independent of fixed wage labor and who manage his/her production activities mainly using family labor. Small-scale farming in the three provinces in Indonesia was characterized that within one year they managed less than 0.16 hectares of land, raised less than 0.61 units of tropical livestock, and earned less than USD 1044.169 PPP (Statistics Indonesia, 2021). Based on this definition, in 2020 the proportion of small-scale farmers in West Java, East Java, and West Nusa Tenggara were 35.82%, 21.15%, and 23.0% respectively. The proportion for the three provinces in aggregate term was 28.77%. In 2020, the productivity of small-scale farmers per working day (2.3.1*) in the three provinces in aggregate was USD 36.30 PPP or IDR 172,183 (based on the conversion rate of the World Bank for 2020: 1 USD PPP = IDR 4,743,337). The productivity of small-scale farmers (in PPP) in West Java, East Java and West Nusa Tenggara were USD 43.58, USD 28.52, and USD 20.15, respectively. In 2020, the average net income of small-scale agriculture producers (2.3.2*) in West Java, East Java and West Nusa Tenggara provinces (in PPP) was USD 683.37, USD 573.83 and USD 466.73, respectively. The aggregate net income of small-scale farmers in the three provinces was USD 641.97 or around IDR 3.05 million, according to the conversion rate of USD PPP to IDR) as stated above. b. Agriculture labor productivity Data on agricultural value added per labor or agriculture labor productivity was only available for agricultural sector as a whole, not by sub-sector. For the 2015-2019 period, the agriculture value added per labor indicated a quite high upward trend, and reached 8.5%/year. The value added in 2015 was IDR 41.20 million, increased each year afterward, and in 2019 was IDR 56.78 million. The COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the agriculture labor productivity, in 2020 the value added was down by around 2.6% from the previous year to IDR 55.33 million (Figure 4.37). This decline shows that the agriculture sector was affected by the pandemic. In 2020, agricultural GDP could still grow positively by 1.75%, but lower than the previous year's 3.6%. For comparison, in 2019 and 2020 the national GDP growth rates were 5.02% and -2.07%, respectively Figure Error!

First, the agriculture value added amongst 34 provinces had a very wide gap, the highest was around 300% and the lowest was 15% from the national value added. Second, the value added did not have a pattern based on geographic location (Java and outside Java or western and eastern Indonesia) or the level of the agriculture sector development (Table 4.2). INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 86 77. 99 10.16 3.33 -86.9 Source: Statistics Indonesia. The three provinces with the highest added value (about three times the average) were East Kalimantan, North Kalimantan, and Riau whose agricultural sector was dominated by the plantation sub-sector with limited labor supply (relatively small population density). Meanwhile, the three provinces with the lowest value added, namely DI Yogyakarta, East Nusa Tenggara, and Papua had different characteristics of the natural resource endowment and the agricultural development stage. DI Yogyakarta had a relatively small agricultural land area, a fairly developed agricultural sector, was dominated by the food crop and horticultural sub-sector, had a high population density, and the accessibility to location was very high. Meanwhile Papua and East Nusa Tenggara has ample agricultural land and waters, low population density, relatively low economic accessibility, and the agriculture sector was characterized by smallholder plantations and livestock. The country agriculture productivity in 2020 decreased -2.54% from the previous year to IDR 55.33 million, meaning that the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on decreasing added value. The 2020 disaggregated by province showed the dynamics of growth that need further analysis. In the condition of pandemic that caused agricultural GDP growth to decline from 3.6% in 2019 to 1.75% in 2020, agriculture labor productivity in 13 provinces increased while in the 21 other provinces decreased, with wide ranging of growth rates. The growth in added value in North Sulawesi Province was 285% and North Kalimantan was 174%, and in the other four provinces grew over 20.0%. Meanwhile, value added in South Sulawesi grew negatively by -87% and in West Kalimantan, Southeast Sulawesi and East Kalimantan showed a negative growth that was greater than -40% (Table 4.2). This 2020 agriculture value added growth phenomenon need further study, even though one can relate this as an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, the agriculture labor productivity (agricultural value added per agricultural labor) in a province is not influenced by its geographic location, but is influenced by the following factors: (i) progress (modernization / utilization of innovative technology) in agricultural business, (ii) balance of workforce availability and employment opportunity in agriculture, (iii) employment opportunities in the non-agricultural sector, and (iv) shocks from external factors such as pandemics or other disasters. This last factor can have a positive or negative effect on added value or productivity of agricultural labor. 4. ENSURING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE SYSTEM. a. Proportion of productive and sustainable agricultural area The indicator 2.4.1, namely the proportion of sustainable productive agricultural area was designed to measure the implementation of a productive and sustainable food production system. Measurement of this indicator consist of three dimensions, 11 themes and for each theme one sub-indicator is assigned. The three dimensions of the sustainability include (i) the 87 economic dimension with the themes of land productivity, profitability and resilience; (ii) environmental dimensions with the themes of soil health, water use, fertilizers pollution risk, pesticides risk and biodiversity; and (iii) the social dimension includes decent employment, food security and land tenure. The sustainability assessment for each sub-indicator is classified into three categories, namely (i) desirable (according to the principle of sustainability), (ii) acceptable, and (iii) unsustainable. Based on the 2.4.1 indicator calculation formula, the proportion of productive agricultural area is determined by the lowest percentage for one of the 11 sub-indicators that falls into the criteria as 'desirable' and 'acceptable' based on the sustainability criteria. Data for indicator 2.4.1 is in the process of being developed by BPS, through the implementation of the Integrated Agricultural Survey (SITASI), which is targeted to be completed in 2021. In this context, in 2020 BPS will carry out piloting in 3 provinces (West Java, East Java and West Nusa Tenggara, covering the food crops, horticulture, plantation, and livestock sub-sectors. The preliminary results of piloting in the 3 provinces indicate that the proportion of sustainable productive agricultural areas is around 10.28%. In more detail, the temporary piloting results show that 8 of the 11 sub-indicators fall into the 'desirable' and 'acceptable' categories, meeting the sustainability principle of more than 90%. The eight sub-indicators are: profitability (97.13%) and resilience (91.84%) in the economic dimension; soil fertility (95.35%) use of water (91.40%) and biodiversity (99.45%) and use of pesticides (98.49%) on environmental themes; and food security (99.79) and land ownership (98.06%) on social themes (Table 4.3). Table 4.3 Proportion of productive and sustainable agricultural land for the combined of three provinces of West Java, East Java and West Nusa Tenggara, 2020 DIMENSIONS AND THEMESPROPORTION OF AGRICULTURAL LAND BASED ON AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY CATEGORY DESIRABLE ACCEPTABLE SUSTAINABLE (2+3)UN-SUSTAINABLE Economic Dimensions Land productivity 8.12 2.16 10.28 89.72 Profitability 32.05 65.08 97.13 b. Proportion of sustainable agri-food land Indicator of the proportion of sustainable agricultural land area (2.4.1(a)) is a national indicator as a proxy for global indicator, designated as sustainable agri-food land. This indicator refers to The Law Number 41 of 2009 on The Protection of Sustainable Agri-food Land (PLP2B). The stipulation of the sustainable agri-food land (LP2B) is carried out by each district/city government through a regional government regulation. Considering that rice is the most important staple food for Indonesian and the commodity has social, economic, environmental, and political values, at present Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture records this indicator with prioritizing for rice field area. In the period 2012 to 2020, 110 out of 514 districts and cities have issued The District/City Government Regulation on Stipulation of LP2B, covering 28 out of 34 provinces in Indonesia The cumulative designated LP2B up to 2019 was 1,974,415 hectares, most of which were rice field as categorized as technical, semi-technical, simple, and rural irrigated; reclaimed land, tidal and non-tidal swamps; and rain fed land. Based on the Ministry of Agrarian and Spatial Planning stipulation, in 2019 the total area of paddy fields were 7.46 million hectares. By using this rice field area as the denominator, the proportion of P2LB in 2019 was around 25.6%. This figure was much lower than the target of the proportion of LP2B for paddy fields of 50% (Ministry of Agriculture Strategic Development Plan 29020-2024 Revision I). 5. SUPPORTING FACTORS FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT a. Management of plant genetic resources Indicator 2.5.1 is the number of accessions of plants and animal genetic resources for food and agriculture stored in facilities, both for the medium and long terms conservation. However, the availability of information was only for the plant genetic resources. Since more than 15 years ago, the Indonesian Center for Agricultural Biotechnology and Genetic Resource Research and Development (ICABIOGRD) of the Ministry of Agriculture has managed plant genetic resources for food and agriculture both in conservation facilities (Gene bank) and in the fields. In 2015 information on plant genetic resources was not yet available. In 2019, it was reported that the number of collection of plant genetic resources in the medium and/or long terms conservation facilities were 10,900 accessions consisting of 32 plants; as many as 8,400 accessions in the form of seeds and 2,500 stored as crops in the field. Form those amount, a total of 4,594 accessions was registered. In 2020 the genetic resource being registered was 5,246 accessions, an increase of 652 accessions. b. Proportion of livestock at risk of extinctionAnother indicator of target 2.5 is the proportion of livestock classified according to the level of risk of extinction, namely (i) at risk, (ii) not at risk, and (iii) unknown risk. There is only one livestock considered to be at risk of extinction in Indonesia, namely the Gembrong Bali goat, whose population in 2013 was only 28 heads. The definition of risk of extinction is if a livestock family has 100 productive females and 5 productive males. By referring to the total number of Indonesian local livestock reported to the FAO Domestic Animal Diversity-Information System (FAO DAD-IS) were 216 families, in 2019 the percentage of domestic livestock at risk of extinction was 0.46%, the rest were not at risk. The Ministry of Agriculture has responsibility and taken actions to prevent the extinction of Gembrong goats. 89 In an effort to increase the provision of superior animal genetic resources for food, until 2020 the Ministry of Agriculture has released 16 types of livestock, consisting of five local chickens, four family ducks, three family sheep, two family rabbits, goats and beef cattle respectively. These superior livestock have been distributed to small-scale breeders to increase protein source production with higher productivity and better characteristics of food products. c. Food price anomalyTarget 2.c in Goal 2 is to adopt measures to ensure the functioning of commodity markets, including limiting the extreme volatility of food prices. This is measured by the indicator 2.c.1*: food price anomalies (IFPA) which is the normalized difference of the compound growth rate of prices from its historical mean for a predetermined period of time. Basically, the IFPA identifies market prices that are abnormally high. The movement of food prices is classified as normal if the IFPA is less than half the difference from the mean, or: -0.5 IFPA <0.5; moderately high if IFPA 1.In 2019 the national IFPA were 0.21 and in 2020 increased more than double to 0.43; however, both indexes were felt into the normal category. Based on the data disaggregated by the provincial capital city, in 2020 as many as 24 out of 33 capital cities had the IFPA in the normal category, while the provinces belong to the abnormally high category were found in two capital cities only, namely Banjarmasin City of South Kalimantan Province (1.35) and Ambon City of Province Maluku (1.14). The rest (seven provincial capital cities namely Banda Aceh, Bandung, Denpasar, Kupang, Palangkaraya, Manado and Mamuju) were in the moderately high category. It can be concluded that the volatility or movement of national food prices had been maintained at a normal level. The government has been implementing the policies to stabilize supplies and prices of strategic commodities, namely rice, corn, soybeans, shallots, red chilies, sugar, cooking oil, beef, chicken meat and chicken eggs.. B. CHALLENGES AND ACTIONS TO OVERCOME 1. CHALLENGES The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been very broad in terms of economic, socio-cultural, education, health, and food and nutrition aspects. This pandemic has disrupted the performance of the food system, starting from the provision, access and consumption of food. The group most affected by this pandemic was the population with the lowest 40% income group (bottom two quintiles), including vulnerable groups such as pregnant and lactating women, children, and people with disabilities. Therefore, during this pandemic it is necessary to ensure the availability of sufficient nutritious food and equitably distributed to meet basic nutritional needs, especially for vulnerable segment of population. The pandemic has also caused wide disparities in health care and posed challenges in providing adequate health personnel, medical equipment and medicines as well as relatively high health expenditure. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen coordination, harmony, financing and accountability. It requires political commitment and simultaneous action in various sectors, as well as substantial investment and strengthening of data systems. (GNR 2020) INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 90 Research carried out by SMERU (2020) related to the impact of COVID-19 in Indonesia, identified several challenges faced in developing food and nutrition security, including the need to expand the focus of policies beyond stunting to address the three burdens of malnutrition (malnutrition, over nutrition, and lack of micronutrients); promoting a balanced diet through the communication of social change and community behavior; increasing access to diverse and nutritionally balanced foods through the development of a diversified, resilient and nutritionally sensitive food system; ensure social protection programs target those most in need so that no one is left behind; tackling gender inequalities to improve food and nutrition security; and strengthening monitoring and evaluation systems to improve food and nutrition security policies and programs. One of the government food policies is that the fulfillment of food staple is prioritized from domestic production by utilizing resources optimally and innovative technologies. Some of the problems and challenges faced in food production are: 1. The conversion of agricultural land to other uses takes place continuously which reduces the capacity to produce food; while expansion of agricultural land is limited to sub-optimal land which must be managed according to the principle of sustainability; 2. Degradation of the quality of water resources and competition in water use with the industrial sector is increasing; 3. Agriculture sector is dominated by small-scale farming (an average agricultural land and rice field are 0.5 ha and 0.2 ha, respectively), increasing proportion of aging farmers, and the farmers have limited access to technology, financial sources, and market information; 4. The frequency and intensity of extreme climate change events is getting higher, which will reduce the productivity of food crops and increase the risk of crop failure;5. Logistics and food distribution infrastructures are not evenly distributed, especially in eastern Indonesia; 6. The proportion of food loss and waste is still sizable, around one third of national production; and 7. Regional (province, district) food reserves and village and community food barns have not been fully developed in every region. Problems and challenges in the aspect of food affordability can be both physical and economic in nature. Physical affordability is still experienced by people in remote areas and small and outer islands whose access to transportation modes is still limited. Communities in eastern Indonesia face this problem more than those living on the islands of Java and Sumatera. Economic affordability is related to the purchasing power or household income, which can be identified by the poverty rate. In 2020 (March) the number of the poor was 26.42 million people or 9.78% of the total population. They will find difficult to fulfill their food needs, both in term of adequacy in quantity and quality (balance nutrition and safe). The problem of food consumption is related to various factors, including (a) low purchasing power of households to buy sufficient and quality food, (b) household food consumption patterns has not yet referred to the balance nutrition pattern, consumption of animal food, vegetables and fruit is still low and needs to be increased (c) low level of knowledge of household heads on food and nutrition, (d) less optimal use of local food, and (e) parenting and child-rearing practices. The high prevalence of stunting and wasting among children under five is closely related to the factors mentioned above. Nutritional problems in children under five years of age are also affected by poor environmental conditions such as low access to improved drinking water and sanitation services, and low access to health facilities. The challenges faced in reducing malnutrition 91 in children under five are very complex. This is related to: (a) high poverty rates, (b) low food security at the family level, (c) low maternal and child health services, (d) low immunization coverage, (e) sub-optimal feeding practices of children under five, (f) low family education which results in limited ability to access information on good nutrition, (g) poor parenting practices, (h) low access to improved drinking water and sanitation services, and (i) limited coverage of social protection in malnourished families. 2. ACTIONS TO OVERCOME Referring to the 2020-2024 National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) document (Presidential Decree Number 18 of 2020), achieving Goal 2 to end hunger is one of the priorities. Of the seven National Priority (Prioritas Nasional/PN) development agendas in the 2020-2024 RPJMN, there are two PN that support the achievement of Goal 2, namely: 1. N ational Priority 1 (PN-1): Strengthening economic resilience for quality and equitable growth. NP-1 activity components that are directly related to the achievement of SDDGs Goal 2 is Priority Program 3 (PP-3): Increasing the availability, access and quality of food consumption. Priority 3 Program consists of 5 Priority Activities, namely: (1) Improvement of Food Quality, Consumption, Safety, Fortification and Biofortification of Food; (2) Increasing Availability of Seafood Food Products to Maintain Stability of Supply and Prices of Basic Needs; (3) Increasing Sustainable Productivity of Human Resources (HR) Agriculture and Market Certainty; (4) Increasing Productivity, Sustainability of Agricultural Resources and Agricultural Digitization; and (5) Improving Food System Governance. There are 26 targets achievement indicators for NP-1, six of which are also indicators of SDGs Goal 2, namely: percentage of PoU (2.2.1 *), prevalence of FIES (2.1.2 *), DDP score (indicator 2.2.2 (a)), added value/agricultural labor (2.3.1 *), acreage of sustainable agri-food land of aw paddy fields (2.4.1 (a)), and number of conserved pant genetic resources (2.5.1 *). Other indicators from PP-3 that also have a direct and real effect on the achievement of the Goal 2 targets include the achievement of energy and protein sufficiency, the level of consumption of meat, protein from livestock, fish and vegetables and fruit, and production. as well as the availability of important staple foods in the consumption pattern and food economy in the country. 2. N ational Priority 3 (PN-3): Increasing quality and competitiveness of human resources. NP-3 activity components that are directly related to the achievement of SDG 2 are PP-3: Fulfillment of Basic Services. Of the 29 indicators for the achievement of this activity component, two of them are also indicators of Goal 2, namely the prevalence of stunting (2.2.1 *) and prevalence of wasting (2.2.2). Several other indicators are also related to the achievement of SDGs Goal 2, such as prevalence of infant mortality, maternal mortality, and percentage of complete basic immunization. 3. I n PN-1 there is one Major Project (MP), namely the Food Estate (FE) or the Food Production Center Area. The MP FE is an agricultural productive area with a minimum of 2,000 hectares that is cultivated for the polyculture food (various kinds) developed using an agroecological approach. The development of the MP FE is an effort to accelerate the addition of food production to increase national food reserve and the welfare of farmers. The MP FE development is carried out with an integrated, modern, and sustainable practices, by implementing a farmer corporate scheme and encouraging public and private/state own enterprises investment, while the role of the government is as a trigger by providing basic infrastructure development. 4. T he implementation of the Food Estate Major Project is carried out using a Thematic, Holistic, Integrative and Spatial (THIS) approach. Food estate development (KSPP) is carried out with INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 92 upstream-downstream aspects, namely geospatial, on-farm and off-farm integrated, using the principles of sustainability, integrative, resilient, inclusive, advanced and modern. Furthermore, the management of food estate (KSPP) is directed through the formation of a farmer corporation. The FE development is carried out by implementation of agriculture mechanization, efficient water management, and innovative agricultural technologies to increase the cropping index or intensity, productivity and food production. The implementation of the FE has started in Central Kalimantan (Kapuas Regency and Pulang dry land, East Nusa Tenggara (Central Sumba Regency) on dry land and rain fed land, then will also be developed in South Sumatra and Papua (Ministry of Agriculture 2021a). The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted a slowdown in growth or even created economic recession in various countries in the world, including Indonesia in 2020. Responding to these problems, the Government Work Annual Plan for 2021 was refocused to speed up the livelihood and economic recovery that was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (Presidential Decree No. 122/2020), This Government Annual Work Plan 2021 is named \"Accelerating Economic Recovery and Social Reform\". The priority of this annual work plan 2021 is to strengthen economic resilience with a focus on opening up labor-intensive employment opportunities, strengthening the food system, restoring cooperative and micro, small and medium enterprises, industry and trade, tourism and the creative economy, and increasing investment (Bappenas 2021). Several important programs and activities to be carried out starting in 2021 which are closely related to the achievement of Goal 2 are: revitalizing the food system, meeting market needs, increasing value added, and restoring agricultural-fisheries employment. Activities that are closely related to the efforts in achieving the Goal 2 are: 1. increasing online supply chain activities and strengthening food logistics, including strengthening fisheries cold chains and salt distribution systems; 2. fulfillment of domestic needs and export demand for food products, including high value fishery and marine products; 3. increasing labor-intensive activities in the fields of agriculture, fisheries and maritime affairs while still complying with health protocols; 4. protection for fishermen, fish cultivators and salt farmers; 5. utilization of electronic food data integration to support planning and control of access and quality of food consumption; 6. assistance for intermodal food distribution in production base areas and access to consumer markets; 7. food assistance households experiencing food insecurity; 8. unconditional cash assistance for pregnant women and those with children in order to fulfill nutritional adequacy for low-income groups. 9. increasing agricultural productivity in dry land (dryland and upland) and utilization of underutilized land, such as in plantations; 10. development of Food Estate or Food Production Center Areas; 11. development of integrated triple helix of cattle farms and collaborative innovative research; and 12. development of Indonesian National Standard biofortified rice, herbal medicine and kratom. One of the focuses on the Government's 2021 Work Plan to support the achievement of TPB/SGs 2 is the Revitalization of the National Food System. The revitalization of the national food 93 system, among others, emphasizes several things: i) strengthening the production capability/capacity and availability of domestic food in a more sustainable manner to meet the needs/demand for quality and safe food; ii) facilitation of conducive environment for the development of local food industrialization; iii) stabilization of food access; iv) strengthening farmer corporations and food distribution efficiency; and v) strengthening the quality of food assistance for food insecure households. One of the National Priority Projects (Major Project) 2020-2024, namely Strengthening Business Guarantees and 350 Farmer and Fisherman Corporations. The development of farmer and fisherman corporations aims to increase the productivity of agricultural products, increase added value, and increase farmers' income and welfare. The formation of corporations is directed at strengthening farmer institutions and the capacity of farmers to have an entrepreneurial spirit so that they can increase the income of small farmers. The implementation of farmer corporations involves various parties, both from activities and funding schemes. Furthermore, to accelerate the improvement of community nutrition, the Government has issued Presidential Regulation (Perpres) Number 42 of 2013 on the National Movement for the Acceleration of Nutrition Improvement. This National Movement is a joint effort between the government and the community through raising the participation of stakeholders in a planned and coordinated manner to accelerate the improvement of community nutrition. The priority of this movement is the first thousand days of life (1000 HPK), which starts from the conception to the age of two years. This movement indicated a strong commitment of the Indonesian government to join the global Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) network, which is a joint initiative of many countries that realize the importance of good nutrition is the best investment for the future. The government's high commitment to reducing stunting was also demonstrated through the preparation of the National Strategy for the Acceleration of the Prevention of Stunting. With this priority, it is expected that the stunting rate in children under five years can be reduced more quickly. In order to accelerate and synergize the actions of promotive and preventive efforts to live a healthy life, a Presidential Instruction (Inpres) Number 1 of 2017 concerning the Healthy Lifestyle Community Movement (Germas) was issued. Related to the achievement of SDGs goal 2 targets (targets 2.1 and 2.2), this Inpres directs 15 ministers, governors, and regents/mayors to take actions on the provision of healthy food and acceleration of improvement of community nutrition. For example, the tasks were as follows: Minister of Health to improve education regarding balanced nutrition and exclusive breastfeeding; Minister of Public Works and Public Housing to facilitate the provision of improved drinking water and sanitation services in public facilities Meanwhile, to improve food security and consumption of fruit, vegetables and fish, Minister of Agriculture was instructed to monitor the safety and quality of fresh food, and to increase domestic fruit and vegetable production by promoting the use of home yard land; Minister of Marine Affair and Fisheries to increase and expand the Movement to Promote Fish Eating Habit (Gemarikan) to the community at large and to supervise the quality and safety of fishery products; and the Minister of Trade to increase the promotion of healthy food and beverages including domestically produced vegetables and fruit. Meanwhile, the regents/mayors were instructed to carry out activities to utilize the home yard to grow vegetables and fruit. In order to provide a reference for the central government, regional governments, and stakeholders to improve food security and sustainable nutrition, Presidential Decree Number 83 of 2017 concerning the Strategic Policy on Food and Nutrition was issued. The scope of this Presidential Decree includes the strategic policies and national action plans for INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 94 food and nutrition; monitoring, evaluation and reporting; and funding. The strategic policy regulates food availability, food affordability, food utilization, improvement of community nutrition, and strengthening of food and nutrition institutions. Addressing those challenges requires a comprehensive strategy, with strong leadership to mobilize all stakeholders, both at the national and local levels. For this reason, a National Strategy for the Acceleration of Stunting Prevention has been prepared, to accelerate two main interventions, namely specific and sensitive nutrition interventions. Resource mobilization is carried out in an integrated manner to ensure convergence of program activities in the field. Policies and programs that support the achievement of Goal 2 are written in various line ministry documents and implemented by involving various stakeholder components. These policies and programs are written in the 2020-2024 strategic plan of related ministries, especially the Ministry of Health (Regulation of the Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia Number 21 of 2020), Ministry of Social Affairs (Regulation of the Minister of Social RI Number 6 of 2020), Ministry of Agriculture (Decree of the Minister of Agriculture Number: 760.1/Kpts/RC.020/M /11/2020), and the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (Regulation of the Minister of Health Number 17/PERMEN-KP/2020). In the Ministry of Health strategic plan, there are two programs that support the achievement of Goal 2. First, the Public Health Program with the goal to increase the availability and affordability of public health services. Activities in this program are directly related to the achievement of target 2.2, namely (a) family health guidance (health services for pregnant women, newborns, and children under five), (b) community nutrition development (nutrition surveillance, management of malnourished children at the community health center/Puskesmas, and exclusive breastfeeding), and (c) environmental health (monitoring the quality of drinking water services and management of food hygiene). Second, the Disease Control Prevention Program with the target of reducing communicable and non-communicable diseases, as well as improving mental health. Activities that are directly related are health surveillance and quarantine, with a target achievement indicator for children aged 0-11 months receiving complete basic immunization at 95% (special attention is given to Papua and West Papua provinces), children aged 18-24 months receiving advanced immunization rubella measles by 95%. The achievement Goal 2 for target 2.2 in the Ministry of Social Affairs strategic plan is pursued through (i) the Family Hope Program, which is designed to enable beneficiary families to access health services and to provide mentoring on the importance of adequate nutrition intake during pregnancy and child development; and (ii) basic food program aims at increasing the food availability in the low-income households. Activities directly related to the achievement of Goal 2 for target 2.1 and 2.2 in the Ministry of Agriculture strategic plan is designed in the Availability, Access and Consumption of Quality Food Program. Detail activities of this program are as follows: (1) food availability, consist of enhancement of agricultural infrastructure and facilities, plant pest management and mitigation of the climate change impacts on the agriculture, provision of post-harvest infrastructures, and availability of strategic food; (2) food affordability related to increasing capacity of food distribution institutions and food insecurity handling; and (3) food utilization related to ensuring food quality and safety and increasing supervision of the safety of traded fresh food. In the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries strategic plan, there are strategic programs to increase the availability and consumption of 95 fishery products as a source of animal protein, namely: (a) Fisheries and Marine Management Program, with the aim of increasing the productivity of capture fisheries and aquaculture (fish, seaweed) and (b) Value Added Program and Industrial Competitiveness with the target of increasing per capita fish consumption by the community. The government prioritizes efforts to fulfill the community's needs for food from sustainable domestic production, which is translated into policies and programs to increase variety of food production. This effort has two objectives, to provide sufficient food for all according to the principles of balanced nutrition, and at the same time food producers who are mostly small-scale farmers earn decent income. The number of small-scale farmers were 27.68 million households, about 10.34% were female-headed households (Statistics Indonesia, SUTAS 2018). The development of the food system also intensively involves private business actors and State-owned Enterprises (BUMN) as well as community groups along the food supply chain for various commodities. Several policies, programs, implementation in the field, including partnership cooperation between stakeholders can be identified as examples of Best Practices in achieving Goal 2. EMPOWERMENT OF SMALL-SCALE FARMERS Empowerment of farmers, especially those with small scale farming is one of the keys efforts in increasing sustainable food production and increase farmers welfare. Most of the government agricultural development programs have a small-scale farmers empowerment component, including for female farmers. One example of the best practices of the agricultural development with an empowering farmers component is the Rural Empowerment for Agricultural Development Scaling Up Initiatives (READ-SI) project, executed by the Agency for Agricultural Extension and Human Resource in partnership with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The main objective of this project is to improve the prosperity of Indonesian smallholder farmers (Box 4.7). BOX 4.7 IMPROVING THE PROSPERITY OF SMALLHOLDER FARMERS Increasing income of small-scale farmers is one of the objectives of agricultural development in order to increase food production and availability, improve food security and nutrition, and reduce poverty in rural area. One of the government's projects to achieve this goal is the Rural Empowerment for Agricultural Development Scaling Up Initiatives (READ-SI) project implemented in rural Sulawesi (14 districts in South Sulawesi, Central Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi and Gorontalo provinces), West Kalimantan (2 districts) and East Nusa Tenggara Timur (2 districts) for the 2018-2023 period. The development objective of this project is to empower individually and collectively rural households with the skills, confidence and resources to sustainably improve their farm and non-farm incomes and livelihoods. The INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 96 PROMOTING COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN PROVIDING FOOD DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMICS Food supply in the COVID-19 pandemic situation faces special problems and challenges, because the normal food system activities were disrupted. In April 2020 the FAO warned that the COVID-19 pandemic could have an impact on reducing global food production capacity so that it could trigger a global food crisis. To guard against the emergence of a global food crisis, Indonesian President Joko Widodo directed his cabinet ranks and the public to jointly increase domestic food production to meet the food needs for all people. Following up on this directive, the Ministry of Agriculture has refocused agricultural development policies and programs, one of which was forming a new program called \"Program for Increasing Food Availability in the New Normal Era\" as a short-term step in 2020 and continued as a medium-term of agricultural development 2020-2024. This refocusing program to mitigate the pandemic impacts can be seen as one of the best practices. In the program, there are four ways of acting ( Cara Bertindak / CB), namely: CB-1 to increase production capacity, including development of the food estates; CB-2 to reduce food diversification by using optimally local food sources, CB-3 to strengthen food reserves at local governments and community levels and develop a national food logistics system, and CB-4 to develop modern agriculture using various innovative technologies. including digital technology and farmer corporation approach. A brief description of the four CBs is presented in the Appendix of Best Practices. three main expected outcomes are: (i) Improved household incomes and livelihoods; (ii) critical services and input markets in program districts are sustainably improved in terms of quality, relevance, availability and accessibility; and (iii) supportive policy and institutional framework for smallholder agriculture The project is targeting poor and near poor farmers both men and women, who have potential to generate economic returns from agriculture; active/demonstrating farmers that act as \"agents of change\" and including women-headed households who will be included in activities directed at homestead gardening, improved nutrition and financial literacy. The project focus on the proven approach which includes community mobilization that are closely integrated with agriculture and livelihood development. READSI started in 2018 and in its third year, the project has supported 2,376 farmers group that include 54,413 members where 37% of it are women, mainly represented under the homestead gardening farmers group, and 40% are identified as youth. This project has supported 1,843 Farmers Field School (FFS) and has trained 35,410 farmers. This project has also started to support 1,457 farmers group in developing farming plan prior to start-up package and/or input distributions and 999 farmers group had open bank account. Initial data collected on adoption show that on average, the FFS plots had 39% higher yields than ordinary practices. Approximately 48% of the farmers trained were adopting the practices learnt during the FFS. Two major issues to ensure the effectiveness of this project are farmers' access to finance and linking farmers to markets. READ-SI is already scaling up a number of features from READ, in particular the community mobilization and Village Facilitation model which has proven to be successful. Similar approaches are also being scaled-up in the new IFAD supported UPLANDS project design. Link: http://www.readsi.id 97 BOX 4.8 PROMOTING FAMILY FOOD RESILIENCE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC Responding to President Joko Widodo's direction in anticipating the possibility of a food crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic, several governors and mayors issued an appeal to their communities to prepare themselves in case of a food crisis by planting crops in home yards and other vacant land around the house. Several non-governmental organizations responded to the call, one of them was Bina Swadaya Foundation in partnership with the Catholic Network Against COVID-19 (JKMC), Trubus Magazine and Trubus Shop. This foundation provided agricultural inputs (food crop and horticulture seeds, fertilizers, planting media, and farming equipment) accompanied by online training on farming practices and regular mentoring by social media facilities. This program was carried out in Depok City and Parung Bogor of West Java; Semarang Nusa Tenggara from June 2020 to January 2021. The beneficiaries of this program were 881 families including 164 families with disabilities.A qualitative assessment of this program performance indicated that the target group families were able to farm on home yard empty yards that produce nutritious food (horticulture product) for family consumption. Volunteers had a vital role in empowering these family members, mainly women. Two lessons learned from implementing this community empowerment are: First, the effectiveness of online training and social media mentoring depends on the availability and quality of internet connections and devices owned by each group and its members. Second, mentoring needs to be very intensive because it is not a direct face to face approach, including by reading the teaching material slowly and equipped with learning videos. This empowerment activity is easy to replicate in various regions and communities throughout Indonesia. Video of activity: https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=u_0RlSkLv3k INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 98 Many private groups and non-governmental organizations have responded also to President Joko Widodo's call for empowering communities to prepare themselves to provide sufficient food during the pandemic. The initiative to empower households that experiencing food insecurity has appeared in several communities. One of those initiatives was from Yayasan Bina Swadaya (Bina Swadaya Foundation). This Foundation mobilized poor families to use their home yards and vacant land around their houses to produce food. The Foundation empowered farmers by distributing seeds, other inputs, and equipment along with training on home garden farming activities (Box 4.8). The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the performance of the food supply chains. For vegetable farmers whose products are perishable, the government social restriction policy to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 creates two problems at once, namely demand for vegetables dropped dramatically and the flow of fresh vegetable products from production centers to consumption centers was hampered. A vegetable farmer group in Cianjur District of West Java had taken a creative action by developing online marketing (e-commerce) and taken advantage of a personal approach marketing by contacting local offices, institutions and individuals in nearby cities (such as Bogor of West Java). This effort was able to overcome marketing barriers, although not completely, and created a positive attitude of vegetable farmers to keep their enthusiasm in vegetable farming. This effort is presented as an example of both a quick and creative response in overcoming disruptions or obstacles in horticulture/food marketing (Attachment of Best Practices). The provision of safe food is an important step to achieve sustainable food and nutrition security. The Indonesian Food and Drug Authority (Indonesian FDA/BPOM) has implemented Community-Based Food Safety Programs in villages, schools and traditional markets. This activity is considered as one of the best practices since developing public awareness on the important of food safety in food production processes and food preparation for the whole family members is a critical aspect to ensure sustainable community food and nutrition security (Attachment of Best Practices). NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR REDUCING THE PREVALENCE OF STUNTING The policy to accelerate stunting reduction is formulated in the National Strategy (Stranas) . The National Strategy for Stunting Reduction policy is based on Law Number 36 of 2009 concerning Health; Law Number 18 of 2012 concerning Food; Global Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement in Indonesia which started in 2011; and the 2014-2019 RPJMN and continued in the 2020-2024 RPJMN have included stunting prevention as one of the priorities. In line with that, Presidential Regulation Number 42 of 2013 concerning the National Movement for the Acceleration of Nutrition Improvement (Gernas PPG) and the direction of the President and Vice President at the Ministerial Coordination Meeting on 17 July 2017 decided that it is important to prevent stunting with a multisectoral approach through program convergence in all levels (Box 4.9). 99 BOX 4.9 NATIONAL STUNTING REDUCTION STRATEGY The National Strategy (Stranas) To Accelerate Stunting Reduction is based on several important considerations, namely: (1) Indonesian and global evidence and experience related to stunting prevention; (2) to ensure that resources are directed and allocated to support the financing of priority activities, especially for increasing the coverage and quality of nutrition services at the household level in the first 1000 days of life; (3) to ensure that all parties at all levels can work together to accelerate stunting prevention; and (4) to involve line ministries, academics and professional organizations, civil society, the business world and development partners (23 line ministries and private sector and civil society organizations). The priority targets are pregnant women and children aged 0-2 years old or the first 1000 days of life (HPK) target. Priority interventions are specific and sensitive nutrition interventions. The development of priority areas is as follows: 1000 villages in 100 districts/cities that have a high prevalence of stunting (2018); 1600 villages in 160 priority districts in stages (2019); and all villages in all priority districts/cities (2024). The five pillars in preventing and reducing stunting prevalence in the National Strategy for Stunting Reduction are as follows: 1. Commitment and leadership vision The goal is to ensure stunting prevention becomes a top priority for the government and society at all levels. To achieve these objectives, the strategies implemented are: (1) President and Vice President's leadership for stunting prevention, (2) sub-national leadership for stunting reduction, (3) village head leadership for stunting prevention, and (4) involvement private sector, civil society and communities. The coordinator for the implementation of this pillar is the Secretariat of the Vice President/TP2AK. 2. National campaign and behavior change communication The purpose of this activity is to increase public awareness and change people's behavior to prevent stunting. The strategies implemented include (1) a consistent and sustainable behavior change campaign for the general public, (2) interpersonal communication according to the target context, (3) continuous advocacy to decision makers, and (4) capacity building. The coordinators for implementing this pillar are the Minister of Health and the Minister of Communication and Information. 3. Convergence, coordination and consolidation of the central, regional and village governments . The goal is to strengthen convergence through coordination and consolidation of central, sub-national and village programs and activities. The strategies implemented include: (1) INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 100 expanding convergence in planning and budgeting for programs and activities, (2) improving program design and management, and (3) strengthening coordination across sectors and between government and village levels. The coordinators for implementing this pillar are Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas and the Ministry of Home Affairs. 4. Food security and nutrition The goal is to increase access to nutritious food and promote food security. The strategies implemented include: (1) access to food and nutrition, (2) expansion of social assistance and nutritious non-cash food assistance for underprivileged families, (3) fulfilling food and nutritional needs of families, and (4) strengthening regulations regarding labels and food advertisement. The coordinators for implementing this pillar are the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Health. 5. Monitoring and evaluation This effort aims to improve monitoring and evaluation as a basis for ensuring quality service delivery, increasing accountability, and accelerating learning. The strategies implemented include: (1) improving the data collection system, (2) using data in results-based planning and budgeting, and (3) accelerating the learning cycle. The coordinator for implementing this pillar is the Deputy Secretariat. IMPROVING ADOLESCENT HEALTH AND NUTRITION Improving adolescent health and nutrition is an important component in the development of healthy, active and productive Indonesian people. UNICEF Indonesia in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education and Culture, and district governments in West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara Provinces is implementing a youth health and nutrition improvement program, which is implemented in 48 secondary and senior secondary schools. This program was appreciated by the local government as demonstrated by replicating this Nutritious Action program with funding from the APBD. The activities and results of this nutritional program are presented in Box 4.10. 101 BOX 4.10 IMPROVING THE YOUTH HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROGRAM \"AKSI BERGIZI\" In collaboration with the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and Culture, Ministry of Religious Affairs and the District Government, UNICEF Indonesia has taken proactive steps to tackle the double burden of malnutrition. One of them is through pioneering youth health nutrition in 48 pilot schools - SMP and SMA, madrasah aliyah and SMK. The program, called AKSI BERGIZI, was implemented in 10 districts in West Nusa Tenggara Province and one district in East Nusa Tenggara Province, implemented from January 2018 to March 2020. Program implementation begins with a qualitative, quantitative and landscape study of nutrition and youth health programs and related policies in Indonesia. The study found a prevalence of severe stunting (30%), wasting (nearly 10%) and anemia (nearly 20 %) among adolescent girls. Consultation workshops with national and local stakeholders were conducted to develop a youth nutrition program that combines three components: Support for weekly iron folic acid supplementation (WIFS) targeting adolescent girls. Work with local government, school management and teachers to promote the integration of nutrition and physical education into existing structures. Development of behavior change communication tools to improve food consumption patterns and physical activity of adolescents, their families and communities. Implementation in schools begins with training and socialization. Training for trainers was conducted for district facilitators from the school health unit, Bappeda, DEO and district religious offices. Trained facilitators are then assigned to train teachers and peer support groups. WIFS is conducted in schools through 45-minute weekly sessions consisting of breakfast together and tablet supplementation, and literacy sessions. Socialization activities are held separately as extracurricular activities aimed at socialization and behavior change as well as promoting a healthy school canteen. The results and results of this program are: As of February 2020, the completion of the three components has reached 80 percent The Province of West Nusa Tenggara aligns the program with its flagship health program, the \"Golden Generation\" of West Nusa Tenggara/NTB (GENTB). The government provided funds to train 22 facilitators from 10 districts/cities, with technical support from UNICEF, in October 2019. In 2020 the West Lombok District issues a regulation on adolescent nutrition, and DEO develops a road map and budget for improvement through the \"Sister School\". Model schools were instructed to pair up with other schools in the same sub-district and provide guidance. Despite the pandemic, West Lombok continues to distribute IFA tablets through peer support groups, based on a circular from DKP. The high completion rate of component 1 is widely recognized at the national and sub-national levels. Lessons learned from the implementation of this program are: (1) School health units have become the main force driving multi-sectoral coordination and facilitating training INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 102 for health workers and teachers; (2) The government needs to adapt program implementation to the different characteristics of public schools, vocational schools and religious schools to ensure effective implementation; and (3) Provincial and district regulations are needed to ensure that programs become priority and receive adequate budget allocations. Several local governments (Central Lombok, North Lombok and Southeast Lombok of West Nusa Tenggara and 10 districts in East Nusa Tenggara Province) have taken the initiative to replicate this program and allocate budgets for the scaling-up program. Replication should support health and puskesmas and its staff financially for facilitator training and provision of IFAs and training for teachers. LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY INITIATIVES TO REDUCE STUNTING District/city governments and community institutions recognize the importance of reducing the prevalence of stunting as an investment to build a future Indonesian people who are healthy, active, intelligent, and productive. One effort that is considered as an example of best practice is an initiative by the District of East Aceh, Aceh Province, which has a fairly high stunting rate. The Regional Government of East Aceh District is implementing a program to accelerate the reduction of the prevalence of stunting called Rumoh Gampong (RGG). The main activity of RGG is to increase institutional capacity and human resources through training on stunting (Appendix of Best Practices). Meanwhile, the Regional Government of Bandung City, West Java Province implemented the OMABA Cooking Center Program: A Bottom-Up Solution in Alleviating Stunting. The main activity of this program is to produce healthy food for consumption of malnourished children, sent by motorbike transportation. This program has succeeded in increasing public awareness of the need to rapidly reduce the prevalence of stunting. The lesson learned from this program is that cooperation between stakeholders is one of the keys to successful stunting reduction (Attachment of Best Practices). Non-governmental organizations also play an active role in efforts to reduce stunting. One of the best practices is the Bandung Tangginas Program (Bandung Responds to Stunting with Safe and Healthy Food) from the Bandung City PKK Driving Team and the Healthy Bandung Sehat Forum. The main activities of this program include the socialization of stunting prevention in 30 sub-districts, provision of healthy food intake, capacity building for posyandu cadres, and the blessing of Friday rings. This activity was carried out in partnership with related agencies in the City of Bandung and received funding assistance from several institutions such as the Bandung City Baznas, Bandung City IZI, and Sharia Pegadaian (Attachment of Best Practices). One other best practice carried out by community organizations is the Stunting-Free Village Program, which is implemented by Rumah Zakat. The main activity of this program is strengthening the capacity of village health cadres to maximize efforts to fulfill nutrition and 103 reduce the factors that cause infection; with the target beneficiaries are toddlers, pregnant women, and breastfeeding mothers. One of the results of this program is the increased awareness of the community and cadres about the nutritional needs of children under five and the ability to process complementary foods according to nutritional needs (Attachment of Best Practices). C. POLICY RESPONSE Eliminating hunger requires comprehensive efforts from all stakeholders. The role of local government, the private sector and the community is very important, in order to achieve the targets and indicators of the SDG 2. Cooperation in the form of partnerships within the framework of the food system is a form of effort that will accelerate the achievement of the various indicators suggested. The problems faced in achieving Goal 2 in the next five years are even more severe because they are exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Strengthening the implementation of various programs/activities as described above is necessary so that the targets that have been set can be achieved while still paying attention to the principles of sustainable development. For this reason, the participation of all components of stakeholders to ensure the realization of this is urgently needed, through synergies in investment, equal partnerships, and business efficiency. In this context, the government's role is to act as an advocate through the issuance of policies that are conducive to stakeholder participation and basic infrastructure investment. Indonesia continues to strengthen to improve the nutritional status of the community by formulating various policies as follows: 1. STRENGTHENING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2020-2024 NATIONAL MEDIUM-TERM DEVELOPMENT PLAN/RPJMN The policies for accelerating nutrition improvement in the 2020-2024 RPJMN include: a) accelerating stunting reduction by increasing the effectiveness of specific interventions, expanding and strengthening sensitive interventions in an integrated manner; b) increasing lifesaving interventions supported by evidence based policy including fortification and multiple micronutrient administration; c) strengthening advocacy, and social and behaviour change communication, especially encouraging the fulfillment of balanced nutrition using food based approach; d) strengthening the nutrition surveillance system; e) increased commitment and assistance in nutrition improvement interventions at the regional level according to local context; and f) rapid response to improved nutrition in an emergency. Planning and budgeting neds to be assured for the implementation of these policies (Bappenas: RPJMN 2020-2024). 2. STRENGTHENING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GOVERNMENT WORK PLAN 2021 Responding to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on slowing economic growth and disrupting progress towards achieving food and nutrition security, in the 2021 Government Work Plan (RKP) (Presidential Decree Number 122 of 2020), the theme of development in 202l is directed at the development process for recovery that is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, namely \"Accelerating Economic Recovery and Social Reform\". Important programs/activities to be carried out starting in 2021 which are closely related to the achievement of Goal 2 is: revitalizing the food system, meeting INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 104 market needs, increasing added value, and restoring agricultural-fisheries employment. Activities closely related to efforts to achieve Goal 2. 3. STRENGTHENING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL STRATEGY TO ACCELERATE STUNTING REDUCTION The government and other stakeholders have formulated a National Strategy for Stunting Reduction under the Leadership of the President and Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia. There are five pillars in preventing stunting, namely: 1) Commitment and leadership vision, 2) National campaigns and behavior change communication, 3) Convergence, coordination and consolidation of central, regional and village programs, 4) Food and nutrition security, and 5) Monitoring and Evaluation. It is necessary to guarantee the planning and implementation of the five pillars in the annual plan both at national and sub-national level (Secretariat of the Vice President of the Republic of Indonesia: National Strategy for the Acceleration of Stunting Prevention for the Period 2018-2024. 4. STRENGTHENING THE SUB-NATIONAL MEDIUM TERM DEVELOPMENT PLAN/RPJMD At the provincial and district levels, nutrition improvement has been integrated into the Sub-national Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMD). In its translation, the implementation of RPJMD needs to be continuously guarded to ensure its continuity in the annual planning and budgeting.5. STRENGTHENING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NATIONAL ACTION PLAN FOR FOOD AND NUTRITION/RAN-PG AND SUB- NATIONAL ACTION PLAN FOR FOOD AND NUTRITION/RAD-PG For planning that involves various sectors, both at the central and sub-national levels, an Action Plan for Food and Nutrition has been prepared both at the national level (the National Action Plan for Food and Nutrition (RAN-PG)) and at the provincial and district level (the Sub-national Action Plan for Food and Nutrition (RAD-PG)). The RAN-PG and RAD-PG period are five years in accordance with the RPJMN and RPJMD. The preparation of RAN-PG and RAD-PG is coordinated by the Ministry of National Development Planning Agency/Bappenas at the central level and the Regional Development Planning Agency/Bappeda at the sub-national level. As of December 2020, there are 31 Provinces and 212 districts/cities that already have RAD-PG (Bappenas: Directorate for Health and Community Nutrition). As an integrated planning document between sectors, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate RAN-PG and RAD-PG effectiveness. 6. STRENGTHENING THE CONVERGENCE EFFORTS TO ACCELERATE STUNTING REDUCTION The National Strategy for Stunting Reduction, coordinated by the Office of the Vice President and Bappenas, has formulated various efforts to accelerate stunting reduction through convergence efforts carried out from the central and regional levels. This convergence action is the government's effort to ensure that all interventions are received by 1,000 HPK households, both from central and regional funds. In 2018 there were 13 line ministries/agencies which supported the reduction of stunting with a budget of IDR 24 trillion. Furthermore, it will increase in 2019 to 18 line ministries/agencies with a budget of IDR 29 Trillion, increasing again in 2020 to 20 line 105 ministries/agencies with a total budget of IDR 39.8 Trillion (Bappenas: Directorate for Health and Community Nutrition). In terms of convergence actions at the sub-national level, 358 regional heads have signed commitments, 175 districts/cities have established teams to accelerate stunting reduction, 140 districts/cities have drafted regulations, and 93.85 percent of convergence actions have been carried out at priority loci (Ministry of Home Affairs, 2020). The progress that has been achieved needs to be maintained in the future. 7. STRENGTHEN THE NATIONAL MOVEMENT FOR THE ACCELERATION OF NUTRITION IMPROVEMENT Indonesia has joined the global movement to accelerate stunting reduction (Scaling Up Nutrition/SUN Movement). A forum for the National Movement for the Acceleration of Nutrition Improvement has been established for coordination and fortify cooperation between the government, business, community organizations, academics, professional organizations related to food and nutrition, and the UN system. SUN coordination in Indonesia is led by Bappenas. From 2014 to 2020, the coordination forum conducted a joint evaluation to assess the progress of 4 processes, namely: 1) bringing all stakeholders in the same actions, 2) ensuring a coherent policy and legal framework, 3) ensuring activities can be carried out to achieve agreed results together, and 4) monitor funding and resource mobilization. Each process consists of several indicators, given a score of 0 to 4, where a score of 0 (Not started), a score of 1 (Started), a score of 2 (Ongoing), a score of 3 (Nearly completed) and a score of 4 (Completed). The process evaluation shows significant progress, if in 2014 the score was mostly 2, then in 2020 most of the scores were 3. (Bappenas: Directorate for Health and Community Nutrition). A number of networks have also shown their involvement in the regions in order to accelerate efforts to improve nutrition in accordance with the mandate of Presidential Regulation No. 42 of 2013 concerning the National Movement for the Acceleration of Nutrition Improvement (Gernas PPG), including strengthening the national campaign for behavior change. At the end of 2021, the Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit will be held in Tokyo and all countries are directed to renew their 5-year commitments to be reported in the Global Nutrition Report (GNR) until 2025. 8. STRENGTHEN THE MULTI- STAKEHOLDER COOPERATION IN EFFORTS TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY NUTRITION. In order to strengthen the national campaign and communication on behavior change, a Presidential Regulation no. 42 of 2013 concerning the National Movement for the Acceleration of Nutrition Improvement (Gernas PPG) was enacted. Strengthened efforts as described above are expected to have an impact in accelerating the stunting and wasting reduction, supported by clear and measurable nutrition improvement policies in the RPJMN, the 2021 Government Work Plan, and the RPJMD serve as a basis for annual planning. Furthermore, the RAN-PG and RAD-PG are agreements between sectors and constitute a more detailed description of programs and activities of the RPJMN and RPJMD. The agreement between these sectors needs resources mobilization to finance every program and activity. The budget needs to be \"earmarked\" to ensure sufficient funds are available to support specific and sensitive nutrition interventions. To carry out the nutrition program properly, multi-stakeholder cooperation needs to be strengthened in line with the principles of the SUN movement of regular monitoring and evaluation. Strong leadership at every level of administration as well as a focused and continuous campaign are also essential. It will enable the country efforts to gradually achieve the target of nutrition improvement. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 106 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages. This goal is achieved if the health system runs properly, including quality and equitable health services, the fulfilment of health workers, pharmaceuticals, and medical equipment, strengthening governance, financing, community empowerment, and health information systems. The COVID-19 pandemic has been disrupting the health system. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the achievement of health development targets had shown progress in improving maternal, child, family planning, reproductive health services, and the fulfilment of health workers, pharmaceuticals, and medical equipment. The COVID-19 pandemic restricts health workers from providing health services and hinders the supply chain for the availability of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment. Thus, it impacts the achievement of health development targets. The 2021 VNR will discuss the progress of several Goal 3 indicators related to Target 3.1 on maternal health, Target 3.2 on infant mortality rate, Target 3.3 on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases, Target 3.4 on risk factors for non-communicable diseases, Target 3.5 on alcohol consumption, Target 3.7 on access to reproductive healthcare service, Target 3.8 on universal health coverage, Target 3.b on access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines, Target 3.c on the distribution of health workers, and Target 3.d on Goal 3 Good Health and Well-being health emergency preparedness. Since 2020, the achievement of the SDG targets has experienced a slowdown or decline due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the VNR preparation, Indonesia had confirmed more than 1.7 million cases of COVID-19. Despite the consistently decreased number of new cases in January-April 2021, the threat of an increase in subsequent cases remain exists, especially with the increasing population mobility during the Eid Mubarak holiday in 2021 and the entry of new virus variants that has resulted in the increasing transmission in European and India countries. Therefore, the Government continually improves pandemic countermeasures through case searches followed by contact tracing and isolation/quarantine (test, trace, treat - 3T), implementation of health protocols, including maintaining distance, wearing masks, and washing hands, large-scale social restrictions, and vaccinations. As part of the efforts in increasing 3T, the Indonesian Government, in this case, the Ministry of Health, has issued a regulation that allows the use of antigen rapid diagnostic tests as a modality for examining and diagnosing people with suspected COVID-19 and close contact with confirmed cases, especially in areas with limited access to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests (Decree of the Minister of Health 3602/2021). Social restriction effort had evolved from the implementation of Large-Scale Social 107 Restrictions (PSBB), which began in March 2020 to the Limitation of Micro-based Community Activities (PPKM Mikro ). Currently, 20 provinces are designated as PPKM Mikro areas, developing from seven provinces when it was first established in February 2021 (Instruction of the Minister of Home Affairs No.7 of 2021). The Government plans to obtain at least 426 million doses of vaccine by the first quarter of 2022. At the time of the review preparation, the Government secured around 280 million doses of vaccines from Sinovac, Novavax, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and the Gavi/Covax donated vaccine for distribution by the end of 2021. To achieve the main goal of reducing morbidity and mortality rate due to COVID-19, the Indonesian Government has prioritized health workers, the elderly, and public officials with the total target of 40 million people to receive the first batch of vaccinations, and followed by the vulnerable groups and other communities in the second batch. The total target of the COVID-19 vaccination to achieve herd immunity approximately requires 181.5 million people. The first dose of vaccination was given to nearly 12.5 million people, and more than half of them also received the second dose of vaccination; nearly all health workers received two doses of vaccination. The procurement of vaccines has been affected by limited global supplies and export restrictions by producer countries, therefore affecting national vaccination targets. A. TREND ANALYSIS AND IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 1. MATERNAL HEALTH a. Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) The latest data of the Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) could only be obtained from the 2010 Population Census, and the 2015 Intercensal Population Survey (SUPAS). Likewise, the latest data of the Under-five Mortality Rate, Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), and Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) had not yet been obtained as data collection of the 2020 Population Census has not been completed. Meanwhile, the Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) will be implemented in 2022. Maternal Mortality Rate at the end of the 2015 MDGs implementation was declared as an unfinished agenda, decreasing from 346 in 2010 to 305 maternal mortality per 100,000 live-births in 2015. In formulating policies and alternative interventions that effectively achieve the MMR target, information on the causes of maternal mortality is required. Based on the 2018 Sample Registration System (SRS), the most common causes of maternal mortality included hypertension in pregnancy, amounting to 31.9%, bleeding, sitting at 26.9%, and non-obstetric complications, reaching 18.5% (Ministry of Health, 2018). If hypertension in pregnancy is detected earlier, it can be controlled, so that maternal death can be prevented. An unintended pregnancy at a young age has a major risk of death or adversely affects the baby being carried (Chasanah, 2017). This is the main factors behind the Government's decision to raise the marriage age. Additionally, one of the key strategies for reducing MMR are ensuring that trained health workers assist every delivery and that the delivery takes place in health facilities, and strengthening the Family Planning Program (KB). INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 108 b. Proportion of deliveries assisted by trained health workers or in health facilities A higher proportion of births by ever-married women aged 15-49 attended by skilled health personnel, or delivered in a health facility, reduces the risk of maternal mortality. During the 2015-2020 period, the proportion of ever-married women aged 15-49 years with last delivery assisted by trained health workers, such as trained doctors, midwives, or nurses increased consistently from 91.51% in 2015 to 95.16% in 2020 or increasing approximately 0.6 percentage point annually (Figure 4.38). Meanwhile, 87.91% of Indonesian women aged 15-49 years gave birth in health facilities. Thus, the target of the 2020 National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) to achieve delivery in health facilities of 87% had been achieved. The COVID-19 pandemic certainly has impacts on access to health services. However, the proportion of deliveries assisted by trained health workers or carried out at health facilities consistently increased during the pandemic in 2020. Figure 4.38 Proportion of ever-married women aged 15-49 years with last delivery was assisted by trained health workers; or carried out in health facilities (%), 2015-2020 Source: National Socioeconomic Survey (Susenas), Statistics Indonesia In 2020, in contrast to complete coverage in Special Region of Yogyakarta and near-complete coverage in Central Java, Bali, Bangka Belitung Islands, Riau Islands, and Special Capital Region Jakarta, fewer than 80% of births in Maluku and Papua were attended by skilled healthcare personnel (Figure 4.39). Meanwhile, the coverage of this indicator was still under 90% in Central Kalimantan, West Kalimantan, West Papua, East Nusa Tenggara, and North Maluku. The proportion of deliveries assisted by trained health workers in West Java and Banten Provinces remained below the national average (95.16%), reaching 93.00% and 91.79%, respectively, lagging behind compared to other provinces in Java Island which coverage were above 98%. Gaps also occurred in the proportion of women who gave birth in health facilities, especially in the Provinces of Maluku, Southeast Sulawesi, Central Kalimantan, North Maluku, and Papua, the achievement remained under 70%. Indonesia is a large archipelago, and disparities between various communities living in different areas present a challenge in ensuring equal access to health services across regions (National Research Council, 2013). Underdeveloped regions should be prioritized for interventions. Proportion of delivery assisted by trained health workers Proportion of delivery in health facilities 109 Figure 4.39 Proportion of ever-married women aged 15-49 years with last delivery was assisted by trained health workers or carried out in health facilities (%), 2020 Source: National Socioeconomic Survey (Susenas), Statistics Indonesia Education levels also play essential roles in maternal healthcare-seeking behaviour. Figure 4.40 reveals the disparity in the proportion of deliveries assisted by health workers between women with different educational backgrounds in 2020. The number of women with primary, secondary, or higher levels of education whose last delivery assisted by trained health workers was higher than those who did not attend school. The gap between women with the highest education level and those who did not attend school was 18 percentage points. The disparity also occurred in the proportion of women who gave birth in health facilities, with a gap of approximately 25 percentage points between women with the highest education levels and those who did not attend school. It indicates the importance of investing in women's education to increase access to childbirth assisted by trained health workers and in health facilities (Biswas, Ananna, & Bhowmik, 2020).

However, the proportion of deliveries assisted by trained health workers in rural areas in 2020 was five percent lower than that in urban areas (Figure 4.41). It might be attributed to the limited number of health workers in remote and rural areas and the additional costs for the community to access maternal healthcare services (Biswas, Ananna, & Bhowmik, 2020). Meanwhile, the proportion of women who gave birth in health facilities indicated a wider rural-urban achievement gap of 14 percentage points by 2020. Uneven infrastructure development was one of the driving factors of the disparity in access to health facilities for childbirths between rural and urban areas (National Research Council, 2013). Figure 4.41 Proportion of ever-married women aged 15-49 years with last delivery was assisted by trained health workers or in health facilities (%) by residence, 2015-2020 Source: National Socioeconomic Survey (Susenas), Statistics Indonesia Household expenditure provided positive effects on the proportion of women whose deliveries were assisted in health facilities; the higher the expenditure level, the higher the proportion of deliveries in health facilities. However, the 2015-2020 data suggest that disparities between expenditure groups decreased every year. The reduction of the gap between economic status might be one of the National Health Insurance (JKN) and Maternity Assurance Programme or Jampersal contributions. In 2020, the proportion of women who gave birth in health facilities reached 96.09% in the top 20% expenditure group, 90.33% in the middle 40% expenditure group, and 83.26% in the bottom 40% expenditure group (Figure 4.42). This data is consistent with previous studies indicating that socioeconomic status affects the use of maternal health facilities (Wulandari, Putri, & Laksono, 2020). Figure Error!

Meanwhile, in the same year, 83.77% of women with disabilities gave birth in health facilities. The Ministry of Health has issued Guidelines for the Implementation of Reproductive Health Services for Adults with Disabilities, which basically establishes reproductive health service standards for persons with disabilities equal to those for non-disabled people. Exclusively, several adjustments should be made in the service provision, for instance, how to interact, measurement techniques, and examination techniques that need to be adjusted to the conditions of various disabilities (Ministry of Health, 2017). The gaps in indicator achievement of the proportion of deliveries assisted by health workers or in health facilities occurred in nearly all disaggregated data, indicating the need for interventions to strengthen and create equitable distribution of quality health facilities and infrastructures for maternal healthcare services. 2. INFANT MORTALITY RATE (IMR) The Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) shows a decrease from 32 (2012) to 24 per 1,000 live births (2017). The latest IMR data from the 2020 Population Census is still in the data collection progress so it is difficult to measure progress. The 2018 SRS data shows half of the infant mortality rate was neonatal deaths with common causes of deaths are intrapartum complications, mounting to 27.4%, respiratory problems, sitting on 22.3%, and low birth weight and prematurity, reaching 20.7%. The 2030 SDGs target of reducing IMR to 21 per 1,000 live births remains a challenge because the complex causes of newborn mortality are closely related to the condition of the mother during pregnancy, during delivery, and the first month after delivery. Therefore, the quality of health services before and at delivery, and in the first month after delivery is very important. Moreover, immunization has an important role in preventing death in infants and children. Figure Error!

No text of specified style in document..45 Reported HIV positives and AIDS cases, 2009-2020 challenges in efforts to reduce infant and under-five mortality are increasing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the disruption of health services for infants and children under five. Diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT3) and measles and rubella (MR1) immunization coverage decreased by more than 35% in May 2020 compared to the same period in the previous year. Service restrictions accompanied by reduced demand due to public fear of being infected with COVID-19 contributed to the decline. 3. COMMUNICABLE DISEASES a. HIV/AIDS Indonesia is one of the countries with HIV epidemics concentrated in key populations. In 2020, it is estimated that there were 543,100 people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA). From the modelling results, HIV incidence began to show a downward trend, reaching 0.24 per 1000 population in 2018 and is expected to continue to decline to 0.18 per 1000 population in 2024. The number of HIV positive cases reported tends to increase annually. In 2019, there were 50,282 cases reported, and the number decreased in 2020 with 41,987 HIV case findings during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, compared to the average of the previous 8 years, the number of new AIDS cases tended to decline, with 8,639 cases reported in 2020. There were as many as six provinces that did not report AIDS data in 2019 which might have contributed to the decline in AIDS cases in 2019. The six provinces were North Sumatra, Riau, South Sulawesi, Gorontalo, West Sulawesi and West Papua. Figure 4.43 Reported HIV positives and AIDS cases, 2009-2020 Source: Ministry of Health Figure Error!

As of December 2020, the coverage of ARV treatment remains limited with only 142,906 or 26% of the estimated PLWHA who are undergoing ARV therapy. To increase this coverage, the Government has adopted a Test and Treat Policy whereby every PLWHA who is diagnosed positive will be able to receive treatment immediately. The Ministry of Health also continues to decentralize HIV treatment services to primary services so that primary services are able to provide HIV treatment. The coverage of PLWHA with suppressed viral loads was only 6% at the end of 2020. The Ministry of Health is working to expand the coverage of viral load testing to all districts/cities in Indonesia. However, stigma and discrimination in society against people with HIV and HIV-vulnerable populations remain one of the challenges. b. Tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) incidence indicates a steady downward trend during the 2012-2019 period. However, there was a significant decrease in the number of people diagnosed and treated from 568,987 cases in 2019 to 355,553 cases in 2020 (Figure 4.44). It indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic has negative impacts on access to diagnosis and treatment due to enormous pressure on the health system and changes in people's treatment-seeking behaviour (Togun, Kampmann, Stoker, & Lipman, 2020). Several essential TB services have been used to support the COVID-19 pandemic countermeasures, such as the use of rapid molecular test kits for the SARS-CoV2 virus detection and the assignment of TB program staff to work on the COVID-19-related case. Meanwhile, the initial message targeted to reduce COVID-19 transmission, which encourages the community to stay at home if they are symptomatic of a cough and/or fever, can reduce the detection of new TB cases. This disruption of health services could affect an additional surge in TB deaths in the upcoming five years (Cilloni, et al., 2020). Figure Error!

On top of that, in Aceh and North Sumatra, the number of cases in men was fairly twice higher than in women (Ministry of Health, 2020). Previous studies indicated that this disparity correlated closely with the high smoking habit of men as one of the risk factors for pulmonary TB (Khairunnisa, et al., 2020). However, other studies also denoted that the low TB case detection in women was due to stigma, low access, and control of women in managing health resources (Rokhmah, 2013). Tuberculosis cases mostly occurred in the population aged 45-54 years (16.5%) and 25-34 years (15.9%). The high number of Tuberculosis cases in those age groups can impact the loss of productivity. For this reason, it is necessary to strengthen the prevention, early detection, and treatment of multi-drug resistance (MDR) to break the transmission chain and reduce the incidence of Tuberculosis. Figure 4.45 Distribution of Tuberculosis cases in Indonesia by gender and age, 2019 Source: Ministry of Health c. Malaria Although malaria incidence in Indonesia has declined, yet it appears to be stagnant over the past five years (Figure 4.46). The level of malaria endemicity in Indonesia is relatively low, however, the data records three provinces with the highest burden of malaria, namely Papua, West Papua, and Maluku (Figure 4.47). This figure highlights the need to prioritize interventions to control malaria for the Eastern part of Indonesia. Those three provinces have conditions that were favorable for the proliferation of disease vectors, in addition to their low socioeconomic level. Those provinces are also mostly covered by rural areas. These three determinants are proven to be significant causal factors of malaria transmission (Ipa, Laksono, Astuti, Prasetyowati, & Hakim, 2020). As of 2020, 312 districts/cities had received malaria elimination certificates and were in the maintenance/malaria-free transmission stage. Figure Error!

The initial messages to reduce the SARS-CoV2 transmission entailing people to stay at home if they have a fever potentially interferes with the treatment for a febrile illness such as malaria. Concurrently, the program of prevention campaign implementation before the peak of the malaria transmission season (which is likely to coincide with the peak of COVID-19 cases) needs to be adjusted to fit the restrictions for COVID-19 prevention (World Health Organization, 2020). Such disruptions could lead to a significant surge in malaria mortality by up to 36% over the next five years if the mitigation measure is not executed (Hogan, et al., 2020). Figure 4.47 Provinces with the highest malaria incidence per 1,000 people, 2019 Source: Ministry of Health INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 116 d. Leprosy Nationally, Indonesia has achieved leprosy elimination since 2000, while elimination at the district/ city level is targeted to be achieved by 2024. The number of districts/cities with leprosy elimination increases from 375 in 2016 to 401 in 2020. Nonetheless, this achievement is still lower than the 2020 target of 416 districts/cities. Figure 4.48 Number of districts/cities with leprosy elimination, 2016-2020 Source: Ministry of Health One of the biggest challenges in eliminating leprosy in Indonesia is the low level of public knowledge. The stigma of leprosy as a curse, a hereditary disease, or a result of witchcraft complicates treatment efforts (Warsan, Ngatimin, & Natsir, 2012). Breaking the chain of leprosy transmission through early detection (source of infection) followed by appropriate treatment is a principal factor in achieving the elimination status for districts/cities. Accordingly, the rate of new cases can be reduced as low as possible (<1 per 10,000 population). e. Filariasis Indonesia has also attained progress in stopping the filariasis epidemic. Most districts/cities, especially filariasis endemic areas, have participated in the filariasis elimination program. There were 10,681 filariasis cases spread across 34 provinces in 2018. This number indicated a decrease compared to 2015 with 13,032 cases. The five provinces with the most chronic filariasis cases in 2018 were Papua (3,615 cases), East Nusa Tenggara (1,542 cases), West Java (781 cases), West Papua (622 cases), and Aceh (578 cases). Meanwhile, the province with the lowest number of cases was DI Yogyakarta (3 cases). Cumulatively, 64 out of 236 filariasis endemic districts/cities had achieved elimination status in 2020. This number increased from 18 districts/cities in 2015. Nevertheless, this number had not yet obtained the target of 80 districts/cities by 2020. 117 Figure 4.49 Endemic filariasis districts/cities numbers achieving elimination status, 2015-2020 Source: Ministry of Health Figure 4.50 Distribution of filariasis-endemic districts/cities and their elimination status, 2020 Source: Ministry of Health The elimination was achieved through Mass Drug Prevention Program (POPM) for at least five consecutive years in endemic areas with a minimum coverage of 65% of the total population in order to terminate the transmission of filariasis. The province where all filariasis-endemic districts/cities have achieved elimination status is Banten. Meanwhile, there remains no progress in filariasis elimination status in the provinces of Riau Islands, Lampung, Central Java, West Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, North Kalimantan, Maluku, and West Papua since they are still in the middle of performing POPM interventions or in the post-POPM surveillance stage.

RISK FACTORS FOR NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES (NCD s) The major cause of the surge in the NCDs' cases number in Indonesia is the increase in risk factors such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, and obesity due to unhealthy and unbalanced diets, lack of physical activity, and smoking habits. a. Hypertension The prevalence of hypertension declined from 31.70% in 2013 to 25.8% in 2016, then increased to 34.11% in 2018. This data implied that there were 60 million people aged 18 years and above with hypertension. In 2018, the hypertension prevalence in women was higher than men, 36.85% and 31.34%, respectively. The hypertension prevalence in urban areas (34.43%) was slightly higher than in rural areas (33.72%). b. ObesityTThe obesity prevalence of the population over the age of 18 had increased from 10.3% in 2007 to 15.4% in 2013 and 21.8% in 2018. The highest obesity prevalence was found in the group of 40-44-year-old (29.6%) and 45-49-year-old (28.6%) in 2018. The obesity prevalence in women was twice higher than in men (29.3% and 14.5% respectively) and the figure was higher in urban areas than in rural areas (25.1% and 17.8%, respectively). c. Alcohol Consumption The trend of alcohol consumption in the population aged 15 years was fluctuating. It decreased from 0.48 (2015) to 0.33 (2016), increased to 0.54 (2017), and then declined to 0.39 litres per capita (2020). Such phenomenon can be encountered in both rural and urban areas. The alcohol consumption of the population in rural areas is almost three times higher than that of the population in urban areas.

Smoking Behavior The population proportion of smokers over 15 years old tend to fluctuate, it revealed a decrease from 30.08% in 2015 to 29.25% in 2017, increased to 32.20% in 2018, and decreased to 28.69% in 2020. The smoker proportion in rural areas was liable to be higher than in urban areas. In 2020, the number of male smokers was much higher (56.38%) than female smokers (1.07%). Moreover, smokers were also dominated by youths aged 16-30 years (25.70%), followed by seniors over 60 years (23.51%).

The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) The Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) shows the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) declined from 2.6 in 2012 to 2.4 children per women of reproductive age aged 15-49 years in 2017. TFR was higher for women who live in rural areas (2.6) than in urban areas (2.3); with a lower level of education (not attending school) (2.7) compared to those accomplishing a diploma/tertiary education (2.3), and from the lowest 40% of economic level (2.8) compared to the top 20% (2.1). Indonesia aims to have the balance population growth and the TFR is targeted to reach a replacement level of 2.1 by 2024. At the provincial level, there had been 2 (two) provinces reaching the replacement rate, namely Bali and East Java. Meanwhile, the TFR of the other 22 provinces were above the national average with the highest rate in East Nusa Tenggara, 3.4 children per woman of reproductive age. Figure Error!

Adolescent Birth Rate The adolescent birth rate/Age-Specific Fertility Rate (ASFR) for ages 15-19 years showed a downward trend from 48 births per 1,000 women (2012) to 36 births per 1,000 women in 2017 (IDHS). In rural areas, the adolescent birth rate was twice higher than in urban areas with 51 births per 1,000 women and 24 births per 1,000 women, respectively. Moreover, the adolescent birth rate of women from the lowest 40% of household economic level was six times higher than those coming from the top 20% of household economic level. The adolescent birth rate tended to be lower as women's education increases.

The highest adolescent birth rates per 1,000 women were in the provinces of Central Kalimantan (83), Papua (65), West Kalimantan (63). On the contrary, the lowest rates were in the provinces of DI Yogyakarta (15), West Sumatra (16), and DKI Jakarta (20). c. Demand satisfied for family planning by modern methods The use of contraception is one of the factors that can reduce fertility rates and the risk of maternal mortality. Although the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in Indonesia decreased between 2012-2017, but the use of modern contraception in married women of reproductive age who want to delay having children remain unchanged. IDHS shows the percentage of women of reproductive age whose demand satisfied by modern contraception decreased from 79.1% in 2012 to 79.0% in 2017. This pattern was also observed for married women of reproductive aged who use modern contraception. The figure fell from 79.0% in 2012 to 77.1% in 2017. In 2017, there were 19 provinces with the proportion of women of reproductive age whose demand for family planning satisfied by modern contraception below the national average.

UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE a. Unmet need for health services According to Statistics Indonesia (2020)9, \"Unmet need for health services is the ratio between the number of people with health complaints and impaired activities but do not seek outpatient treatment and the number of the population\", expressed in percentage units (%). The activities referred to working, school, or other daily activities. In Indonesia, the unmet need for health services increased 9 ht tps://sirusa.bps.go.id/sirusa/index.php/indikator/1504 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 122 Figure 4.56 Unmet need for health services based on the area of residence, 2015-2020 Source: National Socioeconomic Survey (Susenas), Statistics Indonesia Figure 4.57 Unmet need for health services based on the education level, 2015-2020 Source: National Socioeconomic Survey (Susenas), Statistics Indonesiafrom 4.66% to 5.44% from 2015-2020. The percentage of the population reporting the unmet need for health services was found to be higher in rural areas than in urban areas (Figure 4.56). The reason for the high unmet need in rural areas may be due to the far distance to health facilities and the limited number of health services. Meanwhile, based on gender, men and women have the same proportion of unmet need for health services. One of the factors that influence the increase of unmet need in the recent years is the low level of public awareness of the importance of health aspect.

Based on the data of Statistics Indonesia, the unmet need of the group who did not graduate from elementary school was 7.11%, graduated from elementary school (5.90%), junior high school (4.58%), senior school (3.73%), and higher education (3.11%). Household with higher expenditure level tend to have less unmet need for health services. In 2020, the unmet need for health services in the bottom 40% households' group was 5.97%, slightly higher than household in the medium 40% group by 5.54%, almost 2% higher compared to the top 20% group with 4.16%. One of key takeaway from this data is the unmet occur in the households with high economic levels even though the percentage was relatively low (below 5%). The highest unmet need rate was indicated in Central Sulawesi province by 8.67%. The high rate of unmet need for health services might be due to the lack of public understanding regarding health problems 10. Besides, in another province, such as West Nusa Tenggara, the geographical conditions, such as the archipelago area, are the main reason for the high unmet need. The people with disabilities had three times the higher unmet need rates than people without disabilities groups, with 13.49% in 2018 and increased to 14.41% in 2020. At the same time, the unmet need for people without disabilities reached 4.67% in 2018 and increased to 5.22% in 2020.Figure 4.58 Unmet need for health services by the expenditure groups, 2015-2020 Source: National Socioeconomic Survey (Susenas), Statistics Indonesia Figure 4.59 Unmet need for health services by the disabled status, 2018-2020 Source: National Socioeconomic Survey (Susenas), 2015 Statistics Indonesia 10 ht tps://sulteng.antaranews.com/berita/104398/pemkot-pa - lu-akui-masalah-kesehatan-masih-jadi-tantangan-pemerintahApart from people with disabilities, unmet need rate for the seniors/elderly group was also considered very high compared to other age groups. Based on 2020 Seniors Statistics data (Statistic Indonesia, 2020c), the trend of elderly group experiencing health complaints decreased from 28.62% in 2015 to 24.35% in 2020. However, 3.88% of them did not take medication, and the other 44.12% did self-medication. The reasons for the elderly group who did not get outpatient treatment were varied, such as 61.36% of them perform self-medication, 32.75% of them feel unnecessary, 2.36% of them have no money, and 3.53% of them stated a different opinion.

Based on the Social Demographic Impact of COVID-19 Survey (Badan Pusat Statistik-Statistics Indonesia, 2020a), held in April 2020, nearly half of the respondents experienced a decrease in income during COVID-19 and also experienced an increase in spending on health services. Furthermore, this proportion was higher among the elderly group by 8.5% than younger group counterpart by 3.8-6%. More than half of the seniors reported to have lower income during the COVID-19. They also reported that they reduced their spending on health services to compensate the reduction of the income. In addition, the reduction of health expenditure of elderly group was higher compared to the younger group. The reduction of health expenditure because the elderly group reduced the frequency of their routine check-up since they did not have sufficient fund or vehicles to visit the health facilities. They were also afraid of utilizing public transportation, and no one accompanied them. This matter would certainly increase the prevalence of unmet need for health services for the elderly group during COVID-19 period.b. Household Health Expenditures The Sustainable Development Goals mandate that every people had equal access to quality health services according to their needs without experiencing financial difficulties by 2030. The Statistics Indonesia (2020) use the ratio of total health expenditure and total expenditure to measure financial health burden for each household. Furthermore, the 10% and 25% threshold are used as cutoff value to define households experiencing catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) in Indonesia. The proportion of household with CHE (greater than 10%) at the national level decreased from 2.53% in 2019 to 2.23% in 2020. The same pattern can be observed in CHE (greater than 25%) which decreased from 0.53% in 2019 to 0.43% in 2020. The proportion of household with CHE in rural are were higher compared to the urban area. However, the proportion of household with CHE decreased from 2019 to 2020. This situation occurred since the rural area residents tend to have higher out-of-pocket health expenditures than urban areas (Ziller, 2006, quoted from Lee et al., 2014). 125 Figure Error!

The higher the level of expenditure, the higher the prevalence of health expenditures to the total expenditure. The 2019 data indicated that 1.36% of poor households had health expenditures of more than 10% of the total household expenditures, doubling to 2.74% for middle-class households, and 3.86% for upper-class households. A similar pattern was discovered in health expenditure which was more than 25% of the household expenditures. Women tend to have a higher health catastrophic expenditure than men. Then, women age more than 60 had a higher health expenditure compared to the younger group. According to Owens (2008), the high health expenditure of women in this age group was due to serious health issues they have. Several diseases such as menopause, the risk of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, and osteoporosis increase significantly at that age.

In 2019, there were 2.04% of population age 0-29 years of old who live in the household with CHE (more than 10%). The percentage of elderly group (more than 60 years old) who experience similar condition were doubled with 4.19%. The COVID-19 pandemic affects people's health (increase the unmet need rate) and people's socioeconomics condition. The number of unemployed people has increased due to the economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The open unemployment rate for August 2020 reached 7.07%. It increased by 1.84% compared to August 2019 (Badan Pusat Statistik, 2020b). Besides, the employed population decreased by 0.31 million people from August 2019. This case was very likely to push the households to reduce their health expenditures.

National Health Insurance (JKN) Coverage The National Health Insurance (JKN) is a program based on social security principles and aims to provide an equal high-quality healthcare services to all people. The JKN program has increased its membership coverage every year. Based on data from the Ministry of Health (MoH, 2020a), the total Indonesian population that has been registered as JKN member is 82.51% in 2020, and more than 27 thousand health facilities have formed a collaboration with BPJS Kesehatan (Social Security Administrative Body on Health) to serve JKN participants.

Based on the data compiled from Statistics Indonesia and National Social Security Council (2020), the highest JKN coverage was in Jakarta, and the lowest was in Maluku Province. Meanwhile, women and men had the same proportion of JKN ownership. Provinces with higher the average level of education tend to have the higher the JKN membership. There are significant differences between Premium Assistance Beneficiaries (PBI) JKN coverage based across provinces. The highest coverage JKN-PBI was in Aceh and Papua, while the lowest coverage was in East Kalimantan. It might be due to the level of community education and economic conditions in each province (Figure 4.66) Figure Error!

The Indonesian economy experienced a growth contraction of 2.07 percent compared to 2019 (Statistic Indonesia, 2021). As defined above, this situation has increased the number of unemployment and poverty, which can affect the community's ability to pay JKN contributions. However, since the beginning of the implementation of JKN, the Government has committed to helping poor people to access health services through JKN PBI. The number of JKN PBIs during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis reached 34% of the total JKN participants. It increased up to 4% from the previous year. On the other hand, although the Government has allocated a BPJS-Kesehatan subsidy of IDR 2.4 trillion in 2020 (Manafe, 2020), this subsidized assistance has not increased the number of JKN memberships during the COVID-19 pandemic. 7. ACCESS TO MEDICINES AND VACCINES a. Immunization Coverage Upper respiratory tract infection and pneumonia are the two main causes of child mortality. Ensuring that infants receive complete basic immunization before reaching one year of old is considered essential for reducing the mortality rate from these two diseases. Based on Basic Health Research data, the complete basic immunization coverage for children aged 12-23 months (once Hb-0, once BCG, three times DPT-3, four times polio or three times IPV, and once measles) decreased from 59.2% in 2013 to 57.9% in 2018. Children receiving DPT-3 immunization decreased from 75.6% in 2013 to 61.3% in 2018. The measles immunization coverage also decreased from 82.1% in 2013 to 77.3% in 2018. In 2018, complete basic immunization coverage was slightly higher in girls (58.7%) than boys (57.2%). A significant difference occurred between urban and rural areas. The complete basic immunization coverage in urban areas was 7.7% higher than in rural areas. The proportion of children receiving immunizations increased along with the increase in the education level of the household head.

In 2018, half of Indonesia's provinces had complete basic immunization coverage below the national average, with the lowest coverage in Aceh and Papua, i.e. 19.5% and 29.2% respectively. Experiencing better coverage, Yogyakarta and Bali's complete basic immunization coverage was above 80% during 2013 and 2018. Figure 4.68 Basic immunization coverage based on the province, 2018 Source: Basic Health Research (Ministry of Health) b. Essential Medicines Availability in Health Facilities Access to essential medicines is an integral part of universal health coverage. The access affordability on the essential medicine packages in remote areas can be implemented through the Community Health Centers (Puskesmas) by maintaining supply chains of essential medicines. Each Puskesmas was required to routinely report the availability of essential medicine packages in an independent manner (Directorate General for Pharmaceuticals and Medical Equipment, Ministry of Health, 2020). The 2015-2019 National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) set an initial target of 77% in 2015 to a final target of 95% in 2019 for Puskesmas that have a core set of relevant essential medicines (20 items). Since 2015, Indonesia has achieved the realization of 79.38% Puskesmas with the availability of essential medicines. In 2019, the realization of Puskesmas with the availability of essential medicines reached 96.34% (Directorate General for Pharmaceuticals and Medical Equipment, Ministry of Health, 2019). The 2020-2024 RPJMN sets the 2020 target for of 85% Puskesmas that have a core set of relevant medicines, consisting of 40 essential drug items. In 2020, there was a decrease in realization achievement by 92.12% as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the supply chain of essential medicine packages (Figure 4.69) (Directorate General for Pharmaceuticals and Medical Equipment, Ministry of Health, 2020).

The biggest decline in realization achievement was observed in Banten, Lampung, and Gorontalo. The imposition of social restrictions affected essential drug logistics both at the national level due to the import process disruption and at the local level due to large-scale social restrictions (Directorate General for Pharmaceuticals and Medical Equipment, Ministry of Health, 2020). Figure 4.70 indicates that the island region and Kalimantan region can still maintain the realization of the Puskesmas with the essential medicine packages availability up to 100%. Compared to, for instance, Banten, with an achievement of 97.86% in 2019, which decreased to 78.93% in 2020. The assignment of pharmaceutical officers in maintaining the essential medicine packages availability and the drug stock reporting system was also not optimal; thus, it resulted in the decline in the proportion of Puskesmas with the essential medicine packages availability. In terms of quality, the proportion qualified drugs increased from 78.6 (2019) to 90.6% (2020). Figure 4.70 Health facilities with available and affordable essential drug packages in a sustainable manner based on its region, 2019-2020 Source: Directorate General of Pharmaceuticals and Medical Equipment Reports, Ministry of Health 131 8. HEALTH WORKER Health worker density was calculated with the ratio of total health workers per 1,000 population. In this case, the health workers were categorized as medical personnel (general practitioners, specialists, dentists), nurses, and midwifery personnel (National Development Planning Agency, 2017). In 2017, Indonesia achieved its 2019 target with a ratio of 0.15 for specialist doctors, 0.45 for general practitioners, 1.8 for nurses, and 1.2 for midwives. Several challenges in fulfilling the indicators of health workers density and distribution are the high disparity in each province, particularly in areas outside Java and the field of dentistry, which has not yet met the target ratio of health workers set nationally (Statistics Indonesia, 2020). Figure 4.71 Health workers ratio per 1,000 population in Indonesia, 2014 and 2017 Source: Ministry of Health The Ministry of Health reported that there are more female health workers than male workers. Table 4.4 Number of Health Workers in Hospitals, Puskesmas , and other Health Services according to gender, 2019 PROFESSIONAL GROUP MALE FEMALE Specialist Doctor/General Health Ministry of Health In 2018, the highest general practitioners' density was in Jakarta with 118 personnel per 100,000 population, followed by DI Yogyakarta and West Nusa Tenggara, i.e. 54 personnel and 51 personnel per 100,000 population respectively. Meanwhile, West Java Province with a large population had the lowest general practitioners' density with a ratio of 7 people per 100,000 population. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 132 Figure 4.72 The general practitioner density distribution per 100,000 population by province in 2018 Source: Ministry of Health Figure 4.73 Indonesia's Achievement of International Health Regulations Indicators in 2018-2019 Source: WHO State Party Annual Report9. HEALTH EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS International health regulations contain 13 core points, which include: (1) National legislation, policy, and financing; (2) Coordination and NFP communication; (3) Surveillance; (4) Response; (5) Preparedness; (6) Risk Communication; (7) Human (8) Laboratory; (9) Points of entry; (10) Zoonotic events; (11) Food safety; (12) Chemical events; and (13) Radiation emergency. The World Health Assembly (WHA) assesses the success point of the indicators annually by measuring the country's performance scale based on the 196 entry points. In 2007, as part of the global community, Indonesia declared its compliance with the implementation of the International Health Regulation (2005). Referring to Presidential Instruction No. 4/2019 on Capacity Enhancement in Preventing, Detecting, and Responding to Disease Outbreaks, Global Pandemic and Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Emergencies, health resilience, in general, can be described as the national resilience capabilities of facing public health emergencies and/or non-natural disasters due to disease outbreaks, global pandemics, and nuclear, biological, and chemical emergencies that may have a national and/or global impact. In 2018, Indonesia achieved an average score of 63 out of 100 for the preparedness of the international health regulations and increased to an average score of 73 in 2019 (Figure 4.73) (World Health Organization, n.d.). 133 B.CHALLENGES AND ACTIONS TO OVERCOME 1. CHALLENGES The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the provision of health services, including reproductive health services. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimates that 47 million women living in low- and middle-income countries will reduce access to reproductive health services, leading to seven million unwanted pregnancies (UNFPA, 2020). In Indonesia, the coverage of antenatal care at the integrated health service post ( Posyandu ) decreased by almost 50% in the early months of the pandemic and reached the lowest coverage of 45.2% in May 2020. Although it gradually increased, the coverage at the end of 2020 had not yet returned to the pre-pandemic rate (Figure 4.74). This fluctuation in the coverage of antenatal care services was in line with the implementation of the large-scale social restriction in Indonesia. Figure 4.74 Antenatal care services in Posyandu (%) in 2020 Source: Ministry of Health The decrease in access to reproductive health services could increase the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) by 5-17%, while the impact on the absolute number of maternal mortality would be more severe, the increase was estimated to reach 7-75% (UNFPA, 2020). The quality of health services has been identified as a major obstacle to maternal health services in Indonesia, especially in managing emergency cases. The problems encountered include the lack of qualified health service providers, overcrowded health facilities, and inadequate accreditation of health facilities that contribute to poor service quality provided (Brooks, et al., 2017). Therefore, well-equipped healthcare facilities and trained health workers are essential. In addition, the accessibility factor of health facilities also needs to be considered to improve maternal health services in Indonesia. To reduce the number of maternal mortality, a holistic and sustainable strategy is required. The pattern of maternal mortality causes according to the 2018 Sample Registration System (SRS) indicated that the most common causes were hypertension in pregnancy (31.9%), bleeding (26.9%), and non-obstetric complications (18.5%) %) which can be prevented with the good practice of early detection of mother's risk. When hypertension in pregnancy is detected early, the pregnant women can be controlled earlier, and it can prevent maternal mortality. The quality of ANC for early recognition Figure Error!

Subsequently, it is necessary to prepare the nutritional status of mothers and women entirely to tackle the rate of anemia which remains high in the productive age group of women. Maternal mortality also has a significant correlation with adolescent pregnancy (WHO). In a conservative country such as Indonesia, adolescent pregnancy is strongly related to child and teenage marriage. The COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of early marriage has increased significantly. The reported number of child marriage dispensations granted by the Religious Courts increased from 23,126 cases in 2019 to 64,211 cases in 2020 (Figure 4.75). A pandemic circumstance that requires all family members to limit their activities outside their houses, which has resulted in economic issues of the family and school closures, is thought to be the main factor in increasing child marriage (Cousins, 2020). Figure 4.75 Number of child marriage dispensation (<18 years old) granted by the Religious Court, 2016-2020 Source: The National Commission on Violence Against Women Accordingly, further challenges in improving maternal health services to reduce MMR include: 1. improving quality and equal access to primary and referral health services, as well as access to maternal emergency services including human resource competencies, facilities, and Puskesmas that are capable of providing Basic Emergency and in rural areas; 2. improving reproductive health services for women's and adolescents, as well as the importance of antenatal care and delivery assistance in health facilities for pregnant women; 3. improving the nutritional status of women of reproductive age and pregnant mothers. For communicable diseases such as Tuberculosis, the average notification rate was 47,000 cases per month in 2019. However, following the COVID-19 pandemic, TB case notifications decreased by 35 percent in the early months of the pandemic. The case notifications started to decrease in March and Figure Error!

The case notifications began to increase in June but continued to decline in the third quarter of 2020 (Figure 4.76). Services for TB patients were affected due to the reallocation of manpower, financial, and other resources from TB prevention and control to handling COVID-19. For example, Indonesia had reported the use of a GeneXpert machine for COVID-19 testing and the assignment of national TB program staff to COVID-19-related tasks. Figure 4.76 New and Recurrent TB Case Notifications Rate per month in 2020 Source: WHO Global TB report Indonesia had made progress in the detection and treatment of drug-resistant TB during the 2010-2019 period. In 2019, 11,463 patients with Multidrug-Resistant/Rifampicin-Resistant (MDR/RR) TB were detected and notified, leading to an increase of 27% from 9,038 in 2018. The number of patients enrolled in the treatment also increased by 20%. However, in 2020, the case detection and the number of patients starting the treatment declined by 20% and 17%, respectively (Figure 4.77). In 2020, only 57% of patients with MDR/RR-TB started the treatment. The following measures are required to address the gap: increasing TB case detection; increasing bacteriological confirmation among patients with TB; expanding coverage of drug resistance testing among patients with bacteriologically confirmed TB; and ensuring that all patients with MDR/RR-TB are enrolled in the treatment (World Health Organization, 2020).

In line with WHO guidelines, actions taken by the Government to reduce the impact on essential TB services, such as expanding the use of digital technology for remote consultation and support, reducing the necessity for visits to the health facilities by providing preference to home treatment, and providing TB patients with medical supplies for up to one month (Ministry of Health, 2020). The number of cities/districts that reported the elimination of malaria cases increased every year. In 2020, there were 312 cities/districts that reported eliminating malaria, an increase from 300 cities/districts in 2019 (Figure 4.78). However, this increase had slowed down compared to the previous average increase in cities/districts, which reached 17 cities/districts annually in the 2015-2019 period. Figure 4.78 Number of districts/cities achieving malaria elimination in 2015-2020 Source: Annual report of the Directorate General of Disease Prevention and Control, Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia The COVID-19 pandemic along with the social restrictions in an effort to suppress the spread of the SARS-CoV2 virus also disrupted essential malaria services in 2020. Several activities hampered at the beginning of the pandemic were the insecticide-treated bed-net campaign, reallocation of malaria rapid diagnostic kits production for COVID-19 rapid diagnostic kits, and the use of malaria drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment, which could potentially inhibit the malaria diagnosis and treatment. A modelling study by WHO discovered that the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic could double the death rate from malaria from 2018, or the same death rate 20 years ago (World Health Organization, 2020). These findings were distributed to all countries at the beginning of the pandemic so that the Government could take mitigation measures to properly maintain the implementation of malaria health services. The challenges faced in eliminating leprosy include the sub-optimal commitment of the districts/ cities of leprosy enclaves in prioritizing resources for programs, limited quantity and quality of human resources for leprosy prevention and control, low public knowledge and awareness about leprosy, and the stigma of leprosy sufferers and their families who are affected by leprosy that hinder the case detection. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the delays in surveillance activities for leprosy in the field. The budget refocusing carried out in 2020 for COVID-19 had also made it difficult for some regions Figure Error!

Based on study by National Institute of Health Research and Development, Ministry of Health (Balitbangkes Kemenkes), Filariasis elimination confronted challenges, such as geographic conditions in endemic areas that are difficult to access remote villages and islands and the alleged follow-up events after the POPM, resulting in the decreased community participation in taking the medicine. The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected community-based activities, such as POPM. In addition, budget refocusing on the filariasis prevention and control programs had also led to delays in the implementation of the elimination survey evaluation (Ministry of Health, 2021). The challenges faced during 1990-2016 including the shift of domination of the disease burden profile from communicable diseases to non-communicable diseases (NCD). Sedentary lifestyles such as obesity, hypertension, heavy smoking habits, and lack of physical activity increase the risk factors of NCD, such as stroke, heart disease, and diabetes. In addition, the achievement of reproductive health service remains encounter great challenges, considering the varied understanding level of adolescents regarding reproductive health, the suboptimal use of modern contraceptive methods for married women of reproductive age, the high rate of child marriage, and the high rate of unintended pregnancy. The COVID-19 pandemic crisis potentially impacts all aspects, such as health, economy, social, and culture. Consequently, based on universal health coverage status, Indonesia are in the state of a health emergency. Vulnerable groups-- people with disabilities, children, women, seniors, and people with low income-- are more at risk of being affected by the pandemic. This situation indicates that the national healthcare system is still vulnerable to the shock by the COVID-19 pandemic. The healthcare system preparedness and the equitable distribution of health workers are required to overcome this issue. The challenges faced in achieving health system stability include: 1. improving access to health facilities that are friendly for pregnant women, children, people with disabilities, and seniors, as well as other vulnerable groups - up to the village level, and 2. increasing low public awareness and knowledge about the importance of maintaining health status. The immunization program encountered several challenges, including several geographic area that hard-to-access, difference in service quality due to the gaps in the health workers' competence, suboptimal documentation and reporting system, and negative rumors about immunization spreading in the community through various media (Ministry of Health, 2021). The pandemic also affects the coverage of the immunization program. The coverage of DPT-3 and MR-1 (Measles and Rubella) vaccinations decreased by more than 35% in May 2020 compared to the same period in the previous year. This reduction was caused by healthcare service closure coupled with the decrease in public demand due to the fear of contracting COVID-19. Based on the rapid assessment conducted by the Ministry of Health and UNICEF (2020), 55% of Posyandu reported delays in immunization services. The equitable distribution and availability of essential drug packages in all regions in Indonesia faced many challenges. At the planning stage, most planning allocations were based solely on the consumption models, not on the epidemiological models and disease trends. There were limited capacities of human resources and infrastructure, both at the central and sub-national levels, to report the availability of the essential medicine packages. In addition, social restrictions hinder the distribution period from the request to the fulfillment, in which INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 138 some regions may need to wait for six months. (Ministry of Health, 2020). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the logistic distribution had been disrupted since the implementation of social restrictions became a problem in maintaining the availability of the essential medicine packages. The Ministry of Health had issued regulations to maintain the availability of the essential drug packages and asked the Ministry of Transportation to prioritize the distribution of health logistics. As a consequence of task shifting in handling the COVID-19 pandemic, many staff at the Puskesmas in charge of reporting could only report the lists of drugs and vaccines required out of their working hours, for this reason, the reports are in delay. The central pharmacy warehouse opened managerial information to process the input necessities for 24 hours without delay to solve this problem (Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia, 2020). Although Indonesia had met the health workers density ratio on a national scale, Indonesia still held limited health worker resources in terms of quantity, distribution, quality, and limits of authority. Many health workers were under the burden of multitasking and task shifting, affecting the quality health services and limited access to certain health services (Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas, 2019). Indonesia's geographic locations as an international transport route center make it prone to epidemics of emerging infectious diseases and the potential to the pandemic. Therefore, preventing and reducing the impact of these phenomena has become Indonesia's priority and it is reflected in the National Health Strategy and Action Plan (Rai et al., 2020). The evaluative study results on strengthening the capacity of the Indonesian Port Health Authority (KKP) demonstrated (Kementerian PPN/Bappenas, 2021): 1. 8 3% of the KKP's facilities and infrastructure remain inadequate to carry out their duties and functions to prevent, detect, and respond to potential diseases and other threats at the entrance. 2) 7 3% of the KKP's human resources have met the standards set. However, in terms of distribution, the types of human resources required do not necessarily match the needs. 3) 8 0% of the KKP's capacity in the sustainable prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic should be supported by supplies and needs for personal protective equipment (PPE), drugs for the COVID-19 control, screening equipment, and confirmative test equipment. \u00a9 UNICEF/ UN0246934 139 2. ACTIONS TO OVERCOME In 2020, to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government issued Guidelines for Antenatal, Childbirth, Postpartum, and Newborn Care in the New Normal Era (Ministry of Health, 2020). These guidelines include: 1. P revention of general transmission in pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum; 2. R eadiness of health service facilities in COVID-19 management, including the standard types of PPE used by health workers in providing services; 3. T he antenatal care program is divided according to the spread zone of COVID-19 cases using e-registration for appointments and e-consults through online communication media to replace offline programs, such as classes for pregnant women and perinatal maternal audits; 4. P lanned referral guidelines for pregnant women with COVID-19 symptoms, and or with childbirth risk factors; 5. A ll deliveries take place in healthcare facilities by examining the childbirth risk factors and symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 to determine the health facilities type; 6. T he postpartum care program is divided according to the spread zone of COVID-19 cases using e-registration for appointments and e-consults through online communication media for 2-4 visits in low-high risk zones. In the 2020-2024 RPJMN, the Government includes \"Accelerating the Reduction of Maternal Mortality and Stunting\" as one of the strategic priority projects. The target indication for MMR decrease amounts to 183/100,000 live births in 2024, while the previous MMR amounted to 305/100,000 live births in 2015, with the following project highlights: 1. S upplementary feeding program (PMT), micro-nutrient supplementation, Community-led Total Sanitation (Ministry of Health), quality family planning services in health facilities (BKKBN); 2 H olistic-integrative early childhood development and parenting classes (Ministry of Education and Culture); 3 A ccess to improved drinking water and sanitation services (Ministry of Public Works and Housing); 4. H ealth operational assistance (Special Allocation Fund (DAK) for Health). Mitigation measures for the COVID-19 pandemic impacts by the Government in TB services are more clearly regulated in the TB Services Protocol during the COVID-19 pandemic, which include: 1. M easures to prevent the COVID-19 transmission in service delivery; 2. P lanning for TB drug needs and other logistics including masks; 3. M apping and appointment of a temporary referral health facility of drug-resistant TB (TBRO) (separated from the COVID-19 health facilities); 4. M apping and appointment of other health facilities for laboratory services in the context of TB diagnosis, particularly if the old network needs to be adjusted due to the handling of COVID-19 in the area. 5. M onitoring of TB patients' taking medication using digital technology or a hotline in accordance with local capabilities; 6. M apping in local community engagement for patient assistance; C ommunity involvement, including nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society organizations (CSOs), is essential in controlling Tuberculosis in the population. This can happen formally in the health services infrastructure (e.g., community health workers/CHWs), or informally, such INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 140 as involving family members in patient support. Activities may include awareness raising through education campaign, using CHWs to find people with TB symptoms and refer them to diagnostic and other services, or appointing family members to provide daily support or observation for those taking medicines. (Hadley & Maher, 2000) I nvolving trained CHWs in active TB case findings has proven feasible and can be integrated seamlessly with routine practices (McAllister et al, 2017). CSOs can also make impactful contribution. For example, Aisyiah, a faith-based women organization, has been involved in mobilizing local funding for TB in Bengkulu, and at present works in 14 provinces, 130 districts and 2,083 subdistricts nationwide (World Health Organization, 2020). 7. G uidelines for TB patients care and treatment during the pandemic; 8. G uidelines for laboratory services during the pandemic; 9. S trict surveillance to prevent an increase in the loss of follow-up rate during the pandemic. In 2020, the Government issued the Malaria Service Protocol during the COVID-19 Pandemic Era to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria essential services. The guidelines include: 1. P revention of COVID-19 transmission in malaria services; 2. M alaria control management by ensuring the need and availability of anti-malarial drugs as well as malaria service logistics at every level, particularly Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT); 3. D iagnostic and management guidelines of COVID-19 patients with malaria; 4. M alaria surveillance activities that may continue to run, such as surveillance of malaria cases, especially patient detection and epidemiological investigations (PE); 5. T he malaria prevention using mosquito nets, including recommendations for adapting the mosquito nets distribution during the COVID-19 pandemic; 6. R egular recording and reporting using Malaria Surveillance Information System (SISMAL) Efforts to eliminate leprosy are carried out through strengthening leprosy services and surveillance for active case finding and treatment, strengthening advocacy and program dissemination to stakeholders, increasing the capacity of health workers, promoting and educating patients, family, and community to reduce the leprosy stigma, and strengthening partnership networks with stakeholders, including professional organizations (Ministry of Health, 2021). The strategic efforts made to eliminate filariasis include increasing the coverage of filariasis POPM through the implementation of Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Month (BELKAGA) every October; accelerating elimination through the use of the three-drug IDA regimen (Ivermectin, DEC, and Albendazole) according to WHO recommendations, intensive Mass Drug Prevention Program (POPM) advocacy and dissemination, and post POPM filariasis surveillance (Ministry of Health, 2021). NCD prevention and control ought to be a pro-poor policy. The Government systematically takes steps in preventing and controlling, including (a) implementing promotive, preventive, curative, and rehabilitative efforts comprehensively; (b) developing and strengthening surveillance systems; (c) strengthening networks and partnerships through community empowerment; (d) expanding the stop-smoking services; (e) monitoring the distribution and sale of tobacco and alcohol products; and (f) increasing excise and tax on tobacco and alcohol products. 141 It is required to improve the reproductive health quality, focusing on access expansion, family planning quality, and reproductive health services according to regional characteristics, supported with the optimization of the private sector and government roles through advocacy, education, and counseling; enhancing the competency of family planning extension workers and field officers, field line staff, and health workers in family planning services; strengthening the health service facilities and networks; increasing the postpartum family planning; and increasing knowledge, understanding, and access to adolescent reproductive health services in a gender-responsive cross-sector manner. Following measures made to increase immunization coverage for children include improving the immunization service quality by increasing the officers' capacity; increasing public awareness and demand generation with a communication strategy based on human-centered design; and strengthening cross-program and cross-sector coordination, including networking with the private sector in terms of services and community mobilization (Ministry of Health, 2021). Following measures to fulfill the availability and distribution of health workers, especially in remote areas, borders, islands, and areas with health problems are made through the placement of health workers with special assignments for both individuals and teams and the placement of internship doctors. As of December 2020, the number of health workers deployed through the team-based and individual-based Nusantara Sehat scheme amounted to 4,588 and 9,211 health workers, respectively. The health workers deployed consisted of general practitioners, dentists, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, nutritionists, environmental health experts, public health experts, and medical laboratory technology experts (Ministry of Health, 2021). Meanwhile, the number of doctors participating in the 2020 internship reached 10,360 people. The various scheme of heatlh workers' deployment have contributed to the increase of proportion of Puskesmas with standard types of health workers from 23% (2019) to 39.9% (2020). The proportion of district/city hospitals which have 4 basic specialists and 3 other specialists also increased from 61.7% (2019) to 75.04% (2020) To improve the competency of health workers, the Government provides sustainable education assistance programs, health professional education assistance for specialist doctors/dentists, education assistance for health workers who have not received their associate's degree, accredited technical and functional training, and internship programs. In 2020, the competencies of 52,013 health workers had been upgraded (Ministry of Health, 2021). Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for functional health workers has increased in various fields and sectors. The COVID-19 epicenter area requires more functional health workers than any other areas. In addition, functional health workers are also required in the preventive, promotive, and curative fields to help accelerate the handling of COVID-19 (Ridlo, 2020). The Government has placed additional 677 health workers at the COVID-19 referral hospitals through the exclusive Nusantara Sehat Program. Apart from the required number of functional health workers, the quality should be continuously improved with accurate information about COVID-19 and its handling. The lack of capacity related to the geographical location and Indonesia's position as an international transportation center make it prone to epidemics of emerging infectious diseases. Harmonization between agencies should be initiated by the Ministry of Health as reflected with the collaboration between the Ministry of Health and Coordinating Ministry for Political, Legal, and Security Affairs in the development of the National Action Plan for Health Security in 2020-2024. In addition to the various actions taken by the Government in facing the Goal 3 challenges, various initiatives have also been carried out by institutions, both state and non-state actors, as follows INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 142 BOX 4.11 THE VILLAGE THAT CARES FOR MIGRANT WORKERS RESPONDS TO COVID-19 This program was implemented in Indramayu, Wonosobo, Jember, and Banyuwangi and was initiated by Migrant Care. The COVID-19 pandemic declared by WHO (March 2020) had profound impacts on the migrant worker community, both in destination countries and in their hometowns. Since then, many migrant workers had returned to their hometowns because of the economic contraction due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The Village that Cares for Migrant Workers (DESBUMI) and the local COVID-19 Task Force worked together to minimize the impact of the migrant workers' arrival from abroad. The activities included dissemination about COVID-19, health protocol campaign, preparation of isolation places, as well as sewing masks and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).Migrant Care conducted online webinars on the data collection of returning migrant workers and the need for access to health. DESBUMI also prepared activities that workers could carry out upon arrival at home, i.e., producing masks and PPE. Migrant Care noted that 176,000 migrant workers returned to Indonesia and there were no new cases caused by this activity. Apart from being at the forefront of accurate information and dissemination regarding COVID-19, DESBUMI initiators had also contributed to ensuring the availability of masks and PPE. The Ministry of Manpower can replicate this initiative through the Productive Migrant Village (DESMIGRATIF) initiative by sharpening the resilience and recovery of the COVID-19 era.

INITIATIVE OF MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM IN SCHOOLS The COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the mental health of the younger generation mainly due to the burden of distance learning, Sehat Jiwa Bahagia initiates a program that can be implemented in various regions to maintain mental health resilience as described in Box 4.12. 143 BOX 4.12 SEHAT JIWA (MENTAL HEALTH) FOR SCHOOL This program was implemented by Sehat Jiwa Bahagia in early 2021, in the form of virtual activities in 10 schools in Indonesia. The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has an impact on the social and psychological activities of the community. Sehat Jiwa considers that psychological ability plays a pivotal role in the future of Indonesian citizens. Since the implementation of Distance Learning (PJJ), many students have experienced burnout and a decline in mental health. Due to this condition, Sehat Jiwa Bahagia provides well-being curriculum-based mental health education which supports better individual development. During the implementation process, Sehat Jiwa conducted a preliminary survey in 10 schools in Indonesia. The respondents of the pre-activity assessment included teachers and students during the pandemic. Sehat Jiwa provided modules through training to build students' psychological flexibility and offered skills to assist them to maintain their mental health conditions during the pandemic. The module was adapted from the well-being curriculum developed by Sehat Jiwa in 2018 to increase the resilience and psychological well-being of adolescents in Indonesia. The parties involved included Sehat Jiwa volunteers and facilitators, youth influencers, Talkmore community. It was also sponsored by BNI Indonesia and all students and teachers. Sehat Jiwa collaborated with SDSN Youth, FM Unpad Fair, etc. The beneficiaries covered 1,188 students from 10 schools, including SMA 1 Pariangan Sumatra Barat, SMA Sukma Bangsa Aceh, SMA 77 Jakarta, SMAN 2 SERUL Papua, SMA Lentera Harapan Ambon, etc. This activity results indicated that 90 students showed increased knowledge and skills of how to maintain mental health in crises, 90% of students felt helped to relieve stress during the pandemic with mental health education sessions at schools, and 100% of teachers felt helped to understand the mental health conditions of their students and planned the learning activities concerning on psychological conditions. This program is likely to be replicated in other areas or on a wider scale. It would be better if it is supported by cooperation with the central and local governments. PROGRAM INITIATIVE FOR THE ACCELERATION OF HIV CONTROL IN URBAN AREAS Indonesia committed to ending AIDS by 2030. The intermediate target by 2020 was to reach 90% of people with HIV aware of their status; 90% of people aware about their HIV status and accessing treatment; and 90% of people with HIV accessing treatment and decreasing the amount of virus in their blood (viral suppression). The city government's role was considered crucial to accelerate the achievement of these targets. The Fast Track City was then initiated through the Paris Declaration at the end of 2014, and DKI Jakarta Province has become one of the Fast Track cities since 2015 and is still ongoing to accelerate the HIV control. Implementation of this program are described in Box 4.13. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 144 BOX 4.13 PROGRAM INITIATIVE FOR THE ACCELERATION OF HIV CONTROL IN URBAN AREAS (FAST TRACK CITY) IN DKI JAKARTA In particular, UNAIDS provides technical supports to the Ministry of Health and the DKI Jakarta Provincial Health Office to strengthen strategic information and coordinate multi-sectoral partners implementing HIV programs in Jakarta, including community organization partners. Meanwhile, technical and financial supports for the implementation of programs and services in DKI Jakarta are also provided by various partners, including the Global Fund and the United States Government (USAID). The parties involved cover all stakeholders in DKI Jakarta, such as the DKI Jakarta Provincial Health Office, Sub-departments in 5 municipalities, public and private health services, non-governmental organizations, communities, and other related partners including the Ministry of Health, USAID, and UNAIDS. The beneficiaries of this program are Most-at-Risk Populations, such as female sex workers, homosexuals, transgender, partners of key populations, injecting drug users. All stakeholders hold regular meetings every three months to discuss progress and challenges in efforts to accelerate AIDS prevention in DKI Jakarta Province. These activities provide good strategic information to enable the City of Jakarta to design programs and monitor their impact more effectively. To strengthen strategic information, the support provided includes support to estimate and project the HIV epidemic using AEM and Spectrum tools as the basis for policy and program development in DKI Jakarta; development of investment case analysis for DKI Jakarta to perceive the contribution of various intervention models to local AIDS prevention efforts. Supports are also provided to monitor the contribution of local support to local AIDS prevention efforts through a NASA survey.With the supports of the Global Fund and USAID, the HIV acceleration program in Jakarta has made many new breakthroughs in the STOP approach: Suluh (observe), Temukan (find), Obati (treat), and Pertahankan (keep it up) to stop AIDS by 2030. It can be conducted through community outreach to MARPs communities; offering mobile HIV testing and community-based HIV screening in the community area of each MARP; innovating digital platform for HIV testing agreements (UpdateStatus); providing a digital platform for drug delivery (JakAnter) and specimen transport for the Viral Load test (JakTransport) which brings many benefits, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce the burden of services in health facilities and minimize exposure to COVID-19 for beneficiaries. The Ministry of Health and the DKI Jakarta Provincial Health Office have also expanded HIV services, decentralized HIV treatment from hospitals to Puskesmas to bring HIV treatment services to the community, and started HIV treatment early after diagnosis (test & treat). Currently, there are 179 HIV testing counseling services, 116 support and treatment care, and 30 services for the Viral Load TCM test, 33 Early Infant Diagnosis services, and 16 Methadone Maintenance Treatment services that are ready to serve Jakarta and its surrounding areas requiring HIV testing and treatment. As of December 2020, the data indicate that 96% of People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Jakarta are aware of their HIV status. PLWHA that are currently on ART treatment in Jakarta amount to 40%, this figure is higher than the national average of 26%. Finally, PLWHA with the suppressed viral load 145 PROGRAM INITIATIVE FOR THE ACCELERATION OF MALARIA CONTROL IN ENDEMIC VILLAGES Indonesia targets to increase the number of districts/cities that eliminate malaria from 312 districts/cities in 2020 to 405 districts/cities in 2024. However, there are still many districts/cities in the Eastern Indonesia Region with high endemic levels. Maluku is one of the provinces that have contributed to the national malaria incidence rate. Measure to contain malaria could be conducted with various strategies, one of them are through community involvement and utilization of village funds as described in Box 4.14. in Jakarta has reached 25%. This figure will be increased constantly by expanding the coverage of viral load testing to all PLWHA Learning from experiences in DKI Jakarta, there is a great opportunity for the Program for the Acceleration of HIV Control in Cities (Fast Track City) to be replicated in other HIV priority cities/districts in Indonesia, which currently has been specifically followed by 24 HIV priority cities/districts in Indonesia. Similar supports for capacity building in developing city/district-based strategic information can be mobilized to assist city/district governments in planning policies and programs required to stop AIDS by 2030 in their respective regions. 96% VNR 2021 146 BOX 4.14 ACCELERATION OF MALARIA CONTROL IN ENDEMIC VILLAGES THROUGH COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND UTILIZATION OF VILLAGE FUNDS UNICEF, the Ministry of Health and the Provincial Health Office are working together to provide training for village facilitators to support activities in various provinces. The training focused on key issues, such as (1) increasing malaria awareness through mapping of malaria cases and deaths; (2) life cycle, symptoms, transmission, and conducive condition to malaria exposure and infection; (3) identifying breeding sites; and (4) developing village action plans using available resources. Mapping of malaria endemicity was carried out from the district to village levels in Maluku Barat Daya District. Mapping activities were carried out in high endemic areas within geographic/administrative boundaries, such as districts or islands. Field officers consisting of provincial, district, and community health workers were deployed to observe potential mosquito breeding sites and local customs or habits that could lead to malaria transmission in the villages. Observations were conducted together with the community and religious leaders. This activity provides an opportunity to assess local knowledge about the environment and the linkages between malaria vectors. Prompt diagnosis and treatment were also emphasized as essential to reduce transmission and mortality. At the end of the activity, a meeting was held to discuss the findings in the form of a map of the distribution of mosquito breeding sites for each village, possible obstacles related to seasonal habits (harvesting cloves and nutmeg), and access to health facilities. Solutions are formulated from the ground up, including potential funding from the Village Fund. Meanwhile, the local Health Office and Village Community Empowerment Service have made a memorandum of understanding aiming to accelerate malaria control. Similar activities have also been implemented by the Indonesian Health Dharma Work Association (PERDHAKI) in other highly endemic villages that require intervention. The activity results could accelerate malaria control in Maluku Barat Daya District, a high endemic district with an annual parasite incidence (API) of 14.09% in 2017 to a moderate endemic district with API 1.8% in 2018, and 1% in 2019. A total of 27 participants from seven villages in Damer Island and Maluku Barat Daya District participated in the activity. This program encourages the strengthening of cross-sectoral commitment to control and eradicate malaria through increased knowledge and a sense of belonging. This approach could be adapted for use in quarterly mini-workshops at Puskesmas, by inviting the village head or representatives from the PERDHAKI program to train 'malaria cadres'. \u00a9 UNICEF/UNI97123/ADR Baby is weighed during a health checkup at integrated health post 147 C. POLICY RESPONSE To accelerate the achievement of SDG 3, the policy response shall in consonance with the Government policy response to manage large impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, both from the health and economic perspective. The first stage of policy response to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 is to strengthen the health sector, one of which is by stipulating Law No. 2 of 2020 concerning Stipulation of Government Regulation in lieu of Law (Perppu) No. 1 of 2020 concerning State Finance Policy and Financial System Stability for the Handling of COVID-19 and/or in the Context of Dealing with Threats Endangering National Economy and/or Financial System Stability. In this law, the Government relaxes the budget deficit limit in order to increase the allocation of health. (Bappenas, 2020). The 2021 Government Work Plan (RKP) contains seven National Priorities and one of them supports the achievement of the National Priority 3 on increasing quality and competitive human resources. Stipulates that one of the strategies for economic recovery in 2021 is to reform the national health system and strengthen the health system by increasing promotive and preventive efforts through the Community Healthy Lifestyle Movement (Germas), health security capacity, especially surveillance, network and laboratory capacity, information system, as well as the fulfillment of health resources, such as health facilities, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and health human resources. With this step, the economic actors can operate a normal consumption/production activity. The inflation control policy in 2021 is directed to support the post-COVID-19 recovery process by focusing on (1) maintaining the availability of supplies, especially for 10 strategic food commodities as well as goods for the main needs of the national health system, including tools, equipment, and medicines; (2) increasing supply chain efficiency by optimizing the use of information technology; (3) strengthening trade infrastructure to reduce price gaps; (4) increasing the synergy of central-regional communication to support the management of community expectations; and (5) creating an accurate, timely, and relevant database of food statistics. The policy direction for 2020-2024 is to strengthen the health system focusing on real-time and electronic-based pharmaceutical logistics systems. Therefore, since 2019, the National Digital Inventory (DIN) application system has begun to be developed, which was in the preparation stage of a blueprint in 2020. Furthermore, the DIN information system will be used for drug supply chain management, in realizing effective and efficient drug management. This system is single entry, digital, real-time, user friendly and connected to other applications, for example, SIKOBAT, E-logistics, E-report PBF, and e-monev. In addition, DIN accommodates an integrated pharmaceutical logistics system from stakeholders within the Directorate General of Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices. This DIN will later be integrated and developed in stages to be utilized by the Provincial/District/City Health Office, pharmaceutical industry and distributors, as well as health facilities and work units throughout Indonesia. Therefore, it is hoped that it can also help manage data and make decisions in every logistical management process and create better control of the supply chain for the national essential medicines package. In association of decentralization, the role of local governments needs to be increased in solving the problem of essential medicines packages availability, in this case, the District Health Office. It is governed by dividing the authorities for administering government affairs in accordance with Law Number 23 of 2014 concerning Regional Government, Law Number 11 of 2020 concerning Job Creation, and arrangements regarding the nomenclature of programs/activities in the regions. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 148 Optimizing the role of the Provincial and District/ City Health Offices in the pharmaceutical and medical device programs includes optimizing the logistics management of essential medicines to increase and guarantee its availability at the Puskesmas level and guarantee the medicines quality; taking an active role in the implementation of DIN to support the integration of data on distribution and availability of medicines in real-time; strengthening the monitoring of the availability of essential medicines in Puskesmas and increasing the accuracy of the design of drug needs; and coordinating with the center on program technical implementation and managerial supports. In the context of fulfilling health workers in the regions, the policy direction for health worker development for 2020-2024 is to increase the availability of competent health workers and distribute them effectively. This policy aims to provide quality health services to improve the degree of public health (Center of Research and Development for Humanities and Health Management, 2020). With a focus on regional independence, based on the Decree of the Minister of Health Number 33 of 2015, Provincial/District/City Health Offices and Hospitals shall have a long-term health resource planning. This policy aims to fulfill the needs of competent health workers for the next 10-25 years, so it is necessary to make projections for them (Ministry of Health, 2015). Finally, the Ministry of Health requires to disseminate information on the 2020-2024 National Action Plan for Health Resilience Indonesia to line Ministries and Institutions and collaborate with the results of filling out health security financing instruments. Therefore, the initial target of National Health Resilience is to provide funding for health resilience efforts that can compete with other health priorities during the planning process (Center for Social Determinants of Health Analyses, Ministry of Health, 2019). In addition, it is important for the Central Government to recognize the need to strengthen health resilience capacities in decentralized settings. The countries have taken important steps to ensure mitigation and risk management of health emergencies through enhanced planning and preparedness efforts at the subnational level, one of which is by implementing minimum service standards at the provincial and district levels (Rai et al., 2020). 149 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021150 Discussion of Goal 8 focuses on economic growth, labor productivity, the share of informal sector, unemployment, child worker, workplace safety, financial inclusion, access to capital for MSMEs and tourism sector. Besides presenting analysis based on trends up to 2019, the impact of COVID-19 on the achievement of the SDGs, especially on relevant indicators, is also being explored. A. TREND ANALYSIS AND IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 1. SUSTAINED, INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH a. Annual growth rate of real GDP per capita Indonesia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, is experiencing a moderate upward trend. From 2010 to 2019, GDP per capita has consistently grown from IDR 28.8 million in 2010 to IDR 59.1 million in 2019. In terms of growth rate, GDP per capita growth shows a slightly slower growth trend. Figure 4.79 illustrates that Indonesia's GDP per capita growth rate attained its peak in 2012, where GDP per capita growth reached 4.67%. However, since 2013, GDP per capita growth has slowed down until 2015 with an annual growth of 3.03%. Indonesia's per capita growth began to increase in 2016-2019, although it has not yet been able to reach a growth rate of above 4%. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the achievement of Indonesia's GDP growth. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, Indonesia experienced negative economic growth for the first time after the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997-1998. Indonesia's per capita growth shrunk by 3.15% in 2020 and caused GDP per capita to fall from IDR 59.1 million (2019) to IDR 56.93 million (2020). The decline in per capita income and Indonesia's economic growth certainly had significantly hampered social welfare because business and economic activities have been curbed due to mobility restrictions. A slowdown in economic activity will have severe consequences, like higher unemployment and increased poverty. The study conducted by Halimatussadiah et al. (2020) shows that the negative impact of COVID-19 on the Indonesian economy, especially GDP, will worsen if not accompanied by a national economic recovery (Pemulihan Ekonomi Nasional/PEN) policy. In this study, it was shown that in the absence of government stimulus policy, Indonesia's economic contraction could reach -6.3%. In the latest release by Statistics Indonesia (BPS), Indonesia's economic growth in the first quarter of 2021 still experienced negative economic growth of 0.74% compared to the first quarter of 2020 (yoy).Goal 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth 151 Another critical issue related to Indonesia's GDP and COVID-19 pandemic is related to remittances from migrant workers. The remittances of migrant workers contributed nearly 1% of GDP in 2016 and continued to increase in 2017-2019. Data from Bank Indonesia shows that even with the decline in remittances due to the pandemic, Indonesia still benefitted from transfer from migrant workers for around USD 9.42 billion in 2020. The government of Indonesia have to ensure that the economic recovery during the post-COVID-19 period needs to be accelerated in order to achieve the RPJMN 2020-2024 target of 6-6.5% economic growth in 2024. To attain this target, the government needs to control the spread of the virus by increasing the number of tests, vaccination rates\u2014especially for the most vulnerable group\u2014and maintaining people's level of adherence to health protocols. . Figure 4.79 GDP per Capita (in million IDR) and Annual growth rate of real GDP per capita (%) Source: Statistics Indonesia In accordance to Indonesia's efforts to promote sustainable growth, the Government has adopted the Circular Economy concept in development strategies which fits the narratives of achieving national economic growth targets and promoting environmental sustainability. Vision Indonesia 2045 has adopted Circular Economy policy as a way forward. The implementation of Circular Economy concept in the production process ensures that all inputs are optimized, illustrated as a closed-loop production process through its 5R principle (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recover and Revalue). It is projected that the implementation of Circular Economy concept can prolong the lifetime value of the consumer products and bring sustainable benefits through reinvestment in sustainable production processes. By adopting circular economy opportunities in five key sectors of the economy (food & beverage, textiles, construction, wholesale and retail trade, and electrical and electronic equipment), Indonesia's GDP could increase by IDR 593 to 638 trillion (USD 42 to 45 billion) in 2030 (than it would under a \"business-usual\" approach); 4.4 million cumulative net jobs could be created between 2021 and 2030, out of which 75 percent could be for women; CO2e emissions and water use could be reduced by 126 million tonnes and 6.3 billion m3 in 2030, respectively (equivalent to 9 percent of the current emissions and 3 percent of the current water usage); and the average Indonesian household could save IDR 4.9 million (USD 344) annually, representing almost nine percent of the current yearly household INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 152 Figure 4.80 Annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person based on PPP (%) Source: Statistics Indonesia 2. CREATING PRODUCTIVE, INCLUSIVE AND DECENT JOB OPPORTUNITIES a. Bolstering Formal Employment Although efforts to continue formalizing employment and economic activity in Indonesia have shown some improvement, the majority of workers still work in the informal sector. Based on the age group, people aged 60 years and over (85.8%) and 55-59 years (73.34%) are the age group primarily working in the informal sector in 2020. For the productive age group, especially those aged 15-25 years, the majority (67.8% for 15-19 yo and 43.4% for 20-24 yo) worked in the informal sector. However, due to the pandemic, more people aged 15-19 years old are working in the informal sector. This number has increased from 51.5% in 2019 to 67.8% in 2020. Based on location (urban versus rural) and occupation by sex (male and female), there is a significant difference related to the share of formal employment. During 2015-2020, the proportion of employees in urban areas who worked in expenditure. By creating new job opportunities, making supply chains more resilient, and providing business opportunities (particularly for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises), a circular economy can be a key component of Indonesia's economic recovery. However, this analysis also highlights some challenges, including potential job losses and reduced demand for upstream production in the five focus sectors (under some scenarios). A robust multi-stakeholder roadmap is envisaged as the next step in this work and will be crucial for addressing these concerns and the barriers for capturing the circular economy opportunities (Bappenas et al, 2021). b. Annual growth rate of real GDP per employed personBased on annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person, it is evident that there are fluctuations in productivity growth in Indonesia. Its productivity tends to continue to decline throughout 2011-2019. Specifically, for 2020, annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person has negative growth for the first time. Low levels of education, lack of skills and inadequate training are thought to have an effect on productivity. Another aspect affecting worker productivity is the presence of low-value-added jobs in some sectors. Other additional factors, such as complicated regulations and bureaucracy, obsolete machines and technology, taxes and incentives that hinder investment, also affect productivity. A healthy and safe work environment has the same effect on productivity since worker feel at ease at work. Figure Error!

The pandemic, on the other hand, has resulted in an increase in the number of people employed in the informal sector. Figure 4.83 shows the proportion of informal employment in agriculture, manufacturing and services by level of education. One of the key findings from this figure is that informality has a strong correlation with education levels. In the agricultural sector, the majority of jobs are informal or around 88.57% in 2020. The share of the informal sector in the agricultural sector has increased compared to 2018 and 2019. For manufacturing, the number of informal workers is around 44.31% in 2020 from 41.09% in 2018. Finally, almost half of workers in the service sector work in the informal sector, or about 50.46% in 2020. An increasing number of informal jobs in manufacturing and services have been affected by the pandemic. Many companies and the service sector have had to close their businesses or shift production. Figure 4.82 he proportion of Formal Employment by Location and Gender, 2015-2020 Source: Statistics Indonesiathe formal sector ranged from 57.81% to 50.5%. On the other hand, 73,41% of workers in rural areas work in the informal sector. In general, most Indonesian workers are still working in the informal sector (60,47% in 2020). Data from National Labor Force Survey 2021 shows that the number of formal sector workers has increased by 0.85% in February 2021 compared to August 2020. Simultaneously, the number of informal workers decreased to 59.62%. In terms of gender, more women tend to work in informal sectors. Around 65,35% of Indonesian women work in the informal sector, compared to 57% for men. Figure Error!

As workers attain more years of schooling, the proportion of those workers working in the informal sectors went down. This evidence suggests that education is linked to which sector the workers will work in. As a result, policies aimed at improving educational attainment and education quality will be critical to growing the formal sector's share of the economy. Formalizing employment among youth population becomes more challenging as its percentage significantly decreased by -7.15 percentage points, from 60,3% in 2019 to 53.15% in 2020. This figure is even worse among those living in urban areas, females, and the younger age group. Based on age, the impact of COVID-19 has hit most of the youth population (16-18 yo), as its formal employment decreased by -16.92% (from 42.8% in 2019 to 25.88% in 2020). Figure Error!

Maintaining Low Unemployment Rate and Decent Jobs Pre-pandemic, the growth of Indonesia's open unemployment rate had a downward trend from 6.18% in 2015 to 5.23% in 2019. However, due to the pandemic in 2020, the unemployment rate in Indonesia increased to 7.07%. Over the past two years (2019-2020), there has been a significant rise in educated unemployment, rising from 8.0 percent (4.7 million) to 10.2 percent (6.3 million). The percentage of men who become unemployed is higher than women, which is quite different from other countries. One of the possibilities is prior to COVID-19 pandemic, the gap in labor participation rates between men and women is already significant, with men accounting for 84 percent and women 55 percent, respectively (National Labor Force Survey, Feb 2020). Based on National Labor Survey February 2021, unemployment rate in Indonesia decreased to 6.26% in February 2021. Most unemployment is still dominated by men (6.81%) compared to women (5.41%). Based on location, the unemployment rate in urban areas was consistently much higher than that in rural areas. Regarding the unemployment growth rate, the rate in rural areas has consistently decreased from 2015-2019. In urban areas, the unemployment rate increased slightly in 2017 but continues to fall until 2019. Figure 4.85 also suggests that unemployment rate in urban area is much higher than in rural areas due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The higher unemployment rate in urban areas is likely due to the large number of jobs lost due to the mobility restrictions and impact on sectors that operate in many urban areas. Meanwhile, in rural areas, where the majority of economic activities are engaged in the agricultural sector, the unemployment rate grows, but not as high as urban population. Data for National Labor Force Survey February 2021 shows that the number of unemployment rate in urban area is still higher (8%) compared to in rural area (4.11%). Figure 4.85 Unemployment Rate by Sex and Location, 2015-2020 Source : Statistics Indonesia (National Labor Force Survey) Figure 4.86 shows that the underemployment rate in Indonesia is experiencing a similar growth rate with the unemployment rate. There has been a decrease in the underemployment rate since 2015-2019, but it increased significantly in 2020 and the underemployment rate in rural areas is much higher than in urban areas. National Labor Force Survey February 2021 shows that the underemployment rate in Indonesia underemployment rate fell to 8.71% compared to August 2020 which reached 10.19%. Figure Error!

Based on Figure 4.87, the average salary of workers in Indonesia grew from IDR 11,434 per hour in 2015 to IDR 17,696 per hour in 2020. The number of hourly wages for workers in Indonesia has increased throughout 2015-2020. However, the growth of salaries in Indonesia has been relatively sluggish. Even in recent years, workers' wages have been relatively equal to the inflation rate. This evidence suggests that in real terms, the wages of workers have not experienced any significant improvement. Especially for 2020, an increase of hourly wage does not mean that workers' income has increased, but it is due to the total number of hours that went down due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2015, the difference between men's and women's salaries was not very significant. However, from 2017 to 2019, the wages of male workers continued to increase. The gender wage gap in Indonesia is narrowing in 2020, but evidence of this is likely due to the number of hours worked by women went down compared to the previous year. The growth of wage does not occur for female workers, in fact it looks stagnant. The changes in men's and women's wages over time become increasingly pronounced in wage disparities. However, women earn more than men for certain sectors, especially in electricity / gas / water and transportation. This can be explained by the fact that the majority of the female workers in this sector are manual workers and have a higher education than male workers.

About a third of low-income of elderly indicated inadequate work, this was confirmed by about one-fifth of the elderly who worked 49 hours and longer in the past week. Long working hours indicated their need to work out of necessity, the highest proportion among elderly working in the service industry. c. The employment of the older persons Data on the elderly population (60+) shows that about half of the elderly were still working from 2015- 2020, although the proportion of elderly people who worked was lower by age group. There was even a 4.5 percentage point increase in the working elderly in 2020 compared to 2015. Another challenge related to the working elderly is that around 80 to 90 percent work in the informal sector. The proportion of elderly working in the informal sector is higher for older women, increases by age group, and is higher for older people living in rural areas. The elderly, women and those living in rural areas may be more vulnerable than other age groups if working in the informal sector is due to a lack of contracts, poor earnings, and increasing uncertainty.

Young worker and Child Labour During 2010-2020, the proportion of youth who did not attend school, work, or attend training (NEET) in Indonesia did not change significantly. In 2010, the percentage of NEETs was 25.6% and fell to 21.77% in 2019. Despite relatively lower, the percentage of NEETs rose more than double when compared to national unemployment rate (5.23%), indicating that the participation of youth population in the economic activities is still not optimal and this is exacerbated by the impact of the pandemic which caused NEET to increase to 24.28%. Figure 4.90 Percentage of Young People (15-24 Years) Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET), 2010-2020 Source: Statistics Indonesia The pandemic also caused youth unemployment to rise to 15.23%. This increase was mostly contributed by the young population in urban areas, male, and among the older youth (19-24 years). Although unemployment among entry-level ages (16-18 years) is relatively high (28.12% in 2019), during the pandemic, it actually decreased by -3.54% to 24.58% in 2020.

However, this figure rose to 0.9 percent point in 2020 (3.25%). Over the past three years, it was shown that male children labor is higher than that of female children, although the increase in female working children in 2020 is relatively high compared to the male. An increase in the trend of child labor may be happening because of the dropout rate in 2020 due to the pandemic and more children need to help support their families affected by the pandemic. Thus, more kids have to go to the labor market to support their family's basic needs. 3. EMPOWERMENT OF MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES (MSME s) a. Access to Finance and Credit for MSMEs Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) provide a significant contribution to Indonesia's economy, in 2018, micro-enterprises dominate the number of MSMEs with 63.5 million businesses or around 98.68% of the total businesses. In terms of output, MSMEs in 2019 contributed 60% of national income. From the workforce side, MSMEs are able absorb 97% of the total workforce (Kementerian Keuangan, 2020). Due to the pandemic, the contribution of MSMEs is projected to decrease. Meanwhile MSMEs' access to financial services continues to increase, in 2012 only around 14.36% of MSMEs had access to financial services and in 2020 it became 24.40%. Based on the proportion of credit, the majority of MSMEs that obtained credit are medium enterprises. The number of micro enterprises that receive credit continues to increase from 19% in 2011 to 23% in 2020. The number of micro-businesses that have access to financial credit decreased in 2020 during the pandemic. Based on the LPEM FEB UI and UNDP (2021) study, it was found that the majority of micro-enterprises have decided to postpone their expansion plans due to the pandemic. This finding may explain why the share of access to financial services for micro-enterprises has fallen.

Contribution of Tourism to GDP The tourism sector not only contributes significantly to GDP, but also the tourism sector also absorbs a large number of workers. In 2020 the number of workers in the tourism sector reached 12.7 million workers or around 10% of the total working population. The tourism sector is one of the sectors that has been hit quite significantly by the pandemic. Mobility restrictions, strict quarantine policies, COVID-19 testing as a condition for travel, and visa restrictions have resulted in a decline in the number of foreign and domestic tourists.

The contribution of the growth rate of the tourism sector to the Indonesian economy during 2012-2019 has fluctuated. In 2020, the contribution of the tourism sector to GDP went down to 4.00% with negative growth until minus 19.52%. Figure 4.95 Contribution of Tourism to GDP, 2010-2019 Source : National Tourism Satellite Account b. Number of Foreign Tourist and Number of Trips by Domestic Tourists Indonesia has become more attractive for foreign tourists, this was illustrated in the number of foreign tourists visitors in 2019 that has more than doubled to 16.11 million compared to 2010, which amounted to 7 million. However, this number has decreased sharply in 2020 (4.05 million or 75,03 percent decreased) due to the pandemic. In terms of domestic tourists, there has been an increase in domestic tourist trips from 234.38 million in 2010 to 282.93 million in 2019. As a result of the pandemic, the number of domestic tourists is estimated to fall to 198.24 million in 2020. The daily cases of COVID-19 in Indonesia that have not changed, and the occurrence of second wave, are to accuse for foreign tourist visits that have not improved until the end of 2020. As a result of this situation, travel restrictions were reintroduced, including restrictions on foreign tourist entering and leaving Indonesian territory. 163 Figure 4.96 Number of Foreign Tourist Visit to Indonesia Quarterly, 2019-2020Source : Statistics Indonesia Figure 4.97 Number of Foreign Tourist Visit to Indonesia, 2010-2020 Source : Statistics Indonesia Figure 4.98 Number of Domestic Tourist Visit to Indonesia, 2010-2020 Source: Statistic Indonesia Note : *estimation by the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy Figure Error!

Foreign Exchange Revenue from Tourism The increasing number of foreign tourists contributed to foreign exchange revenue from tourism of USD 7.6 billion in 2010 and growing to USD 17.60 billion in 2019. Due to the pandemic, foreign exchange revenue from tourism sector went down from USD 16.91 billion in 2019 to USD 3.31 billion the year 2020. Figure 4.99 Foreign Exchange Revenue from Tourism, 2010-2020 Source : Bank of Indonesia 5. FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CAPACITY a. Number of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and Commercial Bank Branches In 2010, there were 13.04 Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) per 100,000 Indonesian adult population, in 2020 it increased fourfold to 52.95 ATMs per 100,000 adult population. The number of bank branch offices also continues to grow, from 8.11 bank branches per 100,000 population (2010) almost doubling to 17.67 bank branches per 100,000 population (2020). Over the past 5 years, there has been a decline in number of ATMs and commercial bank branches. The expansion of digital technology has encouraged many people to take advantage of digital platforms in the financial sector and reduced incentives to go to ATMs or bank branches. The pandemic has further increased the role of digital technology and digital transformation around the world, including Indonesia. The LPEM FEB UI and UNDP study (2021) found that almost 44% of MSMEs in Indonesia used digital platforms to market their products during the pandemic, an increase from only 22% before the pandemic. From a bank perspective due to changes in consumer behavior, there are efforts to ensure that the number of ATMs and bank branches will remain profitable and achieve economies of scale .

The same pattern occurred based on gender, where there was a significant increase in the number of bank ownership for both men and women. The proportion of women who have bank accounts is more than half (51%) and men 46%. Despite the fact that there is no substantial gender disparity, more than half of Indonesians do not have a bank account.

However, even before the epidemic, it was apparent that the elderly who received credit tended to decline.

CHALLENGES AND ACTIONS TO OVERCOME 1. Challenges Slow economic growth and regional disparities are the initial problems in Goal 8. The Indonesian economy grew steadily at over 5% after the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997. The skyrocketing demand for global commodities that has increased commodity prices and pro-poor government policies, has made Indonesia a successful upper-middle income country. Despite this, Indonesia's economy has never surpassed a growth rate of more than 6%. Another important aspect is the disparity between regions in economic activity and investment. The majority of economic activity takes place in Java and/or Sumatra, with other areas, particularly in the Eastern Region, are still lagging behind.

The growth of FDI inflows in the manufacturing sector has tended to fluctuate since 2011. In recent years, FDI inflows in this sector have recorded negative growth, despite the amount of investment in Indonesia has grown positively. The low investment growth in the manufacturing sector poses a serious challenge to increasing labor productivity and shifting Indonesian products toward more value-added. Early deindustrialization is likely to have started, especially since there is a tendency for economic activity in Indonesia has been shifting toward service sector. Figure 4.103 FDI Inflows in Indonesian Manufacturing, 2011-2020 (in thousands of USD) Source: Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) Gender inequality, people with disabilities and youth unemployment are three important things related to equal and decent work for all which also pose a challenge. ILO data (2020) shows that on average women in Indonesia earn 23% less than men, the length of time they are educated does not even close the wage gap. At the higher education level, there is even the most significant gender gap in wage acceptance among various levels of education. For the high-wage job category male workers also dominate, women only work in a quarter of the high-wage jobs such as managerial and supervisory jobs. Even for these jobs, women also earn less than men. As many as 1.5 million men work in high wage jobs, while women only 500 thousand.

No text 2019 2020Elementary Lower Secondary School Upper Secondary School Vocational High School 2020 Urban & Rural Rural UrbanPersons with Disabilities (PWDs) are one of the vulnerable groups who experience difficulties in attaining decent work (LPEM FEB UI, 2017). The MAHKOTA study (2020) found that people with disabilities have been particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic economically, with more than half of those surveyed reported a decreased in income. Job losses and unemployment due to the pandemic are estimated to be higher for persons with disabilities, as diversifying their businesses is still a challenge for them. Even before COVID-19, PWDs tended to work in physically distant environments, and were more likely to face barriers to accessing information, and may be exposed to violence and harassment. One possible policy that can help PWDs during and after a pandemic is by ensuring protection through disability-inclusive occupational safety and health (OSH) measures (ILO, 2020). In the future, the \"new normal\" working conditions need to be optimized by building more inclusive and better working conditions, especially for the most vulnerable groups. It is necessary to implement structural reforms by creating new forms of work and employment relations that accommodate disability inclusion. It is necessary to strengthen and conducting skills development training for inclusive lifelong learning for PWDs. Optimizing technology by using assistive technology devices at work will be an important policy for helping PWDs. Finally, it is necessary to ensure that PWDs are included as a vital component in achieving sustainable and inclusive economic growth. Youth unemployment and vulnerable groups also need special attention, especially due to the pandemic. Based on data from Statistics Indonesia, it is shown that around three-quarters of the unemployed population in Indonesia are youth. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the problem of youth unemployment. The youth unemployment rate is projected to increase at a faster rate than the adult generation unemployment rate due to the higher rate of layoffs (PHK) among the younger age group compared to the older age group. The ILO study (2020) shows that the impact of the pandemic on youth tends to be systematic and heterogeneous across areas and groups, especially for women, younger youth and young people from low-income families. The next challenge is worker productivity and skills related to education. The majority of Indonesian workers are those with primary and junior secondary education. The number of low-educated workers has increased from 71.5 million in 2015 to 73.41 million in 2020. However, at the same time, there has been an increase in the number of workers who have earned vocational, diploma and university degrees. Figure 4.104 Worker Education Level in Indonesia (in million), 2015-2020 Source: Statistics Indonesia 169 Challenges related to the rights of migrant workers as part of workers' rights, the Indonesian Migrant Workers Protection Agency (BP2MI) recorded that the total population of Indonesia migrant worker (TKI) who left migrating in 2020 was 113,173, a significant decrease from 276,553 in the previous year. This figure shows that migrant workers are among the vulnerable groups due to the pandemic. Nearly 142,000 migrant workers have returned to Indonesia, and formal placements have been terminated (IOM UN Migration, 2020). In addition, migrant workers face a lack of access to economic and livelihoods reintegration. Indonesia has sent around 200,000 to 300,000 workers abroad; this helps absorb the workforce and reduce the unemployment rate. Other than that, migrant workers have contributed significant remittances to support their families and have an impact on the surrounding community. The impact of COVID-19 has resulted in travel and placement restrictions, mismatch between demand and skills of the migrant workers, and significant losses from remittance contributions. Several challenges related to financial inclusion implementation namely (a) limited access to formal financial services for Indonesian migrant workers to support them during this stage of the migration process; (b) people with low-income such as 1) community groups receiving social assistance and other community empowerment programs, and 2) entrepreneurs who have limited resources for expanding their businesses with limited or no access to all financial services; (c) limited access for people living in the borderline frontier, the outermost and underdeveloped regions; (d) low rate of 25% of digital financial transaction users, such as mobile banking and electronic payment, despite high number of mobile phone users; (e) regional disparity in the use of cellular-based electronic payment, used mostly by those living in urban areas; and (f) gender disparity in number of formal financial bank accounts, in which only 51.4% is owned by women. Related to the contribution of MSMEs, they have a substantial contribution to the Indonesian economy. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, MSMEs face several challenges. The ILO study (2020) shows that two out of three enterprises have stopped operating. MSMEs income has dropped by 90 percent. Consequently, around 63% of MSMEs have to reduce the number of workers. A similar study conducted by LPEM FEB UI and UNDP (2021) found that due to COVID-19, 88% of MSMEs in Indonesia experienced a decrease in demand for their products while 75% of them experienced supply shocks (increased material prices). Although government assistance is available, it has not yet reached ideal coverage, with only 43% of MSMEs surveyed aware of these programs. The main challenges of MSMEs development in Indonesia namely the absence of an integrated MSME database, the imbalance between size of MSMEs and their contribution to GDP; there are 99% of businesses in Indonesia, which are dominated by MSMEs, with the contribution is only around 50-60%, and the low number of MSMEs form partnerships with large businesses (including networking in the global value chain) also the low level of technology utilization in running their business, particularly in terms of digitalization. The last issue is low access to finance. Data from Statistic Indonesia shows 88 percent of micro and small businesses do not obtain or apply for credit (SE 2016). Based on education side, there is low involvement of youth graduates from secondary to start their business and become entrepreneur. Related to the implementation of circular economy, International research also shows that MSMEs can be some of the potential biggest beneficiaries from a circular economy. As a such, ensuring MSMEs are at the heart of the circular economy roadmap development will be crucial. A circular economy could enable cost savings for MSMEs from greater resources efficiency and waste reduction, and lead to the development of new business models, such as those focusing on recovery and recycling, which could provide INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 170 significant opportunities to MSMEs. Furthermore, MSMEs could be better placed than large enterprises to adopt circular economy practices. Since MSMEs are more likely to be closer to the end-consumer than large enterprises, they are better positioned to adopt circular business models that require decentralized production systems, such as business models focused on reusing, recycling, or repurposing resources locally. However, in Indonesia, most enterprises within MSMEs are micro or small. According to the Statistics Indonesia, micro and small enterprises accounted for close to 99 percent of all MSMEs in 2019. The micro and small firms could lack the knowledge and capital to adopt circular opportunities. Hence, it needs policies that are cognizant of the variation within the MSMEs, and support micro and small firms to become members of supply chain partnerships that have shown to be effective in Europe. 2. Actions to Overcome Improving Business Climate. The response in achieving economic improvement for COVID-19 is conducted by improving the Business Climate. The Indonesian government has launched the Omnibus Law on Job Creation which is considered an important reform and an effort to make the Indonesian economy more competitive. The new law aims to strengthen Indonesia's long-term ambitions to become a high-income country. The Omnibus law can support Indonesia's economic recovery and long-term economic growth. One of the defining elements of this law is that it seeks to implement policies that will remove important investment restrictions and convince investors that Indonesia is open for business. Furthermore, this new law could enhance the amount of investment, create new jobs and help the government reduce poverty. Indonesia's Ease of Doing Business Index is still lowest compared to other countries. In 2020, Indonesia is ranked 73rd and has not experienced a significant increase since 2018. However, several indicators in 2020 have improved compared to 2019. For example, in terms of starting a business, getting access to electricity, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts. Government response to COVID-19. The Indonesian government has implemented several actions to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially some measures to boost economic recovery. Indonesia's government has allocated IDR 692.5 trillion for the National Economic Recovery Program in 2020, including a budget for improving hospitals and provision of medical equipment. The economic recovery plan also encourages social assistance programs. The government has also provided economic recovery plans for firms or enterprises with have a strong commitment to retention and promise not to lay off their workers. For 2021, the Indonesian government has allocated the state budget for the national economic program to be IDR 553.09 trillion. Investment in infrastructure. In the 2015- 2019 National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN), the government priorities were improving transport links, enhancing the maritime sector's infrastructure, expanding access to remote areas, providing alternative multi-modal transport options, and assisting urban mobility. The government has increased the allocation of infrastructure spending by USD 10 billion each year to achieve these priority targets. The government has also provided several infrastructure projects to several State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) (including the Trans Sumatra-PT Hutama Karya Toll Refinery and PT KAI, etc.). Due to some budget constraints, the government also increased the private sector's participation in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) (i.e., Steam Power Plant (PLTU) Batang, 10 Highway Projects, 3 Telecommunication projects (Palapa Ring). In RPJMN 2020-2024, infrastructure policy and expansion are still the government priority, in 171 particular, to reduce the disparity in the quality of infrastructure between Java and non-Java, in particular in remote areas. Support to informal sectors during the pandemic. Support for the informal sector during the pandemic is also part of overcoming the challenges. Informal workers in Indonesia usually work in unregistered, unregulated and unprotected jobs, efforts to explore problems in this sector need to be optimized. Like other sectors, the COVID-19 pandemic also has an impact on the informal sector in Indonesia. Due to the heterogeneity of the informal sector in Indonesia, some workers do not qualify for government support due to various factors (e.g., salary, sector, etc.). However, during the pandemic, the government has launched several social assistance programs (e.g., salary subsidies for workers, cash transfer programs), especially those not previously included in social assistance programs. The recipients of this program are mainly those registered with the BPJS Ketenagakerjaan or social security program. Pre-employment Card (Kartu Pra Kerja) and training. The government has allocated the state budget for pre-employment cards of around IDR 20 trillion. This program allows beneficiaries to receive training and benefits to prepare them to enter the labor market. The program aims to help 5.6 million informal and laid-off workers, MSME owners, among other types of workers. This program is managed by the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Manpower. The Ministry of Manpower will provide competency and productivity-based training incentives. This program also optimizes the role of vocational training centers (BLK). This program is also a government collaboration with private and public digital platforms (for example Tokopedia, Ruangguru, Pintaria, What Do You Want to Learn, Bukalapak, Pijar Mahir, Sekolahmu, Sisnaker). Participants in this program will receive funding assistance of around IDR 3,55 million (i.e., IDR 1 million for training grants, IDR 600 thousand funding after the training for each month for four months, and survey incentives of IDR 50 thousand for three times). Expansion of Cash-for Work Schemes . The government has also expanded the Cash- for Work Scheme. The Ministry of Villages, Development of Disadvantaged Areas, and Transmigration reallocated village funds from IDR 72 trillion to IDR 71.19 trillion 11 to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ministry ordered all village governments and authorities to revise their village budgets and reallocate these funds into the village-based cash-for-work program (PTKD). This program aims to help marginalized groups in the village, such as the unemployed, day laborers, and underprivileged families. Policies for migrant workers. On the other hand, the government also encourages policies for migrant workers. UNAIDS Representative Office for Indonesia, in collaboration with the International Labor Organization, the United Nations Development Program and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, have launched a joint program in March 2021 to empower vulnerable groups including refugees and migrant workers 12. Government response related to workplace safety. The government has also responded to the condition of COVID-19 with policies related to work safety. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the workplace, the government has issued the Minister of Manpower Letter No. M/3/HK.04/III/2020 concerning protection of workers / labor and the continuity of business in the prevention and control spread of COVID-19. In particular, this letter urges employers to immediately report these positive cases to the local manpower and health offices to ensure workers' rights. The government also requires companies where 11 ht tp://www.djpk.kemenkeu.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FAQ-Dana-Desa-COVID-19.pdf 12 ht tps://reliefweb.int/report/indonesia/unaids-works-partners-support-covid-19-recovery-vulnerable-people-indonesia INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 172 workers infected with COVID-19 to seek guidance from the local health office regarding additional steps to minimize and reduce the virus' transmission in the workplace13. Support from labor union. In bridging the interests of employers and fulfilling workers' rights, the community or worker association plays an important role in providing a forum for discussion, especially in dealing with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. To reduce labor rights violations in multinational companies whose supply chains were affected by the pandemic, the Confederation of Indonesian Trade Unions (KSBSI) held a social dialogue that initiated agreements between workers and employers on several issues in work relations, especially for the 300 KSBSI members in several federations. This meeting resulted in an MoU and an agreement on OSH protection, business continuity and freedom of association. In addition, KSBSI also facilitates bipartite negotiations for workers and employers in minimizing unemployment during the pandemic. This is related to the threat of layoffs for workers in the hotel sector affected by the pandemic. These negotiations had an impact on 2000 hotel employees who were members of the Kamiparho federation. The results of these negotiations led to an agreement that there would be a reduction in working hours which resulted in a reduction in wages, in order to avoid layoffs. These two initiatives show that a well-developed dialogue between job employers and workers will foster mutual trust, especially in increasing the resilience of business sector during a pandemic. BOX 4.15 SKILLS TO SUCCEED INDONESIA: TRAINING OF SKILL TO WORK AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR YOUTH In preparing to enter the labor market, youth in Indonesia (aged 16-24 years) experience various challenges, especially for Vocational High School graduates who are recorded as having the highest unemployment rate. Based on the Labor Market Assessment conducted by Save the Children Indonesia with Accenture, one of the biggest challenges that the labor market in Indonesia needs to face is the provision of soft skills needed in the workplace, financial expertise or literacy, entrepreneurial skills, and the need for career guidance to find out interests and talents. Youth with disabilities face an even greater challenge. Save The Children Indonesia in collaboration with Accenture launched a program that focuses on improving youth work readiness in Indonesia, that is also implemented in seven other countries. The program developed 4 main training modules, including soft skills, financial literacy, entrepreneurship, and career guidance, as well as one financial literacy application (Dooit which can be uploaded on Google Playstore). The modules were developed using the Transferable Life Skills (TLS) Common Approach from Save The Children, which consists of communication skills, developing the ability to build social/ teamwork relationships, positive self-concept/ increased self-confidence, self-control, and problem-solving skills with critical thinking. In the early stages, this concept was tried out and trained to teachers in schools and instructors/ facilitators of institutions, through learning/ classroom training methods, e-learning, digital applications, 13 ht tps://betterwork.org/portfolio/better-work-indonesia-guidelines-on-transmission-prevention-and-handling-of-covid-19/173 and mentoring. The master trainers then extend the range of training to other teachers as well as to students or job seekers, including those with disabilities. In addition, training and mentoring are also carried out for employers so that improvements can also occur in the workplace to accommodate in accepting (prospective) workers, including those with disabilities. This program was implemented from 2015 to 2020 and successfully improved the quality of work skills to 68,841 young people in 337 vocational schools, involved 2000 teachers, 249 business places, and 22 supporting institutions. This activity involves the community, teacher forums, and other stakeholders from government and private institutions (Vocational Training Centers/ BLKs, Course Institutions, Community Learning Activities Center/ PKBM, and Labor Distribution Institutions, and Rehabilitation Institutions) in 43 cities and 3 provinces. The results of the latest evaluation found that 75.35% of youth who had been trained had been working in a company or started their own business. On the other hand, training was also provided to 300 young people with disabilities (blind, deaf, or physical disabilities) from 15 Special Schools (SLB) with 30 teachers for children with disabilities, of which 40 of them have completed apprenticeship and entrepreneurship programs in 8 companies. In addition, 27 companies / employers including vocational training centers, community learning centers, youth organizations, and national teacher training centers under the Ministry of Education and Culture, have conducted workplace readiness assessments and carried out gradual improvement and implementation plans for recruitment of prospective workers and increasing competence. existing staff. This program notes that there are still many parties who ignore the importance of soft skills in preparing workers in Indonesia, so that the training curriculum design for youth does not provide the necessary provisions and there is no monitoring in the implementation. The training provided so far tends to be normative and narrative, so that changes to models and methods through this program require a more enjoyable approach (experiential learning), so that the concept is easier to understand and practice. In addition, convincing curriculum makers and school programs is important to be able to apply this program. The support of the Guidance and Counsel Teacher (BK) who directly applies this model and module in the classroom, as well as the positive results of channelling graduates to be accepted for work, have made this program even more popular. This is also supported by a learning model that can integrate not only training inside and outside the classroom, but also with various other student activities to make the implementation of this program more integrated, including optimizing the use of financial literacy applications (Dooit). The Skills to Succeed youth empowerment program has received positive responses from various parties, so that the opportunity for replication can be carried out in all Indonesian SMKs through the adoption of the program by the Ministry of Education and Culture and also institutions under the Ministry of Manpower, as well as in various government and private institutions. In the medium and long term, it is expected that the output of this program can help lower the unemployment rate and increase the productivity of Indonesian youth. Upper Panel: young men in Vocational High School learning how to manage finances through Financial Literacy program, INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 174 Empowering MSMEs Scale Up. The government of Indonesia has made some efforts to prioritize the improvement of MSMEs. Bank of Indonesia encourages MSMEs to scale up their business, primarily related to institutional development or corporatization, financing, and MSMEs' capacity. Indonesia's government also promotes MSMEs to increase business linkage among MSMEs, business partnerships between MSMEs and large enterprises, and encourage entrepreneurship. The Ministry of State and Owned Enterprises (SOEs) has committed to supporting MSMEs upscaling through providing better infrastructure, financing, and access to the market. In particular, The Ministry of SOEs will increase the coordination between the association of State-Owned Banks (Himbara), PT Pegadaian, and PT Permodalan Nasional Madani or PNM for supporting micro-enterprises MSMEs go digital. The government aims to utilize the digital economy by encouraging MSMEs to join digital markets. In 2023, the government wants to ensure that half of MSMEs in Indonesia (around 30 million MSMEs) will go digital and integrate their business activity into the electronic payment system. Before COVID-19, there were only 8 million MSMEs that joined digital platforms. In 2020, the number of MSMEs who entered digital media was increased by 3.7 million MSMEs. The government plans to encourage and increase digital literacy for MSMEs, especially Micro Enterprises. Access to Finance for MSMEs. The government has introduced several accesses to finance programs for MSMEs, for example, People's Business Loans (Kredit Usaha Rakyat/KUR) through State-owned banks, cooperatives and other financial institutions. Some of those institutions also provides working capital via People's Business Loans (KUR) but specifically for business entities or business groups but do not have collateral or insufficient. The amount of the grant is more than IDR 25 million to IDR 500 million. In 2019, the government encouraged new entrepreneurs by assisting in up to 2500 micro-scale start-up entrepreneurs (Wirausaha Pemula/WP) up to IDR 12 million for each WP. Implementation of Low Carbon Development. In terms of business licenses, there is government support for the planning of Environmental Impact Analysis for companies and/or operations of Micro and Small Enterprises that have a significant environmental effect, in compliance with Law No. 11/2020 concerning Job Creation (Omnibus Law). Assistance with the preparation of an Environmental Impact Analysis may take the form of facilitation, Fee, and/or the development of Environmental Impact Analysis itself. Government support during COVID-19. The government provides fiscal support to assist MSMEs following the COVID-19 pandemic. Indonesia's government has allocated approximately IDR 34.15 trillion for around 60.66 million accounts to relax debt payment and credit interest subsidies via People's Business Loans (KUR), Ultra Micro (Umi), Mekaar program, banking, mortgage company, and others. The government also introduced a set of policies to encourage micro-business to restart and re-growth their business. For the micro-enterprise, the government provides grants for startups and increasing the LPDB (Revolving Fund Management Institution/Lembaga Pengelola Dana Bergulir) funds that can be used as a source of loans for cooperatives and MSMEs with lower interest.

This can also be done by preparing youth to start their own businesses. With this motivation, in 2019, Indonesia Business Links (IBL) in collaboration with Accenture Indonesia runs the Skilled Youth House (Rumah Muda Terampil/ RMT) Program to prepare young people (including women's groups) to dare to start a business and become reliable young entrepreneurs. In addition, this program also aims to create jobs for local communities through an eco-business model and ensure program sustainability through social entrepreneurship. This program is implemented in Ngembeh Village, Dlanggu District, Mojokerto Regency, East Java. The implementation of the RMT program involved many stakeholders such as the extended family of Suwadi Sinduredjo, who lent the family home as a shared study room, the WARLAMI Association (Indonesian Natural Colouring Association); Mojokerto Regency's Industry and Trade Office; The Mojokerto Regency's Cooperatives and SME Office, PT Asia Pacific Rayon, also collected aspirations from community officials (village heads, sub-village heads, and community leaders) as well as communities (youth mosques community, PKK, youth organizations, IPNU, and IPPNU). In the first stage, a mapping of the local social, economic and cultural conditions is carried out in order to adapt it to local wisdom and the potential of the area. Furthermore, program socialization was carried out to increase awareness of the importance of entrepreneurship at a young age to 272 participants. After that, soft skills training was given to 76 participants to build good character that can be used for personal and community development. Then, the training was continued by providing technical skills training to 27 participants to start a business. The training provided included planting Indigofera seeds, training on making Indigofera paste, techniques for dyeing \"Jumputan\" fabrics with natural dyes, practicing making Sasirangan, and making Eco Print. Training participants are also given assistance to start a business with a mentoring mechanism and provide access or marketing media for business products. As a result, around 70% of program participants started natural color-based businesses by forming the Juwana Juwono Social Entrepreneurship and 30% started their own businesses selling online. The challenges that arise from the implementation of this program include the need to identify the backgrounds of the training participants such as education attained, business experience, and business capacity. This identification is also useful to be used as a basis for conducting a needs assessment analysis so that the training provided can be more in line with the participants' abilities. The benefits of the program can also be expanded by recruiting more participants and using a master training system. This program can also be replicated in other regions by utilizing the local wisdom of each region to encourage the creation of decent work opportunities and achieve economic equality.

This program is implemented with the Creating Shared Value (CSV) concept targeting MSMEs engaged in the trade sector and the food-beverage sector. These two sectors are the sectors with the closest business process to Pertamina through the distribution of Non-Subsidized LPG. This program is a fund loan program with a loan interest rate below People's Business Loans (KUR) toLPG outlets to develop their business by selling non-subsidized LPG, as well as MSMEs using subsidized LPG who wish to switch to use non-subsidized LPG. This program disbursed business funds at a maximum of 200 million rupiah for each MSME with an administrative service of 3% per year which is valid for 3 years. In addition to financing, the assisted MSMEs will also receive guidance in the form of training and certification assistance needed. The coaching is aim to improve MSME's competences, develop their business, and upgrade class (Naik Kelas). This program is generally carried out to increase the productivity of MSMEs to upgrade their business (increase in turnover, get certification, increase in number of labor, expand markets, increase production capacity, and involve the surrounding community). Through this program, the development of local and regional business clusters is also developed, including through improving institutions and regulations. Through the Pinky Movement program, it encourages the opening of new LPG outlets in various area of Indonesia. This program also provides access to the community to Non-Subsidized LPG, which previously used mostly subsidized LPG.To date, as many as 461 SMEs LPG outlets participating in the Pinky Movement, received soft loans and used the funds to increase their business through the business of selling non-subsidized LPG. The increase in business can improve its operating profit by an estimated 21 million rupiah per year per LPG outlet and assets for the Non-Subsidized LPG business of around 31 million rupiah per year. This program also provides guidance through online learning and facilitates access to licensing and certification. MSMEs participating in this program can also expand their online marketing through the My Pertamina application, the pds135.com website and a market place for culinary MSMEs. In addition, the Pinky Movement Program can be a method to control the use of subsidized LPG effectively while at the same time raising public awareness and ability to use Non-Subsidized LPG. The projection of savings in state subsidies from the Pinky Movement program is around 45 billion rupiah per year, which is obtained from reducing the consumption of 3kg LPG by 7.38 million kg per year. This program is also beneficial for Pertamina itself, which is projected to increase the company's profit by 7.56 billion rupiah per year. However, this program requires a strong commitment from MSMEs as well as proper guidance in order to reduce the risk of Non-Performing Loans. This program can also be expanded by adding the MSME sector that is financed, such as the industrial and livestock sector, which also uses LPG as industrial fuel and room temperature heating devices for livestock stalls.

Among the most important are: to progressively achieve and sustain growth in the income of the bottom 40% population (in terms of income) at a rate higher than the national average; empowering and enhancing social, economic and political inclusion for all, regardless of age, gender, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or and another socio-economic status; ensuring equal opportunities and reducing inequalities in outcomes, by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices, promoting appropriate legislation, policies and actions; adopting policies, particularly fiscal, wage and social protection policies, and progressively achieve greater equality. In this review, the analysis of Goal 10 indicators in terms of its long-term trend (2015-2019) and the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic (2019-2020), which will be divided into three parts. The first part focuses on the level of inequality based on the Gini ratio, the second discusses indicators related to the status of no one left behind, and the third discusses the aspects of improving equal opportunity, reducing discrimination and the role of the state in achieving all these goals. Then, it will put forward challenges and actions to address the challenges, including a discussion of related best practices that have emerged as initiatives by non-state actors and concluded with several policy responses related to recovery from the COVID-19 Pandemic. A. TREND ANALYSIS AND IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 1. INEQUALITY BASED ON THE GINI RATIO OF PER CAPITA EXPENDITURE In Indonesia, inequality indicators are typically measured using the Gini of per capita expenditure or consumption. From March 2015 to March 2019, Indonesia's Gini ratio (of per capita expenditure) continued to decline from 0.408 to 0.380 (Figure 4.105). Particularly, during this period, the Gini ratio decreased more rapidly in urban areas (-8.6%) than in rural areas (-5.7%).Goal 10 Reduced Inequalities 183 Figure 4.105 Gini Ratio 2015-2020 Source: Susenas, Statistics Indonesia Information on what happened during this period can be analyzed by expenditure per capita changed for each percentile of expenditure per capita. This is known as the Growth Incidence Curve (GIC) (Figure 4.106). GIC is relevant in the context of a longer period. Thus, Indonesia's Gini ratio from 1960 - early 2020 is shown in Figure 4.107. The Gini ratio usually changes very little over time, so looking at it from a longer time perspective is often necessary. Henry Aaron, an American sociologist, once said in 1970 - that observing inequality is like 'seeing the grass grow' 16.

One theory explaining this is that there is an increase in skills of urban workers due to import substitution policies to develop a capital-intensive industry (e.g., see Leigh and Van der Eng 2009). Figure 4.107 Gini Ratio 1964-2020 Source: Susenas, Statistics Indonesia From the 1980s to the late 1990s, before the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC), the Gini ratio was stable, if not slightly declining. However, after AFC, the Gini ratio shows a solid upward trend in urban and rural areas. In 2001, just after the AFC, the Gini ratio in urban area was 0.31. It Increased to 0.41 in 2013 (an increase of 0.1 or 33 percent increase) in urban areas. The rate of change in rural areas is quite similar. In 2001 the Gini ratio was 0.24, and in 2013 it increased to 0.32 (an increase of 34 per cent). After peaking in 2012, the Gini ratio began to show a slow downward trend until 2019. In 2020, the Gini ratio began to increase slightly again, most likely due to the economic crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. From the longer-term perspective, it is known that the Indonesian Gini ratio since 2015 is a reversal from the solid increasing trend from the early 2000s, which is good news. However, from the longer-term perspective, the current Gini ratio is still considered high in historical standard. Currently, high Gini is a result ratio from the strong trend from the early 2000s to 2011, where the Gini ratio reaches a record-high surpassing the psychological threshold of 0.40. From 2010 to 2015, the Gini ratio increased from 0.378 in 2010 to 0.408 in 2015, and then it fell to 0.380 again in 2019. Referring to the GIC curve (Figure 4.106), there is a solid positive slope of the GIC curve of 2010-2015, which means that when the percentage change in consumption is higher, the richer the population is. The slope around the top 10% wealthiest area is steeper, suggesting that the top 10% gains a disproportionately large increase in consumption. In contrast, the GIC curve of 2015-2019 shows a relatively flat slope until around the top 20% richest. Starting from that percentile (80th percentile), the percentage increase of consumption is lower the more inclined towards wealthier households. At the bottom 5%, it is shown that the percentage change of consumption is slightly higher compared to the increase during the 2010-2015 period.

Of course, GIC only illustrates the mathematics of distribution, and does not illustrate the underlying factors. There are not many literatures on the possible factors for the reverse of the trend from 2015 onwards, but here are several possible theories. First, the slower increase of the top 20% richest expenditure may be caused by the end of the commodity boom after 2011. Indonesian Gini ratio reached its record high in 2011, at the same time of the peak of the Indonesian commodity boom. Indonesia has experienced a commodity boom in coal and palm oil, which has impacted inequality. Yusuf et al. (2014) used a computable general equilibrium model to show that the changes in inequality are due to world prices of mining commodities rather than estate crops. The hypothesis of the commodity boom can explain the widening gap between poor and rich in rural areas at least until 2011. After 2011, when the boom stops, inequality stalled and started declining after 2014. It may take time for the ending of the commodity boom to affect the consumption of the richest. Second, there are progressive reforms in expansion of the target and the increase in social protection, especially after the fuel subsidy significantly reduced. It created fiscal space for more investment in social protection. The target of this program was mainly the bottom 5% population. The slope of the GIC curve around the bottom 5% area shows the effect of this program. For example, most of the poor people in this group are in the Family Hope Program (Program Keluarga Harapan/PKH). PKH is one of the social assistance programs prioritized. Yusuf (2018) analyze the social assistance program in the year 2016 that contributed to the Indonesian Gini coefficient, and found that the market Gini (without transfers) is estimated to be 0.410. The net Gini (after transfers) is 0.394. Therefore, the 5 social protection programs in that year have reduced inequality (as measured by the Gini ratio) nationally by 3.7%. The effect of PKH in 2016 is significant. It reduces the market Gini from 0.410 to 0.403, 2021 186 BOX 4.18 EFFECT OF SOCIAL SPENDING ON INEQUALITY Yusuf (2018) estimate the effect of various social spending on inequality in Indonesia. By doing that, He can estimate the difference between the market Gini ratio (Gini ratio without social spending/transfers) and net Gini ratio (Gini ratio with social spending/transfers). He defines NET_X as net household expenditure, where:: NET_X GROSS_X BSM + BPJSPBI Where GROSS_X is the market expenditure, or expenditure without any government transfers (of the 5 listed), BLSM is the unconditional cash transfers, PKH is the unconditional cash transfers, RASKIN is the rice subsidy for the poor, BSM is the education assistance for the poor and BPJSPBI is the health insurance subsidy for the poor. BLSM, PKH and BSM is a direct cash transfers where as RASKIN and BPJSPBI is subsidy and without and cash transfers involved. Calculating each of the element of the net expenditure need to be explained as follows. The result for year 2016 is shown in the table below. The market Gini (without transfers) is estimated to be 0.410 and the net Gini (after transfers) is 0.394. Therefore the 5 programs of social protection have reduced inequality (as measured by Gini coefficient) nationally by 3.7%. The effect of PKH in 2016 is large. It reduces the market Gini from 0.410 to 0.403, a reduction of 1.5%.

The effect of various social spending on Gini ratio (2016) The economic crisis caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic undoubtedly increases poverty everywhere. However, during the early phase of the pandemic, the impact on inequality is not strongly confirmed by empirical analysis. Statistics Indonesia also reports a slight increase in Gini ratio from 0.380 in September 2019 to 0.381 in March 2020. However, from a longer perspective, as seen from Figure 4.107, two alarming trends emerge: first, this is the first time since March 2014 that Gini ratio increased. Despite the pandemic has just began in March 2020, Indonesian government have begun encouraging work from home. Mobility restriction actually started during the second half of March 2020 and in the fourth week of March mobility reduced by 30-40% than February in many areas in Indonesia. In reference to previous studies, there are four mechanism possibilities that exacerbated the inequal impact of COVID-19 in household income. First, informality of jobs. The level of informality in Indonesia is considerably higher in relative to other developing countries (Alatas and Newhouse, 2010). Using SAKERNAS, August 2019, the informality level was measured as the share of labor force, excluding salaried workers and self-employed with paid workers, to total employed workers by province. The mean value of these province-level informality rates is 56.4%. Rothenberg et al. (2016) estimated that more than 93% of firms in Indonesia are informal. These informal firms pay low wages, have low productivity and low-educated managers and serve small, very local and narrow demand markets-attributes that make informal sectors, arguably, vulnerable to economic shock. Second, the ability to work from home. Dingel and Neiman (2020) and Mongey et al. (2020) assert that workers whose were unable to work from home will be hit disproportionately by mobility restriction 17 Gemma W right,1 Michael impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the remedial tax and benefit policies on poverty in Indonesia INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 188 due to COVID-19, either from voluntary mobility reduction or government lockdown policies. Workers whose occupations are classified as craft and related trades workers, plant and machine operators and assemblers and elementary occupation, most likely were unable to work from home. From the SAKERNAS August 2019, the mean of shares of these types of workers to total labour force by province is 20.8%. Third, the mobility-dependent economic sector. The heterogeneity of employment in terms of people's mobility affects the workers in these sectors based on the characteristics and product consumption. Some sectors are more sensitive to direct mobility contraction than others and in the shorter term, which are trade, transportation and accommodation sectors, based on SAKERNAS August 2019, the mean of shares of employment in these sectors by province is 17.5%. Fourth, the workers' educational attainment. As discussed in the literature review, Cho and Winters (2020), Cortes and Forsythe (2020). Montenovo et al. (2020) and Benzeval et al. (2020) explores this mechanism and argue that less-educated workers face larger shock and far worse from the pandemic. Definition of low-educated workers are workers who attained no-school or elementary school education. Calculated from SAKERNAS, August 2019, the mean value of the share of low-educated workers to total labour force by province is 35.4%. Figure 4.108 Top 10 Increasing Gini Coefficient in Urban Areas Source: Susenas, Statistics Indonesia When Statistics Indonesia announced the Gini ratio data of September 2020 in February 2021, it confirmed previous theories and hypotheses. Gini ratio of September 2020 was reported to be 0.385, an increase of 1.3% compared to the previous year. The difference is not significant, but it reversed inequality back to the inequality number of September 2018. Inequality increase was experienced in urban areas where Gini ratio increased by 1.7% from 0.393 to 0.399. As can be seen from Figure 4.108 and Figure 4.109 increase in urban inequality was experienced more predominantly in urban area in provinces where there are more labor-intensive industries like Banten, regions which was hit hardest with COVID-19 cases such as Jakarta, and regions where tourism is its main economic activities, such as Bali (See Figure 4.109).

Table 4.7, data from the survey shows the pattern of reduction in working hours from August 2019 to August 2020. The data shows that formal workers experience a reduction in working hours more than informal workers, especially in the positions of managers, professionals, administrators, and machine assembly operators. This is a response to restrictions on movement (Large Scale Restriction or Pembatasan Sosial Berkala Besar/PSBB) or the policies implemented by the companies where they work. This is due to income of informal workers are dependent on their working hours; they do not have the privilege of not working; when not working, they will not be able to meet the needs for their families. However, this is different from the perspective of change of income. Informal workers generally experience a much larger decrease in income than formal workers, although the decrease in their working hours is much smaller (Table 4.7). For example, it appears that the largest decrease in income occurred for workers in the operator/machine assembler group (-25.0%). The second largest decrease in income was experienced by those who worked as technical workers who worked informally (-23.0%). Furthermore, managers who work informally also experienced a significant decrease in their income by -14.4%. These workers are owners of small enterprises who are dependent on people's outdoor activities which have declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation can explain the decline in income is a lot larger for the poor. For example, the poorest 20% (lowest income group) experienced a decrease in income by 16.5% while the decrease in income for the richest 20% group is 8.3% (Table 4.7). During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a decline in income among the workforce which tends to be regressive (the poor suffer more than the rich), and thus consistent with the increasing expenditure inequality discussed earlier.

The decline of almost 30% in 4 years or around 8.6% per year. This is a positive progress considering Indonesian economic growth has been at around 5% per year. With this progress, there is also an increase in the number of villages classified as independent villages (desa mandiri) . A village is classified as Desa mandiri with scores higher than 75 in the Village Index. There were as many as 2,894 independent villages in 2014. In 2018, the number of desa mandiri increased to 5,606, almost doubled. It is an increase of 16% per year during these 4 years period. Another indicator that measures the progress of development is the number of underdeveloped districts (daerah tertinggal) . Underdeveloped districts are districts that are less developed than other districts on a national level. Underdeveloped districts are determined based on criteria of the economy of its population; quality of its human resources; quality of facilities and infrastructure; regional financial capacity; accessibility; and certain regional characteristics. Based on these criteria in 2015, there was at least 122 districts in Indonesia (out of 416 districts) which were classified as under developed districts (Figure 4.110). In 2018, it was reduced to 62 districts, a decline of almost half in 4 years.2. THE STATUS (LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND) a. Inequality between regions There is significant progress from 2014 to 2018 in the number of underdeveloped villages (desa tertinggal) . A village is classified as Desa Tertinggal based on its status of: (1) provision of basic needs, (2) basic services, (3) environment, and (4) activities of empowerment of villagers. Underdeveloped villages are classified as such due to minimal availability and access to basic services, infrastructure, accessibility/transportation of public services, and governance. An index is developed based on those indicators (Village Index/ Indeks Desa ). Underdeveloped villages scores less than or equal to 50 18 . Figure Error!

However, progress of the declining of underdeveloped regions (villages or districts), there are still room for improvement. First, despite steadily declining from 21.7% in 2015 to 20.1% in 2019, the declining rate of poverty in underdeveloped districts is relatively slow, only 0.6% reduction in 4 years. COVID-19 pandemic hit these underdeveloped districts hard. Poverty in these districts rise from 21.7% to 26.4%, 5.3% percentage point in just one year. This shows how vulnerable these regions are to economic shocks. Second, in terms of economic growth, the economic growth of underdeveloped regions is not always higher than national average during 2015-2020\u2014conditional to address regional inequality. Only in 2015 and 2016, economic growth of underdeveloped districts is notably higher than national average. With this condition, reducing the gap between underdeveloped and other regions became more challenging. b. Relative Poverty Relative poverty is measured by the proportion of people living below 50 per cent of median income (In Indonesian case, proxied by expenditure per capita). In contrast to absolute poverty, such as extreme poverty (PPP$1.9/day/person) or poverty incidence by national poverty line, in relative poverty, the poverty line increases when median income increases over time. An increase in relative poverty incidence can mean that the income growth of the population in the bottom part of distribution (poorer) is not in line with the median income population. In this case, people with average median income are the anchor of welfare standard. Normally, when economy grows, the income of median people also grows. In this situation, it is harder to eradicate relative poverty. Figure Error!

Compared to 2017, the proportion fell from 12.8%, however if compared to 2015, there has been an increase (Figure 4.112). In 2015, the relative poverty incidence is 10.17%. From this we may conclude that despite consistent decline in absolute poverty, Indonesia's relative poverty does not show a similar progress. It means that, despite income of the people in the category of poorest rises, its rate of increase is not rapid enough to the increase of median income population. Relative poverty is more prevalent in rural areas (16.8% in 2020), among youth (15.3% in 2020) and the elderly (13.24%), and those with disabilities (14.35%) (Figure 4.112). In regional terms, poverty is more prevalent in the underdeveloped areas, such as areas in the provinces of NTT, Papua, and some parts of Sulawesi Island (Figure 4.113). Figure Error!

Over the period of 2015 to 2020, the trend shows an improving trend. The percentage of government spending on social protection (relative to total spending) in 2020 is larger than 2015. In 2020, the proportion of expenditure spent on social protection reached 12.7%, while in 2015, it was only 1.7%. The increase in 2020 due to additional social protection budgets as an effort to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Figure 4.115 Proportion of workers covered by Workers Insurance Source: BPJS Ketenagakerjaan and Sakernas, Statistics Indonesia Another indicator of equal opportunity is protection of workers (such as from being laid-off or other risks). There has been a significant improvement in coverage, at least for formal workers. In 2019, 56.51% of formal workers were covered by employment insurance. In just one year in 2020, the coverage increased to 63.82%. Coverage for informal workers, however, is still low (3.21% in 2020). In addition to insurance, Indonesian government has also improved its protection for Indonesian migrant workers. Services facilitation for Indonesian migrant workers have increased to an additional 365 occupation in 2020 from an accumulative of 650 occupations in 2019. B. CHALLENGES AND ACTIONS TO OVERCOME 1. CHALLENGES We identify some of the main challenges faced in achieving the targets of Goal 10 (Reducing Inequality). 1. L ow social mobility. High and persistent inequality generally occurs because of low social mobility, which is represented by high inequality of opportunity. A recent study 20 shows that in Indonesia, people born to low-income families will earn 85-90% lower than those born in non-poor families when they are adult. Figure Error!

Effect of Growing Up Poor on Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from Indonesia. ADBI Working papers. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021196 2. H igh rate of urbanization. By 2035, nearly 70% of Indonesia's population will live in cities. Two-thirds of Indonesians and three-quarters of the population in Java will live in urban areas. Two drivers drive this process: the migration of people from rural to urban areas for jobs and better lives and the transformation of the region from rural to become urban areas. The challenge that has arisen so far is that rapid urbanization goes hand in hand with increasing inequality. The data shows that inequality in urban areas is much higher than in rural areas. Poverty in urban areas has also decreased much more slowly than poverty in rural areas. The sources of new problems resulting from unanticipated urbanization include lower quality of life (urban slum areas), urban poverty, increased pollution, reduced environmental quality, and congestion. From an economic point of view, the problem of urbanization is also related to the inability of cities to create sufficient decent work opportunities for their growing population and, at the same time, the limited development of economic activities capable of providing employment and a decent level of living in rural areas. 3. S tructural transformation. During the 2000s, economic growth in the manufacturing sector is not in line with the long-term growth of the same sector experienced between the 1970s and the mid-1990s. After peaking at 28.4% in 2001, the value-added from the manufacturing sector fell to 19.7% in 2019. The share of manufacturing employment fell from 13.1% in 1997 and increased slightly to 14.9% in 2019, with small annual fluctuations. In other words, Indonesia is experiencing stalled industrialization. The change of the main engine of structural transformation (from manufacturing to services) has had a severe impact on the productivity of the Indonesian economy. Labor productivity growth decreased from 4.5% per year during 1985-96 to 3.1% per year during 1999-2012. In addition, the proportion of the contribution of structural transformation to labor productivity growth shrank from 39.2% to 29.8%. Various studies (e.g. Baymul and Sen (2019), also Yusuf et al. (2021) show that tertiarization tends to increase inequality. 4. H igh labour informality. The high level of labor informality is the cause of structural transformation occurred during the 2000s towards an unproductive tertiary sector that tends to increase inequality. High and persistent labor informality is also a challenge to achieve universal access to social protection. 2. ACTIONS TO OVERCOME Actions that have been implemented in an effort to address the above challenges include the following. 1. Low social mobility is related to the low investment in human capital among low-income groups. Thus, the government continues to strive to improve access to education and health for these group of population. The Family of Hope Program (PKH) is one of these efforts. Its conditional nature where the money can be given only if the children from poor PKH recipient families stay in school or that pregnant women and infants continue to be routinely checked in government health service units, help these programs translate from income transfers into human capital development. 2. Several scholarship programs for the poor have been implemented by the national government, such as the Smart Indonesia Program (PIP), which is given to 21 million school-aged children from 30% poorest households. In addition, local governments such as the Jakarta Provincial Government also provide special programs such as the Jakarta Smart Card. 3. Low social mobility is also associated with the low nutrition-status of children under 197 BOX 4.19 GUYUB PROJECT, JAWA TIMUR The project also brings together various government agencies, including the National Counter Terrorism Agency (BNPT), Witness and Victim Protection Agency (LPSK), Directorate General of National Unity and Politics (Kesangpol), Directorate General of Corrections (DGC), Ministry of National Development Planning (BAPPENAS), Ministry of Women's Empowerment and Child Protection, and Ministry of Religion. Among the novelty of the Guyub Project is that it leverages the partnership and collaboration between academia the provincial government especially the offices of the Governor and Deputy Governor of East Java Province. This multi-agency and multi-sectoral approach are necessary because violent extremism is a complex phenomenon requiring a coordinated multi-disciplinary response involving a wide range of relevant expertise. Despite the challenges from COVID-19 pandemic, the project managed to reach around 9,295 direct beneficiaries and more than 40,000 indirect beneficiaries during the first year of implementation. It was done through innovative platforms and media, including podcasts, online learning and hybrid modalities.five, which causes stunting and eventually lead to low cognitive levels and low labor market outcomes during adulthood. The Ministry of Health has formulated a national strategy to reduce stunting. The strategy includes specific nutrition interventions directly targeting children in their first 1,000 days of life. Other efforts include providing drugs or food for pregnant women or infants aged 0-23 months. Nutrition interventions are also indirectly carried out through various development activities outside the health sector, such as, the provision of clean water or sanitation, nutrition education, and food and nutrition security. 4. Structural transformation is the most difficult challenge. Several initiatives have been started so that investment, especially in the manufacturing sectors, can be accelerated. The government undertakes reforms in to speed up licensing that can reduce regulatory burden on companies. All with the objective that the manufacturing sector, especially those that have the potential to increase job opportunities, can grow faster. Several actions have been implemented to address the challenges related to Goal 10, and many non-state actors also play a role in their contribution in the achievement of Goal 10.. The following are some examples of best practices that are considered significant in Indonesia's efforts to achieve Goal 10. GUYUB PROJECT , EAST JAVA Guyub Project was initiated as a partnership between the Indonesian Government and the United Nations. It is a good example of what can be achieved when partners work together toward certain strategic goals. Led by UNODC, in collaboration with UNDP and UN women, the Guyub Project supports the Indonesian Government to prevent violent extremism in the Province of East Java. MINA is an initiative from Regional Unit IV of PERTAMINA (A fossil fuel state-owned company) Cilacap. The program utilized the abundant potential of wind and solar power in a remote area. The power plant is independent from the main grid that constitute solar and wind energy through a Hybrid Power Plant with a capacity of 12,000 WP. The people of Bondan village can use of the power plant to power up their economic activities including pond cultivation.

POLICY RESPONSE This section discusses some important immediate policy responses in the context of Indonesia's recovery from the multi-dimensional crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis has threatened to disrupt the targets of Goal 10 (Reducing Inequality). The discussion will primarily focus on the recovery efforts as outlined from the Government Work Plan (RKP) in 2021. Even though, the RKP 2021 is focused on economic recovery from COVID-19, some of its themes are relevant to Goal 10 (Reducing Inequality). For example, the following are considered national priorities: (1) Strengthening Economic Resilience for Quality and Equitable Growth; (2) Regional Development to Reduce Inequality; and (3) Increasing Quality and Competitiveness of Human Resources. These three national priorities are very relevant in achieving the targets of Goal 10 (Reducing inequality). 199 In the 2021 RKP, there are at least four economic recovery strategies most relevant to the achievement of Goal 10. First , social protection system reform. The development of an integrated data collection system towards social registration of 100 percent population will commence. The first step is to include data further than the bottom 40 percent. This step was taken primarily to improve the accuracy of data on program recipients, to minimize exclusion and inclusion errors, especially for the poor and vulnerable groups post-COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, integrated social assistance programs are also developed with the aim of increasing the effectiveness of poverty reduction by increasing the adequacy of benefits received by beneficiaries. Second , labor-intensive infrastructure development strategy, especially those directed at industrial and tourism areas. There is a strong emphasis on labor intensive sector so that the economic recovery that occurred would increase equality. Third , human development strategy. As previously discussed, human development strategies are closely related to efforts to expand social protection, strengthen the health sector, and alleviate poverty and reduce inequality. Human resource development needs to be directed at efforts to increase the productivity and competitiveness of the workforce, including through strengthening vocational education and training, as well as general secondary and tertiary education. This strategy is directed at increasing the productivity of labor affected by the COVID-19 crisis. In the preparedness of prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, the quality and effectiveness of learning during the pandemic will also be strengthened. Fourth , challenges of de-industrialization resulting in structural transformation with its adverse inequality impact. Thus, the outlined industrial and trade recovery strategy is relevant to Goal 10. Enhancing competitiveness of leading industrial sectors will be the targets; and then encouraging procurement of local goods by government and state-owned enterprises; accelerating the development of import-substitution products, especially food, beverages and pharmaceuticals; increased export facilitation; facilitate import of raw materials; increased product standards; optimizing the Preferential Trade Agreement Free Trade Agreement (FTA) Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) for export expansion; and improved logistics efficiency. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 200 Goal 12 Responsible Consumption and Production Sustainable Development Goals ensures a sustainable pattern of production and consumption through Goal 12. The main issues include the implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programs on the Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP SCP) (12.1), food loss and waste (FLW) (12.3), chemicals and waste management (12.4) and waste generation reduction (12.5), the active role of companies and businesses through their sustainability report (SR) (12.6), sustainable public procurement practices (12.7), education for sustainable development (12.8), and rationalization of fossil-fuel subsidies (12.c). In the last five years (2015-2019), progress has been reported for several indicators in Goal 12. Nevertheless, some indicators continue to be developed in 2020 to improve the quality of the achievement of Goal 12. Meanwhile, COVID-19 pandemic has both directly and indirectly confined the achievement of several targets in Goal 12. Directly, for instance, the pandemic generates tremendous hazardous medical waste such as medical masks, etc, therefore, further efforts to manage these medical wastes are required. A. TREND ANALYSIS AND IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC Goal 12 consists of seven reportable targets with the main impact of COVID-19 pandemic in targets of Goal 12 is the generation of hazardous medical waste to prevent the spread of the virus. It is estimated that before the pandemic, 2,867 hospitals in Indonesia generated 294,660 kg of medical waste per day (Ministry of Health, 2018). During the pandemic, medical waste generation was projected to increase by 30% (Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 2021). Hazardous medical waste is one of the priorities in SDG 12 achievement since the COVID-19 virus spread in early 2020 until today. The pandemic has changed people's lives and has had multi-dimensional effects on development policies. Therefore, implementing a circular economy is even more relevant in terms of efficiency and strengthening the value chain. Circular economy provides a solution by maximizing the existing resources and also other potentials. The concept of circular economy is not only focused on designing zero-waste industries, but also focus on social factors and the provision of resources and sustainable energy. This concept is applied with the 5R approach (reduce, reuse, recycle, recovery, and repair). 201 1. IMPLEMENTATION OF 10YFP SCP Since 2015, intervention of sustainable consumption and production (SCP) is indicated by its mainstreaming in the Nasional/RPJMN) implementation is part of the SDGs National Action Plan (NAP) 2017-2019 and many SDGs Subnational Action Plans. Currently, SCP implementation is part of the country's national priority (National Priority 1 Strengthening Economic Resilience for Quality Growth and National Priority 6 Building Living Environment, Increasing Disaster Resilience and Climate Change) as part of the effort in resourse efficiency and environmental pollution reduction, as well as improving the quality of life development. These policies are applied in low carbon development (LCD) in the national development agenda. At the beginning of SDGs implementation in 2016, the implementation of 10 YFP SCP was translated into the increased number of collaborations of thematic quickwins programs. In 2020, there were 11 collaboration sectors of thematic SCP quickwins programs, consisting of (1) industry: green industry standard and low-cost green car (LCGC); (2) forestry: Timber Legality Verification (3) energy: new and renewable energy; (4) tourism: Indonesia Sustainable Tourism (ISTA); (5) public works and housing: Sustainable Construction and Building; (6) transportation: Sustainable Transport, and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) scheme to Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA or ICAO Corsia); (7) communication and information: Green Information and Communication Technology (ICT); (8) innovation and technology: Green Technology; (9) financing: Sustainable Finance; (10) agriculture: Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil System (ISPO); and (11) fisheries and marine: Sustainable Fisheries. In 2020, the 10YFP SCP document was updated by the publication of the SCP Indonesia Framework 2020-2030 document and the SCP Action Guidelines. The first document is an update from the SCP Indonesia Framework 2013-2030, which consists of: (1) Strategies of the implementation of SCP pattern change in Indonesia; (2) Reference in formulating strategies and actions to SCP pattern change from tread level; and (3) Reference in implementing cross-sectoral collaboration for policies on SCP (Ministry of Environment and Forestry 2020a). The latter document is a compilation of \"SCP Action Guidelines\" from various innovation and action initiatives on Goal 12 that has flourished in Indonesia over the last 10 years. These documents are expected to be the references for SCP implementation that is tangible, deliverable and beneficial for the Subnational Governments (Provincial, Districts and Cities), new SCP-concerned communities, and businesses. Furthermore, in the longer term, these actions may become a collborative acceleration tool to achieve SDGs. The implementation of both documents is expected to maintain harmony and alignment, and interconnectedness among SDG actions (Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 2020b). Mainstreaming the SCP implementation is also conducted through the development of the SCP Community of Practices in Indonesia. Its establishment can be accelerated through a collaborative platform of relevant stakeholders. Community of Practices are achieved through two approaches: (1) a change in tread level focusing on operational changes of business processes by the government, businesses and community. Package/Menu of SCP action is prepared to ease the process in the SCP Action Guidelines; (2) top-down approach through SCP sectoral policies. Many sectors have initiated policies in SCP pattern change. To strengthen the implementation of sectoral SCP, started in 2020, it was encouraged that the performance indicators of these policies can be INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 202 accommodated in the medium-term development planning cycle in Indonesia. Indonesia continues to encourage SCP implementation in companies through Companies' Rank Performance Rating Program ( Program Penilaian Peringkat Kinerja Perusahaan /PROPER). PROPER is developed to assess and award companies that actively reduce their environmental damage and maintain their reputation. There are five categories of PROPER: gold, green, blue, red and black, which rank from best/most consistent to the lowest. Until 2020, 2,038 companies participated in PROPER have reduced their pollution up to 46.16 million tonnes, 3R activities of waste up to 5,029,181 tonnes, 131.2 million tonnes CO 2e of GHG emissions reduction, and water use efficiency of 339,529,963 m3. Along with the increasing number of industries that have received green to gold certification, the realization of sustainable production and consumption in Indonesia will also increase (Ministry of Environment and Forestry 2020). Generally, the blue PROPER recipients increased from 1,422 companies in 2015-2016 to 1,629 companies in 2019-2020 (Figure 4.116). Gold PROPER recipients have increased from 12 companies (2015-2016) to 32 companies (2019-2020). Meanwhile, the trend of green PROPER recipient companies decreased from 172 in 2015-2016 to 125 in 2019-2020 as several companies increased to the Gold category. The rest for the red PROPER recipient companies are still experiencing fluctuations over the year. However, there are still 2 companies until 2020 that have received the black PROPER predicate.

The government efforts through the Ministry of Industry that have been made include the preparation of Green Industry Standards and Green Industry Certification. The green industry standard is an industry standard related to raw materials, auxiliary materials, energy, production processes, company management, waste management, or other aspects that are prepared to create a green industry. From 2017-2020, the Ministry of Industry has set a total of 28 green industry standards. Furthermore, green industry certification is a form of financial incentive from the government to the industry through financing the initial certification of green industry implementation. During 2017-2020, 37 industrial companies have been certified in the green industry through collaborative financing by the government and industry. To support the implementation of green industry certification, until 2020 there are 16 Green Industry Certification Institutions (Lembaga Sertifikasi Industri Hijau, LSIH) consisting of 8 Centers (Balai Besar), 1 Industrial Standardization Research Center, 1 Industrial Certification Center, and 6 external LSIH. From 2010 until 2019, 895 companies are receiving SIH, contributing to energy and water efficiency equivalent to IDR 3.5 trillion and IDR 228.9 billion consecutively. Efforts in the implementation of 10YFP SCP is made through the implementation of SCP standards in the development sectors. One example is the SCP standard implementation in the sector of environment and forestry based on science and technology principles. Currently, 10 Indonesian National Standard (Standar Nasional Indonesia/SNI) has been established: (1) Management Standardization (forest management, seed technology, nursery and environment management); (2) Product Standardization (non-wood forest product, log, sawn timber, wood panels, and other products, harmonization to international standards, ecolabel criteria); (3) Technology and Assessment Standardization (water quality and wastewater, quality of seawater, air quality, hazardous materials, and ecolabel criteria) (Ministry of Environment and Forestry 2021b). To strengthen this, the Institution of Environment and Forestry Instrument Standards established based on Presidential Regulation Number 92 Year 2020 on the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. It aims to strengthen the authority and capacity of standard institutions, which are currently only echelon level institutions (Pusat Standarisasi LHK). BSI is designed to reach the standards in production, implementation, monitoring and management, thus ensuring the achievements of SCP profiles. 2. REDUCING FOOD LOSS AND FOOD WASTE (FLW) Current policies of food security in Indonesia are focused on increasing food production, setting aside the management of FLW. According to FAO (2019), food loss is the decrease in the quantity or quality of food resulting from decisions and actions by food suppliers in the chain, excluding retailers, food service providers and consumers. Meanwhile, food waste is the decrease in the quantity or quality of food resulting from decisions and actions by retailers, food service providers and consumers. Food loss occurs in production, post-harvest, until processing and packaging. Food waste occurs during the distribution and marketing until consumers' consumption. According to the study of Food Loss and Waste in Indonesia (Bappenas, 2021), it is estimated that 23-48 million tons/year (115-148 kg/capita/year) of food loss and waste has generated in 2000-2019. The largest generation occurs in the consumption supply chain (5-19 million tons/year). The percentage of food loss for 20 years INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 204 tends to decrease from 61% in 2000 to 45% in 2019 with an average of 56%. Meanwhile, food waste generation for 20 years tends to increase, from 39% in 2000 to 55% in 2019 with an average of 44%. When viewed in terms of food types, the largest FLW generation was contributed by the food crops sector, specifically from grains, which amounted to 12-21 million tons/year. Meanwhile, the most inefficient type of food is the horticulture sector, especially vegetables - where the loss reaches 62.8% of the total domestic supply of vegetables in Indonesia. The emergence of FLW has a multidimensional impact. From the environmental aspect, these emissions result in total greenhouse gas emissions reaching 1,702.9 Megatons of CO2e. From an economic point of view, it causes economic loss of IDR 213 - 551 Trillion per year or equivalent to 4%-5% of Indonesia's GDP, and from the social side, the loss of energy content due to food loss and waste is equivalent to the portion of food consumed by 61 million - 125 million people per year. Moreover, the issue of FLW also affects the achievement of responsible consumption and production patterns. As a concrete step of FLW management in the context of implementing a circular economy and low carbon development in Indonesia as well as encouraging the achievement of sustainable development goals, several key points need to be encouraged, including building FLW knowledge to all stakeholders involved in the food supply chain, changes in community behavior, developing farmer corporations and optimizing appropriate funding for the provision of infrastructure and facilities that support food processing efficiency, developing FLW regulations at national and regional levels as well as strengthening institutional coordination, encouraging the development of food distribution platforms (food banks) and FLW management that supports a circular economy, and strengthening of national and regional databases on FLW through studies and censuses. 3. ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN MULTILATERAL INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT ON CHEMICAL AND HAZARDOUS WASTE Indonesia has significant importance in actively supporting the agreement on the management of chemical and hazardous waste. This happens because the geographic nature of Indonesia as an archipelago supporting Indonesia to be geographically vulnerable to sources of pollution, including hazardous waste. Hence, close cooperation with neighbouring countries is needed. Indonesia has played an active role in several international environmental agreements related to chemicals and hazardous waste and has also ratified them, among others: (1) Basel Convention through Presidential Decree No. 61 Year 1993 and amendment of Presidential Decree No. 47 Year 2005 regarding the forbidding of solid hazardous waste import and protecting the country from other imported wastes; Figure 4.117 Food Loss and Waste Generated in 2000-2019 Source: Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas, 2021 205 (2) Stockholm Convention through Law No. 19 Year 2009 on Endorsement of Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants; (3) Rotterdam Convention through Law No. 10 Year 2013; and (4) Minamata Convention through Law No. 11 Year 2017 on Endorsement of Minamata Convention on Mercury. Furthermore, to strengthen the implementation of the aforementioned global conventions, Indonesian government has enacted Presidential Regulation No. 21 Year 2019 on National Action Plan on Reduction and Elimination of Mercury in the reduction and elimination of mercury are part of the national development agenda which is prioritized in 4 sectors: energy, health, manufacture and small-scale gold mining (pertambangan emas skala kecil/PESK). According to a study by the Directorate of Environment, Ministry of National Development Planning (2020), it is projected that mercury from 17 institution and non-institution activities will increase from around 3,700 tonnes/year in 2019 to 8,234.1 tonnes/year in 2045. One of the first innovative efforts of integrated mercury management is establishing a Mercury and Metrology Laboratory. The construction of this lab finished in December 2020 and it is hoped to be fully operationalized in 2021. This lab is responsible to develop research and monitoring network of mercury in Indonesia and support the Natioanal Action Plan (NAP) of PPM. Moreover, this lab is expected to strengthen surveillance and monitoring of mercury pollution quickly and accurately in the country (not dependent on testing on other countries). This lab is also expected to become the center of excellence to strengthen the capacity of labs at the subnational level. This shows Indonesia's commitment to Indonesia's role as the President of Bureau and Host of COP-4 Minamata Convention as agreed in COP 3 Minamata. Other efforts include reducing hazardous materials use and hazardous waste by reducing ozone- depleting substances (bahan perusak ozon/BPO). This effort started from ratifying the Montreal Protocol in 1992, which regulates the consumption of BPO types of CFC, HCFC, Halon, Methyl bromide, Methyl chloroform, and Carbon tetrachloride through the Ministry of Environment and Forestry as the National Focal Point. On January 1, 2015, Indonesia banned the use of HCFCs in the air conditioning and refrigeration manufacturing industries and some foam sectors. The only BPO that can be imported is HCFC which is used to meet the needs of refrigeration and air conditioning unit maintenance services, solvents, and as a developer in the foam sector and Methyl bromide for quarantine and pre-shipment purposes. In 2019, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry conducted an inventory study of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) as the alternative materials to replace BPO that do not destroy ozone. This activity is one of the preparations for ratifying the Kigali Amendment as an amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which adds a gradual reduction in HFC consumption. From 2013-2020, Indonesia has contributed to the success of the Montreal Protocol by reducing the consumption of BPO, especially the type of HCFC by 215.52 tons of ODP (Ozone Depleting Potentials). 4. WASTE MANAGEMENT TO SUPPORT SCP IMPLEMENTATION a. Management of Hazardous Waste to Support SCP Implementation One of the efforts in reducing industrial waste in Indonesia is executed through the management of hazardous waste. Until 2019, 68.3% of 132.7 million tonnes hazardous waste has been managed resulting more than 99% of hazardous waste recorded have been managed annually (Figure 4.118). Achievement in hazardous waste management is supported by companies that have applied clean technology to reduce the use of hazardous materials. Nevertheless, this achievement is way below the INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 206 SDGs target of 150 million tonnes in 2019 (Ministry of National Development Planning, 2020). In addition, around 1.9 million m 2 contaminated land has been restored from the total of around 2.9 million tonnes of hazardous waste in the last 5 years. Apart from the hazardous waste generated by industries, COVID-19 pandemic has caused more hazardous waste has been generated that requires particular attention.

No text of specified style in document..120 Number of COVID-19 medical waste generation (in tons) for the period of March 2020-March 2021. Source: Ministry (tons/year) Hazardous managed (tons/year) Between March 2020 until March 2021, 10,575.87 tonnes of hazardous waste in regards to the pandemic has been generated (Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 2021). This waste generation is spread across 34 provinces, in which more than 80% (8,543.63 tonnes) come from Java Island. DKI Jakarta Province has generated the most medical hazardous waste amounting to 7,496.56 tonnes or around 70% of all medical waste generated (Figure 4.119). This is due to DKI Jakarta becoming the first epicentre of COVID-19 spread and the highest number of COVID-19 patients treated in health care facilities and isolation facilities compared to other provinces. Medical waste management, including waste from COVID-19, can be done through hazardous waste management technology such as incinerator or standardized autoclave. Currently, there are 121 hospitals and 20 hazardous waste management facilities with license to manage medical waste. In order to increase the capacity of hazardous waste management, especially the medical waste of COVID-19, there are additional 84 units of waste management facilities that have not been licensed but are allowed to operate by the discretion of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. Therefore, there are 224 units of waste management facilities with capacity to manage 475,670 kg/day of medical waste, including COVID-19 medical waste in all of Indonesia. Figure Error!

According to data of the Ministry of Health, 4,500 kg medical waste has been processed in hospital incinerators since March 2020. The increase of medical waste before and after the pandemic in Indonesia is illustrated in the number of medical waste (waste of PPE and other medical wastes) (Figure 4.120). Figure 4.120 Number of medical wastes processed in incinerators 21. Source: Ministry of Health in Bappenas - IATL, 2021 21 Updated data on medical w aste in health care facilities is not included with current data on COVID-19 referral hospitals that has reached 506 hospitals in all Indonesia (PERSI in Bappenas - IATL 2021).Currently, the capacity of medical waste spread across Indonesia does not cover all 34 provinces. Of the 132 referral hospitals based on the Decree (SK) of the Minister of Health, 110 already have licensed incinerators. There are 20 hazardous waste management facilities spread across 7 regionals in Indonesia (Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 2020). Also, there are 6 regions in Indonesia with thermal medical waste management capacity. In response to the situation, the Indonesian Science Institution (Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia/ LIPI) introduced some technology that can be utilized to manage the increased generations of medical waste during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several technologies developed by LIPI are (1) disinfection, autoclave, incinerator and recycling waste of medical masks; (2) recrystallization method of plastic medical waste to be applied to raw plastic materials for PPE such as polypropylene, polyethene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride (LIPI, 2021; Jarum Suntik/APJS) with sliding electrode method and self-heating system to destroy the metal part of the syringe, and destroy the tube so it cannot be reused (LIPI, 2021a). These technologies are expected to strengthen the capacity in medical waste management to reduce infectious waste and avoid the risk of COVID-19 spread.

Waste Management to Support SCP Implementation Since 2015, 3R waste management has been conducted in the recycling centers (Pusat Daur Ulang/ PDU) in the city level and 3R waste management center with capacities up to 5 - 20 tonnes/day. Until 2019, 14.58% of waste has been reduced and 67.40% of waste has been managed (Figure 4.121). Ministry of Environment and Forestry has pushed extended producer responsibility policies (EPR) in Indonesia, as stipulated in the Ministerial Regulation of the Minister of Environment and Forestry No. 75 Year 2019 on Roadmap of Waste Reduction by Producers. This policy aims to achieve the target of waste reduced by producers of 30% compared to waste generated in 2029. The waste reduction includes limitation of waste generation, recycling and upcycling. COVID-19 pandemic has encouraged social and economic changes, including increased urban farming, which contributes to pollution reduction (Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 2018; Sedana, 2020). The work from home (WFH) policy has also encouraged urban farming to become a popular trend in the past year, apparent by the increased sales of horticulture seeds of up to 5 folds and export in house plants up to 333 million pieces until November 2020 (Ministry of Agriculture, 2021). Integrated urban farming encourages circular economy implementation at the community level, significantly reduces household waste and strengthens food security and climate change resilience.

To address this issue, PT Solusi Bangun Indonesia Tbk (SBI), represented by its waste management unit, Nathabumi, transform waste generated in cities to become Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF). RDF substitutes fossil fuel in a certain percentage and helps reduce CO 2 emission in cement production. Collaborating with Cilacap District Government, RDF technology helps the city to manage domestic waste and reduce waste going to landfill. This RDF facility in Cilacap is the first of its kind in Indonesia and is realized through the collaboration of the Cilacap District Government, Denmark Government, Central Java Province Government, Ministry of National Development Planning, Ministry of Public Works and Housing, and Ministry of Environment and Forestry. The first RDF facility was launched in 21 July 2020 with minimum capacity of 120 tons of waste treated using bio-drying method that generated around 60 tonnes of RDF. This amount can replace 40 tonnes of fossil fuel per day and also helps to reduce GHG emission from methane in landfills. This initiative has the potential to be replicated in all cities in Indonesia to address issues of sustainable waste management. Currently, SBI is collaborating with DKI Jakarta Province Government and PT Unilever Indonesia to manage waste in Bantargebang Landfill (TPST) using landfill mining. In East Java, SBI also participates in planning the RDF plant in Tuban District, collaborating with Ministry of Public Works and Housing, Semen Indonesia Group, and Tuban District Government. Later, cement factories under the Semen Indonesia Group like in Rembang, Aceh, Padang and Makassar plan to replicate the action, together with each districts or cities governments. This contribution is expected to give an innovative, sustainable, environmentally-friendly, and economical solution to Indonesia's challenges of urban waste management. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 210 5. SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES AND INFORMATION IN REPORTING The Sustainability Report (SR) is a report for the industry to disclose information on sustainability performance transparently to encourage behavioral change in managing risks, both financial, social, and environmental. Submission of SR for Financial Services Institutions (Lembaga Jasa Keuangan, LJK), Issuers, and Public Companies is obligatory and must be submitted to Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan/OJK). This has been regulated in OJK Regulation Number 51/POJK.03/2017 on Implementation of Sustainable Finance for Financial Services Institutions, Issuers, and Public Companies. The implementation of sustainable finance for LJK, Issuers, and Public Companies is carried out in stages. The banking sector became the first implementer of the implementation of POJK 51 Year 2017. In the first implementation of 2020, around 55 (fifty-five) banks have submitted a Sustainability Report. This report was made available to the public in June 2020 or 2 (two) months later due to the OJK's Sustainability Report deadline relaxation policy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sustainable Finance must also be implemented in the Capital Market sector for Issuers and Public Companies since January 1, 2020. Issuers other than Issuers with small-scale assets and Issuers with medium-scale assets and Public Companies are required to submit the first Sustainability Report in 2021. However, OJK provides relaxation of the Sustainability Reports submission deadline for Issuers and Public Companies to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the non-bank financial sector, the implementation of Sustainable Finance is supposed to be implemented in 2020 with the obligation to submit sustainability report for the first time in 2021. However, the relaxation regulation allows Sustainability Report to be submitted 2 (two) months later, thus it will be available in June 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data sourced from the IDX shows an increase number of SR companies. As of October 2020, 100 companies have published its SRs. This number grows compared to only 55 companies in 2016 (Financial Services Authority (OJK), 2017).

The implementation of SML by companies is considered important as a management system to protect environmental management (perlindungan pengelolaan lingkungan hidup/PPLH), including permits, training, monitoring and law enforcement. SML implementation in Indonesia is shown by the number of companies with SNI ISO 14001 certification as the standard as agreed internationally. The number of companies implementing SNI ISO 14001 Indonesia shows a positive trend (Figure 4.122). From 2009 through 2018, the number of companies implementing SNI ISO 14001 has increased from 1,028 in 2010 to 2,125 companies in 2019. 6. SUSTAINABLE PUBLIC PROCUREMENT PRACTICES a. Eco-Friendly Products Referring to Presidential Regulation No. 12 Year 2021 on Amendments to Presidential Regulation No. 16 Year 2018 on Government Procurement of Goods/Services, one of the objectives of Government Procurement of Goods/Services (Pengadaan Barang/Jasa Pemerintah, PBJP) is to increase sustainable procurement. Furthermore, Article 68 explains that PBJP is implemented by taking into account sustainable aspects consisting of: (1) Economic Aspects, (2) Social Aspects, and (3) Environmental Aspects. The development of environmental aspects in sustainable procurement is reflected in the environmentally friendly procurement of goods and services. The procurement of environmentally friendly goods and services is mandated in Article 43 of Law No. 32 Year 2009 on Environmental Protection and Management. In order to implement the mandate of Law 32, Articles 31-37 of Government Regulation No. 46 Year 2017 on Environmental Economic Instruments regulates the environmentally friendly label system and the procurement of environmentally friendly goods and services as an incentive instrument. Based on Presidential Regulation No. 12 of 2021 on Amendments to Presidential Regulation No. 16 of 2018 on Government Procurement of Goods/Services, sustainable procurement is carried out by: (1) PA/KPA in planning and budgeting for the Procurement of Goods/Services; (2) PPK in drawing up technical specifications/KAK and draft contracts in the procurement of goods/services; (3) The Election Working Group/Procurement Officer/Procurement Agent in Compiling the Bidding Document. Furthermore, in preparing technical specifications, terms of reference (ToR), and draft contracts, PPK uses environmentally friendly products that are labelled environmentally friendly. Procurement of eco-friendly goods and services is aimed to encourage behavioural change and mindset from consumers in government institutions for more efficient and environmentally friendly practices. The procurement of eco-friendly goods and services also means a behavioural change leadership from the government and communities that have been established. The scheme used as the criteria of procurement of eco-friendly goods and services is an agreement from Ministry/Institution as the scheme owner to work together in monitoring the cross-sectoral environment and sustainability aspect. The list of references for eco-friendly goods and services stated in the attachment of Ministerial Regulation of the Minister of Environment and Forestry No. 5 Year 2019 are (1) photocopy paper with ecolabel type 1 (scheme developed by Ministry of Environment and Forestry; (2) file folder with ecolabel type 2 (Ministry of Environment and Forestry); (3) wood for furniture with SVLK; (4) microwave hybrid with eco-friendly technology verification (Ministry of Environment and Forestry); (5) autoclave hybrid with eco-friendly technology verification (Ministry INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 212 of Environment and Forestry); (6) AC with the energy-saving label (Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources). As an operational reference for procurement of eco-friendly goods and services, National Procurement Board ( Lembaga Kebijakan Pengadaan Pemerintah /LKPP) has enacted Circular Letter LKPP No. 16 Year 2020 on Stipulation of Green Products/Products of Green Industries to be utilized in the procurement of sustainable goods/services for the government. Green products stated in this Circular Letter consists of eco-labelled photocopy papers, eco-labelled office stationery (folder file) and wood-based furniture with Timber Legality Verification System ( Sistem Verifikasi Legalitas Kayu /SVLK). b. Ecolabel Application The rising demand for eco-friendly goods and services supports the development of Green Public Procurement, Green Building, Green Tourism, Green Hotel, and others. To be labelled eco-friendly, Indonesia has issued an ecolabel logo for registered eco-friendly products: (1) Ecolabel Type I, this label is given to products complying with SNI ecolabel criteria, until April 2021, 31 products meet the criteria of Ecolabel Type I; (2) Ecolabel Type II, label given to products with verified eco-friendly self-declaration, until April 2021, 122 products are registered Ecolabel Type II. Eco-friendly standard/criteria are stipulated in the Indonesian National Standard (Standar Nasional Indonesia/SNI), and those stipulated by the Ministerial Regulation as well as criteria (claim) of environmental aspect in reference to SNI ISO 14021 and follow procedures of the ecolabel logo attachment as regulated in the Ministerial Regulation of the Minister of Environment and Forestry No. 2 Year 2014 on Ecolabel Logo Attachment. Ecolabel provisions have 3 (three) sustainability aspects: (i) sustainability of forest product functions, (ii) sustainability of forest ecological functions, (iii) socio-cultural sustainability. It is anticipated that public procurement can also be in line with forest sustainability, both from forest resources, conservation, socio-economic and institutional. 7. AWARENESS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Awareness on the importance of environmentally friendly lifestyle can be done through education, raising awareness, and capacity building of human resources and institutions. Indicators used to measure the aspects are the number of formal educations and institutions/communities with environment concerned and culture. Environmental education conducted by relevant stakeholders and communities aims for behavioural change by increasing knowledge, skills, and awareness on environmental issues and values and their challenges. It is expected that environmental education can influence the community to be active in environmental conservation and protection for the benefit of present and future generations. The Adiwiyata program is one of many programs of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry that encourages knowledge-sharing and increases awareness in schools communities. This program is supported by several regulations such as the Ministerial Regulation of the Minister of Environment and Forestry No. 5 Year 2013 on Guidance for Adiwiyata Program Implementation, Ministerial Regulation of the Minister of Environment and Forestry No. 52 Year 2019 on Action of Environmental Awareness and Lifestyle in Schools, as well as the Ministerial Regulation of the Minister of Forestry and Environment No. 53 Year 2019 on the Adiwiyata Award. The Adiwiyata program aims to create an enabling environment for schools to become a facility for learning and raising awareness (for educators, students and school employees) that is reflected in (1) Development of a school policy on environmental awareness and lifestyle; (2) Development of an environmentally-friendly-based curriculum; (3) Development of 213 participative-based environmental activities; and (4) Development and management of environmentally-centered facilities. In 2019, there were an additional of 434 schools that participated in the Adiwiyata program. There were also 5 Gemilang institutions/communities representing formal education and communities with awareness and leadership of environmentally-friendly lifestyle (Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 2021). Furthermore, in 2019, 363 environmental and forestry cadres were established, 1,320 generations of environment and forestry, as well as 785 scouts from Saka Kalpataru and Saka Wanabakti. Conservation cadres act as pioneers and drivers to conserve and preserve the natural resources and ecosystems and foster a conservation movement in the community. Awareness of an environmentally-friendly lifestyle can be intervened by providing environmentally-friendly public facilities complying with the Community Service Standards (Standar Pelayanan Masyarakat). Public facilities are an ideal locus for SCP intervention since public facilities are the places where interactions happen among communities as the user with government and private sector as the managers. Thus, public facilities can become a social lab to encourage the SCP lifestyle. Community Service Standards at Public Facilities (Pos-pos Fasilitas Publik/SPM-FP) provide standards for its management through the Ministerial Regulation of the Minister of Environment and Forestry No. P.90 Year 2016 on Community Service Standards at Public Facilities to Improve Environment Quality. This includes an integrated environmental management through the role of District/City Governments as the implementor of government affairs in public services at public facilities, and in improving the quality of the environment towards a sustainable city, with the support of the related Ministries, Provincial Government, and Stakeholders. In the Regulation of the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry No. P.8 Year 2017 on the Implementation and Assessment of Community Services Standards Public Facilities, it is further regulated the Guidelines of the First Party Compliance Assessment (Penilaian Kesesuaian Pihak Pertama/SPM-FP). Until 2020, there was 12 documents regarding SPM FP: (1) Recreation Area; (2) Eco-Tourism; (3) Public Market; (4) Religious Place of Worship; (5) Terminals of Road Transport; (6) Shopping Centers; (7) Ports; (8) Rest Areas on Toll Areas; (9) Higher Education; (10) MICE; (11) Railway Stations; and (12) Islamic Boarding Schools. The public facilities that have implemented SPM-FP as per April 2021 include (1) SPM-FP Religious Places of Worship (Salman Mosque ITB and Santa Odelia Church, Bandung); (2) SPM-FP Jurangmangu Station, South Tangerang; and Klender Station, Jakarta). 8. RATIONALIZATION OF FOSSIL FUEL SUBSIDIES TO BETTER TARGETED POLICIES The Government has committed to reduce the negative impacts on the environment, in parallel to SDG 12 achievement. These efforts align with reducing fossil fuel subsidies as shown by a descending trend in the realization of fossil fuel subsidies as a GDP percentage. The percentage of fossil fuel subsidies to GDP over the last three (3) years has decreased from 0.65% (2018) to 0.31% (2020). Reducing fossil fuel subsidies are part of transforming policies regarding commodity-based subsidies to a more targeted recipient-based. The assistance that is targeted recipient-based is carried out through integration with social assistance gradually. Social assistance aims to provide access to the poor. With the principle of No One Left Behind, the rationalization of fossil fuels in a more targeted direction contributes to green economy development.

CHALLENGES The challenges in implementing SCP in Indonesia include: (i) the need for operational policy intervention on SCP implementation in the business cycle and business processes in government, private sector and community holistically, including its financing; (ii) the need to analyze and avoid trade-offs between economic growth and quality of the environment and natural resources; (iii) the need to implement SCP (with the concept of decoupling) to more sustainable development; (iv) the need to develop incentives and disincentives to encourage the SCP implementation. In addition, the availability of data and information regarding the implementation of SCP in Indonesia is not yet fully available. This is because SCP implementation is not embedded daily, in the household level, companies, and the government. At the community level, the implementation of SCP can change behavior or lifestyle to a healthier lifestyle by considering the surrounding environmental conditions such as no littering and water and electricity use efficiency. At the company and country level, SCP implementation can result in resource efficiency such as land, food and energy. Furthermore, SCP implementation can encourage companies to innovate in producing eco-friendly products. Figure Error!

ACTIONS TO OVERCOME Several actions in the acceleration of the achievement of Goal 12 focuses on resource efficiency, low- carbon development strategy, green economy, circular economy and more comprehensively. In the Indonesian context, there are 4 main strategies: (1) Create Demand: Green Public Procurement and improvement in Green Public Facilities; (2) Create Supply: portfolio of new environmentally friendly product or service or investment, sustainable sourcing, innovation, green technology, sustainable financing; (3) Resource Pool: platform of concrete actions of SCP for government, businesses and communities; and (4) Create jobs/new economy through integrated waste management, rainwater harvesting and others. Furthermore, in response to overcome the challenges of medical hazardous waste management due to the pandemic, in 2020, many medical waste managements were built in Aceh Province (capacity 300 kg/hour), West Sumatra (300 kg/hour), South Kalimantan (150 East Nusa Tenggara (150 kg/hour). Many other best practices were implemented by other stakeholders, follows: BOX 4.22 BAGS) Bogor City Government supports the campaign to reduce plastic bags through the Mayor Regulation No. 61 Year 2018 on Reduction of Plastic Bags in shopping centers and modern stores. This regulation aims to reduce household plastic waste in Bogor City, which can accumulate to 1.8 tonnes monthly. This policy is called as the BOTAK program. Since August 2018, Bogor City Government has advocated this policy around 150 times in 3 months, supported by environmental communities and several CSOs. The policy was firstly aimed at retail shops, and in August 2019 started to be implemented in modern markets. The outreach to traditional markets begins in 2020 to meet the target of zero plastic bags in Bogor in 2025. In its implementation, the effectiveness of this policy has to be evaluated to ensure the zero plastic bags target is achieved. Disincentive should also be considered if the policy is not implemented. Since the BOTAK program, the number of wastes in Galuga landfill has reduced to 7% (50 tons) a day from 650 to 600 tonnes of waste (Beritasatu.com, 2019). This shows that the BOTAK program can reduce plastic bag waste in Bogor City INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 216 BOX 4.23 PLASTIC REBORN 2.0 Plastic Reborn 2.0 is a subsequent program of Plastic Reborn 1.0 implemented by the Ancora Foundation to inspire behavioral changes of Indonesian youth in plastic waste management, especially post-consumption plastic packaging. Plastic Reborn 2.0 is a step further by engaging the public, especially the youth, with their creative and innovative ideas using post-consumption plastic packaging as a new business opportunity. Selected startups are provided acceleration class to build-up their business and many other facilitations so they are known by the public. Although there were some challenges at the beginning of the program, especially the willingness of the startups to collaborate, it is realized that this collaboration unites the strength of each startup. Collaboration among startups has produced several innovations for technology-based integrated waste management services named Mixed Waste. Another innovation is the Smart Waste Platform (SWAP), an online platform to help create transparencies and better effectiveness for scavengers and waste management workers. This program has encouraged the development of startups in waste management and recycling, which has collected 282 tonnes of post-consumption plastic packaging waste or polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Numbers continue to increase to 24% that is recycled for 18 months. The total amount of waste managed (organic and inorganic) is 464%. One of the startups experienced an increase in active users of 5,000 customers, 17,000 mobile apps users, and more than 200 waste management partners. Meanwhile, other startups also experience 100% growth in household customers and businesses. This program has been implemented in Makassar, Gowa and Denpasar, and it has created a waste management ecosystem that is based on circular economy concept. Plastic Reborn 2.0 is expected to become a role model for the youth and the other regions to create better plastic waste management in Indonesia. 217 BOX 4.24 ENVIRONMENT EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN (PROGRAM PENDIDIKAN LINGKUNGAN UNTUK ANAK/PELITA) The waste generated in Muktijaya Village is 6.817,5 kg/day with the potential to harm the facility of PT Pertamina EP Asset 3 Subang Field if not managed properly. Moreover, 980 poor households and many infants (3-5 years) have no access to Early Childhood Education. These challenges encouraged the company to address the issue with an integrated Early Childhood Education in 2017. On the second year of establishment, PELITA developed an environment-based curriculum and upcycling waste training for parents. This program continued to expand in capacity building for entrepreneur's promotion of upcycled products and establishing Sustainable House of Food (Kawasan Rumah Pangan Lestari/KRPL) in 2019. PELITA continues to flourish with its replication of the waste management curriculum in all Early Childhood Education in Karawang to prevent and recover COVID-19 in 2020. In the same year, a webinar series on the Early Childhood Education Teaching Technique was held in collaboration with the international institution SEAMEO CECCEP. This program has then developed into the year 2021 through the program of Early Childhood Education of Environment, strengthening of Al Firdaus coop, and the formulation of Nutritious Food Menu to prevent stunting in children. Some challenges during the pandemic are the application of distance learning which reduced income, including those of the tutors of the Early Childhood Education, and reduced numbers of waste to be upcycled. To address those challenges, a webinar series on Early Childhood Education Learning Techniques continued during the pandemic, including the establishment of Early Childhood Education teachers entrepreneurship, and seed exchanges with waste to support food security. Benefits of this program include: 70 children participated in Early Childhood Education, 180 people have \"waste savings\" to up to 850 kg, 150 households participated in KRPL, involving 340 poor people. Moreover, as much as IDR 16 million has been generated as an addition to the teachers wage, savings up to IDR 120,000 per parent/year, and the addition of IDR 400.000 per month for households in KRPL. The replication of the curriculum for Early Childhood Education has reached 1,593 schools. This program supports not only the achievement of SDG 12 but also SDG2 (No Hunger), SDG4 (Quality Education), and SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 218 C. POLICY RESPONSE Indonesia has adopted the circular economy concept into Indonesia's Vision 2045 and has integrated it into the 2020-2024 RPJMN. Ministry/Agency supports can be done through increasing technology investment in the implementation of a circular economy, especially for industry; big data development; increasing cooperation for the application of a circular economy such as cooperation in the use of domestic waste; encouraging SMEs to implement a circular economy in their production processes, especially in the food and beverage and textile sectors; providing fiscal incentives such as relaxation of tariffs for industries that have implemented a circular economy, and encouraging the implementation of a circular economy for creative actors in the culinary and fashion fields. Policies and strategies for SCP implementation in the national development agenda consists of: (1) Increasing quality of environment to support sustainable development through (i) Reducing general and hazardous waste; as well as developing integrated general and hazardous waste management towards circular economy; (ii) Pushing the SCP agenda in everyday life; (2) Waste management through (i) household waste management, general and specific; (ii) liquid waste management; (3) Developing green industry through (i) conservation and audit of energy use in industries; (ii) application of modified process and technology; (iii) management of industrial waste; as well as (iv) encouraging the development of incentive and disincentive scheme; and (4) Increasing performance of reduction and management of household waste and other waste in household level such as plastics through (i) development of standards ( Norma Standar Prosedur dan Kriteria / NSPK) in reducing household waste and other waste in household level; (ii) strengthening coordination and collaboration between national and subnational government; (iii) strengthening commitment of executive and legislative institutions in national and subnational level in providing funds for activities to reduce household waste and other waste in household level; (iv) establishing information system; (v) strengthening participation of communities through communication, information and education; (vi) applying and developing incentive and disincentive system in reducing household waste and other waste in household level. The focus for the environment development regarding SCP implementation in the Government Annual Workplan (Rencana Kerja Pemerintah/RKP) 2021 is aimed to increase community resilience to crises like COVID-19. It is focused on building a better environment quality through municipal and hazardous waste management. Considering that hazardous medical waste treatment facilities are not evenly distributed throughout Indonesia, the government, through the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and related Ministries/Institutions continues to support the construction of medical waste treatment facilities, especially in health facilities, which are prioritized in various regions that do not yet have medical waste treatment facilities. This will continue to be developed to meet medical waste facilities in Indonesia as mandated in RPJMN 2020-2024. 219 Goal 13 Climate Action SDG 13 on climate action consists of two inter-correlated main issues of climate change and disaster management. Efforts to achieve the target of combating climate change, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions issues that trigger climate change (13.2), and the response through low-carbon development and climate resilience efforts are discussed. In disaster management, the target of strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity from natural and climate-related disasters (13.1) is discussed. This target comprises the losses due to disasters, notably the number of casualties, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) 2015-2030. In addition, it also examines the increasing public awareness through the education institutions' existence (13.3) and the funding for climate change management (13.a). Various progress in combating climate change and disaster management are reported by the reduction of GHG emissions, adaptation to climate change, financial support in combating climate change, and the implementation of national and sub-national strategies in disaster management. A. TREND ANALYSIS AND IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC The increase in GHG emission is the main cause of climate change. Preparedness to natural and non- natural disasters, including climate-related disasters, is the main target for achieving SDG 13. The COVID-19 pandemic has also greatly affected various development sectors in Indonesia, including SDG 13 achievement. The COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to severely affect GHG emissions due to various development activities impediment in Indonesia. The spread of COVID-19 has led to changes in the GHG emission reduction target in 2020. From one standpoint, the spread of COVID-19 has a positive impact on GHG emission levels reduction by restricting many socio-economic activities such as travels. On the other hand, the COVID-19 has adverse effects on the confined low-carbon development actions. This causes a slight decline in GHG emission reduction in 2020 from the initial target. Nevertheless, Indonesia is still trying to overcome these problems. Indonesia remains focused on stopping the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, boosting the economic recovery efforts and addressing the multidimensional challenges, including the threat of climate change and the environment's declining quality and carrying capacity. This effort is accompanied by a stimulus policy that integrates activities that are environmentally and climate-friendly. The government has laid the foundation for a green economy and made several strategic policies related to climate. Climate action 221 has been mainstreamed into the National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) 2020-2024 through the implementation of Indonesia's broader Low Carbon Development (LCD) strategy. Figure 4.124 Projected GHG Emission Reduction Source: Ministry of National Development Planning/BAPPENAS, 2021 The process of recovering economic and social activities after the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 is expected to have impact on the increase of GHG emissions that year. According to the Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas (2021) study, GHG emissions will rebound, where the emission reduction will weaken from 25.93% in 2020 to only 24.05% in 2021. However, the effect of various efforts to overcome the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to combat climate change will begin to be felt in 2022 by increasing GHG emission reductions until 2024 (Figure 4.124). 1. GHG EMISSIONS AND THEIR REDUCTION EFFORTS a. GHG Emissions As a country that continues to carry out various developments, Indonesia's GHG emission level increases overtime. The national GHG inventory calculation results show that the level of GHG emissions in 2019 was 1,866,500 Gg CO2e, an increase of 680,300 Gg CO2e compared to the emission level in 2000 (Figure 4.125). The forestry and peatland sector are the most significant contributor to GHG emissions in 2019 at 50%. The rest are contributions from four other sectors, 34% from the energy sector, 7% from waste, 6% from agriculture, and 3% from industrial processes and product use (IPPU) (KLHK, 2021a). In 2015 there was a spike in national GHG emissions, primarily due to emissions from peat fires. The forestry and peatland sectors alone account for 1,565,579 Gg CO2e of the total emissions of 2,374,403 Gg CO2e that year. Meanwhile, in 2019, emissions from this sector has been successfully reduced to 924,852 Gg CO2e. Meanwhile, the emission in other sectors experienced a change in which the delta was not too large compared to the total emission. Currently, the total area of peatlands is 14.91 million hectares or about 30% of all tropical peatlands and can INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 222 Figure Error!

GHG Emission Reduction Potential Low-carbon activities have impacted the reduction of GHG emissions. The government and community's efforts have contributed to the potential reduction of GHG emissions and intensity of GHG emissions. The reduction in GHG emissions from 2010-2019 fluctuated, with the forestry and peatlands sectors as the most prominent contributors (KLHK, 2020). The increase in emissions due to forest fires in 2015 significantly contributed to the year's lower emission reductions. 223 Figure 4.126 Cumulative GHG emission reduction potentials for 2010-2019 Source: Ministry of National Development Planning/BAPPENAS, 2020a Up to 2019, the potential cumulative GHG emission reduction is 23.46% from the cumulative baseline emission, or 3,974,713 Gg CO2e (Figure 4.126). The annual GHG emission 2019 have reached 20.51% or 401,822.53 Gg CO2e. Based on the National Greenhouse Gases Action Plan or RAN-GRK's evaluation, two sectors show the potential of significant GHG emission reductions (Figure 4.127): (a) forestry and peat-based sectors; and (b) the fields of energy, transportation, and industry. The most significant low-carbon development actions in the forestry and peatland sectors are deforestation reduction, the increase in Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) principles application, and peat fires control. From 2010 through 2019, the land and energy-based sectors contribute to 85% and 9.5% GHG emission reductions, respectively (Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas, 2020a).

Potential for Reducing GHG Emission Intensity The GHG emissions intensity reduction represents the GHG emissions reduction associated with the economic sector. GHG emission intensity is the ratio of GHG emissions to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in a particular area and period. Reducing the intensity of GHG emissions indicates positive economic growth and the success of GHG emissions reduction (Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas, 2020c). The national GHG emission intensity from 2010 to 2019 showed a descending trend. The decreasing emission intensity value means that to produce a product in the same economic sector in the next period, relatively less emissions will be produced. The reduction in GHG emission intensity in 2019 was 20.77% from the baseline of 420 tons CO2e/billion rupiah due to all low-carbon development sectors' implementation Figure 4.129 GHG emission for Source: Ministry National Development Planning/BAPPENAS, 2020b Figure 4.128 Percentage of GHG emission reduction for 2010-2019 Source: Ministry of National Development Planning/BAPPENAS, 2020b 225 d. Climate Change Management Report Indonesia is committed to reducing GHG emissions by 29% below business as usual (BAU) by 2030 and up to 41% with international assistance. President Joko Widodo has stated this at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris in 2015. As a follow-up to the statement of commitment, the Paris Agreement was ratified through Law No. 16 Year 2016. At almost the same time, Indonesia submitted the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) document to the UNFCCC Secretariat, which is a further elaboration and replaces the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) document submitted before the COP-21 Paris (KLHK, 2017). Indonesia has regularly reported efforts to address climate change to the UNFCCC, which is a manifestation of Indonesia's commitment as a party to the UNFCCC. Efforts to deal with climate change in the form of mitigation and adaptation actions are reported in the Biennial Update and National Communications documents. Concerning the reporting and documents on the progress of climate change efforts, Indonesia has submitted its first Biennial Update (BUR) document in 2015. This document contains updates on mitigation actions implementation submitted to the UNFCCC for the forestry, agriculture, energy, industrial, and waste sectors every 2 (two) years. In addition, Indonesia has also submitted three National Communication Document reports, namely: 1) in 1999 in the form of Initial National Communication; 2) in November 2010 in the form of the Second National Communication (SNC); and 3) in 2017 in the form of the Third National Communication where the contents of the report include including the development of climate change management at the national level. Figure 4.130 The occurrence of climate disasters period in 2010-2019 Source: Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB) 2021 TYPHOON DROUGHT LANDSLIDES FLOODSTIDES/ABRASIONSNumber of events INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 226 Despite mitigation efforts, as an archipelagic country, Indonesia still has the potential for hydrometeorological disasters due to climate change. Several types of disasters due to the impacts of climate change include floods, landslides, typhoons, high tides/abrasions and droughts. Since the last decade, the incidence of hydrometeorological disasters has increased even though the number of events fluctuates from year to year. Landslides and floods were the most frequent occurrences of hydrometeorological disasters during this period (Figure 4.130). The impact of this disaster can be in the form of loss of life of the population, physical loss, to economic loss, including loss of livelihood of the affected community. Therefore, mitigation efforts against climate change must be accompanied by adaptation efforts to the impacts of climate change. Adaptation efforts to climate change are translated into increased climate resilience actions. Climate resilience action is defined as a planned or spontaneous anticipatory action to reduce the value of potential losses due to hazards, vulnerabilities, impacts, and risks of climate change on people's lives in an area. Through Climate Resilience Development (PBI), which is part of the Low Carbon and Climate Resilience Strategy, SDGs, and the Paris Agreement, is also related to macro indicators that climate change and climate hazards can affect the potential loss of GDP in the affected sectors. With the Climate Resilience Development in place, it is expected that potential loss of GDP in sectors affected by climate hazards can be reduced by 1.15%. The success in increasing national climate resilience and reducing GHG emissions can maintain the economic growth targets and strengthen community capacity, which has implications for reducing poverty levels. So that economic growth can be achieved 5.4 - 6.0% and the poverty rate 6.5 - 7.0%. Figure 4.131 GDP Projection With and Without Adaptation Efforts Source: Ministry of National Development Planning/BAPPENAS, 2021 GDP (THOUSANDS TRILLION IDR) GDP PROJECTION GDP WITH ADAPTATION IN RPJMN 2020-2024GDP WITH POTENTIAL ECONOMIC LOSSES DUE TO CLIMATE HAZARDSPOTENTIAL ECONOMIC LOSSES DUE TO CLIMATE HAZARDSCLIMATE RESILIENCE TARGET RPJMN 2020-2024 227 The efforts to increase resilience to the impacts of climate change include reducing the estimated economic losses that will arise. Based on the results of the Economic Loss Assessment Study conducted by the Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas in 2019, it is projected that GDP will continue to increase from IDR 17,130 trillion in 2020 to IDR 24,550 trillion in 2024. However, with the impact of climate change, GDP can decrease to IDR 17. 020 trillion in 2020 to IDR 24,430 trillion in 2024. Adaptation efforts to the national development agenda can avoid this potential economic loss from IDR 115 trillion (without intervention) to IDR 57 trillion (with intervention) in 2024 (Figure 4.131). 2. INCREASING PUBLIC AWARENESS ON CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES Addressing climate change is also carried out through increasing education, raising awareness, and human and institutional capacities related to mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning of climate change. The indicator used is the number of formal education and the environmentally cultured and concerned institutions/communities. Environmental education aims to change the behavior and attitudes carried out by various parties or elements of society, which seeks to increase the community's knowledge, skills, and awareness about environmental values and issues. This can move the community to play an active role in conservation efforts and environmental safety to benefit the present and future generations. The Adiwiyata program is one of the programs of Ministry of Environment and Forestry to encourage the creation of knowledge and awareness of school residents in environmental conservation efforts and sustainable development for the benefit of present and future generations. This program is supported by several regulations, including Ministerial Regulation (Permen) LHK Number 5 Year 2013 on Guidelines for the Implementation of the Adiwiyata Program, Minister of Environment and Forestry Number 52 Year 2019 on the Movement for Care and Culture of the Environment in Schools, and Minister of Environment and Forestry Number 53 Year 2019 on the Adiwiyata Award. The Adiwiyata program aims to create good learning place and increase the awareness of all school residents (teachers, students and school employees), which is manifested in (1) the Development of environmentally concerned and cultured school policies; (2) Development of an environment-based curriculum; (3) Development of participatory-based environmental activities; and (4) Development and management of supporting facilities for environmentally cultured schools. In 2019, an additional 434 Adiwiyata schools participating in the Adiwiyata program. There are also 5 (five) units of Gemilang institutions/communities that represent formal education units and institutions/communities of environmentally concerned and cultured people (KLHK, 2021). In addition, in 2019, there were also 363 environmental and forestry cadres, 1,320 environmental and forestry generations, and 785 Saka Kalpataru and Saka Wanabakti Scouts. 3. FUNDING RELATED TO CLIMATE ACTIONS Indonesia's commitment to addressing climate change is also translated in funding allocation for low-carbon development activities and climate resilience, which are carried out primarily by the government and the private sector. In 2020, the Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas conduct a mapping study of the government's budget through the APBN used for LCD. The budget analyzed includes the State Budget for Ministries/Agencies from 2018-2020 for core and supporting activities in priority sectors: energy, industry, transportation, forestry and peat, agriculture, waste, and blue carbon. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 228 Figure 4.132 Low carbon development budget and expenditure Source: Ministry of National Development Planning/BAPPENAS, 2020b Cumulatively in the last three years, the total APBN allocation for low-carbon development activities was IDR 54.57 trillion, with an 82% realization rate of IDR 44.69 trillion. From 2018 to 2019, there was an 8% increase in the budget from IDR 19.5 trillion to IDR 21.1 trillion. However, in 2020, there was a drastic decrease due to budget cuts for handling COVID-19, bringing the budget to IDR 14 trillion (Figure 4.132). The amount of LCD funding for 2018-2020 is in the range of 0.8% of the total APBN for the three years. Referring to the study 'Government Investment for A Greener and Fairer Economy', the proportion of green funding to the government budget is recommended to be in the range of 3-5% per year so that sustainable development can continue to run progressively. Thus, further efforts are needed to increase low-carbon finance in Indonesia by launching new programs or modifying conventional programs to be more environmentally sound. 4. STRENGTHENING DISASTER RESILIENCE AND ADAPTATION CAPACITY a. D isasters and Their Impacts Indonesia is a natural and climate-related disaster-prone country. Climate-related disasters or disasters with hydro-meteorological types in 2005-2020 occurred 29,513 times (98.64%) during the last 15 years. Meanwhile, disasters with geological types occurred in the same period as many as 402 incidents (1.36%). The incidence of hydro-meteorological disasters has increased from 2005 to 2020, with a four-time increase in the last five-year period (2015-2020). However, in the same period, geological disasters were the disasters that caused the most casualties, adding up to 8,928 people (41.50%) due to the earthquake and 4,141 (46.3%) people due to the earthquake followed by the tsunami.

Meanwhile, in 2020, 409 people died and were missing, and 6,451,439 people were affected and disturbed displaced by the disaster. The impact of this disaster escalated with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of 2019. The number of dead and missing victims per 100,000 people due to disasters (without COVID-19 victims) was 0.15 and 8.34 per 100,000 population when considering the victims of COVID-19 (Figure 4.133). BNPB noted that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 22,138 people died during 2020 from 743,198 confirmed cases of COVID-19. In addition, there were also 611,097 recovered cases of COVID-19. Meanwhile, 866 health workers died during the COVID-19 pandemic until March 30, 2021. This also significantly affects handling the COVID-19 pandemic as a non-natural disaster, especially in 2019. Before the pandemic, there were 213 health facility units affected by the disaster. In terms of economic resilience, from 2010 to 2019, the value of economic losses due to disasters fluctuated with an average economic loss due to disasters of IDR 10.68 trillion per year (Figure 4.134) (Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas, 2020a). In 2018, along with the increasing number of victims due to disasters, economic losses reached IDR 45.55 trillion (0.44% of GDP) due to massive disasters in West Nusa Tenggara Province and Central Sulawesi Province. In 2019, the loss was IDR 6.26 trillion (0.06% of GDP).NUMBER OF DEATHS, & MISSING PERSONS PER 100,000 POPULATION (WITHOUT COVID-19) NUMBER OF DEATHS, & MISSING PERSONS PER 100,000 POPULATION (WITH COVID-19) NUMBER OF INJURED PERSONS PER 100,000 POPULATION NUMBER EVACUATED PERSONS PER 100,000 POPULATION INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 230 Figure 4.134 Economic losses due to disasters in 2010-2019 (in IDR Trillion) Source: Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas, 2020 b. National disaster risk reduction strategies in line with SFDRR 2015-2030 Indonesia has made various efforts to reduce disaster risk; this is reflected in the Indonesia Disaster Risk Index (IRBI), which decreased from 169.6 (high-risk class) in 2015 to 143.6 in 2019. To provide a better reference for disaster management to all parties, the Government of Indonesia has established a Master Plan for Disaster Management (RIPB) for 2020-2044 through Presidential Regulation Number 87 Year 2020. RIPB 2020-2044 is in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 -2030), the Paris Agreement to UNFCCC and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The focus of achieving RIPB 2020-2024 is Indonesia that is resilient to disasters which are realized through (1) Resilient and sustainable disaster management; (2) Professional and inclusive disaster management; and (3) Excellent handling of disaster emergencies and post-disaster recovery (KemenPPN/Bappenas, 2021b). In addition, in the medium-term, the 2020-2024 National Disaster Management Plan (Renas PB) has been prepared, which aligns with the medium-term national development agenda (RPJMN 2020-2024). In the latest National Disaster Management Plan, health disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic are also one of the non-natural disasters that need more attention, especially in terms of prevention and management. c. Local disaster risk reduction strategiesnational level serve as a reference for the Regional Government to prepare Local Disaster Management Plans (RPBD) at the provincial and district/city levels. From 2011 to 2017 the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) has facilitated the preparation of RPBD in 33 provinces in Indonesia. Currently all (34) provinces or 100% of provinces already have RPBD documents, although renewal is needed in some provinces whose RPBD validity period has expired. Meanwhile, at the district/city level in 2012-2019, 182 (35%) districts/cities have RPBDs. Given that there are 514 districts/cities in Indonesia, more substantial efforts are needed to encourage the preparation of RPBDs in all districts/cities in Indonesia (BNPB, 2021). In the future, efforts to mainstream disaster aspects, whether through Action Plans or integrated into the RPJMD, must be intensified to increase awareness and reduce the risk of disasters occurring in Indonesia. IDR Trillions 231 B. CHALLENGES AND ACTIONS TO OVERCOME 1. CHALLENGES The challenges faced in dealing with climate change, especially related to the COVID-19 pandemic, The challenges faced in dealing with climate change, primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have resulted in the policy scenario of Low Carbon Development in the 2020-2024 RPJMN requiring adjustments to remain relevant to current conditions. Suppose the recovery process of post-COVID-19 economic and social activities is not accompanied by an increase in low-carbon development actions to reduce emissions. In that case, it is estimated that the level of GHG emissions will rebound. This is reflected in the decrease in GHG emissions, which are estimated to weaken, from 25.93% in 2020 to 24.05% in 2021, when compared to the baseline. In this situation, low-carbon development actions need to be directed at programs and activities that can significantly reduce GHG emissions and become an integral part of the economic recovery program. Another challenge faced is the increased potential for impacts and risks of hydrometeorological disasters due to climate change. The trend of hydrometeorological disasters is increasing in Indonesia, influenced by short-term extreme climate variability and the effects of climate change. In the short term, it can be felt that extreme climatic events are becoming more frequent, while in the long term, the Earth's surface temperature will experience a significant increase from current conditions. Climate change is predicted to cause surface temperatures in Indonesia to continue to increase consistently. With an increase in temperature of 0.45 - 0.75oC, a change in rainfall of \u00b1 2.5 mm/day, a sea-level rise of 0.8-1.2 cm/year, and an increase in extreme waves of > 1.5 m, 5.8 million km2 of Indonesian waters are dangerous for fishing vessels <10 GT, 1,800 km of coastline are in the very vulnerable category, and rice production will decline in some areas. This will increase the threat of other disasters such as increasing extreme weather and drought periods and intensity, inhibiting the growth of main agricultural crops, causing health problems due to heat stress, potential forest fires, crop failures, lack of clean water, transportation safety due to smoke disturbances, and increased incidence of floods and landslides. The challenge faced in disaster management is the high risk of disasters in Indonesia. This condition is because most areas in Indonesia are still included in the high-risk category with the condition that the number of disaster events has an increasing trend. This is due to the high level of exposure and the vulnerability to natural and climate-related disasters, and non-natural disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost 75% of industrial infrastructure and basic connectivity in Indonesia, including its supporting facilities, are built-in hazard/hazard zones. Another challenge is the weak governance and financing (investment) of disaster management. Efforts to increase disaster resilience have not been supported by an adequate budget, especially for post-disaster recovery. The lack of budget allocation for recovery occurred at the central and provincial and district/city levels of local government. Based on a survey (BNPB, 2018), of all regions that have compiled RPB documents, it is recorded that only 45% have used them as input for the Subnational development plan. Meanwhile, government investment in disaster management efforts is still low in several sectors such as construction, government spending, and other sectors. The percentage of total investment to the new national GDP is around 0.08%. Although post-disaster disaster management is still a large gap, it is recognized the need for a national strategy to build resilience to disasters by strengthening aspects of disaster prevention and preparedness. . INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 232 2. ACTIONS TO OVERCOME Through Climate Resilience Development, it is expected to provide sectoral benefits, reduce vulnerability, increase adaptive capacity, and lead to a reduction in economic losses (GDP). The sectoral benefits include maintaining fisheries production, maintaining rice food production, and protecting coastal settlement areas. The reduction in vulnerability includes avoiding cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and Malaria due to climate change, the potential for ship accidents that can be avoided, and protecting water supplies for households, agriculture and industry. Increased adaptive capacity, including adaptive technology to climate change, is increasing, and land conservation and ecosystem-based adaptation are increasing. Various efforts to intervene in low-carbon and climate-resilient development actions are also encouraged by the Government in various regions by various parties, including local governments and non-governmental institutions. The following are good practices related to Goal 13. BOX 4.25 LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE DEVELOPMENT In anticipation of the impact of climate change, the Government has initiated a low-carbon development policy (PRK) that is oriented towards a balance of economic growth, social stability and reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and GHG emission intensity. In line with this, to reduce the potential loss of GDP for sectors affected by climate hazards, a climate resilience development policy (PBI) has been launched. The PRK is expected to be able to support GHG emission reductions of up to 29% by 2030. Meanwhile, PBI is expected to reduce the potential loss of GDP for sectors affected by climate hazards by 1.15% (KemenPPN/Bappenas, 2021). Various PRK and PBI action interventions support disaster risk management or risk reduction (mitigation), especially slow onset disasters. Currently, the contribution of local governments to the PRK has resulted in 17,717 actions 233 taken by 34 provinces in Indonesia. This PRK action intervention covers the fields of energy, land and waste. Meanwhile, PBI action interventions have been carried out in almost all provinces and at the district/city level only in a few provinces, in four sectors, namely marine and coastal, water, agriculture and health. This contribution is also supported by 23 non-governmental organizations (NGOs), consisting of 67 actions across the four sectors. Since 2010-2019, the Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas has implemented several PRK pilot projects through the Indonesia Climate Change Trust Fund (ICCTF) spread throughout Indonesia. There are 7 priority provinces as pilot projects for implementing the PRK, namely South Sulawesi, Central Java, West Java, Papua, West Papua, Riau and Bali. These various projects have encouraged the reduction of GHG emissions as well as having an impact on the economic welfare of the community and the recovery of various social conditions of the community. As an example of a biogas utilization project for household energy supply in Keningar and Ngargomulyo Villages, Malang Regency, Central Java, it has contributed to the reduction of 16,515 tons of CO2e/year while increasing the community's additional income by IDR 3,000,000 per household per month and involving 155 people in the project by restoring ex-mining land owned by the community. In addition, there are several PBI intervention actions in various parts of Indonesia that support increasing community resilience to the impacts of climate change. Some of these projects include improving water and food security in the regencies of Rote Ndao and Kupang, NTT, and Bantur sub-district, East Java; increasing the economic and ecological resilience of coastal communities in Deli Serdang Regency, North Sumatra; increasing water resistance in Bandar Lampung City and Cirebon City; and resilience to flood disasters in the city of Semarang. The success of these pilot projects will be developed and replicated to several national priority areas according to the potential and needs of the region. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 234 Meanwhile, disaster management is strengthened by regional development efforts to accelerate recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, continue the socio-economic transformation, optimize regional competitive advantages, and increase equitable distribution of quality of life between regions. To realize this goal, regional development will be carried out with a regional socio-economic growth or transformation strategy and an equity strategy that is strengthened by disaster mitigation and risk reduction. The regional development strategy is spatially indicated by growth corridors, equity corridors, and distribution of disaster risk loci. Various efforts at the field level by stakeholders also encourage the improvement of community disaster resilience in various parts of Indonesia. BOX 4.26 BUILDING COMMUNITY DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND RESILIENT THROUGH SCHOOL-BASED DISASTER RISK REDUCTION (BCDPR SBDRR) The earthquake, tsunami and liquefaction disasters that occurred on September 28, 2018 in Central Sulawesi have resulted in various very detrimental impacts, ranging from around 2,227 people died, 965 people were missing and 2,537 people were injured. Various responses from the government and non-government were immediately carried out in the emergency response. In the recovery phase, various organizations are still carrying out programs in the community, but we assess that the programs in the school environment to make schools prepared for disasters are still very minimal, and this has become the basis for the Foundation for the Study and Protection of Children (PKPA) to develop programs BCDPR SbDRR in a school environment in Sigi Regency. The implementation of this program is carried out with various approaches, starting from the coordination of 11 schools, village governments, sub-districts and several stakeholders at the district level. In addition to coordinating, activities such as training, FGD, socialization and procurement of disaster risk reduction facilities in the school environment are also carried out. This program has reached 1,442 beneficiaries consisting of all students and teachers in 11 schools in 5 villages in the Tanambulava sub-district and beneficiaries from the village, sub-district and stakeholder representatives at the district level. The implementation of this program began to face challenges when the COVID-19 pandemic situation occurred, where activities with students could not be carried out in large numbers. This program has the potential to inspire various regions in Indonesia that are prone to disasters to do the same thing to increase resilience to disasters early on. 235 BOX 4.27 CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITIES ASSESSMENT (CCVA)-BASED COASTAL COMMUNITIES FISHERY MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR COVID-19 RECOVERY In 2019, the provincial and district governments of Southeast Sulawesi Province, in partnership with Rare, completed Climate Change Vulnerability Assessments (CCVA) for coastal villages from 22 coastal areas in the province, that depend on local fisheries production for their food security and livelihoods. The CCVA aims to identify the magnitude of climate change threats and the opportunities to adapt under projected climate variability conditions. CCVAs were conducted at the provincial level to provide a province-wide assessment, and at the district level to inform the placement and management plans prepared under the Managed Access with Reserves (MA+R) which is known as Fish Forever Program that has been implemented since 1 Jan 2019 up to 30 June 2024. As the most climate change-impacted segment, the coastal communities have actively participated in the assessment by the provision of very much needed data, information, analyses, and recommended actions that will assist in \"future proofing\" the designs of Fish Forever areas, as much as possible, in the face of predicted changes to both resources and communities. The CCVA applies a flexible framework approach that incorporates both technical, quantitative data and socially informed participatory data to provide a robust, efficient, yet adaptive perspective on local vulnerability (Zhou, 2008). Therefore, the assessment phase was done collaboratively and participatory with local governments and coastal community members to compile the data for 26 variables in 22 MA+R locations. The data was normalized and analyzed to determine 5 key CCVA's components: Exposure, Social Sensitivity, Ecological Sensitivity and Social Adaptive Capacity and Ecological Adaptive Capacity (IPCC SREX 2012, Ofori et al., 2017, Cinner et al., 2013). The tool provides a suite of actions to illuminate the community and local government regarding the potential actions that can be selected as their adaptive actions to climate change. The partnership conducted a workshop to share CCVA methodologies and the subsequent results and recommendations. Based on recommendations, Rare presented a final report in June 2020 in coordination with the Marine Affairs and Fisheries Agency of Southeast Sulawesi province. The published report highlights high climate change vulnerability at 11 of the 22 Fish Forever areas and suggests targeted actions for each based on vulnerability levels and the critical drivers of that vulnerability. Community fisheries management bodies established in 22 Fish Forever sites are now using this tool to prioritize their village-based adaptive actions and finalize their climate-smart fisheries management plans for each Fish Forever area. Using the CCVA results, local communities in those 22 Fish Forever sites work to produce fisheries management plan, initiate collective responses, improve knowledge about climate change impact and adaptation strategy, and, in some sites, commence financial inclusion initiative. Those specific climate change vulnerability assessment-based social adaptive actions prioritized during INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 236 village planning, specifically those aimed at improving access to finances, diversifying livelihoods, and increasing the value of fishery products, are critically important for communities to adapt to the short medium-term economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This can be attained as the ecological, social and financial adaptive capacities of the coastal communities improve and make them more resilient during a hard time, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or extreme weather when they cannot go fishing. 237 C. POLICY RESPONSE The focus of developing disaster resilience and climate change is directed at increasing community resilience in the face of pandemics such as COVID-19. Policy trajectories and strategies for dealing with the impacts of climate change are carried out through Low Carbon Development and Climate Resilience Development. The main policies for dealing with climate change in 2022 prioritizes increasing the achievement of emission reductions and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity during the recovery period of Indonesia's socio-economic activities, focusing on reducing GHG emissions in land use, industry, and energy sectors. 1. In low-carbon and climate-resilient development, the government's future direction is to implement more resilient and sustainable development, emphasizing low-carbon and emission-emission development activities and efforts to address climate change as the basis for economic recovery. This principle is known as Build Forward Better. There are three main strategies in implementing low-carbon development that can change the development paradigm more comprehensively. 2. Implement and integrate a green post-disaster recovery plan into national development planning documents. For example, low-carbon development and climate resilience are priorities for the next five years. This means that development is carried out in a low-carbon framework, using a scientific and analytical approach. 3. Implement fiscal stimulus that can accelerate the transition to low-carbon development. For example, development is directed at developing new and renewable energy, developing environmentally friendly mass transportation, and developing green job opportunities and green tax incentives. In addition, efforts to protect the environment continue to be carried out in the form of rehabilitation of critical lands, ecotourism that can empower the community to participate in preserving the environment. By building community and sector resilience against external shocks/disruptions, such as pandemics and climate-related disasters, the government seeks to improve the quality of the environment. This also aims to increase the quality of water, air, sanitation and waste systems, as well as efforts to increase mastery of technology and innovation to strengthen food systems and resource efficiency through a circular economy approach. As in anticipating the impacts of climate change, the focus of developing disaster resilience and climate change is directed at increasing community resilience in the face of pandemics such as COVID-19. Increasing disaster resilience is more directed at improving the resilience of non-natural disaster systems through efforts for preparedness and disaster risk reduction and capacity building and institutional coordination. Policy directions to achieve these targets include increasing disaster and climate resilience through strengthening the convergence between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. The strategy to achieve this is disaster management through: (1) Strengthening data, information, monitoring potential geo-hydrometeorological disasters and early warning, and disaster literacy; (2) Strengthening disaster systems, regulations and governance; (3) Strengthening disaster risk reduction plans; (4) Improvement of infrastructure for disaster mitigation and management; (5) Integration of cooperation between regions; (6) Strengthening disaster emergency management; (7) Implementation of rehabilitation and reconstruction; (8) Strengthening the integrated multi-threat disaster mitigation system; and (9) Strengthening preparedness in disaster management; and (10) Increasing the development and innovation of alternative schemes for disaster management financing. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 238 In addition, efforts are also made to increase the synergy in the use of regional space, through development strategies: (a) Enforcement of spatial plans based on climate change mitigation and disaster risk reduction to ensure the protection of spatial functions and the prevention of negative impacts on the environment due to spatial use; and (b) Strengthening climate change mitigation and disaster management to reduce climate change and disaster risks; and increase resilience to climate change and disasters, especially in regional growth centers, urban areas and metropolitan cities. The main policies for developing disaster resilience in 2022 are prioritized on strengthening the system and early warning response to natural disasters (focusing on geological, tectonic, volcanic, hydrometeorological and environmental disasters) and non-natural disasters (focusing on preparedness in preventing the spread of infectious diseases/pandemic) . This is supported by efforts for preparedness and disaster risk reduction as well as capacity building and institutional coordination in the context of reforming (strengthening) the disaster resilience system. 239 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021240 Goal 16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions Reporting the progress of Goal 16 achievement in 2021 cannot be done without discussing about the COVID-19 global pandemic that has hit the world, including Indonesia. Goal 16 plays a vital role in the Government of Indonesia's efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigate its detrimental impacts through its three components: 1) access to justice for all, 2) peaceful and inclusive society for sustainable development, and 3) effective, accountable, and inclusive institution at all levels. Therefore, VNR 2021 is developed by situating Goal 16 as the enabler for other goals to succeed and achieving the national agenda to reform the disaster response (including social-health emergencies), health, social protection systems. Goal 16 is also placed to facilitate economic recovery toward Indonesia's green economy to achieve national resilience. As an enabler, the policies developed to support Goal 16, directly and indirectly, serve as prerequisites of Indonesia's development programs that leave no one behind. See Figure 4.135 below to understand better how Indonesia sees Goal 16 as an enabler as described above: Figure 4.135 Conceptual Framework of Goal 16 in Indonesia's Voluntary Review 2021Figure Error!

No text of specified style in document..136 Conceptual Framework of Goal 16 in Indonesia's Voluntary Review 2021 241 Goal 16 consists of ten targets and two cross- target sub-goals, all are interlinked, and the success or failure of one depends on those of the other. Since its Voluntary National Review 2019, the Government of Indonesia has conceptualized a comprehensive framework on Goal 16, which holistically describes how Indonesia places Goal 16 as a foundation to achieve all sustainable development goals in just and inclusive manners. The framework is still relevant for this Voluntary National Review 2021 because: First , the development and implementation of laws and policies based on evidence and free from corruption and discrimination must become the basis of development practices, including handling, recovery, and rehabilitation from the COVID-19 pandemic. Second , the evidence that became the basis for health, education, social-economic protection, legal aid, and livelihood programs, including as responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and other disasters, must come from a system that counts everyone and provides legal identity regardless of one's social-economic status, gender, capacity, religion, ethnicity, and various other social identities. To this end, the Voluntary National Review 2021 will highlight the civil registration system and population data management in Indonesia as the basis of social assistance distributions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Third , the development of policies and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic must ensure a readiness to mitigate the risk of violence against children, youth, women, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups. This Voluntary National Review will discuss the Government of Indonesia's policy to support more ethical evidence and use such data to develop more effective programs, including during the pandemic, Indonesia has witnessed an increasing risk of domestic violence, child marriage, and online bullying and exploitation. Fourth , law and policies, including during pandemic responses, must ease everyone's access to justice. This Voluntary National Review highlights the legal aid policies and adaptation of court services for poor and vulnerable people that maintain inclusive access for justice seekers during the pandemic. Fifth , the system must ensure public access to information to enable people to attain their rights and provide feedback to increase government services accountability. This is even more critical as the pandemic has shifted and limited the Government's priorities. At the same time, information regarding the pandemic evolves rapidly from day to day, from the scientific evidence on the disease itself to how to best respond to it at an individual and policy level. Related to that, the Voluntary National Review 2021 discusses the role of a freedom of press, community's monitoring initiative, and civil society's participation in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this section, the achievements of Goal 16 as an enabler will be organized through the three components of Goal 16. Each segment will look at trend analysis before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the section will discuss challenges, mitigations, and policy responses, particularly addressing the COVID-19 pandemic impacts. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 242 1. FOUNDATION FOR EFFECTIVE, ACCOUNTABLE, AND INCLUSIVE INSTITUTIONS AT ALL LEVEL A. REDUCING CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY IN ALL FORMS 1. Trend Analysis and Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic Corruption remains one of the biggest challenges in Indonesia that hinders the country from achieving optimal benefits from development, including economic growth. To measure society's awareness of corruptive behavior and the public's satisfaction and perception of the handling of corruption, the Government of Indonesia issued the Anti-Corruption Behavior Index ( Indeks Perilaku Anti Korupsi / IPAK). The index shows an increasing trend. In 2017, IPAK showed a score of 3.71, which went downward to 3.66 in 2018, yet rebounded in the subsequent two consecutive years at 3.7 in 2019, and 3.84 in 2020 (IPAK, Statistics Indonesia/BPS). On the other hand, in 2020, Indonesia's Corruption Perception Index ( Indeks Persepsi Korupsi /IPK) that Transparency International issued went back to 37/100 from the previous 40/100 in 2019. In comparison, the 2019 score was its highest achievement over the past 25 years, marked by a two-point increase compared to 2018. Unlike IPAK, IPK indicates some optimism in corruption handling reflected by the perception of strengthened law and policy, consistent enforcement, and stronger public trust. Table 4.8 Anti-Corruption Behavior Index (IPAK) and Corruption Perception Index of 2015-2020 INDEX 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Anti-Corruption Behavior Index 3.59 N/A 3.71 3.66 3.7 3.84 Corruption Perception Index 36 37 37 38 40 37 Source: Statistics Indonesia (BPS), Anti-Corruption Behavior Index (IPAK); Transparency International, Corruption Perception Index (IPK). Several studies show that vulnerable groups often have to bear disproportionate negative impacts of corruption compared to others. Vulnerable groups often rely more on public services as they had limited choices to access private services as an alternative (Peiffer & Rose, 2016). For children, corruption in the health sector led to the high child mortality rate caused by unequal coverage and health service quality (Hanf et al., 2011). This situation also contributed to the high rate of chronic disease patients among the elderly, particularly in low-income countries (Ferrari & Salustri, 2020). In the law enforcement sector, corruption hurdled women victims of violence in accessing protection and handling services as the services became suboptimal (UNDP, 2010). Finally, corruption in the natural resources sector brought about negative impacts to the ethnic groups. Natural resource exploitation through corrupt practices has caused significant environmental damage that might threaten the ethnic groups' survival (Transparency International, 2010). 243 2. Challenges and Actions to Overcome Corruption remains a risk during the pandemic. At the same time, many resources have been reallocated to respond to the health, economic, and social crises. The resource reallocations have decreased the corruption prevention and mitigation mechanism's coverage during the emergency. In addition, rapid action needed to respond to the pandemic might lead to a relaxation of procurement procedures. A study conducted by Transparency International (2020) and World Justice Project (2020a) confirmed the decrease of the state's capacity globally to prevent and address corruption. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the urgency to launch an immediate response to the emergency by loosening up public procurement procedures has increased the risk of corruption (World Justice Project, 2020b). Corruption is highly harmful to the responses against the pandemic, as it compromises public trust and deprives critical resources of those who need them (World Justice Project, 2020b). 3. Policy Response The Government of Indonesia recognized the need for improvements in corruption prevention and mitigation measures. Therefore, during this pandemic and the upcoming recovery phase, anti-corruption approaches such as bidder selection, cash flow tracking, and complaint and reporting mechanism must be consistently applied. In addition, the internal supervision mechanism must also be improved by maximizing the inspectorate's role in every government agency to conduct internal control, ensure good governance, and ensure that all activities associated with the state's finance are already under the prevailing regulation. COVID-19 has also urged the government to immediately conduct procurement to provide the necessary facilities and infrastructures for COVID-19 mitigation. To ensure that the goods and services procurement is still performed effectively, transparent, and accountable, adhering to the best value-for-money principle, the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) issued a guideline for goods and services budgeting to accelerate COVID-19 handling. B. DEVELOPING ACCOUNTABLE AND TRANSPARENT INSTITUTIONS AT ALL LEVELS Strengthening good governance mechanisms and practices will result in an accountable and transparent institution. An accountable and transparent institution will ensure that public service is run effectively. In addition, good governance practices will encourage citizens to monitor and hold the government responsible for any development measures. One of the good governance aspects is financial accountability. Financial accountability encourages accurate and timely reporting of public budget use, which is usually conducted through a report that has been professionally audited. The main goal is to ensure that the public fund is used following the designated purposes in efficient and effective manners. (Agere, 2000) 1. Trend Analysis and Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic In 2020, the budget realization rate was 94.55%, and a high score was obtained from the state financial audit (Ministry of Finance). INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 244 Table 4.9 Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Source: Ministry of Finance There has been a stable increase in government agencies that received 'Unqualified' (Wajar Tanpa Pengecualian/WTP) status from the state financial audit between 2014 to 2020 at various government levels. From 2014 to 2020, various provincial governments consistently ranked the highest in WTP percentage. Whereas district governments still ranked the lowest in their audit compared to the national, provincial, and city governments. Figure 4.136 Percentage of government agencies that received Unqualified (WTP) Status Source: The Audit Board of the Republic of Indonesia ( Badan Pemeriksa Keuangan /BPK) (The 2020 data would be available in the second semester of 2020) The Government of Indonesia commits to build a clear, orderly, effective, and efficient accountability system in the government's performance accountability system (SAKIP) as a form of accountability in managing resources and policy implementation entrusted to institutions. At the ministerial/agency level, the SAKIP percentage has increased from 92.77% in 2018 to 94.12% in 2019 and slightly decreased to 94.05% in 2020. At the provincial level, the SAKIP rate has increased from 94.12% in 2018 to 97.06% in 2019 and 2020. At the district/city level, the SAKIP was recorded to consistently increase from 46.85% in 2018 to 57.28% in 2019 and 62.80% in 2020 (The Ministry of State Apparatus Empowerment and Bureaucracy Reform). 245 Table 4.10 Percentage of Government Agencies with Government Agency's Performance Accountability System (SAKIP) Score B LEVEL 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Source: Ministry of State Apparatus Empowerment and Bureaucracy Reform In bureaucracy reform, Indonesia also records the bureaucracy reform percentage index at various levels. At the ministerial/agency level, there has been a consistent increase of bureaucracy reform index with score B from 93.98% in 2018 to 95.29% in 2019 and 96.39% in 2020. Constant improvement has also taken place at the provincial level, with the bureaucracy reform index in 2018 reaching 70.59%, which later increased to 73.53% in 2019 and 88.24% in 2020. However, a different situation occurred in the bureaucracy reform index at the district/city level that recorded growth from 11.22% in 2018 to 25.20% in 2019, yet declined in 2020 to 24.80%. In public service, Ombudsman Indonesia is responsible for assessing government agencies' compliance to the designated standards in the Public Service Law. At the national level (ministry), the compliance level tends to fluctuate. The public service compliance was 52.50% in 2016 and decreasing to 35% in 2017. In 2018, the compliance level increased to 46.15% before declining in 2019 to 28.57%. At the provincial level, there was a significant increase from 27.27% in 2017 to 62.5% in 2018, followed by a decline to 33.3% in 2019. At the city level, there was an increase from 29.09% in 2017 to 36.73% in 2018, followed by a decline to 33.3% in 2019. Despite all the falls, district-level agencies showed consistent positive growth from 12.15% in 2017 to 31.66% in 2018 and 33.02% in 2019 (Ombudsman Indonesia, 2019).Figure 4.137 Percentage of Government Institutions with Bureaucracy Reform Index B Source: Ministry of State Apparatus Empowerment and Bureaucracy Reform INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 246 Figure Error!

Challenges and Actions to Overcome Handling the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigating its adverse impacts, providing rapid service to ensure safety, recovery, and governance that is inclusive, responsive, and accountable is the foundation for carrying out pandemic responses and preparing for a prevention system to reduce inequality. Figure 4.139 Flow of Inclusion, Response, and Accountability of COVID-19 Pandemic Handling 247 The public services have been facing a lot of challenges since the COVID-19 outbreak. A community survey shows that public service institutions have implemented health protocols such as social distancing, handwashing, temperature check, and mask-wearing (Statistics Indonesia, 2020). However, there are still challenges in enforcing health protocol in public transport and dense settlement, which significantly increased the risk exposure of the local community, particularly the vulnerable. One of the most vital public services during the pandemic is social assistance and protection services. Based on the SMERU survey (2021), 85.3% of households have received cash and non-cash social assistance, and 50.8% have received cash assistance. Of all the households at the bottom 40% of expenditure distribution, 90% have received at least one assistance, and more than 60% have received cash assistance (SMERU, 2021). On the other hand, the community has different perceptions of social protection services during the pandemic. There are significant differences in perception regarding social assistance's match and distribution received by age group (LDUI & INFID, 2020). In addition, social assistance during the pandemic cannot only depend on the definition of poverty. Social assistance distribution needs to consider vulnerabilities that have been made worse by the pandemic (PUSKAPA, Bappenas, UNICEF, and KOMPAK, 2020). The existing data underlined that more than half of disability groups have not received social protection packages yet during the economic crisis (MAHKOTA, 2020). Another data source shows that less than 40% of women with disabilities could access development and social protection programs during the pandemic (HWDI, 2020). Civil society's participation in creating an accountable government is also hindered by the pandemic, which impacts are genuinely felt by the CSOs. INFID (2020) shows that CSO's facilitation activities became constrained due to the social restriction policy. The study concluded that its high dependency on donor funding caused barriers experienced by CSOs during the pandemic. From consultation conducted with the youth, it was found out that the facilitation undertaken by the youth group for victims of violence with special needs had been significantly affected by the pandemic. Since they had to prioritize health protocol, facilitations for blind and deaf people were restricted by the limited access to digital technology that could ensure physical distancing while facilitating their special needs. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 248 BOX 4.28 FINDING THE HIDDEN: COMMUNITY FACILITATION TO ENSURE THAT SOCIAL ASSISTANCE LEAVES NO ONE BEHIND During the COVID-19 pandemic, social assistance became critical to support the recovery of vulnerable people and their families. The pandemic response's effectiveness that requires a behavioral change of the community depends on how the government can mitigate their vulnerabilities. The government should fulfil the basic needs of vulnerable people to ensure the smooth running of the health protocol. Social assistance coverage is also essential to facilitate testing, tracing, and treatment (3T) to curb the pandemic's spread. However, the 3T has caused anxiety among the vulnerable people, who worried that they would lose their daily income and job. This is where social assistance comes into play to mitigate it. Unfortunately, the existing social assistance has not reached out to all the vulnerable. The Women Headed Family Empowerment Foundation (PeKKA) is a non-government agency that focuses on poverty alleviation and justice for vulnerable groups. It took the initiative to monitor the implementation of government social assistance programs during the pandemic. Through its cadres in 20 provinces, PeKKA collected community data in 90 villages to identify the barriers to social assistance distribution. Through this activity, they found vulnerable people that had not been registered as beneficiary and were hidden from the outreach of various programs. Some of them had not even received any kind of assistance, while others had mobility constraints due to old age or disability. These factors made it challenging for them to access services outside of their homes. Based on the findings gathered from community facilitation, PeKKA cadres submitted recommendations to the village government in each beneficiary location. They shared complete data of the vulnerable people who were not registered yet in the system, gave some recommendations to improve the social assistance distribution system, and improved the social assistance beneficiary data. Until this story was authored, the evidence-based advocacy at the village level conducted by PeKKA had managed to include ten more household heads to the social assistance beneficiary list. Ten might not be a significant number for many. However, under the \"no one left behind\" principle, now ten vulnerable households managed to benefit from the social assistance that they deserve.

Policy Response The Government of Indonesia admitted that efforts to improve the country's institutional governance and public service must be further boosted, including ensuring readiness and inclusiveness in the post-pandemic era. The Government Work Plan of 2021 stated that one of the priority programs to strengthen the stability in politics, law, defense, and security ( Polhukhankam ) sectors and ensure public service transformation is bureaucracy and governance reform. Bureaucracy and governance reform will increase the percentage of government agencies that score Good and Beyond in the Bureaucracy Reform Index. By the Regulation of the Minister of State Apparatus Empowerment and Bureaucracy Reform Number 26/2020 on Guideline for Evaluation of Bureaucracy Reform Implementation, several targets to strengthen government agencies' accountability have been set forth, which include: 1) increase of leadership and staff's commitment to performance, which goes beyond routine; 2) increase of ministry/agency/local government's capacity in managing organization's performance; 3) increase of ministry/agency/local government's capacity in implementing the appropriate strategy to achieve the organization's goal; 4) increase of effectiveness and efficiency of ministry/agency/local government's budget use. In addition, the regulation also governs the targets of the public service quality improvement, which aims to increase public service quality in each ministry/agency/local government to the point that meets the society's need and expectation. The targets of the program are 1) increased public service quality (faster, cheaper, safer, and more reachable) in ministry/agency/local government; 2) increased number of service units that meet international service standards in ministry/agency/local government; 3) increased community's satisfaction indices to the public service administered by ministry/agency/local government. C. GUARANTEEING PUBLIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PROTECTING FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOM The Government of Indonesia has ratified the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) through Law No. 12/2005. Article 19 of the covenant stated that everyone should have the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds. The ratification explicitly shows Indonesia's commitment to respect and guarantee the rights enshrined in the covenant, including remedy for any violated rights. Through Article 28F of the 1945 Constitution, the Government of Indonesia also recognized the right to receive information as a human right. This recognition was further strengthened by Law Number 14/2008 on Public Information Disclosure that specifies that public information disclosure and civil freedom are absolute prerequisites to run a democratic state and build a conducive situation to fulfill human rights. The press and public information management agency's role also becomes crucial and must be supported to protect and increase the quality of public information disclosure and civil freedom. 1. Trend Analysis and Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic In 2020, the Press Freedom Index Survey ( Indeks Kemerdekaan Pers /IKP) recorded an increase from the previous four years. The press freedom in Indonesia was categorized as relatively free, scoring at 75.27 or a 1.56-point increase compared to 2019, which was 73.71. Press Freedom Index is defined by several aspects, including violence against journalists, mass media business factors, etc. In 2020, the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) reported 84 violent incidents against journalists (AJI, 2020). Verbal intimidation by public officials, damaging equipment or data from news coverage, and physical violence was the most frequent violence experienced by journalists throughout 2020 (AJI, 2020). INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 250 Figure 4.140 Press Freedom Index (IKP) of 2016-2020 Source: National Press Council On transparency, Indonesia still works to ensure public institutions' compliance since promulgating Law No.14/2008 on Public Information Disclosure. The Central Information Commission ( Komisi Informasi Pusat /KIP) recorded an increase in public agencies qualified as 'informative' from 34 in 2019 to 60 in 2020. The figures represented the proportion of public agencies that fulfilled their duties, including providing public information and managing and documenting public information.

At least from 2018 to 2019, KIP issued the vexatious request policy that directed dispute settlement for public information toward mediation and/or non-litigation adjudication for public information requests without goodwill. Another source shows that based on the survey on public access to information throughout 2018, 34 information requests were fully granted, and four were partially granted in Indonesia (UNESCO, 2020). Table 4.11 Number of public information dispute settlement through mediation and/or non-litigation adjudication 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Amount 123 94 54 32 1.280 350 76 Source: Central Information Commission (KIP) 2. Challenges and Actions to Overcome Challenges around press freedom were one of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) (2017) concerns, as highlighted by the Press Council and AJI's reports. Albeit IKP noted an increase, several barriers for press freedom implementation in Indonesia still occurred, such as pressure from the press company owner to the editorial board--including in determining the media's political direction, local government's intervention toward the news content, and violence against journalists in the political year of 2019 (Press Council, 2020). The issue of press well-being also rose during the pandemic. A study involving media workers shows that COVID-19 caused economic impacts for most respondents (83.5%) (IFJ, 2020). Furthermore, more than one in every three media workers were not equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) in doing their job during the pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government's responsibility to provide accurate public information in health crisis handling, financial budgeting, policymaking, provision of public goods and services, and economy became even more critical than ever (UNESCO, 2020). Public information disclosure is a crucial part of ensuring the effectiveness and accountability of government programs and policies. However, various challenges came in the way to achieve public information disclosure, such as public agency's reluctance to share information without any clear mandate, lack of implementing guideline, unavailable data, inaccurate data, time and cost, and lack of supervisory mechanism (World Bank, 2015; Lubis, Kusumasari, Hakim, 2018). In addition, the fact that many information requests were not made with good intentions had made public agencies have difficulty selecting them, hence taking even more time (Greiling & Spraul, 2010). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenge grows, mainly because they have to ensure reliability, accuracy, and completeness of the information regarding response toward pandemic (UNESCO, 2020a). Since the outbreak and throughout 2020, there have been special needs for information on pandemic and application of health protocol. CSOs' monitoring shows that information on health protocol is available, but only in certain areas, such as in education and public transport (Tempo & INFID, 2020). The data from the people with disability organizations (DPOs) show that 59.40% of respondents with sensory disability (deaf and blind) said that media had not provided sufficient access to information on the COVID-19 (Bappenas, 2020a). INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 252 3. Policy Response The Government of Indonesia recognized the need to improve public access to information and civil freedom, including during emergencies such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In the Medium-Term Development Plan of 2020-2024, the increase of public information disclosure quality is incorporated into the domestic political development policies, which will be carried out through the following strategies: 1) strengthening of integration of public information and communication governance in Ministry/Agency/Local Government; 2) strengthening of local and alternative media as community's sources of information; 3) providing quality, well-spread, and just public information content, particularly for communities living in the frontier, outermost, and least developed areas (3T); 4) increasing human resources quality in communication and informatics; 5) increasing access to public communication; 6) increasing media literacy; 7) developing standardization for press and journalist organizations, and 8) increasing quality of content or broadcast program. Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the public information and communication management by the ministry/agency or local government is not well integrated. The access to and content of information is not yet equal and just. To improve the situation, in the Government's Work Plan (RKP) of 2021, the Government will strengthen socialization and information dissemination programs that are equal (reach everyone) and fair regarding COVID-19 development, handling, and recovery through various media at the national and local levels. 2. FOUNDATION OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR ALL A. ENSURING THE STATE'S RULE OF LAW AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR ALL The Government of Indonesia recognized that people could fall into poverty when they experience shocks in their lifetime. The shock might be caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and other emergencies related to natural disasters, climate change, or legal disputes. 1. Trend Analysis and Impacts of the COVID-19 PandemicWhen they have to undergo a legal process, poor and vulnerable people often have to do it without sufficient legal support to protect their rights. However, from 2015 to 2020, legal aid organizations that received the legal aid budget had provided 54.213 litigation supports for the poor in total. Legal aid organizations also conducted legal coaching and socialization that reached dozens of thousands of vulnerable individuals through 13,091 activities (BPHN/National Law Development Agency). The provision of litigation and non-litigation legal support, although fluctuating, shows a tendency to increase the number of poor people receiving legal aid assistance from 2015 to 2019. Even in the midst of a pandemic, the percentage of poor people receiving litigation legal aid to all the poor people who requested litigation legal aid has increased from 77% in 2019 to 89% in the year 2020. 253 Figure 4.142 Number of litigation and non-litigation legal aid beneficiary Source: Ministry of Law and Human Rights: National Law Development Agency (BPHN) Legal services were also provided for poor people in courts, according to the Supreme Court Regulation 1 of 2014. Legal services in the courts include out-of-court trial, proceeding cost exemption, and legal aid post. Since 2015, around 100% of poor people who applied for legal aids were assisted, albeit the proceeding cost exemption decreased in 2019 and 2020. Table 4.12 Percentage of poor people receiving legal services, including out-of-court trial, proceeding cost exemption, and legal aid post SERVICE 2015*) 2016 2017 2018 data only involves state administration, military, and religious courts) Based on the data from National Commission on Violence Against Women's ( Komnas Perempuan ) service provider partners, in 2020, most of the victims were referred to legal aid services ( Komnas Perempuan , 2021). The referral also depends on the availability of service in partner organizations and the victims' demand and needs ( Komnas Perempuan , 2021). This finding, however, should be taken with a grain of salt, as the survey had a low response level (16%). Subsequently, from 2015 to 2019, it was reported that there were a small number of detainees that had surpassed the maximum detainment period allowed by the law, at 6.63% in 2014, 3.22% in 2015, 2.94% in 2016, 3.34% in 2017, 3.63% in 2018, 1,68% in 2019 and in 2020. (Directorate General of Penitentiary). INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 254 Although it is not directly related to the fact that some maximum detainment period had been surpassed, the facility overcrowding was identified as one of the risk factors of COVID-19 spread. It has put inmates and detainees in vulnerable situations (Simpson et al., 2019). In March 2020, 42% of penitentiary facilities in Indonesia, which 178,228 adults inhabited, were overcrowded (Directorate General of Penitentiary, 2020). In May 2020, 1,660 children still underwent their detainment or imprisonment sentences (PUSKAPA, Bappenas, and UNICEF, 2020). Therefore, the Government of Indonesia decided to do some early release to mitigate further COVID-19 spread in detention centers and prisons. In June 2020, Indonesia released 992 children, half of the children in detention and imprisonment (UNICEF, 2020). Furthermore, in March 2020, there were 14,512 adult women and 53 girls in detention and prison facilities. The number decreased in December 2020 to 12,675 adult women and 19 girls (Directorate General of Penitentiary, 2020). Meanwhile, the decreasing number of adult men and elderly detainees and inmates is not yet available. To measure access to justice, Bappenas and the Civil Society Consortium developed an Access to Justice Index for the first. Access to Justice Index measures several elements, including the prevalence of legal problems, legal framework, problem settlement mechanism, legal aid, quality of legal problem settlement, results of legal problem settlement, and community's ability (Civil Society Consortium for Access to Justice, 2019). The assessment outcome shows a score of 69.6, which indicates that access to justice is available but not inclusive in meeting the community's need to access justice (Civil Society Consortium for Access to Justice, 2019). 2. Challenges and Actions to Overcome The Government of Indonesia recognized that the legal aid budget policy must be in line with monitoring and improving access to and quality of legal aid, both litigation and non-litigation ones. This includes the availability of budget and infrastructure supports to facilitate the special need of persons with disabilities, children, women, and the elderly who need legal assistance. There must be more data available by area distribution, type of case, age of suspect and victim, the special need of the suspect and victim, and facilitation results. On the other hand, the facilitation data needs to be given context by regularly assessing the community's legal needs. This will enable a more comprehensive analysis of the accuracy and effectiveness of legal aid in Indonesia. Legal aid policy consideration also needs to take into account the challenges that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several legal aid institutions such as LBHM, LBH Apik, LBH Jakarta, and LBH Pers reported the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on face-to-face facilitation, mainly due to social distancing (LBHM, 2020). LBH Masyarakat reported that legal aid seekers also had trouble accessing digital legal aid due to internet connection issues (LBHM, 2020). In addition, LBH Apik informed that women victims of domestic violence often lived in the same house with the perpetrator, hindering service providers from providing legal consultation (LBHM, 2020). Whereas, studies found that before the pandemic, communities opted to get legal aid from individual who did not have professional capacities, such as family, neighborhood (RT) head, or religious leaders, and usually settled their issue amicably, which indicated the lack of legal aid's role that the government had provided and recognized (IJRS, 2020). Open access to court decisions from Supreme Court is a very positive initial step. Through court rulings, analyses can be carried out to look at the characteristics of the case. However, Indonesia still needs to strengthen its court decisions' quality, availability, and indexing. Rulings must be made more standardized and include variables on the availability of legal 255 representation, hearing taken place in mobile courts, court fee waiver, and assistances from the court's legal aid post. In addition, there needs to be a more comprehensive data confidentiality protocol in uploading and opening public access to court rulings. This is particularly important for cases involving children and other vulnerable groups. Early release as a COVID-19 mitigation measure shows that this strategy works to reduce over-population effectively. However, it can be implemented only with additional support and facilitation for the released inmates, particularly to help them finding employment. COVID-19 pandemic has closed much of the employment opportunities. The situation faced by former inmates is even more difficult due to their status. This is especially true as the policy package launched by the government to reduce the number of unemployment, which is the Pre-Work Program, did not include the released inmates as a target beneficiary. Indonesia has successfully applied the concluding observation recommendations from the Convention of Rights of Children (CRC) Indonesia (2014) by guaranteeing that detention will only be used as the last resort and that it will seek detention alternative mechanism through Law No. 11/2012 on Juvenile Justice System (SPPA). However, a recommendation is not granted yet, increasing the criminal liability age to 14 years old. In addition, based on the recommendation from HR Periodic Report/UPR (2017), Indonesia also needs to strengthen the Criminal Procedural Law (KUHAP) to ensure the protection of women and guarantee follow-up against any suspected violence against children in detention. 3. Policy Response In 2020, Indonesia issued various policies to achieve Goal 16 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The government issued policies to allow trials by teleconference to attain optimal, effective, efficient, and safe results. The government considers that law enforcement must go in line with the rights of suspects, defendants, victims, witnesses, and the general public, including assessing the health risk that might occur due to the pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic has also forced the judicial system to adapt. One of the responses conducted by the law enforcement to prevent COVID-19 spread was by facilitating online trial through the Cooperation Agreement between the Supreme Court, Prosecution Office, and Ministry of Law and Human Rights Number 402/DJU/HM.01.1/4/2020, Decision Number 17/E/EJP/04/2020, Number PAS-08.HH.05.05 on Trial by Teleconference. Through this agreement, the court, prosecution office, and the Ministry of Law and Human Rights agreed to support each other in implementing online trials. The cooperation agreement was then followed up by the Supreme Court, which issued the Supreme Court Regulation Number 4/2020 on Electronic Court Administration and Trial of Criminal Case that governs in more detail the criminal trial mechanism. To expand the vulnerable group's access to court services, the Government of Indonesia issued policies that mandated law enforcement officers to provide decent accommodation for persons with disabilities in the judicial process. The decent accommodation shall at least meet several conditions, including non-discriminatory treatment; fulfillment of safety and comfort; effective communication; fulfillment of information on persons with disability and progress of judicial process; provision of remote audio-visual communication facilities; provision of persons with disability examination standards, and legal service provision standards; and provision of assistant and/or interpreter for People with disabilities. The government also issued policies to release adult and child inmates through assimilation and integration programs (UNICEF, 2020). The policy considered that prison had become one INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 256 of the sites with high COVID-19 spread due to its overpopulation and inadequate sanitation facility, making it challenging to keep distance and apply hygiene and a healthy lifestyle. The Directorate General of Corrections (DGC) developed the Guideline and related Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on the prevention and management of Covid-19 in Indonesia`s prison facilities, tailoring existing knowledge and expertise from UNODC, ICRC, and WHO to the national context. The regulatory framework was synchronised to the health standard`s put forward by the Ministry of Health, thereby connecting the prison system to the COVID-19 response at national level. Expeditious dissemination of the Guidelines and SOPs to over 525 prison facilities across the country in the first half of 2020 help to defuse sings of panic, anxiety and agitation identified in several prisons. DGC`s Early Warning System developed in 2019 proved valuable in this regard, and also benefitted the early identification and care of both prisoners with health symptoms and those considered to be particularly vulnerable in prison. To respond to the outbreak, the government instructed to intensify the use of alternative detention, such as home detention or city detention, to minimize incarceration in the crowded penitentiary, increasing the risk of virus spread. The government learned and adapted new ways to use information technology to conduct supervision and coaching on adult and child inmates who received assimilation and integration programs that had never been performed before. The government`s policy on early release and assimilation and integration programme were being presented by the Minister of Law and Human Rights at a high-level side event at the UN Crime Congress held in Kyoto in March 2021. The policy has been well appreciated by other countries or member states that attended the forum. Regarding the protection of children in conflict with the law, the Government of Indonesia has issued a policy that governs the rights of children victims and witnesses. In addition to getting their basic rights as victims and witnesses, through this policy, the Government of Indonesia intends to ensure that children victims and witnesses can get medical and social rehabilitation services both within and outside the institution; guarantee of physical, mental, and social security; and ease in obtaining information on the progress of their case. The Government of Indonesia also planned to create access to justice in 2021 through 1) optimization of the electronic-based facility and infrastructure used in case handling process in the judicial system; 2) optimization of alternative case settlement and detention suspension; 3) optimization of assimilation and reintegration of the former inmates to reduce prison over-density. Through its Government Work Plan (RKP) of 2021, the Government of Indonesia is prioritizing governance improvement to address COVID-19 impacts, particularly in recovering economic resilience and community life. The Government of Indonesia also emphasized the importance of law enforcement to cut off the COVID-19 spread. Governance improvement to achieve Goal 16 is carried out by disseminating information on COVID-19 handling through various national and local media. In addition, electronic voting technology to facilitate elections is developed. B. PROVIDING LEGAL IDENTITY FOR ALL, INCLUDING BIRTH CERTIFICATE Legal identity is a state's recognition of an individual's existence before the law. The World Bank (2016) identified three outputs of the legal identity ownership: 1) inclusion in basic services; 2) implementation of effective and efficient public services, transparent policies, and improved governance; and 3) more accurate measurement of development achievement. Therefore, access to legal identity is critical to facilitate the achievement of other development goals as a vehicle for the government to identify, plan and distribute services effectively (Dahan & Gelb, 2015). 257 In Indonesia, legal identity ownership signifies the registration of an individual in the population database, which indirectly guarantees access to various basic services such as health, education, and social assistance (Duff, Kusumaningrum, & Stark, 2016; Jackson, Duff, Agastya, 2016; Sumner & Kusumaningrum, 2014). In addition, the absence of legal identity will make it more difficult for justice seekers to access legal aid or dispute settlement mechanism in court (Legal Aid Law and Government Regulation on Provision of Legal Aid and Legal Aid Fund Distribution). 1. Trend Analysis and Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic In Indonesia, 88.11% of children (aged 0-17) have obtained birth certificates in 2020, a 2.1 point percent increase from 2019. Consecutively since 2015, the coverage of birth certificate ownership among the child population has steadily increased every year, respectively 79.92% (2015), 81.68% (2016), 83.33% (2018), and 86.01% in 2019 (Susenas). Birth certificates coverage among children under-five is 72.7% in 2015, 72.5% in 2016, 73% in 2017, 72.12% in 2018, and 74.6% in 2019. On the other hand, birth certificates coverage for children under one-year old is 53.4% in 2015, 50.7% in 2016, 53.8% in 2017, 51.79% in 2018, 55.29% in 2019, and 58.03% in 2020. Figure 4.143 Birth Certificate Ownership Trend based on Age Groups Source: National Social Economic Survey (Susenas), Statistics Indonesia (BPS)A deeper analysis of Susenas data by region shows that the percentage of birth certificate ownership in rural area was lower than in urban area from 2015 to 2019.

Based on the Population Administration Law, NIK is issued when an individual is born in Indonesia, supposedly with a birth certificate. It is a gate to various other legal identity documents and public services that can support an individual's well-being. Furthermore, legal identity is a prerequisite for individuals to access and practice their civil and political rights. In Indonesia, NIK ownership is close to universal. In 2020, the proportion of NIK ownership in Indonesia was 96.01% (Susenas, Statistics Indonesia). Nevertheless, the 2020 progress must be interpreted in the context of the 2020 Susenas (National Social Economic Survey), which was conducted during the pandemic, using the 2020 Population Census as its basis. Meanwhile, the first round of the 2020 Population Census was conducted by referring to the population who owned NIK. Thus, the 2020 Susenas might represent various data collection limitations experienced by the Government of Indonesia and only described the documented population. Table 4.13 Ownership of Citizen Registration Number (NIK) of 2017-2020 by age group in Indonesia AGE GROUPS 2017 2018 2019 2020 All Statistics Indonesia/BPS, Susenas 2. Challenges and Actions to Overcome The NIK as citizens' identity in Indonesia is utilized to validate social assistance beneficiaries. Not all beneficiaries have NIK during the pandemic or registered in the Population Administration System (SIAK), hindering the distribution of assistance to beneficiaries (PUSKAPA and KOMPAK, 2020). In June 2020, it was found out that some social assistance beneficiaries in Indonesia did not have any NIK (Purnamawati, 2020). Furthermore, the social assistance beneficiary data was not in harmony with the population data, leaving some rightful beneficiaries such as family members overlooked. Inappropriate population registration and documentation hindered the effective distribution of assistance and emergency responses plan (PUSKAPA, Bappenas, UNICEF, and KOMPAK, 2020). NIK registration is based on birth registrations. Children from the poorest household still experience barriers in birth registration. For children from households of the lowest income and consumption quintile, the birth certificate between children aged 0-17 only reached 80.87% in 2020 (Susenas). The birth registration trend for children under five and one-year-old is running slowly. Only 77.2% of children under five own a birth certificate in 2020 (Susenas). 259 Further analysis of Susenas data according to the regions shows that the percentage of birth certificate ownership in the rural area is lower than in the urban area. This gap can be observed from the estimated children's birth certificate ownership province. The 2019 Susenas data shows that children's birth certificate ownership was highest in Yogyakarta (98%), a stark contrast to Papua as the lowest one with 46% (KPPPA, 2020). Recommendations to UPR (2017) and concluding observations of CRC (2014) and CEDAW (2012) suggested Indonesia issue birth certificates for every child without exception for free. Indonesia has ensured free birth certificate issuance through the Population Administration Law. However, the country still needs to address other barriers that occur when trying to access birth certificates. The existing studies show that various barriers limit community's access to birth certificates, such as unaffordable service, cost incurred from the application process, complicated procedure, and the high possibility for children from parents with disabilities to not have a birth certificate compared to those whose parents are without disability (Duff, Kusumaningrum, & Stark, 2016; Sumner & Kusumaningrum, 2014). During the pandemic, the barrier will make it even more difficult for those who have never been registered to access basic services (PUSKAPA, Bappenas, UNICEF, and KOMPAK, 2020). Various studies also underlined the link between the provision of social assistance and legal identity, particularly related to the risks of exclusion (Chudnovsky & Peeters, 2021; IFRC, 2018). During the pandemic, the Government of Indonesia has attempted to transfer the civil and population registration to the online domain. Since mid-March 2020, the Directorate General of Population and Civil Registration (Dukcapil/Civil Registry) has mandated the registry offices through its circular (443.1/2978/Dukcapil) across Indonesia to prioritize online services. Several dukcapil offices have interpreted this directive into their technical guidelines, such as the Registry Office of Kulon Progo, Pacitan, and Bener Meriah Districts. BOX 4.29 STRIVING FOR FULFILLMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITY After serving the poor and vulnerable groups for over ten years, Yayasan Pondok Kasih (YPK) realized that poverty alleviation efforts require the fulfillment of rights to a legal identity document, such as an ID Card, marriage, and birth certificate. The lack of access to legal identity might hinder access to education, health, social services, and employment and business opportunities. The situation is more difficult for households in rural areas and isolated islands.. Therefore, since 2001, YPK has been conducting a series of mass marriage and assisted several families in registering the birth of their members. In 2013 and 2015, YPK held cross-religion mass marriage for 4,541 and 5,150 couples, respectively, and provided birth certificates for their children. YPK collaborated with the Ministry of Social Affairs to integrate INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 260 this activity into the National Solidarity Day (HKSN) every year in Jakarta (2015), Palangkaraya (2016), East Java (2017), Gorontalo (2018), and Banjarmasin (2019). In addition, YPK also collaborated with the Coordinating Ministry of Human and Cultural Development (Kemenko PMK) for PMK Community Service (Bhakti PMK) activity in Kaimana (2016). In carrying out such activities, YPK built a partnership with various partners, particularly the national and local governments, business sector, NGOs, youth, religious leaders, and community leaders. On the HKSN commemoration day of 2019, YPK assisted the registration of marriage certificate and birth certificate in Tabalong, Balangan, Hulu Sungai Selatan, Tapin, Banjar Districts, and Banjarmasin City. The activity has successfully resulted in the issuance of 3,570 marriage certificates and 192 birth certificates. Furthermore, in 2019, YPK team also assisted the community in Nias Island, supported the issuance of 3,144 birth certificates. YPK kept continuing the activity in 2020 during the pandemic, although in a limited manner, by adhering to the health protocols. The facilitation process included socialization to the villages in collaboration with the PKK (Family/Women Welfare Program) and local partners to collect data, write down, and submit the form for a birth certificate, application and coordination with Registry Office, and hand over the certificate to the applicant. The YPK team conducted the facilitation in Palembang through a free mobile hospital and the Indonesian Movement for Administrative Awareness (Gerakan Indonesia Sadar Administrasi/GISA). In 2020, YPK successfully assisted the community in six sub-districts in Palembang and supported 750 population documents. YPK realized that such achievements were not sufficient to address the gap in birth certificate ownership. YPK has been consistently promoting similar practice intensively, including the strategies for immediate birth registration. In addition, YPK called for a consistent national campaign and local government to actively provide mobile service for reaching out to all segments of communities that need it.

Policy Response Improving the civil registration and population data management system has always been the commitment of the Government of Indonesia. At the end of 2019, the President issued a Presidential Regulation Number 62/2019 on the National Strategy for Population Administration Acceleration for Vital Statistics Development. The Presidential Regulation serves as a guideline for the national and local governments to accelerate the vital registration services. Furthermore, the policy is also the basis for developing vital statistics that will be used for improving basic services and development plans in various sectors. The Government of Indonesia has also issued multiple policies. The Ministry of Home Affairs, for instance, has simplified registration procedures and more actively reached out to the population through mobile and integrated service. The progress, however, must be further supported by the Government by providing all civic documents for all citizens, from birth certificate to death certificate, which will serve as the basis to complete the population data and support population health, as well as provide security for the family that is left 261 behind. A robust civil and population registration system is critical to cope with and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic (UN Legal Identity Agenda Task Force, 2020; World Justice Project, 2020). As such, the Government of Indonesia has also recognized that the strategy for the national health system, social protection, and disaster resilience must be based upon proper organizing of population data. Bappenas policy paper highlights civil registration systems reform as a necessary policy action (PUSKAPA, UNICEF, BAPPENAS, and KOMPAK, 2020). In the health sector, Bappenas also stated that the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted the national health reform. One of the eight key areas of national health reform is health financing, which has been carried out through strengthening the National Health Insurance (JKN) program. JKN aims to provide universal health and support COVID-19 recovery efforts for everyone. To achieve such a target, JKN must be backed by a reliable population data system. The efforts to fix the data include strengthening the registration mechanism of all populations without exception, ensuring accountable data management, and population administrative data sharing for planning basic services, protection, justice, and other public sector-related purposes. 3. FOUNDATION FOR PEACEFUL AND INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT A. REDUCING ALL FORMS OF VIOLENCE, INCLUDING VIOLENCE AND TORTURE AGAINST CHILDRE N Violence against children, women and vulnerable groups not only bring long-term adverse impacts to the victims (Walker et al., 2011; Gartland et al., 2019). The slow responses toward violence against vulnerable groups reflect the state's weakness in enacting the law and human rights (Hayati, Emmelin, & Eriksson, 2014; Stark et al., 2012). Therefore, the Government of Indonesia made a long-term commitment to increasing the life quality, well-being, and child protection in various development sectors; decrease the number of violence, exploitation, and discrimination against children; and strengthen the child institution and network at national and local levels (National Long-Term Development Plan of 2005-2025). 1. Trend Analysis and Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic To measure the prevalence of violence against children and women, the Government of Indonesia has allocated a significant budget and carried out National Women Life Experience Survey (SPHPN) in 2016 and the National Children and Adolescents Life Experience Survey (SNPHAR) 2018. Both cross-sectional studies found that violence against children and violence against women were severe problems that had affected many women and children. One in every three women aged 15-64 have experienced physical or sexual violence throughout their lifetime (SPHPN, 2016). Furthermore, SNPHAR (2018) found that 62% of girls and 61.7% of boys aged 13-17 have experienced violence. The government is currently analyzing the data from both studies to obtain information on the causes, risks, and protective factors to inform programs and policies. One form of violence against children is child marriage. The Government of Indonesia recorded that child (young girl) marriage prevalence from 2015 to 2018 were 12.14%, 11.11%, 11.54%, 11.21% consecutively (Bappenas, Statistics Indonesia/ BPS, PUSKAPA & UNICEF, 2020). Another group vulnerable to violence is the elderly. BPS/Statistics Indonesia (2020) recorded that 0.97% of the elderly became victims of crime in 2020. These elderly victims experienced theft (88.11%), theft with violence (1.42%), abuse (1%), and sexual harassment (0.45%) (Statistics Indonesia/BPS, 2020). Further INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 262 analysis shows that the percentage of elderly victims who were PwD was higher (1%) compared to the non-disability ones (0.8%) (Statistics Indonesia/BPS, 2020). In addition, the elderly from the 20% top expenditure group experienced more crime (1.5%) than those from the 40% bottom expenditure group (0.63%) (Statistics Indonesia/BPS, 2020). Statistics Indonesia/BPS (2020a) also reported that 1.14% of youth (aged 16-who became crime victims in 2020. The crimes experienced by the youth in 2020 included theft (80.12%), theft with violence (2.98%), abuse (5.24%), and sexual harassment (1.84%) (Statistics Indonesia/BPS, 2020a). Indonesia is still developing an integrated database mechanism from the ministries and agencies handling trafficking in person. Due to its complexities, reliable data is the first step toward establishing effective policies and responses. As one of the effort to prevent and handle the trafficking in person cases, Indonesia has established the Anti-Trafficking Task Force (ATTF), an inter-ministerial and inter-agency coordination center, since 2008 through the Presidential Regulation 69 of 2008. Indonesia also launched the National Action Plan to Eliminate Trafficking in Person for 2015-2019. The Ministry of Women Empowerment and Child Protection, as the daily chair of the National Anti-Trafficking Task Force, in 2019 has developed a technical guidance for government and non-government actors on the data collection and reporting of trafficking in persons cases. However, its nationwide implementation still needs to be supported. From 2016-2020, IOM supported comprehensive efforts of the Government of Indonesia in preventing and handling Trafficking in Persons (TIP) in Indonesia through the \"3P Approach\" - Prevention, Protection, and Prosecution. In collaboration with government and civil society partners, 837 trafficking survivors were assisted and empowered through enhanced referral mechanisms, and whole-of society approaches were strengthened through capacitation of ATTF at the national and sub-national level. 2. Challenges and Actions to Overcome The recommendations from the concluding observation of CEDAW (2012) and CRC (2014) urged the Government of Indonesia to collect data on violence against women and children, and develop strategies to provide complaint service and facility for children victims of violence. Some improvement has been recorded from the data generated in SPHPN (2016) and SNPHAR (2018). However, it is still challenging to regularly obtain the complete picture of violence against children and women in Indonesia. On the service side, various service mechanisms have been available, yet not all functions correctly. The services are still below optimal due to the absence of Standard Operating Procedures for service and referral in all places, limited human resources' quantity and quality, and limited coverage of the service, especially to handle cases down to community level. In addition, various efforts for violence prevention and handling have not targeted vulnerable groups, such as persons with disability or children, youth, and women who don't live in traditional household settings (Bappenas, 2020). During the pandemic, mobility restriction to mitigate the COVID-19 spread has placed women and children vulnerable. UN Women (2020) study shows the vulnerability experienced by women, particularly the married ones, with low income and aged 31-40. Another study shows that 43% of respondents felt unsafe at home, further exacerbated by COVID-19 (East Asia & Pacific Gender Innovation Lab, 2020). 263 Several service provider organizations for the victim of violence against women and children recorded increased complaints compared to before the pandemic the increase of complaints might not reflect women who faced barriers or felt reluctant to report the violence they experienced. A SMERU survey report (2019) found that 24% of poor women did not want to report the domestic violence they experienced. Only a few of them said that they would report the domestic violence to the police (21%) and integrated service center for women and child protection (P2TP2A) (10%) (SMERU, 2019). Furthermore, a survey by Wahana Visi Indonesia (WVI) (2020) covered limited area shows that in the households they assisted, 11% of children experienced physical violence, and 33.8% of children experienced verbal violence during the pandemic. The Indonesian Women with Disability Association (HWDI) (2020) conducted a rapid online assessment covering 50 women with disability respondents. They reported that 80% of them had experienced violence, which was not that much different from before the pandemic. Quite the opposite, with the increase of complaints, the number of service providers who respond to violence cases has decreased during the pandemic. The National Commission on Violence against Women ( Komnas Perempuan , 2020) reported that the budget cuts for government agencies' services were the leading cause of the decline in service quality. In addition, CSOs needed to seek funding independently to help cover the additional cost incurred from applying health protocols in responding to the cases ( Komnas Perempuan , 2020). Furthermore, there have been several studies that discussed gender inequality during the pandemic. The restriction of movement due to the pandemic has brought more domestic chores for women. A survey by Hill, Baird, and Seetahul (2020) found that women were more likely to work from home than men. The female respondents in both studies reported increased domestic chores (Hill, Baird, & Seetahul, 2020; Komnas Perempuan , 2020a). Furthermore, these female respondents also had to allocate more time cleaning, preparing food, grocery shopping, and taking care of their children during the pandemic (Hill, Baird, & Seetahul, 2020). Another study shows that mothers were three times more frequent (71.3%) in taking care of their children compared to men (22%) (SMERU, 2021). BOX 4.30 PROTECTING CHILDREN IN INTEGRATED AND COMMUNITY-BASED MANNERS Upon observing the high rate of involvement of child labour in the agricultural sector (60% of child labourers in the world work in the agricultural sector), Save the Children and Cargill Cocoa & Chocolate developed a Child Protection Program with Sustainable Cocoa in Indonesia that was to be implemented from 2020-2023. The program aims to ensure child protection through a system that functions to identify, prevent, and recover child labour to increase the safety and well-being of the children in Bone and Wajo Districts (South Sulawesi). The program has been kicked off Limapuluh (South Sulawesi) It is also currently being developed in Luwu Utara and Luwu Selatan (South Sulawesi), Poso (Central Sulawesi) and Flores Island. The Community-based Child Protection Mechanism (PATBM) was carried out child labour protection by supporting which served to conduct prevention, identification, and follow-up INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 264 of cases associated with child protection issue in the village. The program involved local civil society organizations, district and village governments, and community cadres, including community leaders, religious leaders, women groups, PKK (Family Welfare Program)/ posyandu (integrated health post) cadres farmer groups. The merchants involved in the supply chain monitor the existence of child labour in their surroundings. When this story was authored, the program had managed to build 10 PATBM in 10 villages in Bone and Wajo Districts. Through PATBM, the community's understanding of the elderly, cocoa, and supply chain merchants on child protection and prevention of child labour have increased. In addition, PATBM also supported the formalization of a proper SOP and building a referral mechanism with relevant parties to handle child protection cases at the village level. The PATBM activities have also been incorporated into the village planning document to obtain the village fund support. The implementation of PATBM program shows that commitment, communication, and collaboration of all stakeholders and beneficiaries are crucial to success. Furthermore, the PATBM also found the importance of engaging prominent figures or influential group representatives from the community. As a government-initiated child protection program, PATBM can be established in every village with the support of commitment from the community members to identify and handle child protection issues and promote the fulfilment of children's fundamental rights. Source: YSTC (Yayasan Sayangi Tunas Cilik) Evidence from the field shows that child marriage, as various other violence against children, reflects a hidden inequality. Among women aged 20-24 who were married before age 18, women who came from a household of the first expenditure quintile made up the highest prevalence (26.76%) compared to the second, third, fourth, and fifth quintile, respectively 23.96%, 20.73%, 2020). In addition, disaggregation by domicile shows that the prevalence of girl marriage was higher in rural areas than the urban area from 2008 to 2018 (Bappenas, Statistics Indonesia/ BPS, PUSKAPA, & UNICEF, 2020). Although Indonesia's level of child marriage has shown a declining trend, Indonesia still ranks eight globally for child marriage (Girls not Brides, 2019). Under the CRC concluding observation (2014) 's recommendation, the Government of Indonesia has increased the minimum age of marriage to 19 years old in Law No. 16/2019 on Amendment to Law No. 1/1974 on Marriage. CCEDAW Report (2012), CRC (2014), and UPR (2017) resulted in the recommendation to strengthen the efforts to eradicate human trafficking. Furthermore, the observation conclusion of CEDAW (2012) and UPR (2017) underlined the need for addressing the root problems of human trafficking and strengthen the investigation and support mechanism for victims. The efforts to combat human trafficking is still going. Yet, a study conducted by Habibie Center in 2019 stated that Indonesia is still one of the countries with many human trafficking victims. Most exploitation cases involved forced labour and debt-slave, most of which involved Indonesian migrant workers. Exploitation cases were reported mainly by domestic workers, factory workers, construction workers in Asia and the Middle East; workers in palm oil plantation in Malaysia; and workers in the fishery industry in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In addition, the study also mentioned sexual exploitation for prostitution (primarily internal trafficking) as the most frequently reported, with women and children as the primary victims. 265 3. Policy Response The Government of Indonesia recognized that there is a need a lot of improvement in the protection efforts for children, women, and other vulnerable groups. RPJMN of 2020-2024 shows the Government of Indonesia's intention to strengthen a child protection system that is responsive to the diversity and characteristics of the child's area to ensure that the children will enjoy their rights. The strengthening includes: (1) strengthening regulation and law enforcement that is proportional to the child's best interest; (2) strengthening institutional effectiveness through capacity building of human resources, service provider, coordination, data and information system, and coaching and supervisory functions; (3) increasing understanding on child protection for stakeholders, community, family, and children; (4) strengthening network between the government and community, mass media, business sector, and community organizations; (5) strengthening children's participation in development in accordance with their maturity; (6) strengthening efforts to prevent and handle various violence, exploitation, including with regard to child labor issue and child neglect; (7) strengthening coordination and synergy to prevent child marriage by engaging various stakeholders; (8) strengthening child caring in family and temporary caring in institutions; (9) increasing access to integrated, friendly and inclusive basic services for all children, particularly children in special situation and condition; and (10) increasing services and rehabilitation for children who need special protection. The Government of Indonesia continues its commitment to reduce violence, discrimination, and exploitation toward children, women, and vulnerable populations. The commitment is manifested in several priorities: (1) the strengthening of inclusive, gender-sensitive, and child-friendly services, strengthening of coordination in enhancing access to basic services for children, women, and vulnerable populations; (2) the network strengthening of the communities and other stakeholders; (3) the enhancement of children, women, and vulnerable population participation in the development; (4) strengthening the prevention measures; and (5) the enhancement of institutional effectivity (RPJMN 2020-2025). In addition, the government has set up a policy to protect women and children from gender-based violence in a disaster context. The policy is expected to increase stakeholders' awareness that during a disaster situation, women and children are at risk of becoming victims of gender-based violence (GBV); hence, their specific needs as victims must be fulfilled. Furthermore, the government has also developed a policy on service standards for child victims or perpetrators of pornography. The policy aims at providing service standards for staff of social, education, religious, health service, and local government institutions to provide early handling, coaching, and recovery for children victims or perpetrators of pornography. Throughout the pandemic, the government has formulated several multi-sectoral protocols for child protection, including 1) Cross-sectoral Protocol for the Prevention and Handling of Violence against Children, Maltreatment, Neglect, and Provision of Substitute Caretaker in Covid-19 pandemic; 2) Cross-sectoral Protocol for Release and Liberation of Children through Assimilation, Rehabilitation, and Unconditional Release; 3) Protocols for Children in correctional institution/LPKA Who Are Given Assimilation and Integration to Prevent and Mitigate Covid-19 Spread; 4) Protocol for Children Data Security and Use to Prevent and Mitigate Covid-19; 5) Protocol for Handling Children Victims of Violence in COVID-19 Pandemic, and 6) Protocol for Protection of Child Refugee and Foreign Child Refugee during Covid-19 Pandemic. In 2020, the Government of Indonesia strengthened the protection for Indonesian migrant workers placed overseas with a new policy. One of the measures is establishing the One-Stop Service for Placement and Protection of Indonesian Migrant Worker (LTSA) INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 266 to ensure that these workers get information, protection, and problem handling support that is easy, sensible, and non-discriminatory. To increase women protection, including migrant workers from violence and human trafficking, the Government of Indonesia has mentioned several strategies in the RPJMN of 2020-2024: (1) strengthening policies and regulations for prevention, handling, rehabilitation, repatriation, and reintegration; (2) increasing knowledge and understanding of both women and men, family, community, business sector, and other stakeholders on violence against women and human trafficking; (3) building capacity for law enforcement officers and government administrators on violence against women and human trafficking; (4) strengthening women protection institutions through capacity building of the providers, coordination between service provider units, strengthening of data, information, and supervision; (5) developing a unified data system on violence against women and human trafficking; (6) developing an integrated service system for handling violence against women and human trafficking; (7) strengthening network and collaboration between national and local governments, community, mass media, business sector, and legal aid; and (8) developing innovations that aim to prevent violence against women and human trafficking. The above policies were built upon various inputs, including from children and youth. In addition to several response-related protocols, children and youth also contributed to distance learning policies and efforts to prevent child marriage during the pandemic. Lastly, the government has also implemented a policy to rehabilitate neglected children using in-shelter and out-shelter rehabilitation. With this policy, the local governments play essential roles to provide social services and rehabilitation for neglected children. B. PROMOTING AND ENFORCING NON- DISCRIMINATORY LAWS AND POLICIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Discrimination policies will prevent the vulnerable group from getting their human rights, access to basic services, and economic opportunities; the situation exacerbated the challenges of multidimensional poverty, these vulnerable groups will have a high chance to pass down such poverty to the next generation (Arauco et al., 2015). In the end, it will make all efforts to improve the community's well-being and reduce poverty more difficult. 1. Trend Analysis and Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic Based on the number of human rights violation report handling indicators, Indonesia showed fluctuating situation from 2015 to 2020. This was demonstrated in the violation reports received from the National Human Rights Commission (Komnas HAM), as shown in the table below: 267 Table 4.14 Number of human rights violation complaint handling 22 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Number of human rights violation (National Human Rights Commision) In addition, based on the indicators of the number of violence against women complaint handling, the National Commission on Violence against Women (Komnas Perempuan) recorded that the increase of complaints handled to 2.389 cases. The increase in complaints indicates higher violence against women cases during the pandemic. Figure 4.145 The Number of Complaints about Human Rights Violations, particularly Violence Against Women Source: Komnas Perempuan (National Commisision on Violence Againts Women) Komnas Perempuan recorded a number of discriminatory regulations against women from 2014 to 2020. There were 32 discriminatory regulations in 2016, the highest between 2014 to 2020. Since 2016, there were apparent efforts from the regional government from the reduction of discriminatory regulation until it was not present in 2020. During the pandemic, reports on discrimination are still received. There remain reports of discrimination against adat communities. The Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation ( Yayasan Lembaga Bantuan Hukum Indonesia /YLBHI) recorded that from the total land in the conflict in 2019, approximately 19,617 hectares or 36% belonged to local communities. Such disputes have been claimed to violate the right to live of 94 people and 3,279 head of households of the adat communities. (YLBHI, 2020). YLBHI also recorded 15 cases of violation of rights to religious and faith freedom throughout 2019. The violation included violation to practice particular religion or faith, right to worship, right to build a 2 2 In 2019, K omnas HAM changed its calculation unit to provide more accurate complaint data. The dossiers unit refers to the number of documents submitted by the complainer or complainee of a complaint (case). Whereas, complaint unit refers to the cases submitted by the complainer, hence one complaint might consist of more than one dossiers. Figure Error!

Local governments are accused of committing these violations through several policies, such as issuing local regulations or circular that restricted certain religious activities. YLBHI recorded at least 38 suspected cases of religious defamation filed to the police from January-May 2020 (YLBHI, 2020). Most of these cases occurred on social media. 2. Challenges and Actions to Overcome In 2012, the observation conclusion of CEDAW implementation in Indonesia recommended abolishing discriminatory regulations at the local level. However, Indonesia is still facing some challenges to ensure that non-discriminatory regulations and policies are in place and provide equal access to justice and basic services for women, children, and other vulnerable groups. BOX 4.31 WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP FOR JUSTICE: ADDRESSING GENDER-BASED ISSUE CHALLENGES DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated gender-based violence and impacted on women in all of their life aspects, including 1) loss of a job or most of their income; 2) enormous workload in the household; 3) domestic violence; 4) increase of child marriage 5) social safety net that often overlooks women. KAPAL Perempuan , through its programs, has attempted to address gender issues during this pandemic. KAPAL Perempuan has conducted efforts to strengthen grass-roots women leaders, organized women through Sekolah Perempuan, and collaborated with various stakeholders to build awareness of the importance of responding to gender issues during COVID-19. They run multiple programs, including 1) Legal education for prevention and handling of child marriage; 2) COVID-19 emergency response to handle gender issues during a pandemic; 3) Emergency assistance and development of women business to fulfil family's food needs; 5) Advocacy of gender data and COVID-19 Task Force to address gender issues during a pandemic; 5) Village Women Complaint Post for dealing with social assistance, gender-based violence, and data issues. The measure involved multi-stakeholders network that is spread in 16 districts/cities, Indonesia (Indonesian Movement for Stopping Child Marriage). 269 The program has increased legal knowledge of the women leaders in the community that helped prevent and handle child marriage and gender-based violence cases. By strengthening women leaders, 37 child marriages have been addressed in North and East Lombok, and domestic violence cases were brought to court in Gresik. Furthermore, KAPAL Perempuan also provided data that informed the responses to gender issue during the pandemic and provided direct emergency assistance through educating the vulnerable community about the health protocol. The program has also successfully supported women through the development of the business group and grass-root cadres. Grass-root village Covid-19 Taskforce has advocated DTKS data, village policies, and budgeting to respond to gender issues during the pandemic. The activity was successfully implemented by support from the Ministry of Women Empowerment and Child Protection (MWECP/KPPPA), local governments in the activity sites, individual solidarity supports for the most pandemic impacted group, MAMPU Program, Equal Measures 2030, Digital Access Programme (DAP), and Move92/Partner Asia. Source: KAPAL Perempuan Indonesia also faces challenges in guaranteeing freedom of religion and opinion, which raised attention in observing the implementation of CEDAW (2012), CRC, and UPR (2017). YLBHI found some improvement in handling religious defamation case by law enforcement, as police now clarified, facilitated mediation, and even ceased report in many instances (YLBHI, 2020). However, systemic challenges persist for national and local governments in finding the best solution and adequate protection. Meanwhile, on the other hand, the issue of criminalization that is often brought through the use of religious defamation clause in Criminal Code and Electronic Information and Transaction Law (EIT LAW) also remains a challenge. Consultation with the youth revealed several problems related to policy makers' lack of sensitivity toward human rights, gender equality, and different social identities. The situation has made advocacy at national and local levels to ensure gender-sensitive and inclusive policies more complex and challenging. During the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a lot of social identity-based incitement. However, various responses, both the government and community, tend to show cross-identity solid social solidarity. Consultation with youth revealed some youth organizations' concerns about the risk of radicalism that they observe during the pandemic. They argued that the pandemic had increased online interaction, hence paving the way to exposure to radicalism. On the other hands, the opportunity to build critical thinking capacity in schools that could mitigate such a risk was stifled by the shift to distance learning or \"school from home.\" INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 270 3. Policy Response The Government of Indonesia recognizes that much improvement is needed to protect human rights from discrimination. Therefore, in the Government Work Plan of 2021, one of the objectives is to create consolidated democracy, preserve freedom, strengthen the capacity of democratic institutions, and protect citizens' equality optimally. These targets are to be achieved by increasing Indonesia's democracy index and law development index. The government continues to maximize efforts of human rights protection and discrimination prevention. For example, the Sexual Violence Prevention Bill is still being pushed to be passed. Efforts to examine application of the EIT Law (electronic information and transaction) are pursued to sustain civil and press freedom. In the National Medium-Term Development Plan of 2020-2024, the Government of Indonesia has targeted to improve its score in the Global Terrorism Index. Furthermore, the Government of Indonesia will also increase national security and stability by creating policies and programs to prevent and address terrorism and deradicalization. At the beginning of 2021, the Government of Indonesia issued Presidential Regulation Number 7/2021 on the National Action Plan for the Prevention and Mitigation of Violent Extremism that Leads to Terrorism for 2020-2024 (RAN PE). The national action plan consists of series of activities that are to be conducted systematically and well-planned to prevent and address violent extremism that leads to terrorism. The action plan serves as a guideline for ministries, government agencies, and local governments to prevent terrorism. Specifically, the national action plan aims at increasing coordination and participation between ministries and institutions to prevent and address violent extremism that leads to terrorism. The RAN PE also develops a data collection and monitoring instrument and system to support the measures to prevent and mitigate violent extremism. 271 272 \u00a9 UNICEF/ UNI360178Goal 17 Partnership for the Goals This section outlines the Goal 17 of SDGs with a focus on five important Targets that are relevant and affect the achievement of the SDGs in Indonesia, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, namely tax revenue, growth of non-oil and gas export, internet use, international development, and data. Taxes as an indicator of Goal 17 can show the situation of resource mobilization in the country. Exports may capture the external circumstance as well as may describe the internal situation. The use of internet can illustrate how Indonesia is rapidly turning to the digital world in response to the pandemic. International cooperation shows how Indonesia interacts with the international community in development. Furthermore, the data\u2014especially with the implementation of the 2020 Population Census\u2014shows how the country continues to carry out its ten-year national agenda even in the midst of the pandemic by leveraging available resources. This section will also discuss how the trends of the main indicators behave and the challenges that correspond to the five Target, and how the government and stakeholders respond to the behavior of the indicators during a pandemic. In addition to reviewing in depth the relevant selected indicators, the analysis of Goal 17 also emphasizes how these indicators are achieved within the framework of multi-stakeholder cooperation. A. TREND ANALYSIS AND IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC 1. TAX REVENUE The catastrophic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic goes beyond the health issue. Already experiencing disadvantages, women has been severely impacted more than men in many dimensions23 , albeit their resilience capability was found impressive24. Experienced globally, the resources to cope with the adverse effects of pandemic were limited, while the prevailing issues in relation to virus transmission and related health issues is daunting. Unsurprisingly, government faced state budget constraints. On one side, state revenue was negatively affected by the decline of economic growth. On the other side, the government had to refocus state budget for pandemic response efforts, especially 23 Gani, I. (2021). P overty of Women and the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia. BIRCI-Journal: Humanities and Social Sciences, 4(1): 10-34- 1041, DOI.

Policy Brief 3. 273 targeting vulnerable groups, to ensure the acceleration of national economic recovery. The government spending significantly increased from IDR 2,309 trillion to IDR 2,739 trillion between 2019 and 2020; the highest increase at least in the last five year (Table 4.15). However, the tax revenue fell notably from IDR 1,546 trillion to IDR 1,405 trillion\u2014its figure from four years ago (2017), in which at the time government expenditure was only IDR 2,007 trillion. This implies that the total government revenue in 2020 dropped significantly, as indicated in Figure 4.146. As seen in the figure, the ratio of government revenue to GDP in 2020 was the lowest in the last decade. Table 4.15 Government Spending and Domestic Revenue ITEM 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Proportion of domestic budget financed by domestic taxes (%)*67.02 ** Financial Note and State Budget (APBN) 2021 All data are in IDR trillion Figure 4.146 Government Revenue and Tax Source: Government Revenue: Ministry of Finance and the Statistics Indonesia; Tax to GDP: Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Home Affairs The tax ratio was at a declining trend, which may be caused by the sources of tax revenue that is not diverse enough. The tertiary sector solely dominates the tax revenue composition for the last six to seven years, surpassing the ones of primary and secondary sectors. In the meantime, the revenues from agriculture and mining tend to be erratic following the rhythm of commodity prices at the global market, while revenues from manufacture slows down along with deindustrialization in the last Figure Error!

This is the opposite trend with the tax revenue contribution of the secondary sector that declined from 39% in 2015 to 37% in 2019. Furthermore, the tax revenue contribution of the primary sector to the total tax revenue was the smallest, about 12-13% in the same period 26. Main challenges remains in tax compliance. The trend of tax ratio continues to decline since a decade ago, despite lower-bound taxable income has been adjusted and a tax amnesty has been once introduced in 2017-2018 through Law 11/2016. The declining generation of revenue through tax has directly affected the proportion of domestic spending financed by domestic tax. In, 2018-2019, this proportion fell from 67% to drop to 65%, continue to decrease to 63% in 2020. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic can be traced through the trend in tax revenue by type of tax. The following table shows that all types of tax decreased in 2021, thus reversing the increasing trend that had occurred since 2015. In 2020, the total tax revenue decreased by around IDR 140 trillion from the level in 2019. In nominal terms, the deepest decrease\u2014around IDR 100 trillion\u2014came from income tax, namely from IDR 772 trillion to IDR 670 trillion. The rest is distributed unevenly among various other types of taxes. The income tax revenue in 2020 is closer to income tax in 2016, i.e., IDR 666 trillion. Moreover, from international trade sources, the sharp decline was shown by export duty revenue, from IDR 3.6 trillion to about half, namely IDR 1.7 trillion. This picture shows that export activities have declined along with the restrictions on the mobility of goods and people in many countries during the pandemic. 25 Deindus trialization phenomenon is clearly recognized in a document published by the Ministry of Finance (2021).

GROWTH OF NON-OIL AND GAS EXPORT The drop in the government revenues, among others, is also caused by the decline of export growth, especially non-oil and gas export. As Indonesia has no longer been an oil exporter since 2009, the non-oil and gas export then becomes an important substitute in the country's international trade. The country itself has long been an exporter of agricultural and mineral products for years. Many different crops and products have been internationally traded and are now still exported. However, the generated nominal values cannot gainsay the fact that the majority of export earnings has always been limited to a short list of primary commodities. Non-oil and gas export growth has not met its targets. A further look at the data shows that the growth of non-oil and gas export had been negative in the last two years prior to the pandemic. Between 2018 and 2019, the growth rate was -5%, while amid the pandemic it was still negative, -0.5%. However, the trend of negative growth of non-oil and gas export is not new. Between the years of 2011 and 2016, for about five years, Indonesia experienced negative export growth rates\u2014displayed in Figure 4.147. In 2015, the growth was at about -10%. Clearly, as it may affect the trade balance, even the overall country's balance of payment 32 , a systematic improvement in the performance of non-oil and gas export is an important and critical agenda. As an illustration, until 2019, the majority of single-digit SITC exports has declined, with the exception of SITCs 0 (food and live animal) and 6 (manufacturing)\u2014that's even with small increases in export value from US$ 13.104 and US$ 26,337 million (2018) to US$ 13,225 million and US$ 26,409 million (2019), respectively for SITCs 0 and 6. 33 32 Inflo w remittances need also a special attention. A significant decline in remittances touched 17,6% in 2020, previously, in 2019, the remit - tances sent to Indonesia reached highest record at USD 11,7 billion-about 1% contribution to the GDP. With more than 180,000 migrant workers returned home during the pandemic, and more than 80,000 placements delayed, Indonesia has experienced a massive drop to only USD 9,43 billion in 2020. 33 See ht tps://bps.go.id/indicator/8/1494/1/nilai-ekspor-menurut-golongan-sitc.html; accessed 27 April 2021. INDONESIA'S 4.147 Growth of Non-Oil and Gas; Oil and Gas Exports (%) Source: Statistics Indonesia A similar trend is experiences by the growth of oil and gas export. As depicted in Figure 4.147, the trend line of oil and gas export resembles the pattern of the non-oil and gas export. In 2012, the non-oil and gas export growth was about -6%, the oil and gas export growth was at the rate of -11%. In 2015, when the oil and gas export suffered most with the growth rate of -38%, the non-oil and gas export growth also touched the worst at -10%. During the 2020 pandemic, the negative growth rate of oil and gas export was still unsatisfactory at -30%, while the one of non-oil and gas export was slowing down at the rate of -0.6%. A comparable pattern is also detected when the two growth rates reached positive points as found in the years of 2010-2011 and 2017-2018. Challenges remain in the declining trend of both oil and gas and non-oil and gas export. Table 4.17 provides some details on the non-oil and gas export performance compared to the oil and gas export performance. First, as mentioned, the non-oil and gas export dominates the country's export composition. All the time, the share is always above 80%, albeit as mentioned earlier it is still concentrated on a few numbers of goods. Second, just like in the growth rate, the nominal values of non-oil and gas exports also decreased for three years of 2018-2020\u2014also followed by a similar oil and gas export behavior. The tendency even could be detected from the years of 2011 to 2015. Export performance once hiked from the year of 2018, but then persistently fell afterwards, indicating that the year of 2018 was the peak year of export in the last five years. Third, the pandemic has set the export value of non-oil and gas export back to the level that had been achieved previously in the year of 2017. During the pandemic, the oil and gas export value was the worst one, at least for the last 10 years. 277 Tabel 4.17 Oil and Gas; Non-Oil and Gas Exports MILLION)SHARE Statistics Indonesia, accessed 22/03/2020 In the last three years, international factors\u2014the US-China trade tension and a serial weakening of commodity prices\u2014are responsible for the declining trend. At the country level, China, for example, is still a big export market for Indonesia as it takes about 20% of the total export of the country. Undoubtedly, any shock occurred in China\u2014due to, for example, the increase in trade tension\u2014would have a direct effect on Indonesia's export. At the global level, the World Bank 34 shows that in 2018 the global economic growth was relatively robust at 3.1%, but slowly fell over the next two years along with the deceleration of advanced-economy growth and the leveling-off recovery in major commodity-exporting emerging market and developing economies. Along with the international factors, however, domestic issues also matter. The Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum, for example, reports that the ranks of the country sharply dropped from the 45th (of 140 countries) in 2018, to the 50 (of 141) in 2019. In 2020 the World Economic Forum also reported that within a scale of 0-100\u2014the higher, the better\u2014the country's scores on five arenas of industrial performance were not impressive. The scores on (1) incentives to direct financial resources, (2) competition and antitrust frameworks, (3) public-private collaboration, (4) investments in research, innovation and invention as well as (5) diversity, equity and inclusion to enhance creativity were consecutively 59.7, 62.9, 45.0, 45.6, and 60.4. Certainly, this achievement is far from the expected level. Still in the same 2020 Global Competitiveness report, it is also recorded that between 2016 and 2020 the percentage change in the skill sets of graduates of Indonesia among the G20 economies are all negative. All of these imply that the capacities to innovatively search for new international markets and to and to diversify export goods still need to be developed more. Market intelligence and market brief, export communication forum, buyer reception desk and inquiry service, as well as export library are, among others, the list of actions required to be strengthened. 34 Cited 7 April 2021 fr om the World Bank. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 278 INTERNET USE 'Working from home' and 'schooling from home' was implemented as a response to policies on social restrictions to control the spread of the COVID-19. Therefore, internet connection is key to support these activities 35. With only few Internet users in 1990s, according to the World Development Indicators of the World Bank 36, currently around half of the population are frequent internet users. Statistics Indonesia also released the data that internet users have increased from about 22% in 2015 to 48% in 2019. 37The last survey-based data by Indonesian Association of Internet Providers (APJII), however, shows a higher number of users; that is, almost three-quarter of the country population are internet users. This is more than double that of the 2014 figure where the users were only 35%. In 2020, when the pandemic hit the country, the internet users according to the APJII data were about similar with the one in 2019, 74%. Nevertheless, two important signs emerge. First , overtime there are similar increasing trends reported by those-mentioned institutions. This to say that, no matter how it is measured, the proportion of population categorized as internet users increase steadily from time to time. This is, however, not a phenomenon unique to Indonesia solely, because it is a global phenomenon as reported in the Internet World Stats. 38 According to the Internet World Stats38. According to the Internet World Stats about 0.4% of the world population was internet users in 1995, but now it takes around 64%. 35 Almos t at the same moment, in April 2020, the Ministry of Education and Culture in a collaboration with the national public TV (TVRI) released a program \"Learning from Home\" to add what has been programmed through the internet network. 36 The de tail figures can be seen in the World Bank website. 37 In the las t five years, the WB uses the data released by Statistics Indonesia, accessed 2 May 2021. 38 ht tps://www.internetworldstats.com/emarketing.htm, accessed 9 April 2021.Figure 4.148 Internet Users in Indonesia Source: Blue Line: Percentage of Internet User (APJII); Brown Line: Percentage of Customer Served by Broadband to Total Household (The Ministry of Communication and Informatics) 279 Second , this certainly reflects a combination of demand and supply sides for the internet. On the demand side, with the increase of welfare, internet use also increases39. To illustrate more, the statistics indicates that customers served by the broadband almost doubled in five years since 2016 (Figure 4.148). Five years ago, it was only 7.84 of the total population, while in 2020 it reached to 14.3%. In between a consistent increase is found: 9.38% in 2017, 10.45% (2018), and 13.59 (2019). On the supply side, there has been massive development of internet infrastructure over the country, even at sub-district level. In 2019, there was only 35.75% sub-districts served by fiber optic network, while a year later it increased to 57.58%. On the demand side, a more detail characteristics of consumers is recorded by the APJII data (Table 4.18). First, digital divide by gender is not significant as male users only slightly dominate the use of internet, while the gap tends to decrease overtime. In 2017, there were 51.5% male users, and decreased to 51% in 2019; thus, there was an increase in female users from 48.5% to 49%. Nevertheless, second, spatial digital divide is more apparent. More than half of internet users are in Java, the main island with the most densely populated area; while the rest is unevenly distributed among the remaining islands, while challenges remain on the number of internet users in the eastern part of Indonesia. Nonetheless, third, initial signs of convergence can also be detected as portion of internet users in Java tends to decrease, while the opposite occurs in the rest of the groups of islands. . 39 This e ven applies also to the elderly group as reported by Statistics Indonesia (2020) in Statistik Penduduk Lanjut Usia 2020 (Elderly Statistics 2020). Table 4.18 Internet Users INTERNET USERS 2017 2018 2019 National 54.68 64.8 73.7 Sex Male 51.43 - 51 Female 48.57 - 49 Island Jawa 58.08 55.7 56.4 Bali-Nusa 5.63 5.2 5.2 Sumatera 19.1 21.6 6.6 6.3 Sulawesi 6.73 10.97 Maluku-Papua INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 280 40 This perhaps a 'helicopter vie w' of contrast. A closer look at, even, a capital city like Jakarta, such a divide is still found, as reported by a study of SMERU (2020). 41 See, S tatistics Indonesia. 2020. Statistik Pemuda Indonesia 2020 42 See, S tatistics Indonesia. Penduduk Lanjut Usia 2020. 43 ERIA , Bappenas, and Survey Meter. (2021).Older People and COVID-19 in Indonesia. Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA).The spatial dimension of digital divide is most likely explained by general socio-economic development gap between the main islands and the outer islands\u2014and urban and rural areas as well. The main islands\u2014and urban areas\u2014represent the more developed areas as contrast to the outer islands\u2014and rural areas 40. In the meantime, gender dimension of digital divide\u2014albeit the APJII data does not show a sharp difference\u2014may associate with various factors. Furthermore, if the internet users are seen from a particular age cohort, the Youth Statistics 2020 41 of Statistics Indonesia records that in 2015 only 44% of youth were internet users. By 2020, the figure has changed to almost double, to 86%. Therefore, the number of internet users among the youth is significantly increasing. However, relative to 2019, the increase in internet users in this group tends to decrease, where the increase was only five percentage points from 81%; whereas between 2018 and 2019 the increase was about eight percentage points from 73%. This slowdown occurred amid the COVID-19. Stronger efforts need to be put in place to achieve the ideal target of 100%. There is growing attention to the elderly users. There is an increasing tendency that those categorized as elderly are also internet users and the size is bigger over time. The Elderly Statistics 2020 42 reports that in 2016 only 2% of the elderly population were internet users, but five years later it rocketed to 11%. This number will continue to grow, a research reports that during the pandemic about 75% of elderly stated that they keep social relations through various devices, like telephone, short message service (SMS), or social networking service (WhatsApp) 43. Albeit the research does not explicitly inform the internet communication behavior of the elderly, this may still provide information about the importance of communication technology for the elderly. At the same time, other aspects of life\u2014e-commerce, e-banking, and other digital business serving also the elderly group\u2014are also rising very fast. Digital literacy skill to the elderly is, therefore, an inevitable need. Moreover, since the elderly group is not sociologically and geographically homogenous, a further attention needs also to be paid to female elderly, those with lower socio-economic status, disability groups as well as those living in rural and remote areas. In the midst of digital divide and unsatisfactory digital literacy, the big size of internet user in Indonesia has some positive impacts on the electronic- or internet-based business sector. Even in the pandemic time, the internet has become a savior for the overall economy from a deeper fall down. Among some few others that grew in the pandemic time, this sector was the one that grew progressively. Telecommunication and information are the closest proxy for this sector. During the pandemic in 2020, while the aggregate growth level was -2%, this sector grew at nearly 11%. This was a boost if compared to the rate in 2019 that took around 9%. This rate was very close to the rate in the first quarter of 2020 when the pandemic just began in March. In the second, third, and fourth 281 quarters of 2020 when the virus hiked explosively, the growth of IT sector was quite stable to maintain the same rate of growth, 11%. 46 4. DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION: THE SOUTH-SOUTH COOPERATION Becoming a middle-income country and as member of G20, Indonesia continues to strengthen international cooperation, including through South-South Cooperation (SSC). This is a translation of the 1955 Asia-Africa Conference and Indonesia's \"independent and active\" foreign policy, aligned with the current vision and mission of the President \"Nawacita Jilid II\". Furthermore, this initiative is also directed to build collective independence that will strengthen the position of developing countries in international fora. In 2019, there are 3 flagship programs of the SCC, as illustrated in figure 4.149, where development cooperation was the main focus. Moreover, scholarship program had the highest number of beneficiaries. Furthermore, the closest neighbor, Timor Leste, was the country partner that benefited most from the SSC program compared to the other nine countries. 46 The S tartup Report 2020 of the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy (2021) recorded that the top five unicorns of Indonesia booked impressive ecosystem values ranging from US$ 3 billion to almost US$ 11 billion. The five unicorns includes (1) 'Gojek' that was initially an online transport network platform company (TNC), (2) 'Tokopedia', a marketplace platform company, (3) 'Traveloka', an online ticket company, (4) 'Bukalapak', a marketplace platform company, and (5) 'OVO', a payment gate company. This advancement is confirmed by the report of Startup Genome that rank Indonesia at the second place after India in the top 100 emerging ecosystem rankings.

THE ROLES OF DATA: THE 2020 POPULATION CENSUS Internet increases regional connectivity through the Palapa Ring and the High Throughput Satellite (HTS), but there remain challenges of internet coverage in some areas. Indonesia is the biggest archipelagic country and the fourth most populous country in the world, and according to the latest 2020 Population Census (PC), is home to 270.20 million people, and additional of 32 million people in comparison to the population recorded in the 2010 census. Male and female population proportion are 50.6% and 49.4% consecutively, sex ratio of 102. The annual population growth of 2010-2020 is 1.25%\u2014lower than 1.49% in 2000-2010. It is also important to know that millennial generation and Gen Z collectively take more than half of the population, where the former is around 25.9% and the latter is 27.9%. About 9.78% of the population is the eldery, increasing from 7.59% in the 2010 census. Productive age still dominates the population structure with 70.72%, implying that the country is still in the era of demographic dividend. Last but not least, geographically, the main island of Java is still the most densely-populated land as it takes 56.1% of the whole population living in this island covering only seven percent of the total area of the The international development cooperation, however, is not limited to SSC. It also covers a wider range of development cooperation beyond the SSC; and the initiative has been established long before the pandemic. Figure 4.150 displays the number of programs and the financial amount of the cooperation, including the SSC. The two graphs show the increasing trends of the country-initiated international cooperation programs. On the basis of the temporary report of the SSC, the number of programs during the pandemic has dropped to only 68 activities, albeit the temporary data on program financing increased to IDR 123.5 billion, higher than 2019 figure of IDR 112.8 billion.

For the SDGs, the 2020 Population Census has some strategic roles. First, the census provides an updated version of population data to adjust various Statistics Indonesia surveys\u2014or other surveys\u2014with much smaller samples. There are many SDGs indicators where the underlying data are constructed from sampling-based surveys that need to be adjusted by the census results. Welfare, health, and education statistics, are few among many SDGs data that needs to be adjusted. Second, the data provides information about the size of SDGs target population, and the implied budget, for various intervention programs in the four pillars\u2014social, economic, environment, and justice and governance pillar\u2014by both national and sub-national governments, including non-state actors. During the Dutch era, i.e., between 1815 and 1930, there were about 10 population censuses effectively conducted, and in that period of time, quality of census data continues to improve, in which the 1930 census data had the highest quality 47. After the independence in 1945, for about every 10 years since 1961, Indonesia conducts the population census regularly. Figure 4.151 depicts the journey of the country's censuses since 1961 48. As displayed in the Figure, the country's population grows, but with a declining trend. With an amount of 94 million people, ten years after the 1961 census, the population growth was 1.7%, but by the latest two censuses, the growth was only 1.3%. All the censuses were conducted with the enumeration method of direct visits to the targeted citizens. Figure 4.151 The Journey of Indonesia Population Census 47 K ompas, accessed 12 April 2021. 48 S tatistics Indonesia, as quoted by Kata Data, accessed 12 April 2021The latest 2020 census, however, was different from the ones that have ever been conducted in the history of Indonesia demography statistics in various dimension. First, it was unexpectedly conducted in the hard times of pandemic. The area-based lock down and physical distancing policies and various social dynamics due to the pandemic had made the census extremely challenging. This does not include yet the uncertainty of the pandemic: when it would end and when the new wave of the pandemic would come. Second, the census combined both traditional and registration-based data collection. The former was run as a full field enumeration, while the latter was conducted through an online system. The online system later on successfully recorded 51.4 million people or 13.6 units of household. 285 B. CHALLENGES AND ACTIONS TO OVERCOME 1. CHALLENGES On tax revenue, Indonesia is struggling with the low tax ratio, thus increasing the ratio should be addressed. First , the expansion and diversification of tax payers and tax sources. The number of tax payers needs to be increased. The sources for tax also need to be diversified to generate new sources. Second , retaining and intensifying current tax payers and tax sources. As the economy grows, the income levels of the current tax payers will also increase. Similarly, as the country's economy grows, the generated economic values of the current businesses will escalate as well. These will be another set of sources for tax revenue in the upcoming future. On export performance, its governance needs to be improved to accommodate its many fronts: at desks, seaports and freight, airports and cargo, including land transportation. Market diversity also remains a necessity, especially in the expansion to new markets and the creation of new goods with high value-added. Bilateral and multilateral collaborations are also unavoidable in increasing non-oil exports. Trade counselors in Indonesian embassies abroad needs to strengthen their roles. Market intelligence will be a serious and strategic task to be played by the counselors. Promoting and marketing Indonesia products\u2014and services\u2014as well as inviting export-oriented investments should become a priority. On the internet, digital ecosystem should be prioritized, thus digital literacy is a must for content creators, programmers and users, especially the elderly. Parallel with digital literacy, manners of proper communication in digital ecosystem, such as social media, should be disseminated. Adverse effects of internet use, such as hate speech and hoaxes continue to spread widely through digital platforms, creating social tensions and some are followed by legal processes. At the same time, digital divide remains. Those living in rural areas and underdeveloped regions, as well as vulnerable groups, such as women, elderly and people with disabilities, continue to experience disadvantage in internet access. Development of internet infrastructure should continue to prioritized hard-to-reach areas, to ensure that the population has coverage to internet, which can be utilized for business development, innovation creation, social network expansion, intensive political participation, and many others. The future will be the internet\u2014the 'Internet of Things' (IoT), therefore more areas should be covered by internet. The 2021 Government Work Plan stated the challenges that still need to addressed in Technology, Information and Communication (ICT) sector are (1) inadequate access and unreliability of ICT infrastructure to boost digital economic growth with the targeted quality. Increasing the reliability and speed of information services requires some expansions in fixed broadband networks and mobile broadband networks; (2) the use of ICT infrastructure that has been implemented needs to be optimized for public sector services, industry, tourism and services to restore economic productivity; (3) the use of ICT infrastructure services is hampered by limited Human Resources (HR) who have mastered expertise in the digital field. In terms of international development cooperation related to SSTC, the main challenge is in ensuring the inclusiveness of non-state actors through several strategies. First , the existing program is still limited to the government programs. In the future, private sector through their CSR programs and the philanthropy will be two potential actors in strengthening international cooperation. Second , future INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 286 cooperations can focus on strategic issues, such as sustainable development. Indonesia can share the experiences and lessons learned in the preparation and implementation of SDGs. Indonesia has entered a new era of system of online-based data enumeration . Currently, the online system is a complementary to the classic field-based data enumeration system. However, in the near future, the online system would dominate data enumeration. This requires a set of strategic investments in both hardware and software development. At the same time, this also needs a new perspective on data management. Big data with the 5Vs\u2014volume, velocity, variety, veracity and value\u2014will also a huge opportunity in the near future. In the public sector, online system is utilized in the data collected and recorded by the offices dealing with statistics, civil registration and population, taxation, social assistance and social protection affairs, political election, and other relevant sectors. Big data will play an important role, alongside data with better speed, coverage and accuracy. The country is in the process to achieve the agenda of \"Satu Data Indonesia\" (One Data Indonesia). This is a daunting task, knowing that integrating various sources and characteristics of data in the country into one system is very challenging. This, however, will provide sense of urgency and opportunity for evidence-based policy using standardized, interoperable, and updated data, to strengthen transparency and accountability of government. 2. ACTIONS TO OVERCOME In terms of domestic resources mobilization, the government has developed strategies to address this issue. First , in response to the COVID-19, government refocused state budget to the efforts in prevention, treatment and control spread of the COVID-19. Efforts in health sector, social protection, and SMEs were prioritized. The health sector focused on health-related equipment supply, incentives to medical staff, and other health efforts related to the COVID-19. Efforts in social protection was directed to maintain consumption levels of the poor and vulnerable groups. Subnational governments need special assistances to compensate the significant reductions generated in their regions. Second , the government also provided various kinds of tax incentive. This includes a series of tax exemptions on incomes of medical staff, those with income levels lower than IDR 200 million per annum, and SMEs; importation of medicines, equipment, and health goods, special alcohol ingredients for sanitizer, and many others. This undoubtedly reduced the capacity of the government to generate revenues as the sources of tax revenues were also reduced. However, those policy actions were necessary to stimulate the economy and, more importantly, to save the human lives. Under the limited revenue but with urgently requiring needs for spending, a larger fiscal deficit, therefore, was consequently unavoidable\u2014reached at about 6% of the GDP where the normal ratio was less than 3%. To cope with the deficit in April 2020, the government issued a sovereign bond', and led the way in raising funds from the international bond market. It was recognized as an important bond for two reasons. 49 First , it was the first sovereign bond issued by a government in Asia with a special purpose in response of COVID-19 pandemic. Second , it was also considered as one of the first market reopening transactions, building the road for investors to participate with the country in its response to COVID-19 pandemic. As the largest issuance of dollar-denominated bonds by the Indonesian government in history, the bond issuance attracted a lot of interest from investors at the Singapore Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. It was reported that the bond was two times oversubscribed in both markets with a total bid of $10.9 billion 50. Later on, the bond was integrated into the overall sovereign bond of the country. 49 Dr awn from Global Capital, 15 March 2020. 50 Jak arta Globe, https://jakartaglobe.id/business/indonesia-rais - es-43b-from-pandemic-bonds; accessed 8 April 2021. 287 Domestic resource mobilization actually covers a broad dimension. This includes not only the government's efforts to cover the budget deficit and finance development, but also reach out to the efforts of people who are genuinely engaged. This movement of resource mobilization by the community can even influence policy making due to the very strong evidence it shows. In various places and sectors of community activity, these efforts are embedded and expanded widely. The following box, on 'Women and Sorghum', illustrates how resource mobilization by reviving tradition has been able to influence policy. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 288 BOX 4.32 WOMAN AND SORGHUM: A SHORT STORY OF LONG LOCAL RESOURCE MOBILIZATION It was Monday, 29 March 2021; a smiling day in the mid of the COVID-19 pandemic. That day was the first time for the Provincial Governor of East Nusa Tenggara, a province in the tip of the country, to harvest 'Sorgum Bioguma 3'. 'Sorgum Bioguma 3' of Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench, bred by the Indonesian Agency for Agricultural Research and Development. On that day the Governor said, \"In 2020 we planted 2,800 hectare (ha) of Sorgum, in 2021 we are going to reach 3,200 ha. In 2022, we expect to have 50,000 ha of land to be planted by Sorgum.\" Sorgum, however, is not a new kind of food seed introduced to the province. It is rooted deeply in the local tradition with dozens of local names, each with its legend, indicating that it has been long known by the local communities. Unfortunately, it had ever been lost and forgotten once among the community, when the centralistic national government extensively brought paddy rice to almost every corner in the country to execute a national food security program in 1970-80s; ironically under a name 'food self-sufficiency' program. The first official harvesting day, therefore, was a symbol that local food, local resource, is officially recognized and revitalized. It was Maria Loretha\u2014called 'Mama Tata'; also widely known as 'Mama Sorgum' (mother of Sorgum)\u2014who first realized that the local community traditionally has special food seeds to be planted in the dried, rocky, and hilly land of East Nusa Tenggara. In 2014 Mama Tata with a long patience tried to recollect various seeds of Sorgum from village to village. It was, however, not easy at all to bring back Sorgum to the existing rice-reliance agriculture. The seeds and the cultivating tradition of Sorgum were almost gone. Pessimism and doubt among the farmers was spread over the villages. The days were so long. Started in one small village, called Likotuden, in Flores island, Mama Tata reintroduced Sorgum to the village life. Under a collaboration with a local foundation name Yaspensel (the Foundation for Socio-Economic Development of Larantuka) organized by Frater Benyamin Daud, Sorgum was revitalized. The Catholic Church of the Larantuka Archdiocese also supported a pilot project in the village. The church motivated the villagers to replant Sorgum and brought a new perspective about the importance of Sorgum among other externally-introduced food. Mama Tata and the church recalled the memory of the villagers about Sorgum; recollected the seeds from the local who still had them, recultivated, and expanded the Sorgum agriculture to other villages, even to other islands in the province. The farmers and villagers adopted this reinvention. A Jakarta-based foundation, KEHATI, played an important role in expanding the Sorgum agriculture to those places in the East Nusa Tenggara province. These stakeholders have been hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, worked with and for the local lives through Sorgum. Sorgum is now going back to live in the hearts of the communities. From village to village, from a mountain to another, even in the flat land, Sorgum is coloring those places. To illustrate, when Sorgum was reintroduced in Likotuden village in 2014-2016, the area of production was only 65 ha. In 2020 it has covered around 217 ha. Also around the same years, in the first village of the Sorgum reintroduction, the production was only 800 kg per 2.5 ha and the market price was IDR 2,200 per kg. By the beginning of the last quarter 2020, the production increased three times to 2.8 ton per the same size of land and the price hiked almost five times to IDR 289 10,000 per kg. Similar stories are also found in other places, like the one mentioned in the beginning of this box. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when food security was under a pressure in many places, Sorgum has changed the game. It has not only made food diversity discourses real at the provincial level, even at the country level as a whole, but also has provided the local community with local resources to be genuinely mobilized. The provincial government has realized that Sorgum is both the current and future agriculture of the province. The Agriculture Office of the province now is preparing to promote the local seeds of Sorgum to be the nationally-recognized seeds to be planted in the forthcoming years. The national government through the Ministry of Agriculture has committed to support a number of regencies to extend the Sorgum agricultural development in the province. Mama Tata, the villagers, and the church have successfully reintroduced Sorgum and changed the game in the provincial agricultural development. Source: Kehati Foundation Furthermore, observing that the country's performance in export is far from impressive, the authorities have initiated various trade cooperation to widen the size of and variation in the export market. In 2019, a MoU had been signed between the Indonesian and the Dutch (the Centre for the Promotion of Imports from Developing Countries--CBI) authorities on home decorative products. What is interesting in this is that the cooperation focuses on the capacity development of small and medium enterprises to enter the Dutch market with the decorative products. Still in this year, a Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) was signed between Indonesia and Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) targeting 18 trade areas to explore\u2014agriculture, transportation, energy, and others. Euroasia is a non-traditional export market of Indonesia. Still in 2019, Indonesia and UK continued what has been agreed in ASEAN high level conference in Bangkok and the Trade Review in the Trade Expo Indonesia (TEI) in Tangerang, Indonesia. In addition to this, in the same year of 2019, a Preferential Trade Agreement had been achieved between Indonesia and Mozambique. Mozambique is not only seen as a non-traditional export market of Indonesia, but more importantly is treated as an export hub of Indonesia to enter to and widen the export markets in Africa. The list is extended to cooperation in 2020. In this year, Indonesia and China agreed to further cooperate in coal trade. Continuing what had happened in 2019, the agreement was achieved in a meeting called 'China-Indonesia Coal Procurement Matchmaking Meeting' and participated by the coal associations of the two countries. Also in this year, the Parliament of Indonesia (DPR) finally has made a new law on Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IA-CEPA). The law facilitates various trade and investment exchanges between the two countries, including reciprocal skills exchange. There are 23 more agreements of international trade between Indonesia and trading partner countries this INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 290 year. It is expected that these cooperations can positively impact Indonesia's economic growth amid the pandemic. Trade cooperation can also be expanded towards development cooperation . The SSC National Coordination Team, has also carried out various activities that have had a significant impact on the development of SSC. Some of them are programs in the form of strengthening the SSC governance, namely (1) Formulating Guidelines for Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), (2) Monitoring and evaluating the placement of experts, (3) Updating of international training M&E guidelines, (4) Completion and refinement of the Indonesia SSC Database application. Replacement of PP 48/2018 to PP 57/2019 as well as the establishment of LDKPI (International Development Cooperation Fund Institution). This was also accompanied by outreach programs, publications, and promotions, namely the preparation of \"Indonesia's Action in South-South Cooperation: Moving Forward Together towards a Better World\". To further expand the internet access, the Palapa Ring Project is the first project of cooperation between the government and private companies (KPBU, Kerjasama Pemerintah dan Badan Usaha ) in telecommunication sector using availability payment scheme initiated by the Ministry of Finance through the mechanism regulated in the Universal Service Obligation (USO) principles. The availability payment scheme is a regularly-scheduled payment mechanism along with the concession period, where the payment will follow the work completion done by the private companies. The project integrates the existing network in the western and the middle paths of the country to a new network in the eastern part. The western and middle paths of the network have already completed, while the eastern network is now under its finalization of infrastructure development through 3,850 km-length submarine cable and 600 km land cable with landing points in the selected regencies. In total it covers 8,500 km-length submarine cable and 12,200 km-length land cable. The overall network is designed for 100-160 GB capacity, run by three consortiums of communication companies in the country\u2014Konsorsium Mora Telematika Indonesia and Ketrosden Triasmitra in the west (the Palapa Ring Barat), a group of companies called PT LEN Telekomunikasi Indonesia in the middle (the Palapa Ring Tengah), and another group called PT Palapa Timur Telematika in the east (the Palapa Ring Timur). The network will become a melting pot for those companies to cooperate and build partnership, connecting point to point in the country. In addition to this, in the very coming future, a new satellite\u2014High Throughput Satellite (HTS)\u2014is going to be released to cover the remaining spots and areas that cannot be covered by the current network of Palapa Ring. The widespread of internet access opens up many possibilities for innovation to be created. In fact, this innovation will positively modernized traditions in the community level. 'Taking care of and helping each other', for example, are long-standing societal norms that rise to the forefront when internet technology is introduced into this tradition. In Central Java, the \"Jogo Tonggo\" (literally 'taking care of and helping each other') tradition has linked up with the internet to reach millions of people. This innovation is presented in the following box. 291 BOX 4.33 'JOGO TONGGO': WHEN TRADITION MEETS MODERN TECHNOLOGY The COVID-19 pandemic has spread over the country and the province of Central Java is not an exception. However, the way the province responds the pandemic is different. The Governance of the province through Governor's Decree 1/2020 reactualizes a local wisdom, 'Jogo Tonggo', that literally means taking care of your neighbors. In every village in the province, 'Jogo Tonggo'is run by a unit called 'Rukun Warga' (RW), an administrative jurisdiction below the village\u2014with four focused working tasks: health, economy, social and security, and entertainment. It is a massive program across the 32,800 km-squared area of the province involving millions of village cadres of those already in the existing family-based women groups ('PKK'), health services ('Posyandu'), social housing ('Dasawisma'), farmers'groups, youth groups ('Karang Taruna'), and many others. At the RW level, apart from the standard protocol of the COVID-19 to implement, the cadres also have a series of tasks to accomplish, namely recording the in-and-out people mobility, identifying the RW members with their health status, and providing special places and supports for local isolation for those. 'Jogo Tonggo' also identifies the RW members in needs\u2014including the elderly, difables, pregnant women, children, etc\u2014and ensures all economic supports (staple food, cash transfer, to match the identified targets. 'Jogo Tonggo' also revitalizes the 'kentongan', a wood-made traditional communication tool beaten with special rhythmic for special meaning until everyone gets the message. Information transfer, however, is not only among the RW members, but also between the RW and the higher administrative jurisdictions up to the provincial level. For this purpose, in September 2020 the Telkom Regional IV Office supported the 'Jogo Tonggo' with a mobile-phone based application to collect the information through the hierarchical structure of jurisdictions. A local university, the Universitas Dian Nuswantoro, was also behind this technical assistance. The application gathers various information including data of those impacted by the virus and the updated health status, the handling mechanisms applied at the filed, and other related health and non-health information. All are centered in the Central Java Government website, https://jogotonggo.jatengprov.go.id/login. Prior to the use of this on-line application, a series or training was conducted to those working at the RW level to input and update the Upper panel: Above, Staple Food Supports in Jogo Tonggo' (detik.com). Below, text in the banner You may take and give your almsgivings; kendalkab.go.id. Accessed Tonggo', Let's take care each other. Below: Tasks and Organizations Structure of 'Jogo Tonggo'The Telkom's support is not the only assistance the 'Jogo Tonggo' receives. Knowing that as a massive program both the provincial and regency government budgets are not enough, other participating supports are received from various entities. To mention some, the private business' CSRs and the communities themselves are the two entities actively who assist the people with staple food packages through the 'Jogo Tonggo' during the pandemic. At the same time, the 'Baznas'\u2014the Islamic-based National Alms Agency\u2014of the Central Java Office provides also special supports to those impacted by the pandemic. The CSRs and the Baznas, and certainly the communities within the neighborhoods, have their own agile structures and mechanisms to work at the field level and effectively reach the target. With the various combinations of technology, assistance, and stakeholder, it is not surprising if the 'Jogo Tonggo' received a special award from the national government through the Ministry of Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform as the Top 21 and Top 45 Innovative Public Services in the COVID-19 handling management. The governor admits that the success is because the RW communities actively input and update the data, share their knowledge and experience in the neighborhoods; and, last but least, many active stakeholders have engaged in the 'Jogo Tonggo'. The so-called 'gotong royong' (literally, a side by side mutual collaboration) has been revitalized from the tradition to find its fertile land to grow in the modern era. Source: Central Java Provincial Governmentdata. In addition to this, social-media groups of communication were also established to bridge discussion among the 'Jogo Tonggo' members. Field-level data verification is also conducted to ensure the precision of information transferred to the authorities for policy execution. Clearly, the 'Jogo Tonggo' has successfully capitalized the traditional kentongan and the modern application of communication to send messages and information. 293 In the meantime, as a new data enumeration in the 2020 census , its online system was challenging and required collaboration among the stakeholders to ensure its success. Statistics Indonesia worked together with the statistics offices in subnational level and other related Ministries/Institutions. Collaboration with the Ministry of Home Affairs was established to obtain records of civil administrative data collected by the Directorate for Population Affairs ( Direktorat Jenderal Kependudukan dan Catatan Sipil , Dukcapil). The Ministry of Home Affairs further also released a circular letter delivered to the heads of sub-national governments\u2014provinces, regencies, and municipalities\u2014to inform the census and increase the participation of the local community in it. The Ministry of Education modified the online census as homeworks for students at schools and universities. The Ministry of Villages, Disadvantaged Regions, and Transmigration assisted the census through its field-level officers throughout the country\u2014similarly done by the office of the National Population and Family Planning Board (BKKBN). Furthermore, data of The National Armed Forces (TNI) and The National Police (Polisi Republik Indonesia) also supported the online census. Statistics Indonesia also brought social media influencers to disseminate and promote online census to ensure greater outreach to the community level. The result of the cooperation is incredible. As mentioned above, Statistics Indonesia records an amount of 270.20 million people, while the registered citizens of the country in the Ministry of Home Affairs are 271.35 million. The difference is quite reasonable due to, say, the dynamic geographical mobility of the population. This is not to mention yet the country's geographical size of about two million km-square that makes any effort to reach the people and generate accurate data not easy at all. At the same time, this also shows that\u2014apart from those living in accessible areas\u2014those living in hard-to-reach areas was well recorded. Clearly, even in the difficult times of enumeration, Statistics Indonesia was able to produce reliable population data. In the near future, the country will develop a Vital Statistics Register (VSR) system to cover birth and death data integrated to the current population data. The series of collaboration has shaped some degrees of confidence of Statistics Indonesia that in the future such a data enumeration Left: Online or interview. Make sure that you're registered.

The stakeholders have proven the willingness and capacity to cooperate, while at the same time the general public can actively participate to supply their information. In the future, a real time data collection mechanism will no longer be impossible knowing that each element of the nation is ready to jointly work for development. C. POLICY RESPONSES The country authorities have set various policies to respond the challenging situation documented in the 2021 Government Work Plan ('Rencana Kerja Pemerintah', RKP). First, tax policy and administration reform has been formulated as the direction of government policy in the 2021 RKP to achieve the tax revenue target of 8.2% by 2021. This includes (1) refining tax regulations in order to increase economic activity, including tax treatment through electronic trading activities that have been carried out in 2020; (2) optimizing tax revenue based on improvements in economic activity, especially income tax and value added tax (3) expansion of the new tax base, including extensification of excisable goods; (4) improvement of tax information technology; (5) increasing tax compliance and supervision; (6) relaxation of customs procedures and development of digital-enabled customs and excise services to accelerate national economic recovery; and (7) enacting fiscal incentives that are more precise, measurable, and based on economic justice. Second , in terms of non-oil and gas exports, the 2021 RKP in addition to focusing on accelerating economic recovery and social reform, has also set a target of Indonesia's non-oil and gas exports of 6.0% -7.9%. In line with the recovery of industry and trade, the policies stipulated in the 2021 RKP include increasing export growth, namely optimizing the competitive advantage of leading industrial sectors; increasing export facilitation, increasing product standards; optimizing the Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA), Free Trade Agreement (FTA), and Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) for export expansion; and improved logistics efficiency In the meantime, the policy direction and strategy of the manufacturing sector during the COVID-19 recovery period in 2021 will focus on three main objectives, namely (1) assisting industry in restoring production to meet consumer demand; (2) assisting the workforce rehiring/re-training process and (3) opening and facilitating access to imported raw materials and export markets. In line with that, from the trade sector, recovery will be encouraged by (1) increasing domestic and foreign demand, including increasing product standards, strengthening public purchasing power, increasing export facilitation, and accelerating the development of imported substitute products, especially food, beverages and pharmaceuticals; (2) logistics efficiency improvement; (3) strengthening the capacity of trading business actors, one of which is through the use of information technology. Third , the policy direction in the ICT sector is focused on increasing the development and utilization of ICT infrastructure and the contribution of the information and communication sector to economic growth, including by encouraging an increase in the number of digital HR training institutions, simplifying the investment process in the ICT sector to absorb labor, and encouraging acceleration. the implementation of the Electronic-based Government System (SPBE) to organize efficient digital public services. These priority activities are aimed at dealing with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has directly accelerated the adoption of digitization. Finally, Indonesia continues to improve and strengthen its SSC management through various activities that are carried out both through National Coordination Team and implementing 295 line ministries. These activities are carried out independently and with supports from international development partners. Strengthening the capacity and management of Indonesia's SSC is carried out in the form of (1) strengthening of governance that focuses on cordial relations with related line ministries as well as with actors outside the Government (Non-State Actors), human resource development, and contributions in RPJMN; (2) Dissemination of information, publication, and promotion of Indonesia's SSC activities to increase domestic and international awareness of contribution to SSC activities. INDONESIA'S VNR PR OGRESS OF VOLUNTARY NATIONAL REVIEWGoal 4 Quality Education Goal 4 aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. During the period of 2015-2019, there has been good progress in the achievement of several indicators of Goal 4, but this was not the case for other indicators. Discussion of Goal 4 covers four main issues: (1) fulfillment of access to education; (2) improving the quality of teaching and learning; (3) education for employability including vocational education and trainings; and (4) strengthening one year of pre-primary school education. A. TREND ANALYSIS 1. FULFILMENT OF ACCESS TO EDUCATION a. School Completion Rate The school completion rate (indicator 4.1.2*) is used to monitor access to and completion of education. While the school participation rate indicates the proportion of children and adolescents enrolled in school, the school completion rate provides information about children and adolescents who complete their last education level without excessive delays. Figure 4.152 shows the progress of the school completion rate from 2015 to 2020. An increase occurred at the primary and junior secondary education levels, but there was a slight decrease for the senior secondary education completion rate from 2017 to 2018; but then the figure increased from 56.25% (2018) to 63.95% (2020). Data shows that the higher the education level, the lower the completion rate. The government promotes an affirmative program in the form of assistance to children from low socio- economic groups through the Smart Indonesia Program ( Program Indonesia Pintar /PIP). This program aims to increase access to education. Through Smart Indonesia Program, education cash assistance is provided to: school-age children (aged 6-21 years) from poor and near families: Prosperous Family Card ( Kartu Keluarga Keluarga Harapan /PKH) beneficiaries, orphans, persons with disabilities, and victims of natural disasters. According to the study conducted by Ministry of Education and Culture, almost half of the parents of PIP recipient students only completed primary school education and no more than 2% were university graduates. This phenomenon indicates the proper targeting of PIP program. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 298 Core Susenas, 2015-2020 b. Out-Of-School Children The school completion rate shows the proportion of students who complete certain level of education. However, it does not explain the situation of children and adolescents' participation in education. Figure 4.153 shows the number of out-of-school children for each education level age group from 2019 to 2020. For children aged 7 to 12 years, this figure is very low, indicating that the majority of children have already participated in primary education. However, out of school children of junior secondary school age (13-15 years) tends to increase during the 2019-2020 period. Although there was a decrease in the proportion of out-of-school of senior secondary school age (16-18 years), the figure was still high, stood at 20% within the two years period. Figure Error!

Participation Rate at Higher Education More efforts are needed to improve access to tertiary education to achieve the RPJMN target of 36.73% in 2019. Statistics Indonesia (BPS) data shows that the achievement of the gross enrollment rate (GER) of tertiary education was only 30.85% in 2020. Although there was a tendency of increasing GER for higher education ( Perguruan Tinggi /PT) over years, this figure shows that most senior secondary school graduates (almost 70%) did not continue their education to tertiary level. This reinforces the importance to expand the opportunity to access non-formal education and training that can increase their employability. Figure 4.154 Higher Education Gross Enrollment Rate Source: Core Susenas, 2015-2020 Primary school age (7-12 years)Junior secondary secondary school age (16-18 years) INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 300 Statistics Indonesia (BPS) data show that the gross enrollment rate (GER) of higher education varied across expenditure groups. The GER of higher education in the richest household group (Quintile 5) reached 56.87%, compared to only 16.13% in the bottom 20 percent households (Quintile 1). The GER of higher education for people with disabilities was 13.85%; this was half the proportion for those who did not have disabilities (30.99%). The wide gap in access to higher education needs special attention since it is essential in increasing employment and serves opportunities for social mobility. 2. IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF TEACHING AND LEARNING a. Quality of Student Learning Outcome The quality of teaching and learning is measured through student learning outcomes including literacy and numeracy skills. However, to determine the quality of learning process experienced by students, indicators of the quality of teachers and school infrastructures need to be examined. The 2019 SDGs Achievement Report (BAPPENAS, 2020) shows that there was a decrease in the proportion of children and adolescents who achieved the minimum competencies in reading and mathematics. This decline can be observed from the result of PISA test, which is an international literacy and numeracy survey followed by 15-year-old students (students in grade 9 junior secondary school and Grade 10 senior secondary school). In 2015, 44.62% students achieved the minimum proficiency level in reading and 31.35% for the minimum proficiency in mathematics. In 2018, Indonesia again participated in the PISA test and the result shows that proportion of students who achieved the minimum proficiency level in reading and mathematics decreased to 30.1% and 28.1%, respectively. The proportion of Indonesian students aged 15 years who achieved the minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics from 2003 to 2018 is shown in Figure 4.155.

Education Facilities and Learning Environments Indonesia needs to continue to build and improve educational facilities that are friendly to all children regardless of gender and disability status, as well as providing a safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning environment for all. The need for adequate learning facilities is not limited to facilities and infrastructure that are directly related to learning activities, but also health-related needs, given that children and adolescents spend a lot of time at school. Figure 4.156 shows the status of availability of facilities in schools. It appears that not all of education units have access to electricity, computers and the internet. Until 2018, the proportion of education units using the internet and computers for learning purposes was still low, especially at the primary and junior secondary education levels. Access to information and communication technology (ICT) in learning is essential to improve literacy proficiency of children and adolescents in Indonesia. Figure 4.156 Proportion of Schools with Access to Educational Facilities Source: Core Education Data (Dapodik), Ministry of Education and Culture 2018 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 302 The 2019 SDGs Achievement Report also noted that the hand washing facilities (WASH: water, sanitation, and hygiene) available in schools need to be improved. At all education levels, the proportion of educational units that have this facility is only around 50%. This data shows that the education unit's attention to provide basic hygiene facilities needs to be increased. c. Bullying at SchoolThe quality of student learning outcomes is also related to the bullying phenomenon that occurs at school. Students aged 15 years who experienced bullying at least a few times per month had lower PISA reading scores than those who were not bullied. In the 2018 PISA survey, it was found that as many as 41.1% of Indonesian students experienced bullying at least several times a month. In Indonesia in particular, bullying tends to be higher in male students and in students who are financially privileged. The results of this survey indicate that efforts to create child-friendly schools must continue to be strengthened. 3. EDUCATION FOR EMPLOYABILITY a. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Skills Information and communications technology (ICT) skills are one of the basic competencies that adolescents and adults need to have in order to improve their employability. This indicator is assessed using a proxy indicator on proportion of adolescent and adults who have access to internet. From 2015 to 2020, the proportion of youth aged 15-24 years with ICT skills increased from 51.83% to 87.17%. This increase was in line with the expansion of access to digital technology in Indonesia. Table 4.19 Proportion of adolescents (aged 15-24 years) with information and communications technology (ICT) skills, 2015-2020 DISAGGREGATION15-24 YEARS OLD 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 AREA OF RESIDENCE Urban Areas (Statistics In rural areas, the proportion of adults aged 15-59 years with information and communication technology (ICT) skills increased from 25.65% in 2017 to 49.77% in 2020. 303 Table 4.20 Proportion of adults (aged 15-59 years) with information and communications technology (ICT) skills, 2015-2020 DISAGGREGATION15-59 YEARS OLD 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 AREA OF RESIDENCE Urban Areas Table 4.21 Participation Rate in Organized Learning Before Primary Entry School Age EXPENDITURE GROUPPARTICIPATION RATE 2019 2020 40% ONE YEAR OF PRE-PRIMARY EDUCATION a. Participation Rate in Organized Learning (one year before the official primary entry age) One year of pre-primary school education or early childhood education (PAUD) for five and six years old children is an important education for the transition from learning at home which is generally unorganized, to a more organized and structured education in schools. At this golden age, children need a variety of stimulations for their development. Susenas data shows that there was an increase in participation in organized learning one year of pre-primary education (indicator 4.2.2*), from 95.85% in 2015 to 96.37% in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic that has led to the dismissal of face to face learning activities which also affected the PAUD participation rate. In 2020, there was a decrease in the participation rate of organized learning for pre-primary, from 96.37% in 2019 to 92.76% in 2020. Table 4.21 shows that the decline in participation rates occurred both in the top 20% richest households and the bottom 40%. This may be due to a decrease in household needs for PAUD facilities. Initially, PAUD was an alternative for parents to entrust their children to educational programs when the parents worked. When the pandemic forces parents to work from home and take over their childcare and education, this could contribute to lower participation rates. In addition, the existence of family economic pressures can also cause difficulties for parents to access PAUD. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 304 Even for children who are still registered in PAUD service, the quality of learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has also been disrupted. There is also concern that learning from home will reduce the quality of learning which will have an impact on school readiness. The rapid assessment conducted by Save The Children Indonesia in April 2020 shows that 25 percent of parents do not have adequate tools and materials to support children's learning at home, and around 40 percent of parents report that learning motivation of their young children has dropped. B. CHALLENGES The challenges in fulfilling access to education include: (a) underprivileged children tend to discontinue and drop out of school at the secondary education level. Likewise, at the higher education level, the education gap between economic groups is still wide; (b) out-of-school children remains a challenge particularly to synchronize cross-sector interventions in minimizing the social, economic, cultural, and geographical barriers faced by school-age children in accessing educational services. There is a need to address out-of-school children issue by accommodating and paying adequate attention to specific needs and various issues faced by children, such as children with special needs, street children and neglected children, children in conflict with the law, children in marriage or teenage mothers, and children who work or child labor; and (c) the implementation of inclusive education in Indonesia is still facing several challenges, for example, not all schools are ready to accept children with special needs, schools do not have teachers with required backgrounds to guide students with disabilities, and the availability of social infrastructure and facilities in schools is still inadequate to support the implementation of inclusive education. Challenges in improving the quality of learning and teaching include: (a) infrastructure and teacher interventions aimed at supporting the improvement of the quality of education services have not shown a significant impact on student learning outcomes; (b) decreasing number of certified teachers at each level of education; (c) curriculum development must be more inclusive and collaborative to produce curricula that considers children's abilities and interests; and (d) learning assessment should be directed to provide feedback in the formulation of future learning strategies. The challenges in education for increasing skilled employment include: (a) the Indonesian workforce is still dominated by junior secondary school graduates; (b) large gaps between persons with disabilities and persons without disabilities; and (c) the view that attending a higher education does not necessarily guarantee greater employment opportunities, which creates a reluctance for youth to continue their education to a higher level. Challenges in strengthening one year of pre- primary education include: (a) better coordination between related ministries (Ministry of Education and Culture, Ministry of Religious Affairs, and Ministry of Villages, Development of Disadvantaged Regions and Transmigration) and with local governments for providing childhood education; (b) better synchronization of policies related to teacher development; (c) the welfare of PAUD teachers still needs to be improved; (d) the certification for PAUD teachers is uncertain; (e) stronger partnership between parents and teacher of PAUD students; and (f) the level of education, interest, and socio-economy status of the parents especially in rural-remote area is still low. C. POLICY RESPONSE According to the Government Work Plan (RKP) for 2021, efforts to increase the distribution of quality education services are carried out 305 through: (a) providing internet network infrastructure and developing digital technology to support virtual learning, especially during the pandemic (school from home); (b) increasing productivity and competitiveness, through revitalizing vocational education and trainings in line with the needs of the industry, creating digital-based education, developing a credible and world-class labor market information system, and implementing vocational training and apprenticeship in Industry 4.0 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 306 Goal 5 Gender Equality Goal 5 calls for gender equality and women empowerment. Achieving Goal 5 is not only a fundamental human right and justice, but also a necessary foundation for creating a more prosperous nation. Goal 5 does not stand alone. Gender sensitive development encompasses all the goals of the SDGs to ensure the realization of gender equality in all aspects of life. A. TREND ANALYSIS 1. GENDER RESPONSIVE LEGAL FRAMEWORKS The availability of legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality and eliminate discrimination on the basis of sex are efforts to end all forms of discrimination against women. Based on the 2020 assessment, the existence of legal frameworks that encourage and/or promote gender equality and law enforcement and/or monitoring of the implementation results in the area of overarching legal framework has reached 100%, while the score in the area of violence against women was 91.67%, employment and economic sector was 90 %, and the field of marriage and family by 81.82% (Ministry of Women Empowerment and Child Protection, 2021). 2. VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN Based on the 2016 National Women's Life Experience Survey (SPHPN), as many as 10.4% of women who have ever/were married experienced violence from their partners in the past year with the highest rate of emotional violence, namely 7.5%. The same survey also showed that as many as 4.66% of women experienced sexual violence by someone other than their partner. 307 Figure 4.157 Prevalence of violence against women aged 15-64 years who have ever/ were married by a partner in the previous 12 months, 2016 Source: SPHPN 2016 (Ministry of Women Empowerment and Child Protection and Statistics Indonesia) 3. CHILD MARRIAGE The rate of child marriage in Indonesia has shown a decline. The proportion of women aged 20-24 who are married or living together before the age of 18 has decreased from 12.14% (2015) to 10.35% (2020). Meanwhile, the number of child marriages under 15 years has decreased from 0.60% (2015) to 0.50% (2020). Child marriage was still prevalent in certain provinces in Indonesia. In 2020, 21 out of 34 provinces in Indonesia had rates of child marriage under the age of 18 that is higher than the national average. Child marriage appears more prevalent in women who live in rural areas and come from households with the lowest 40% expenditure. Moreover, girls who were married at child age tend to have low levels of education. Figure 4.158 Proportion of women aged 20-24 years who were first married or living together before age 18 by province, 2020 Source: Core Susenas 2020, Statistics Indonesia INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 308 Figure 4.159 Characteristics of women aged 20-24 years who were first married or living together before age 18, 2020 Source: Core Susenas 2020 (Statistics Indonesia) 4. WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION The participation of women as political decision makers has been encouraged in the laws and regulations, with a target of at least 30% women representation in parliament. This target was only fulfilled for the Regional Representative Council (DPD) members in the 2019 general election. Meanwhile, the proportion of women who are members of the House of Representatives (DPR) and the Regional House of Representatives (DPRD) at provincial and district/city levels is still far from the target figure of 30%. Table 4.22 Proportion of national and regional legislative seats held by women, 2009, 2014 and 2019 LEGISLATIVEYEAR 2009 2014 2019 The House of Representatives (DPR) 17. 86 17. 32 20.52 The Regional Representative Council (DPD)26.57 25.76 30.88 The Provincial House of Representatives (DPRD Provinsi)15.50 The District House of Representatives (DPRD Kabupaten/Kota)14.24 15.30 Source: General Election Commission (KPU) The proportion of women in managerial positions in both government and public and private companies continues to increase from 22.32% (2015) to 33.08% (2020). The figure varies across provinces, with the highest proportion in Gorontalo Province (50.43%) and the lowest in Southeast Sulawesi Province (21.54%). 309 5. REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH Based on the Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) data, the proportion of women of reproductive age 15-49 years who make their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use, and reproductive health services continues to increase during the 2012-2017 period. For women of reproductive age (WUS) this proportion increased from 28.3% (2012) to 29.5% (2017). Meanwhile, for married women of reproductive age (PUS) the figure was much higher, increasing from 38.6% (2012) to 41.0% (2017). Women who make their own decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use, and reproductive health services are found mostly in the adult age group (20 years and over), with higher levels of education and from the middle and upper expenditure quintile. Disparities between provinces also still occur. In 2017, the highest proportion of decision making for both WUS and PUS was in Central Kalimantan (42.6% and 55.1% respectively) and the lowest was in Aceh Province (15.1% and 23.1% respectively).

ACCESS TO ECONOMIC RESOURCES The results of the 2020 Statistics Indonesia (BPS) Integrated Agricultural Survey (SITASI) pilot in the provinces of West Java, East Java and West Nusa Tenggara show that only 26.74% of the agricultural population owned agricultural land in these 3 (three) provinces. Among the agricultural population with land rights, women's ownership of agricultural land was only 18.95% while the rest was owned by men. The proportion of women in the agricultural population as owners or who have rights to agricultural land in East Java Province was 24.28%, West Nusa Tenggara was 21.24%, and West Java was 13.54%. 7. ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY The proportion of individuals who own mobile telephone continues to increase from 56.92% (2015) to 63.53% (2019) but then decreases to 57.48% in 2020. The highest access to mobile telephone was among the young population (15-24 years old), followed by population aged 25-64 years. The level of access to mobile telephone in urban areas was better than in rural areas. Although the access remains higher in men compared to women, the gap was getting narrower during the 2015-2020 period. Figure 4.162 Proportion of individuals who own mobile telephone, 2015-2020 Source: Core Susenas (Statistics Indonesia) Disparities in access to mobile telephones also occurred between regions in Indonesia. The provinces of DKI Jakarta, East Kalimantan, Riau Islands and North Kalimantan were the provinces with the highest levels of mobile telephone access in Indonesia during the 2015-2019 period. The level of mobile telephone access in these 4 (four) provinces has reached over 70%. 8. GENDER RESPONSIVE BUDGET ALLOCATION The availability of a system to monitor and track gender responsive budget allocations ( Anggaran Responsif Gender /ARG) has an important role in achieving gender equality. The assessment of the system to monitor, track, and make ARG budget allocation in Indonesia in 2020 shows that the performance of Indonesia's gender responsive budget was classified as \"approaches requirements\" (Case E). Criteria that have been met are aspects of programs and budget allocations to reduce gender disparities (criterion 1) and a budget system to promote the achievement of gender equality (criterion 311 2). Meanwhile, the aspect of public transparency (criterion 3) is still not yet to be fulfilled because there is no built-in mechanism for reporting ARGs to the public. B. CHALLENGES Cases of violence against women remains an iceberg phenomenon in Indonesia. The number of reported cases did not represent the actual number of violence cases. There are two main challenges behind this phenomenon, namely external factors and internal factors from the victim. In terms of external factors, data collection system needs to be improved, communication, information and education has to be effective, and access to services needs to be expanded. From the internal side of the victims, strengthened efforts are needed to increase awareness of the violence experienced, remove assumption that the violence experienced is a disgrace that must be covered up, and stop the bad stigma against victims of violence that prevent them from reporting the case. Challenges in preventing child marriage include: (a) empowerment and understanding of reproductive health and the negative impact of child marriage on children and adolescents; (b) family socio-economic factors such as parents' incomes, education background, and their knowledge regarding reproductive health and the impact of child marriage; (c) unequal power relations between parents and children and the development; (d) interpretation social norms and values which serve as justification for the practice of child marriage; and (5) the needs for technical regulations to implement the Law on maturity of marriage age and the high rate of marriage dispensation by religious courts. The challenge of increasing women's representation in politics and as decision makers in various institutions is rooted in a patriarchal culture. This patriarchal culture creates barriers to women's participation as decision makers in the form of: (a) limited space and time due to the double burden of women in public and private spheres; (b) limited resources (financial, social networks), political experience, and low motivation/ambition/interest of women to have a career in politics; (c) the development of gender stereotypes that regard leadership positions as positions for men, as well as the greater priority given by workplace agencies and political parties to male candidates than female candidates. The challenge for women to make their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use, and the reproductive health services use is influenced by women's knowledge and access to information about sexual and reproductive health. However, efforts to increase the women capacity still face a number of challenges, namely: (a) equal access to quality promotive and preventive services related to reproductive health in health facilities (b) sexual and reproductive health education; (c) the implementation of policies related to reproductive health, not limited to issue of family planning and sexually transmitted diseases, and (d) regulations that reach all women of reproductive age to ensure protection against violence. Challenges to encourage ownership and control of agricultural land by women include: (a) equal inheritance rights of economic resources; (b) equal access to arable and information related to arable; (c) equal responsibility between men and women in the domestic sphere; and (d) accommodation the needs of women farmers and/or women from adat communities. The challenges in expanding access to mobile telephone include: (a) increasing the coverage of cellular networks and internet signal with the large and varied geographic area of Indonesia; (b) eliminating the problem of theft and vandalism against the telecommunications infrastructure, as well as the improving quality of human resources working in the ICT sector; and (c) improving community capacity and affordability (community economic factors) to access mobile telephone. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 312 The challenges faced regarding the availability of the system for tracking and formulating gender responsive budget allocations are: (a) developing a special mechanism for monitoring ARGs; (b) conducting gender impact assessment as a basis for the ARG allocation policy; (c) developing a specific evaluation mechanism to measure the outcome of the ARG allocation policy; (d) developing mechanism for ARGs as independent audit subjects related to their support for gender responsive policies; (e) publishing ARG data d officially so that it is available for the public; and (f) improving the accuracy of budget allocation calculation resulting from the ARG budget tagging. C. POLICY RESPONSE Based on the Government Work Plan (RKP) for 2021, efforts to improve the quality of women and children are carried out through: (a) strengthening data systems and integrated services to protect women and children from violence and human trafficking; (b) strengthening child protection from various negative impacts of COVID-19, such as discrimination, mistreatment, stigma, violence, exploitation, child marriage, and loss of care due to separation from parents/primary caregivers; and (c) strengthening coordination for women's economic empowerment, including for women victims of violence and groups affected by COVID-19. 313 Goal 6 Clean Water and Sanitation A. TREND ANALYSIS 1. ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER The proportion of households using improved drinking water services is quite high nationally. The proportion in 2019 has reached 89.27% and increased by 0.94% where it reaches 90.21% in 2020. Unimproved drinking water services were mostly influenced by the use of unprotected wells, which reached 4.69%. Meanwhile, for the category of access to safely managed drinking water services still needs special attention since it was only 11.9% (Safe Drinking Water Quality Survey/SKAM 2020, National Institute of Health Research and Development/NIHRD Ministry of Health). Looking at the distribution of areas, only Kalimantan (16.9%) and Java and Bali (13.8%) have figures above the national level. The other regions are still below the national figure. Based on urban rural areas, access to safely managed drinking water services in rural areas is higher at 15.1% compared to urban areas which only reached 8.3%.

ACCESS TO IMPROVED SANITATION The proportion of households using improved sanitation services (including safely managed sanitation) has increased by 2.14% within a year, from 77.34% in 2019 to 79.53% in 2020. Based on household expenditure groups, there was an increase in households with access to improved sanitation services. In 2020, the middle 40% and the top 20%'s access is above the national figure. However, in the lowest 40% group, only 70.03% of households have enjoyed access to improved sanitation services and it is still below the national figure. As part of sanitation, the proportion of households using a hand-washing facility with soap and water has also risen from 76.07% to 78.3% during 2019-2020.

For improved drinking water, the highest access occurred in DKI Jakarta (99.84%) and the lowest was in Bengkulu (62.47%). For improved sanitation, the province with the highest access was in DI Yogyakarta (96.96%). There are 14 provinces that have access to improved drinking water above the national average, and there are 17 provinces where access to improved sanitation is above the national average. Nationally, access to improved drinking water is relatively better than access to improved sanitation. However, there are more provinces that already have access to improved sanitation above the national average, although the difference is not significant. Figure 4.166 Disparities in Access to Improved Drinking Water and Improved Sanitation Services in 2020 Source: Susenas, Statistics Indonesia INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 316 3. WATER The water quality index ( Indeks Kualitas Air /IKA) in 2020 was 53.53 or an increase of 0.91 from the previous year. However, the IKA has not met the target of 55.1. There are eight provinces that have met the IKA target, namely Bengkulu, East Java, Central Java, West Nusa Tenggara, Papua, Banten, DI Yogyakarta and North Sulawesi. Meanwhile, there are 26 other provinces that still have not met the IKA target. The main parameters that cause IKA to not reach the target are Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Dissolved Oxygen/Oxygen Demand (DO), and Fecal Coli. This shows that the source of pollutants from domestic activities is still dominant as the cause of the decline in water quality. Figure 4.167 Water Quality Index (IKA) 2015-2020 Source: Environmental Quality Index Media Briefing (Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 2021) B. CHALLENGES Challenges faced in realizing the target of Goal 6 Clean Water and Sanitation include: 1. E fforts to supply drinking water services still face challenges, including challenges in governance for the provision of drinking water; and commitment and capacity of local governments as the main implementers of the Drinking Water Supply System ( Sistem Pelayanan Air Minum ). 2. R egarding the provision of access to improved sanitation services, it is necessary to optimize the operation of the Wastewater Treatment Plant ( Instalansi Pengolahan Air Limbah Lumpur Pengelolaan Air Limbah Domestik /SPALD). 3. I n the management of groundwater and raw water, challenges include the low level of raw water supply services; problems of quantity and quality of water (3T: too much, too little, too dirty); and problems of monitoring of water quality; and utilization of technology to ensure the quantity and quality of raw water that is safe and feasible in a sustainable manner. C. POLICY RESPONSE Policies related to Goal 6 include: 1. Provision of access to safely managed and improved drinking water services is implemented with the following policies: (1) Improving institutional governance for the provision of safely managed and improved drinking water services; (2) Increasing the capacity of drinking water providers; (3) Figure Error!

The policy directions for sustainable groundwater and raw water management are: (1) accelerating the supply of raw water from protected water sources; (2) enhancement of integration in drinking water supply, (3) and utilization of technology in raw water management. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 318 Goal 7 Affordable and Clean Energy Discussion on Goal 7 focuses on electrification ratios, per capita electricity consumption, household gas networks, household gas use ratios, renewable energy mix, primary energy intensity and installed capacity of electricity generation from renewable energy. Besides presenting an analysis based on trends up to 2020, this section will also explain the impact of COVID-19 on the achievement of the SDGs, especially on relevant indicators. A. TREND ANALYSIS 1. ENSURING AFFORDABLE, RELIABLE, SUSTAINABLE, AND MODERN ENERGY ACCESS The energy and mineral resources sector are strategic sectors and have become a backbone in supporting national development and economy. Energy is a basic need which is a prerequisite for the running of economic activities which in turn will have a direct impact on economic growth and other community activities. Energy demand will continue to increase frequently with the growth of the economy and population in Indonesia. Energy supply and utilization activities will also have an impact on the environment, both greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental impacts. Attention to the environmental and social impacts of energy supply and utilization activities is increasing at both the global and national levels, this further demonstrates the importance of a sustainable national energy supply and utilization strategy. The Electrification Ratio (RE) is the ratio between the number of electrified households with the total number of Indonesian households. The electrification ratio continued to increase from 88.3% in 2015 to 98.89% in 2019. The electrification ratio (RE) for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 99.20%, slightly below the RE target for 2020 as stated in the RKP 2020 at 99.9%. 319 Figure 4.168 Target and realization of renewable energy Source: ESDM (Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources) In 2019, there were 29 provinces that had RE of more than 95% covering all provinces on the island of Sumatra, Java, parts of Sulawesi and Kalimantan, Maluku, North Maluku, and Bali and West Tenggara. Four provinces, namely Central Kalimantan, Southeast Sulawesi, Maluku and Papua have RE in the range of 90-95%, while the provinces with RE less than 90% are East Nusa Tenggara. The government is making efforts to increase RE either through the on-grid strategy, namely through the extension of the PT. PLN ( Persero ) and the off-grid strategy, namely through the distribution of Energy Saving Solar Lamps ( Lampu Tenaga Surya Hemat Energi /LTSHE) as well as non-PLN electrification programs (local government, community and private sector organizations). One of the benchmarks for the progress of a country is the provision of adequate and reliable energy for the whole society which can be indicated by the level of electricity consumption. In the 2015-2019 period, electricity consumption per capita increased from 910 kWh per capita in 2015 to 1,084 kWh per capita in 2019, or increased by an average of 43.5 kWh per capita per year. However, this increase has not yet reached the target set in the 2015-2019 RPJMN of 1200 kWh per capita in 2019 so it still needs to be accelerated. As of the fourth quarter of 2020, per capita electricity consumption has reached 1,089 kWh per capita or 93.8% of the 2020 target of 1161 kWh per capita. This achievement only increased by 5 kWh per capita compared to the previous year which reached 1,084 kWh per capita, much smaller than the average annual increase of 43.5 kWh per capita per year in the 2015-2019 period In supporting the use of cleaner, more reliable and affordable energy sources, the use of natural gas for household needs continues to be developed. The household gas network continues to be built. In the 2015-2019 period, 337.93 thousand household connections ( Sambungan Rumah Tangga /SR) of city gas networks (Jargas) were built so that the total cumulative Jargas increased from 220.36 thousand SR in 2015 to 537,940 SR in 2019. In other words, the addition household gas line is around 68 thousand SR per year (Table 4.23) Until the fourth quarter of 2020, the construction of the city gas network has reached 135,286 SR or 50.85% of the target in RKP 2020 of 266,070 SR. With this addition, the cumulative of city's becomes 673,226 SR. INDONESIA'S VNR Table 4.23 Development of City Gas Networks (Jargas) (in thousand SR) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Non-State Budget Realization 12.72 10.22 3.74 (Ministry Energy and Mineral Resources) Strategic Plan 2020-2024 and ESDM 2020 Performance Report By taking into account the 2020-2024 Medium- Term National Development Plan (RPJMN) target of 4.1 million SR in 2024, an additional 692 thousand SR is required per year. This shows that more effort is needed to achieve the predetermined targets in 2024. The ratio of household gas use is an indicator to describe the proportion of households that have used gas as fuel for cooking to the total household as a whole. In the 2015-2019 period, according to the People's Welfare Statistics data, Statistics Indonesia (BPS), the achievement of this indicator continues to increase every year, from 68.78% in 2015 to 79.9 in 2019. Realization in 2020, the ratio of use household gas valued at 81.98%. Although nationally the value continues to increase and the achievement of the proportion is relatively high, this condition is not evenly distributed throughout Indonesia. Several provinces, such as East Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, North Maluku, Papua, and West Papua, have a very low household gas use ratio of below 5%, even Maluku Province has a household gas use ratio below 1%. This shows that the implementation challenges in increasing the value of the ratio of household gas use, especially in these four provinces in Eastern Indonesia, are still very large, because they are related to gas fuel distribution infrastructure as well as price affordability, as well as community habits. One of the benchmarks for the provision of clean and sustainable energy can be seen from the renewable energy mix. In this case, it can be measured from the share of New and Renewable Energy ( Energi Baru dan Terbarukan /EBT) in the primary energy supply or Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES). In the 2015-2019 period, the share of EBT continued to increase from 4.4% in 2015 to 9.15% in 2019. This achievement was still below the target set in the 2015-2019 RPJMN of 16% in 2019. Meanwhile, the mix portion EBT in the national primary energy supply reaches 11.2%, lower than the target in the 2020 RKP of 13.4%. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the achievements of the development of geothermal, bio-energy and other PLT ET are 2,131 MW, 1,904 MW, and 6,246 MW, respectively. This achievement is still below the targets set in the 2020 RKP of 2,273 MW, 1922.5 bio-energy and other PLT ET, respectively. The increase in energy use efficiency can be indicated by the value of the primary energy intensity. Primary energy intensity is the amount of primary energy supply needed to produce each unit of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The lower the energy intensity figure in Barrel of Oil Equivalent (BOE) per unit of GDP (constant 2000 prices), the more productive and efficient the use of energy in a country is. During the 2015-2019 period, energy intensity decreased by 76.1 BOE/billion Rupiah, BOE/billion Rupiah in 2015 to 424.87 BOE/Billion Rupiah in 2019. This achievement in 2019 is equivalent to 140.6 BOE/BIB billion rupiah (in constant 2010 GDP at constant prices). The installed capacity of electricity generation from renewable energy (in Watts per capita) is used to describe the priority to use renewable energy to meet the energy needs of the 321 population for one year. This indicator continues to increase from 33.26 Watts per capita in 2015 to 38.42 Watts per capita in 2019, along with an increase in EBT generation capacity from 8.49 GW in 2015 to 10.30 GW in 2019, or an increase. an average of 451.29 MW per year. B. CHALLENGES In the energy and electricity sector related to Goal 7 Clean and Affordable Energy, there are several main challenges, including: 1. A lthough the national RE achievement is already close to 100%, the challenge of expanding access to electricity is still quite large in several areas, including in the provinces of East Nusa Tenggara, Central Kalimantan, Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, and Papua, especially in remote and geographic areas hard to reach. In 2020 there are still 409 villages without electrification and 3090 LTSHE villages that need access to electricity and increased reliability. 2. I n terms of per capita electricity consumption, the existence of a policy for Work from Home (WfH) has implications for an increase in electricity consumption in the household sector. However, this increase was unable to keep up with the decline in consumption in the industrial and business sectors. Often with better economic growth, the increase in electricity consumption per capita is expected to improve as well. In general, increasing per capita electricity consumption requires efforts to ensure the availability of electricity infrastructure access for the public, industry and business; reduce grid losses, provide competitive electricity rates for industrial and business customers, encourage the use of electric stoves, and encourage the use of electric vehicles. 3. S ome of the obstacles from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the construction of city Jargas , among others, are obstacles to the mobilization of workers, project materials, to difficulty obtaining spare parts. This fact has resulted in an adjustment to the cumulative target for Jargas development in the 2021 RKP update to 715,800 SR or an additional target of 42,578 SR from the 2020 achievements. construction of Jargas in the 2015-2019 period which only relies on funding from the state budget and assignments to business entities. 4. T he COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the development of New and Renewable Energy (EBT). This is due to the low price of fossil energy or fuel oil ( Bahan Bakar Minyak /BBM), decreased demand for B30 which directly reduces the use of Biodiesel, and disruption of the supply chain for the implementation of EBT-based power generation projects, including jobs that require experts from abroad which ultimately results in slow EBT development. C. POLICY RESPONSE In order to achieve the goal of ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all levels of society by 2030 and to support economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic, priority programs carried out in accordance with RKP 2021 are: 1. S trengthening the provision of affordable energy; In an effort to restore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, various important activities carried out in relation to Goal 7 are as follows: opening up \"labor-intensive\" jobs in the energy, minerals and mining sectors, through (a) accelerating the development of renewable energy which is supported setting feed-in tariff (FIT) policies, reducing import duties, relaxing the Domestic Component Level ( Tingkat Kandungan Dalam of \"strategic reserves\" by utilizing idle tanks in old refineries that are not producing and using old field wells that are no longer producing as storage for imported crude oil; and (c) INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 322 accelerating the construction of smelters for downstream minerals in the country. 2. I ncreasing access and supply of energy and electricity The policy direction for infrastructure development in 2021 related to Goal 7 will be focused on efforts to support the post-COVID-19 economic recovery, namely the development of targeted energy and electricity subsidies including reducing payment of electricity bills and encouraging synergies between the supply of energy and electricity with various government programs. The government has attempted to provide electricity bill relief stimulus for more than 33 million PLN electricity customers for household, business, industrial, social and special service consumers with provisions that have been set by the Government (household sector with a power of 450 VA and household customers of 900 VA subsidized; social and small business 450 VA).In the 2021 RKP, several Major Projects have been established which will directly support the achievement of the 7th goal of the SDGs, namely: 1. Development of Palm Oil-based Green Fuel Renewable Energy; 2. 27,000 MW Power Plant, 19,000 KMS Transmission and 38,000 MVA Substation; 3. City Gas Network Infrastructure for 4 Million House Connections; 4. Trans Kalimantan Natural Gas Pipeline (2,219 km) 323 Goal 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure Sustainable and inclusive economic growth needs to be supported by infrastructure development to support national connectivity, industrial growth and expansion to support the growth of the labor-intensive sector, and the development of innovation by using technology to increase competitiveness and productivity. A. TREND ANALYSIS 1. INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CONNECTIVITY Accelerating infrastructure development is needed for equitable development throughout Indonesia, especially in the eastern region. For this reason, it is necessary to facilitate integrated and well-connected and integrated regional infrastructure, particularly road and transportation infrastructure, both sea and air transportation, including information and communication networks, so as to create national connectivity. This connectivity can also support industrial growth as one of the largest contributors to GDP, and absorb a large amount of labor. Infrastructure development has become a priority for the national agenda, particularly infrastructure for inter-regional connectivity. After the pandemic, many infrastructure projects have stopped, but priority projects, especially for smooth logistics distribution, are still being implemented. The length of railway line development continues to increase from 6,222 km in 2019, to 6,357 in 2020. This is also in line with the number of ferry ports, where in 2019 there were an additional 24, and in 2020 there were an additional 6. 2. LABOR INTENSIVE INDUSTRY The manufacturing industry sector is one of the strategic sectors in boosting national economic development and improving people's welfare. The manufacturing industry sector is able to absorb a large number of workers so that its role in increasing household income and reducing poverty is very crucial. For the manufacturing industry, the proportion of value added to GDP decreased from 21.54 in 2015 to 20.61 in 2020. This trend is not in line with the proportion of its workforce, which has continued INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 324 to increase from 13.5 in 2015 to 14.91 in 2019. However, like the labor conditions affected by the pandemic, the proportion of workers in the manufacturing industry sector also experienced a decline to 13.61 in 2020. Figure 4.170 Proportion of Value Added of Manufacturing Industry Sector to GDP and Growth Rate of Manufacturing Industry Source: Statistics Indonesia To support sustainable industrial growth and integrated infrastructure development, various researches are needed to encourage the creation of various innovations that can be used in efforts for economic growth, especially after the pandemic. Various innovations are created to support the production of high-tech industrial products. The proportion of exports of high-tech industrial products continues to increase from 20.80 in 2017 to 22.26 in 2019, but has decreased to 21.38 in 2020 after the pandemic.

CHALLENGES In the Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure sectors related to Goal 9, there are several main challenges, including: 1. I nfrastructure development to support connectivity in equitable development needs to be continuously improved, particularly the integration of all existing infrastructure. 2. T he role of small industries needs to be continuously strengthened, especially in the post-pandemic period. 3. T he need for a larger budget allocation for R&D (Research and Development), and not only depending on government funding, but it is necessary to explore funding collaboration with non-government parties such as the private sector. 4. D ata, especially sectoral data, are not yet centralized in one place, making the data collection process difficult. C. POLICY RESPONSE Policies to support the achievement of Goal 9 are directed towards infrastructure development for connectivity, growth of labor-intensive, inclusive and sustainable industries, as well as research, technology and innovation. In an effort to ensure infrastructure development for connectivity, inclusive and sustainable industrial growth, and innovation to support sustainable development, various policies are formulated in the development agenda. Infrastructure development policies for connectivity are emphasized in PN 5 (Strengthening Infrastructure to Support Economic Development and Basic Services)): 1. I ncreasing regional connectivity through road, rail, sea, air and land connectivity; 2. I ncreased development and utilization of ICT infrastructure, as well as the contribution of the information and communication sector to economic growth through the completion of ICT infrastructure. Labor-intensive, inclusive and sustainable industrial growth policies are emphasized in PN 1 (Strengthening Economic Resilience for Quality and Equitable Growth) and PN 6 (Building the Environment, Enhancing Disaster Resilience and Climate Change): 1. S trengthening entrepreneurship, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and cooperatives through increasing business capacity and access to finance for entrepreneurs and increasing the creation of start-ups and business opportunities; 2. I ncreasing added value, employment and investment in the real sector and industrialization; 3. I ncreasing high value-added exports and strengthening the Content Level ( Tingkat Kandungan Dalam Negeri / TKDN) through increasing diversification, added value and competitiveness of export products and services; 4. I ncreased achievement of GHG emission reduction against the baseline in the industrial sector. The innovation policy to support economic growth is emphasized in PN 3 (Increasing Quality and Competitive Human Resources) by increasing productivity and competitiveness through increasing science and technology capabilities and creating innovations. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 326 Goal 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities A. TREND ANALYSIS 1. ACCESS TO ADEQUATE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSES The proportion of households with access to adequate and affordable housing continue to increase from 56.51% in 2019 to 59.54% in 2020. Based on 4 (four) aspects of feasibility, the adequacy of building area, building resilience (roofing, floors and walls as proxies), access to improved drinking water and sanitation is quite high. Figure 4.172 Proportion of households with access to adequate and affordable housing, 2019-2020 Source: Susenas 2019 and 2020, Statistics Indonesia Based on household expenditure groups, access to adequate and affordable housing in the bottom 40% and middle 40% groups are still below the national figure, namely 48.69% and 61.21% in 2020, respectively. The discrepancy is seen in the top 20% group with a gap of around 23.65% when compared to the bottom 40%. The disparity in access to adequate and affordable housing occurs between provinces. The province with the highest household access to decent and affordable housing is DI Yogyakarta, reaching 86.19% in 2020. Meanwhile, the province with the lowest access is Papua Province, which is 28.56% in 2020. Figure Error!

ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION The proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport is analyzed based on the number of people who have an access distance within a radius of 0.5 km from their place of residence to public transportation, compared to the number of all residents within the area of the public transportation service. During the period of 2017-2020, the convenient access to public transport increased from 54.67% to 56.01%. The province that has the highest access is North Sulawesi, while DI Yogyakarta ranks the lowest with an achievement of only 34.33%.

WASTE MANAGEMENT Waste management is defined as an effort to reduce and manage household waste and other waste. Based on Ministry of Environment and Forestry's waste management data collected from 290 districts/cities throughout Indonesia, in 2020 the total managed waste was 53.55%. In other words, 46.45% of waste is still unmanaged. Looking at the composition of waste based on its source, the most waste comes from households at 32.4%. Traditional markets and trade centers rank next with the respective percentages of 21.7% and 13.9%. 4. AIR QUALITY During the 2015-2020 period, the air quality index ( Indeks Kualitas Udara /IKU) was relatively fluctuating but in the last two years it has increased, namely by 87.21 in 2020. The IKU value in 2020 reached the highest value due to the decrease in NO2 and SO2 concentrations in districts/cities as a result from decreasing activity from both mobile and immovable sources due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of pollution control policies and activity restrictions.

Figure 4.177 Air Quality Index by Province in 2020 Source: Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 2021 331 B. CHALLENGES The challenges in the achievement of Goal 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities targets include: 1. A dequate and affordable housing: (1) limited access to housing finance, especially for low-income and irregular income groups; (2) the growth of an unstructured urban area (urban sprawl); and (3) guidance and supervision in the housing and settlement areas has not been optimal. 2. A ccess to public transportation: (1) private vehicle growth continues to increase from year to year; and (2) public transportation is not yet the main choice for residents, especially in cities. 3. U rban waste management: (1) the application of the principle of reducing waste is still low and the infrastructure for reducing waste is still low. such as for example: Integrated Waste Management Site ( Tempat Pembuangan Sampah Terpadu /TPST) and ( Tempat Pembuangan Sampah 3R/TPS 3R); (2) lack of waste transport fleets and geographic and accessibility challenges that hinder the waste transportation process; (3) Most of the landfill ( Tempat Pembuangan Akhir /TPA) are still operated with an open dumping system, while the design of the TPA system prepared is a sanitary landfill system; and (4) the commitment of local governments to continue to be improved in waste management in the regions. One form of commitment that must be considered is the financing of solid waste infrastructure for operations and maintenance (O&M). C. POLICY RESPONSE Policies related to Goal 11 include: 1. In the framework of providing access to adequate, safe and affordable housing and settlements, policies are directed at gradually increasing community access to affordable and safe housing and settlements in order to realize an inclusive and livable city. The strategy is focused on three aspects, namely the demand side related to the financing system, from the supply side related to land use and housing provision, and an enabling environment related to collaboration with local governments, communities and business. 2. In addition, the 2020-2024 RPJMN has also planned and budgeted a Major Project for Urban Flats (1 million) as concrete steps to achieve development goals related to urban and sustainable settlements. This Major Project is planned to be integrated between several funding sources such as the State Budget, Regional Budget, and Business Entities. One of the benefits expected from the Major Project is increased community access to affordable and safe housing for a million urban households and dealing with slum settlements. 3. Urban development policies, including: (1) planning for metropolitan areas outside Java; (2) development of metropolitan areas outside Java; (3) improving the quality of the Java metropolitan area; (4) development of big, medium and small cities; (5) construction of new cities; (6) development of the State Capital. 4. Policies related to public transportation access are implemented with the development of an urban mass public transport system prioritizing 6 (six) major metropolitan cities, namely the metropolitan areas of Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Medan, Semarang and Makassar. Urban transportation priority projects include: (1) development of mass public transport systems including in 6 (six) metropolitan areas (Major Projects); (2) development of modal transfer facilities that are integrated with centers of economic activity, settlements and public facilities at transportation nodes, (3) development of non-level crossings between roads and railways in urban areas, (4) construction of INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 332 urban ring roads, and (5) provision of PSO and subsidies for urban mass public transport. 5. Policies in waste management include: (1) waste management from upstream to downstream with the principle of reduction and reuse; (2) strengthening waste reduction campaigns; (3) strengthening the capacity of local governments, regulations and waste management institutions; and (4) monitoring, evaluation and law enforcement. 6. Policies to improve air quality, among others, by improving environmental quality and low carbon development, through prevention, countermeasures, restoration and strengthening of institutions and law enforcement against pollution and damage to natural resources and the environment. 333 Figure 4.178 Area of Marine Protected Areas 2015-2020 Source: Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, 2021 In addition to efforts to increase the area of marine conservation areas, measurements of the quality of management are also carried out by developing measurement/evaluation tools for the effectiveness of the management of marine, coastal and small islands conservation areas. The procedure for determining marine conservation areas refers to Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries Regulation (Permen KP) No. 2 Year 2009 on Procedures for Designating Marine Protected Areas.

TREND ANALYSIS 1. AREA OF MARINE PROTECTED AREAS Indonesia has succeeded in increasing the area of marine protected areas by 24.1 million ha (101.3%) from the 2020 target of 23.8 million ha. The area of marine conservation area comes from: (a) 10 conservation areas managed by the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries covering an area of 5.3 million hectares, (b) 161 conservation areas managed by the provincial government covering an area of 14.2 million hectares and (c) 30 conservation areas managed by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry covering an area of 4.6 million ha. Million hectare INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 334 2. PROPORTION OF FISH STOCKS WITHIN SAFE BIOLOGICAL LIMITS Indonesia consistently updates fish stock assessment in the sea, to estimate the value of the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) and the amount of allowable catch (Total Allowable Catch/TAC). The amount of catch allowed is 80% of its maximum sustainable potential (Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, FAO 1995). In 2011, the MSY was set at 6.52 million tons (Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries Decree (Kepmen KP) No.45/2011); furthermore in 2016, the MSY value was set at 9.93 million tons (Kepmen KP No.47/2016); and finally in 2017, the MSY value was set at 12.54 million tons (Kepmen KP No.50/2017). Fish resources in the Indonesian sea cover 37% of the world's fish species, of which several types have high economic value, such as tuna, shrimp, lobster, reef fish, various types of ornamental fish, shellfish, and seaweed. The sustainable potential of Indonesia's marine fish resources is estimated at 12.54 million tons per year, which are scattered in Indonesian territorial waters and the waters of the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone ( Zona Eksklusif Ekonomi Indonesia /ZEEI). Of all the potential fish resources, the total allowable catch (TAC) is 10.03 million tons per year or about 80% of the sustainable potential. In 2020, national capture fishery production will reach 7.70 million tons, consisting of capture fisheries production in mainland public waters of 0.56 million tons and marine capture fisheries production of 7.14 million tons or 71.14% of the total allowable catch (TAC).

The government has divided fisheries management into 11 Fishery Management Areas ( Wilayah Pengelolahan Perikanan /WPP). Fishery Management Plans for all WPPs have been determined through a Decree of the Minister of Marine and Fisheries. This regulation regulates the distribution of fishing areas through a licensing mechanism, so that fishermen can definitely utilize fishery resources in a sustainable manner and do not exceed safe biological limits. Figure 4.179 Indonesia's Fishery Management Areas Source: Regulation of the Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries of the Republic of Indonesia Number 18/Permen- KP/2014 concerning the State Fisheries Management Area of the Republic of Indonesia (WPPNRI) In 2019, there are 3 WPPNRI (27%) that have mapped the potential of marine and fisheries resources for sustainable marine economic development. The involvement of the central and local governments, academics and non-governmental organizations is needed in mapping the potential of marine and fisheries resources. 4. COMPLIANCE WITH MARINE AND FISHERIES BUSINESS ACTORS The compliance of marine and fishery business actors in utilizing marine and fishery resources is in accordance with the permits and provisions of the stipulated legislation. Achievement of the percentage of compliance (compliance) of marine and fisheries business actors with the provisions of the legislation in force in 2019 amounted to 93.57%. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 336 Law enforcement and the eradication of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing are problems that require high commitment and cross-institutional cooperation at the operational level. Indonesia as an archipelagic country that has the largest water area in the world, has a strong legal basis to combat IUU fishing in Law No. 31 Year 2004 jo Law No. 45 Year 2009 on Fisheries. To combat IUU fishing, the Indonesian Government has implemented a monitoring, control and supervision system, increased cross-agency cooperation related to marine patrols, air patrols and regional cooperation with foreign countries in fighting IUU fishing, increased community participation-based supervision, and licensing arrangement. . B. CHALLENGES The challenges faced in achieving the target of Goal 14 Ocean Ecosystems include: 1. O ptimization of integrated and sustainable management of 11 established WPPs. 2. T he designated marine conservation areas need to be managed more effectively. This requires efforts to improve institutions and infrastructure in the management of marine conservation areas. 3. T he potential for marine capture fisheries production has not been utilized optimally due to the limited fishing fleet (the dominance of traditional fishing fleets) and IUU fishing activities/practices. This requires support for the availability of adequate and modern capture fisheries infrastructure, increasing the capacity of competent human resources in sufficient numbers, and increasing the eradication of IUU fishing activities. 4. A p roper regulatory framework is needed in the mechanism for providing assistance to small-scale fishermen, including support for fishery production facilities and infrastructure as well as facilitating access to finance and marketing, while maintaining sustainable use of fish resources. 5. I mproving sustainable capture fisheries management through optimizing the utilization of fisheries capacity, both in terms of productivity and quality of catches; promoting sustainable fishing practices; strengthening supply chains and traceability mechanisms; improve data reliability for stock assessments and associated management measures; and carry out inclusive fisheries governance at the WPP, national and regional levels. C. POLICY RESPONSE Policies related to Goal 14 Ocean Ecosystems include: 1. Make the Fisheries Management Area (WPP) a spatial basis for sustainable fisheries development, institutional transformation and function of WPP, improving the quality of WPP management, as well as managing and structuring marine spatial and coastal zoning plans. This is supported by conducting comprehensive fisheries stock assessments on a regular basis at 11 WPP locations, developing a Sustainable Fisheries Platform for all stakeholders, and structuring permits. 2. Managing marine ecosystems and utilization of marine services in a sustainable manner. 3. Increasing welfare and empowerment as well as protection of small-scale marine and fisheries businesses as well as access to fishery resource management. 4. Increasing human resources and maritime, marine and fisheries research, as well as strengthening marine and fisheries databases. 337 5. Preventing and restoring damage to marine resources through conservation and rehabilitation of water, coastal areas and small islands, and prevention of marine pollution. 6. Combating illegal, unreported and unregulated and destructive fishing (IUU and destructive fishing). INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 338 Goal 15 Life on Land A. TREND ANALYSIS 1. CONDITION OF FOREST AREA, AS WELL AS FOREST AND LAND COVER Indonesia continues to maintain its forest area and strives to increase forest and land cover. Until 2019, Indonesia's mainland forest area was recorded at 120.39 million hectares, consisting of: 21.89 million hectares of Conservation Forest, 29.66 million hectares of Protected Forest, and 68.84 million hectares of Production Forest. The condition of forest cover in forested areas until 2019 reached 94.11 million hectares (50.1%), and the land that was not covered by forest (not forested) was 93.64 million hectares (49.9%) of the total area. mainland Indonesia which reaches 187.75 million hectares. 2. FOREST MANAGEMENT UNITS ( KESATUAN PENGELOLAAN HUTAN/KPH) Indonesia seeks to improve forest governance performance through the establishment and operation of Forest Management Units (FMUs). The establishment of an FMU area is divided into Protected Forest Management Units ( Kawasan Pengelolaan Hutan Produksi /KPHP). In 2020, there will be 24 FMUs in both production and protected areas. There are 10 Production Forest Management Units (KPHP), while 14 Protected Forest Management Units (KPHL). The establishment of FMUs is very important to overcome various problems in forest management at the site level, such as illegal activities (logging, hunting, encroaching), theft of germplasm, forest and land fires that are still ongoing in forest areas which have an impact on the destruction of the forest ecosystem. The legal basis for the establishment of FMUs is through Government Regulation Number 23 year 2021 on Forestry Management. 3. FOREST AND LAND REHABILITATION ( REHABILITASI HUTAN DAN LAHAN /RHL) In addition, in 2020 the government formed the Peat and Mangrove Restoration Agency through Presidential Regulation No. (Perpres) No. 120 Year 2020 on the Peat and Mangrove Restoration Agency ( Badan Restorasi Gambut dan Mangrove /BRGM) with a Peat Restoration target of 1,200,000 339 hectares and a Mangrove Rehabilitation target of 600,000 hectares within 4 years. Presidential Decree No. 120 Year 2020 on the Peat and Mangrove Restoration Agency (BRGM) is a continuation of the peat restoration efforts that have been carried out by the Peat Restoration Agency ( Badan Restorasi Gambut / BRG) which was formed through Presidential Decree No. 1 Year 2016 on the Peatland Restoration Agency (BRG). BRG has succeeded in realizing the peatland restoration program by December 2019, reaching 778,181 hectares. 4. HIGH CONSERVATION VALUE (HCV) AREAS Conservation area management is carried out with conservation principles, namely the protection of the ecosystem as a life support system, preservation of natural and genetic resources, and sustainable use. Indonesia has designated a High Conservation Value (HCV) area of 33.71 million hectares. This area consists of a conservation area of 27.04 million hectares, an essential conservation area of 1.08 million hectares and an essential ecosystem area with high conservation value of 5.58 million hectares. High conservation value (HCV) areas are areas that contain important environmental and social values. These values include, among other things, wildlife habitat (key species/mega fauna), water catchment protection areas and archaeological (cultural) sites. These values are calculated as very significant or very important, both locally, regionally and globally (Consortium revised HCV Toolkit Indonesia, 2008). In other words, high conservation value areas are forest areas that have important biodiversity, both at the ecosystem level, population to species level, including in areas which are priority animal pockets whose home ranges reach and enter into essential ecosystem area ( Kawasan Ekosistem Esensial /KEE). 5. LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND FORESTRY SECTOR The Indonesian government has a strong commitment to law enforcement in the environmental and forestry sector. The filing of court cases (P.21) for violations of the criminal law against illegal logging and trade in wild animal plants ( Tumbuhan dan Satwa Liar /TSL) from year to year continues to show an increase. Criminal law enforcement is one of the important pillars in law enforcement activities after administrative sanctions and civil law enforcement. The implementation of environmental and forestry law enforcement is divided into 6 (six) typologies, namely: 1) illegal logging, 2) forest encroachment, 3) illegal flora and fauna (TSL) circulation, 4) environmental pollution, 5) forest fires and land, and 6) environmental damage. Most cases are cases with a typology of illegal logging and the circulation of illegal TSL. During 2019, as many as 104 cases of illegal logging (54.74%) and 65 cases of illegal TSL circulation (34.21%) had been handled up to P.21. Challenges in law enforcement in the environmental and forestry sector include, among others, the wide coverage of work areas throughout the archipelago that must be monitored, as well as the limited human resources. B. CHALLENGES Environmental damage, especially in terrestrial ecosystems, is caused by violations of law in the field of natural resources and the environment, such as illegal logging, forest and land fires, mining without permits, and illegal forest control. In addition, there is a reduction in the ideal habitat area for endangered species on four large islands (Sumatera, Java, Kalimantan and processed by P.21 in 2015-2020 Source: Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 2021 Sulawesi) which is driven by an increase in monoculture plantation areas which further depress forest cover and can lead to increased loss of biodiversity if not treated immediately. Another obstacle faced in restoring ecosystems is the settlement of land tenure status (clear and clean) so that land conflicts can be avoided. C. POLICY RESPONSE 1. Recovery of pollution and damage to natural resources and the environment, which is carried out by: (1) restoration and restoration of peatlands; (2) forest and land rehabilitation; (3) restoring ex-mining and land contaminated with hazardous and toxic waste; (4) restore damage to the coastal and marine environment; (5) restoring the habitat of endangered species; and (6) increasing the population of endangered wild plant and animal species. 2. Reducing the rate of deforestation in Indonesia, through: (1) restructuring Indonesia's forest area allocation; (2) using technology and information in land use and forest areas towards Forestry 4.0; (3) developing incentive and disincentive mechanisms for forest management; and (4) increasing community management access rights in forest management 3. Reducing the rate of forest degradation by: (1) continuing the moratorium policy on suspending permits or concessions for the use of primary forest; (2) optimizing utilization of plantation forests; and (3) continuing the peat protection policy.

Two important national agendas was accomplished quite well, namely parliamentary and presidential elections, with the voter participation rate of 82% for each type of election. Through the two elections the country was able to move forward with a new development plan, the RPJMN 2020-2024\u2014where the SDGs are mainstreamed, which means implementing SDGs is implementing the national development agenda. The national development plan and the SDGs as an integrated development plan were reported in the 2017 and 2019 VNRs. This section describes the country's SDGs means of implementation through the pandemic-related policies, data provision, technology, coordination, and capacity building. 5.1 POLICIES TO RESPOND THE PANDEMIC As the economy was declining, strategic plans were needed for economic recovery. Government Regulation (GR) 23/2020, and its revision in GR 43/2020, on economic recovery program was released to accommodate strategies for economic recovery. This was followed by the enactment of Law 2/2020 on the State Budget Policy and Financial System Stability to respond the pandemic. The President also released a regulation on the establishment of the COVID-19 Response and the National Economic Recovery Committee ('Peraturan Presiden', Perpres/Presidential Regulation) 82/2020. The Perpres mandated expansion of the previous works of the task force 53 by including two new units, namely policy committee and special task force for national economic recovery and transformation. The overall policy serial is depicted in Figure 5.1. 53 A special task f orce was previously established through a presidential decree, namely 'Keputusan Presiden' (Keppres/ Presidential Decree) 7/2020, to work in five arenas: (1) national health resilience; (2) management of COVID-19 pandemic; (3) monitoring of COVID-19 distribution and escalation; (4) operational policy actions; and (5) COVID-19 prevention, detection, and response. 343 Figure 5.1 The COVID-19 Cases and Policy ResponsesDATE GOVERNMENT POLICY AND RESPONSES 02/03/2020The Government AnnouncementCase 01 and Case 02 13/03/2020Presidential Decree 7/2020Establishment of COVID-19 Control Task Force 20/03/2020Presidential Decree 9/2020Revised version of Keppres 7/2020 31/03/2020Government Regulation In Lieu of Law 1/2020State Budget Policy and Financial System Stability to Cope with the Impacts of COVID-19 on National Economy and Financial System Stability 31/03/2020Government Regulation 21/2020Large Scale Social Restriction 31/03/2020Presidential Decree 11/2020Health Emergency Status 09/05/2020Government Regulation 23/2020National Economic Recovery Program 16/05/2020 Law 2/2020State Budget Policy and Financial System Stability to Cope with the Impacts of COVID-19 on National Economy and Financial System Stability 20/07/2020Presidential Regulation 82/2020Establishment of National Committee for COVID-19 and Economic Recovery 08/04/2020Government Regulation 43/2020Revised version of PP 23/2020 Figure 5.1 The COVID-19 Cases dan Policy Responses Figure Error!

A total of 366 regulations specifically regulates the COVID-19 pandemic response. In addition, there are various derivatives of national policies and local government policy initiatives. The Government of Indonesia also sets public health policies. The government announced a status on public health emergency and determines it as a non-natural disaster. To reduce the rate of increase in cases, the government established Large-Scale Social Restrictions (LSSR) and intensified the obligation to implement health protocols. As one of the steps to reduce the rate of transmission, the government is also committed to carrying out a universal vaccination, which has been rolled out since the beginning of 2021.

The goal is to reduce legal uncertainty caused by overlapping policies. The Indonesian government has also issued a special policy on the village funds that is usually allocated for the development of villages and their communities, so it could be utilized for economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic translated into activities on COVID-19 pandemic prevention and treatment efforts and for social protection schemes. At the micro level, a series of government policy actions was also made, released as summarized in Table 5.1. The government response is a mitigation strategy to prevent the overall economy falling to a deeper crisis through maintaining the activities of economy in production and consumption. In the production side, the focus was directed to support small and medium enterprises (SMEs), State-owned Companies (SOCs), banking and industrial sectors in general. In the consumption side, specific interventions were emphasized for the poor and unemployed labors. This is due to the income declines experiences by workers during the pandemic. A survey found that people who were still working in August 2020 also reported income declines with high prevalence across all sectors 54. Figure 5.3 clearly shows a comparative situation in the household level, those that are out of employment, have loss of income, and have shortage of food were the three issues emerged during the crisis.

Meanwhile, the BPS survey of 34,559 businesses throughout Indonesia shows the following picture. First, 24.31% of businesses reduced their working hours, and reduce their use of machinery and labor. Second, 58.76% of businesses stopped their activities. Third, 5.45% businesses have applied WFH for some their employees and 2.05% have applied with WFH for all employees. However, fourth, most (58.95%) businesses continue to run as they would pre-pandemic. Even, fifth, although only in a small portion, there were some others businesses (0.49%) running with more economic activities than pre-pandemic. From these findings, it is apparent that policies in place have been targetted to address economic recovery.Figure 5.4 and Table 5.2 below shows a more detailed illustration on how the poor and unemployed had been assisted by the government with a number of programs. The assistances included cash transfer, food staple support, and subsidy. A technical model simulation 56 indicates that the assistances had likely softened the impact of the pandemic on poverty despite the projected lower growth and weaker labor market. The simulation also shows that without the assistances, 8.5 million people would fall into poverty. However, with better implementation and non-error targeting scenarios, it would ensure social protection for the poor and those most vulnerable to become poor. These findings show that the assistances could be highly effective in protecting the bottom 30% of households and, even, the households in the middle of the distribution, i.e., 40th to 80th percentile. 55 W orld Bank (2020).

First, on 31 March 2020, the government enacted Regulation lieu of Law 1/2020 on State Budget Policy and Financial System Stability. Second, on 16 May 2020, the government and the parliament agreed to raise up the regulation into a law, called Law 2/2020. On the basis of this law, it was allowable for the state budget to take a wider deficit\u2014from 3% by the Law No 17/2003 on State Budget to 6% of GDP\u2014to respond to fiscal expansion as a counter-cyclical policy. The counter-cyclical measure was done by amplifying the spending from IDR 2,309 trillion in 2019 to IDR 2,739 trillion in 2020 to boost the decline in economic activities. Later on, it is evident that the economy fell, but soon grew at the negative rate of -2%, while its pre-pandemic number was on average around 5% (Figure 5.5).

The Central Bank is allowed to purchase the government bonds. The purchases during the first half of the year 2020 were aimed at maintaining and improving the functioning of bond markets due to of a large exit of investors from the country's bond market. Later on, as the World Bank (2020) indicates, since July, the purchases had also funded to finance the government deficit. The purchase of the Central Bank might, to a certain degree, compensate the decrease in the government revenues, especially in the tax revenue. In the midst of limited resources, the government has to strengthen efforts in generating revenues from other sources like the sovereign bond, whilst at the same time to prepare a room of maneuver for the Central Bank to involve. The Central Bank had also been successful in maintaining the inflation low (at the rate of 1.6%, while the target was 2-4%) and the Rupiah currency relatively stable. Nevertheless, the negative economic growth and dormant domestic demand had opened a substantial negative output gap. Under the negative gap and low oil price, the Central Bank had maintained the interest rates at the acceptable range of territory. With these records, the economy is projected to begin rebounding in 2021 and further improve in 2022, while at the same time the SDGs performance is expected to return to its improving trend. The government was not alone in its effort to recover from the pandemic. There was a mechanism established to share the burden between the government and the Central Bank of Indonesia\u2014a partnership in the hard times. Under Regulation lieu of Law No. 1/2020 on State Finance and Financial System Stability, the government opens an opportunity for the Central Bank to play its role as the last resort. The law later on is replaced by Law No. 2/2020. The replaced law authorizes the Central Bank to buy the remaining government bond in the first offering of the primary market in case the market cannot fully absorb the bond. This measure allows the Central Bank to support the government in financing the fiscal deficit, which is conditional to the pandemic. The joint decree between and the government and the Central Bank in April 2020 further regulates the Figure Error!

This includes a proposal to buy via a sequential series of stages, namely non-competitive bidding mechanism, green-shoe option, and private placement in case the bond target is not achieved yet. At the same instant, the law also allows the Central Bank to buy the (repo) bond of the Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation ('Lembaga Penjamin Simpanan'\u2014LPS) if the pandemic is considered to have serial systemic impacts on the solvability of banking sector. The LPS itself is also permitted to raise its ceiling of guarantee from IDR 1 billion to IDR 2 billion per depositor's bank account. In the meanwhile, the Financial Service Authority ('Otoritas Jasa Keuangan', OJK) is also allowed to do merger, consolidation, taking-over, integration, and conversion of banks and other financial institutions. There are still some other measures in the law conditional to the pandemic, but it prioritized collaboration among stakeholders in initiatives and shared burden during these hard times. In the midst of limited resources, it is understandable that the government also needs other sources, such as sovereign bonds. In the near future, the government will again issue a new sovereign bond in which its preparation process was carried out before the pandemic. At the end of 2019, Indonesia had succeeded issuing Green Sukuk in the international financial market. Green Sukuk offers nine sectors to the market for financing, namely renewable energy, energy efficiency, climate change resilience, sustainable transportation, waste management, sustainable natural resource management, green tourism, green buildings, and sustainable agriculture. These are sectors that are considered priorities in responding to the challenges of climate change after Indonesia ratified the 2016 Paris Agreement and established Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). After the success of the Green Sukuk, the government will issue SDGs Bond with the same expectations of success. In issuing this bond, the Indonesian government involves stakeholders in a fairly long list to the market, each with their respective roles joint lead manager and joint bookrunners 57 , joint green structuring advisor58, and transaction co-managers59. The SDGs Bond is directed to finance a number of SDGs projects throughout the country. Currently, the ongoing administration process is in the project selection stage and budget tagging. This Indonesian SDGs Bond will be the second SDGs Bond in the world after Mexico introduced it to the market in 2020 but will be the first in the Asia Pacific. In the meantime, the future \"green\" issues\u2014or issues of sustainability in general\u2014will be the direction of national development. Responsible investors are growing and always demanding new financial approaches and products. Sustainable finance also needs to be adopted and adapted to new trends in sustainable development projects. The meeting place for these matters lies in the domestic and international financial markets, where \"profit, people, and planet\" will be a serious matter to consider in the decision-making process. In other words, some adjustments to the new characteristics of the market will be needed; and Indonesia must be prepared for these market changes. The OJK has issued the Second Phase of Sustainable Finance Roadmap which focuses on the enabling environment to create transparent regulations, to build synergies in collaboration with relevant ministries/agencies and stakeholders, and to improve the capabilities of the financial industry. The OJK is currently in the process of developing a green taxonomy for several strategic objectives, namely developing standard definitions and information disclosures for green investment, encouraging green 57 Deutsche Bank A G, Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC, Maybank Invest - ment Bank Berhad, PT Mandiri Sekuritas, HSBC, BNP Paribas, and Standard Chartered. 58 BNP P aribas and HSBC 59 P T Bahana Sekuritas, PT Danareksa Sekuritas, and PT Trimegah Sekuritas Indonesia Tbk. 351 domestic financial market growth, increasing attractiveness for responsible investors, assisting in monitoring and tracking public expenditure and investment to achieve sustainable goals along with the pre-defined categories and in line with international best practices, provide a signal to investors and financial markets more broadly that the government is promoting sustainable development, as well as identify areas where investment is still needed. 5.3 DATA PROVISION TThe aforementioned policies and programs would not be possible to be executed without the Integrated Data Base of the bottom 40% of population. The Data Base is managed, maintained, and developed by a national team for poverty alleviation acceleration\u2014called TNP2K (Tim Nasional Percepatan Penanggulangan Kemiskinan)\u2014established 10 years ago via Presidential Regulation 15/2010. Two other institutions, namely Statistics Indonesia (BPS) and the Ministry of Social Affairs, also play crucial roles in collecting, producing, and utilizing the data. With some notes on the needs for data improvement, especially the reliability and validity of data, it is evident that during the pandemic the data was reliable and valid, thus adequately supported policy making. This also emphasized the importance of high-quality statistics and data in support of SDGs implementation. Apart from Goal 17, through the underlying policy actions, the data also supported and facilitated the achievement of Goal 1 for No Poverty, Goal 2 for No Hunger, Goal 4 for Quality Education in social development pillar as well as Goal 8 for Decent Work and Economic Growth and Goal 9 for Industry, Infrastructure and Innovation\u2014and feasibly Goal 10 for Reducing Inequality\u2014in economic development pillar. On top of these, the use of the data and other health data in a series of policies in health sector undoubtedly also had facilitated the achievement of Goal 3 for Good Health and Well-Being during the pandemic. In the beginning the data consisted of eligible names of the country's citizens\u2014with the corresponding addresses\u2014for the social protection program, covering about 92 million people within 25 million households nationwide. It was first generated on the basis of three data enumerations, namely the 2010 Population Census, the 2010 National Socio-Economic Survey, and the 2010 Village Potential to be merged in an initiative called 'Pendataan Program Perlindungan Sosial' (PPLS, Data Management for Social Protection Program) 2011 60. The data is updated regularly to adjust with dynamic changes in the field. Amid the pandemic, the Minister of Social Affairs enacted a ministerial decree ('Keputusan Menteri', 'Kepmen') No. 19/HUK/2020 on Integrated Data for Social Welfare 2020 updating the previous 2019 ('Kepmen' 8/HUK/2019) data. The 2020 list records 27.7 million households, 29.7 million families, and 96.9 million household members. In addition to this, the 'Kepmen' also includes adat communities totalling 1,534 households, 1.535 families, and 6,234 family members. There are still 631,000 people listed but outside of the two groups. These eligible names were the specific targets of the various aforementioned social safety net and social protection programs in the pandemic to be executed (Table 5.3) to the bottom-40% population. 60 The PPL S is rooted in an initiative called Socio-Economic Data Management ('Pendataan Sosial Ekonomi', PSE) 2005 to identify the targets of a cash transfer program.

Apart from the data for targeting program, the government also established the online pandemic data, updated daily. There are two interconnected sources of the pandemic data. First, the one in the Ministry of Health; called 'Infeksi Emerging', published in https://infeksiemerging.kemkes.go.id/, where the COVID-19-related data is located in a special section 61. This special section reports various information about the health standard protocol and manuals, underlying regulations, including the daily data of the infectious COVID-19. The last data is composed of, in detail, number of tested people, number of confirmed positive case, number of recovered cases, number of death-related the virus, and number of negative cases. Various comparisons with other countries are also displayed. Second, the data published by the country's special task force, named the National Committee for the COVID-19 Response and Economic Recovery\" (' Komite Penanganan COVID-19 and Pemulihan Ekonomi Nasional ', as described earlier, presented in https://covid19.go.id/. This site is also known in a tagline \" Bersatu Melawan COVID-19\" (literally, \"Together fighting against COVID-19\"). Apart from basic information of the COVID-19\u2014protocols, regulations, announcement, Q&A's, and others\u2014the website also informs two maps of the COVID-19: the map of infected cases and the map of the risk zones. While the former map depicts number of cases, the latter displays four risk categorizations\u2014no case, low, medium, and high risk; and all are disaggregated into district-city administration level. In visual graphs, the former records of numbers of positive case, recovery, and death. Also, in visual graphs, using 10 health indicators, the latter classifies provinces across the country into one of the four COVID-19 risk categorizations. Furthermore, there are several other sites disclosing information about the pandemic, namely the \"Indonesia COVID-19 Hub\" (https://bnpb-inacovid19.hub.arcgis.com/) and \"Kawal COVID-19\" (https://kawalcovid19.id/). The former \"Indonesia Hub\", is a hub managed by BNPB with GIS-based data, which is also connected to the National and Subnational Task Force for COVID-19 Response. In addition, this site is also linked to the Ministry of Health's \"Emerging Infection\" website. The latter site, \"Kawal COVID-19\" (literally, \"monitoring COVID-19\"), is a voluntary contribution from the community that provides information on the dynamics of the pandemic on field. Information from this site can also be accessed via an application that can be downloaded for easier user experience. 61 ht tps://infeksiemerging.kemkes.go.id/document/download/cover?category=kie-covid-19.353 The cover page of \"Infeksi Emerging\" website https://infeksiemerging.kemkes.go.id/ The cover page of \"Hub InaCOVID-19\" https://bnpb-inacovid19.hub.arcgis.com/ The cover page of cover page of \"Bersatu Melawan COVID-19\" Figure 5.6 The Websites of COVID-19 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 354 The media, academia, and general public have access to all of this available information. Even in the last three quarters of 2020, every day the media updates the COVID-19 status. During that time, daily news in media was focused on COVID-19: new infected cases, new number of deaths and recovered cases\u2014and additional inputs from experts and the public. The data was not only beneficial for evidence-based policy making, but has also supported news and research 62. 5.4 TECHNOLOGY Technology plays a pivotal role in facilitating the collection of data, especially during the pandemic, to show dynamic changes in people's social behavior and market activities. Geo-tagging location from mobile phones, Google Mobility Index reports that between March and December 2020 there was a 20% drop of people mobility, on average, if compared to pre-pandemic as the baseline. Sharp drops were found in people's activities in transit stations (-37%), work places (-23%), as well as retail and recreation (-21%), while limited mobility was found in residential places with positive changes of the index (11%). It is apparent, as shown in Figure 5.7 that, the first three months after the announcement of the first two Corona-infected cases in March, people's mobility decreased sharply; and after the announcement of area-based lock down in April, the drop was more significant. Local limited mobility around residential areas affected other types of mobility. By the beginning of June 2020, the decrease in mobility was stagnant; the mobility to grocery and pharmacy stores-located areas increased to its pre-pandemic mobility. The latter may indicate the need of people for buying their daily necessities. 62 tBy 13 April 2021, the Google Scholar thr ough its search engine informed 28,200 results for a diction of \"Indonesia COVID-19\", limited to the year of 2020-2021. Articles from various disciplines use the aforementioned sources of data, apart from their owned-field data gathered during the pandemic time.Figure 5.7 Google Mobility Index Source: Community Mobility Report: https://www.google.com/COVID19/mobility/ Accessed 23 March 2021 355 Face-to-face social interactions were replaced by a handful selection of online platform: Zoom, MS Teams, Google Meet, or Skype, in addition to existing social online interactions through social media platforms of WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Facebook, Twitter, or Tiktok. People from different age group, regions, gender, and social classes are involved massively in these platforms. To illustrate, among the two billion of WhatsApp users over the global, Indonesia was ranked at the third place; 63 and by December 2020 the WhatsApp users in Indonesia were about 143 million. 64 Apart from social media concerns, work and school from home were proved challenging, along with the loss of direct interpersonal communication\u2014discussion, developing empathy, and so on. 65 In addition to the socio- economic context of the underlying causes, limited access and even unavailability of internet infrastructure are the challenges of work and schoold from home. On the contrary, those with internet access benefit from the availability of infrastructure. The government has started investing in fiber optic-based backbone communication infrastructure for 36,000 km to reach around 500 districts in the country\u2014the so-called Palapa Ring Project. In the meantime, economic activities were conducted through various online transactions of goods and services, the e-commerce, using also various platforms\u2014in which some of the platforms are classified as unicorns (see the previous chapter on Goal 17). The circulation of money through these platforms is significant. Last year, the e-commerce transactions totalled to IDR 90.3 trillion, or about 50% increase compared to the figure in 2019 66. At the same time, the online transaction is also marked by an impressive growth in fintech\u2014financial technology\u2014platform. Fintech has become a connecting bridge towards financial inclusion to reach those who have no access to the banking sector, especially during the pandemic. The Financial Service Authority ('Otoritas Jasa Keuangan', OJK) data shows that by December 2020 the outstanding of lending was about IDR 15 trillion\u2014IDR 2 trillion increase if compared to the figure in December 2019\u2014involving 137 million accounts (Table 5.4). Until the last year, there was 149 peer-to-peer lending institutions registered in the OJK. The quality of lending in December 2109 and December 2020 both were above 95%. This indicated the high success of lending to get repaid, albeit the impact of the COVID-19 was also felt as clearly seen in the declining trend of the quality of lending 67 in March, June, and September consecutively about 95.8%, 93.9%, and 91.7%. The same table also shows the average loan value of around IDR 100 million (USD 6,944) which more or less reflects the customers facilitated by the fintech. Knowing the size of transaction in the fintech, the Central Bank released the Payment Gate Blueprint 2025 ('Sistem Pembayaran Indonesia', SPI 2025). The Blueprint is a direction for the financial stakeholders in 5 areas, namely (1) the integration of national economy and financial digital, (2) the digitalization of banking sector, (3) the interlink between the banking and fintech sectors, (4) the balance between financial innovation and consumer protection, and (5) the promotion of national interest in the international financial-economic digital. The Blueprint considers three types of the latest technology, namely artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and block chain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). In addition to this, through other three types of approach\u2014industrial, regulatory, and collaborative approaches\u2014the 63 ht yang-penggunanya-sampai-143-juta-ternyata-whatsapp-cu- ma-dipakai-19-persen-orang-amerika-kenapa-bisa-kalah-pam-or-di-negaranya-sendiri?page=all; accessed 13 April 2021. 65 The User 's Experience of Remote Working Survey, UNESCO Jakarta, Juni-Juli 2020. 66 ht tps://money.kompas.com/read/2021/03/24/123355326/bi- catat-aliran-modal-ke-fintech-capai-rp-315-triliun?page=all, accessed 13 April 2021. 67 The qualit y of lending, captured by the TKB 90 (Table 5.4), refers to the capacity of credit repayment within 90 days of lending. INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 356 SPI 2025 takes five areas of initiatives, namely open banking, retail payment system, financial market infrastructure, data development, and regulation. The Payment System is moving the fintech sector towards standardized, real-time and smooth payments so that economic activities can move at lower costs and drive the future growth. Interestingly, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought payment systems into a sharper focus. Changes in market behavior in digital payments, especially face-to-face and touchless payments, are proven to be able to support social distancing policies. This is also stimulated by the 'work from home' policy in almost all parts of Indonesia. The double increase in the number of accounts from 60 million to 137 million involved in the fintech from 2019 to 2020 (Table 5.4) shows that the payment system has supported the economy\u2014through digital overlays, QR codes 68 , and others\u2014from a deteriorating trend in other sectors. At the same time, transaction efficiency is also formed, especially when the pandemic forced the economic activities to continue while the health aspects must also be maintained. 68 In May 2019 Bank Indonesia launched the QR -Code Indonesia Standard (QRIS) as a part of digital transformation. This is in line with the do - mestic real-time payment scheme at the BI-FAST and the local implementation of IS0 20022 as the national payment The Lowest Lending Value (IDR) 1,020 1,716 1,110 1,000 Organizing Overview of Fintech Lending December 2020 357 At the company level, another proxy for e-business can provide a clearer detail. The Startup Report 2020 of the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy (2021) recorded that the top five unicorns of Indonesia booked impressive ecosystem values ranging from US$ 3 billion to almost US$ 11 billion. The five unicorns include (1) 'Gojek' that was initially an online transport network platform company (TNC), (2) 'Tokopedia', a marketplace platform company, (3) 'Traveloka', an online ticket company, (4) 'Bukalapak', a marketplace platform company, and (5) 'OVO', a payment gate company (Figure5. 8). This advancement is confirmed by the report of Startup Genome 69 that rank Indonesia at the second place after India in the top 100 emerging ecosystem rankings (Table 5.5). 69 S tartup Genome built data infrastructure that host more than 1.27 million companies and more than 250 ecosystems that are sustained by a survey of more than 10,000 startup executives (\"The Voice of Entrepreneurs\").

The role of coordination includes monitoring, evaluation and reporting of SDGs achievement, pushing efforts in mobilizing government and non-government funding sources for SDGs financing, and establishing SDGs National Coordination Team (Tim Koordinasi Nasional/TKN) to orchestrate the efforts of sustainable development in national and disseminate and facilitate efforts of sustainable development in subnational level. TKN, supported and facilitated by the SDGs National Secretariat, is responsible to strengthen commitment of SDGs in national to subnational level, and INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 358 work together in synergy with related Ministries/ Institutions as well as relevant stakeholders to implement and achieve SDGs in Indonesia. The role of TKN in a number of areas are first, in introducing and increasing awareness and participation of stakeholders in sustainability issues. Second, in mainstreaming the principle of sustainability in the development agenda of stakeholders. Third, in ensuring that the sustainable development agenda is linked to financing and investment sources\u2014even innovative ones. As mandated by the Presidential Regulation, TKN supported by the SDGs National Secretariat, is responsible for the development of strategic document to ensure smooth implementation of SDGs: the SDGs Roadmap towards 2030, SDGs National and Subnational Action Plans. All of the documents are developed with active participation and collaboration of the four participation platforms\u2014civil society, academia, philanthropy, and business\u2014to develop their own SDGs initiatives and in support of government SDGs initiatives. The development process of the SDGs National and Subnational Action Plan is explained in detail in the technical guidance for the Action Plan development, currently in its second edition. For the SDGs National Action Plan, the process began with the development of technocratic drafts, drafted by the government in consultation with the academia. The technocratic drafts are then published for public consultation. The RAN includes annexes of both government and non-state actors' activities in their contribution to SDGs achievement. The process is reported in the website of the Ministry of Development Planning at http://sdgs.bappenas.go.id/. RAN also includes activities of both government and non-state actors as their contribution to the achievement of SDGs. With the support of the national government, a similar process is conducted by the subnational governments in developing their action plans. Currently there are 29 SDGs Subnational Action Plans developed by the coordination of the provincial government with their respective district/city governments and their non-state actor counterparts. On subnational level, 23 SDGs Centers have been established at the university level, from the western to the eastern parts of the country, to support SDGs implementation and to further disseminate SDGs in their respective regions and areas of concern. To ensure SDGs monitoring and evaluation, a guideline was formulated. This guideline is currently also in its second edition, aligned with revised guidelines for action plans development guidelines. To inform the public on the latest version of the SDGs indicators which are in line with the SDGs Indicator Metadata set by UNStat, Indonesia also developed SDGs Indonesian Metadata. This document is essential to ensure common understanding of SDGs indicators and its measurement to all stakeholders. With these strategic documents, it is expected that all SDGs stakeholders can take part in contributing to the achievement of indicators, in their respective areas of work and concern. 5.6 CAPACITY BUILDING Capacity building is an integral part of leaving no one behind in SDGs implementation. To ensure spread of SDGs awareness to everyone, SDGs has to be disseminated to as many stakeholders, such as academicians, businesses, civil society organizations, subnational governments, youth and children and other relevant stakeholders. Trainings should be conducted to ensure that all stakeholders are equipped with the substance and planning and budgeting of SDGs. An example of a collaboration in capacity building efforts is the establishment of SDG Academy Indonesia, initiated by Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas, Tanoto Foundation, and UNDP Indonesia, was established as a learning institution on the SDGs through three programs that are open to the public, namely mobile learning, leadership, and 359 study abroad programs. Another example is capacity building efforts organized by business sectors, such as the Indonesian Global Compact Network (IGCN), the Indonesian Business Council for Sustainable Development (IBCSD), and the Indonesia office of Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI) that are active in conducting activities to disseminate the information about the SDGs and to bring commercial companies to integrate SDGs in their business process. The Ministry of National Development Planning/ Bappenas also collaborated with the Ministry of State-Owned Companies (BUMN) Affairs to carry out activities to transform the BUMN companies into sustainable businesses. A series of intensive facilitation processes have been carried out with special assistance and involvement of state-owned companies to align their businesses and the CSR activities with SDGs Goals, Targets and indicators. About 100 state-owned companies have mapped their activities linked to the SDGs, and their implementation will be monitored and evaluated regularly. The currently 23 SDGs Center established throughout Indonesia also strengthened capacity building of their subnational government counterpart in planning and implementing SDGs. Development partners continue to support in strengthening capacity in the subnational level, for example bilateral cooperation of Japan-Indonesia through Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on the development of subnational action plans in pilot selected provinces. Capacity building on data was also supported by development partners like UNICEF in developing SDGs dashboard, and UNICEF with UNFPA in developing database on poverty for children and youth. 5.7 POST PANDEMIC: NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE FUTURE OF SDGS Indonesia continues to strive amid the pandemic, with progress in economic growth and strengthened policies in recovery. Efforts should be continued to ensure that the recovery should be closer to a 'V'-shape, illustrating continued rapid recovery and resilience to crisis. There are theories that Indonesia will recover in a 'Nike'-swoosh pattern illustrating a steady pace of recovery, or a 'K'-shape, illustrating widening recovery gap between the rich and the poor, in which the poor does not recover. Lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change; Indonesia needs to focus on natural and unnatural disaster resilience efforts. In the likely event of upcoming crisis, first Indonesia needs strategies in place for recovery in future crises, and second Indonesia continues to adapt new ways of development. Strategies for better recovery are in place, as stated in the Government Work Plan 2021 (Presidential Regulation 86/2020 and revised by Presidential Regulation 122/2020). The two Presidential Regulations focused on seven sectors called 'National Priorities' (NPs). The seven NPs include (1) economic resilience and equitable growth, (2) development gap reduction, (3) qualified human resources, (4) cultural development, (5) basic and economic infrastructure development, (6) environment, disaster resilience, and climate change, and (7) governance and public service transformation. These seven NPs are translated from the RPJMN 2020-2024 with SDGs mainstreaming, thus these NPs are aligned with SDGs. The policies in response to COVID-19 pandemic strive to build forward better. Indonesia is going forward with the development of SDGs National Action Plan, to engage more non-state actors, to achieve our mutual goal of achieving SDGs without leaving no one behind. Relevant with current crises, Indonesia has INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 360 strengthened its development with economic transformation. The pandemic has accelerated the shift to digital ecosystem, seen through the rise of e-commerce during the pandemic. Blended learning and hybrid education have been adopted to facilitate learning process, and telemedicine has been utilized. Other production sectors\u2014agriculture, mining, manufacture, services\u2014will soon follow. The use of artificial intelligence, internet of things, cloud computing, 3D printing, and robotics will be more common in the future. Government continue to adopt digital ecosystem. In tax system, e-filling, e-billing, e-form, and the likes has been introduced since 4-5 years ago. E-planning and e-budgeting have also been developed and integrated further. In 2020, the experience of theOnline Population Census proved that Indonesia is ready to implement e-administration. The current rolling out of the vaccine is also supported by an integrated national digital ecosystem. The use of digital ecosystem also extends to other public services such as suggestions and complaints delivered via social media, as well as the use of social network data to map political participation. This picture of the near future is very relevant to SDGs implementation. Indonesia strives to achieved SDGs targets, emphasizing on sustainable development for sustainable recovery and resilience from future crisis. In line with SDGs implementation by leaving no one behind, participation and involvement of all relevant stakeholders in all sectors is key for a more inclusive and sustainable development. 361 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021362 6CONCLUSION AND FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS The follow-up action for the acceleration of the implementation of the 2030 agenda. Indonesia is committed to the successful implementation of the SDGs in the context of achieving the 2030 development agenda and continuously striving to become a sovereign, advanced, fair, and prosperous country. The achievement of the SDGs target since 2020 has experienced a slowdown as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the perfect opportunity for transformation or radical change, namely, recovery of industry, tourism and investment towards green economy, reform of national health system, reform of social protection system, and reform of disaster resilience system. Indonesia is moving towards an inclusive and sustainable economic transformation to build forward better, by increasing the role of industry manufacturing and services, strengthening the domestic economy through maintaining inter-island connectivity, green growth program, digital transformation and human resource that are competitive at the global level. The Indonesian Transformation Agenda is expected to drive the achievement of the 2030 development agenda which provides a solid foundation for achieving Indonesia Vision for 2045 to become a high-income country, to be part of the 5 highest GDP countries, extreme poverty rate of 0%, and increase the access to quality jobs. Monitoring and evaluating the implementation at the national and sub-national levels. The achievements of sustainable development are assessed and evaluated periodically every semester and annually. For this reason, the SDGs monitoring and evaluation system is integrated in the planning cycle, through Action Plans at the national (RAN) and subnational (RAD) level. Planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of Sustainable Development are carried out inclusively by involving all stakeholders. Development are carried out inclusively by involving all stakeholders. The government has published the SDGs Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Guidelines (Money) edition 2 in 2020 which is an Since 363 Since 2020, the monitoring and evaluation of SDGs is integrated with other monitoring and evaluation platforms such as e-Monev for National Development under the coordination of the Ministry of National Development Planning. Digital monitoring process and evaluation, as well as reporting of SDGs achievement is integrated to the e-Monev of National Development and the digital planning and budgeting system (KRISNA), facilitated by SDGs budget tagging feature. Codification of government programs and activities to support the achievement of the SDGs is very important as a reference code for connectivity between e-Planning, e-Budgeting and e-Monev platforms, both at the national and subnational levels. The scope of e-Monev SDGs is broader for both government (Ministries and Institutions) as well as non-state actors that are philanthropy, businesses, CSOs and other relevant stakeholders. The lesson learned in the VNR drafting process is the increasing data limitations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. VNR preparation that includes trend analysis requires the most recent data, which in this case was challenging due to COVID-19. Statistics Indonesia (BPS) experienced challenges in the process of data collection and processing due to the large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) policy and the implementation of health protocols. Thus, there are data of SDGs indicators that could not be collected, especially the data for 2020. Statistics Indonesia (BPS) has adjusted its business processes and the availability of Big Data has been a reference in the preparation of 2021 VNR. With this limitation, Indonesia can still report the achievements of the SDGs in a meaningful and comprehensive manner using data collected through various surveys by Statistics Indonesia (BPS) and related Ministries/Institutions, studies from other institutions, as well as program reports by Ministries/Institutions. In addition, due to the social restrictions in place as a COVID-19 response, the coordination for the preparation of VNR 2021 is carried out online. Outreach was easier as more stakeholders could participate, thus the VNR 2021 consultation process is more extensive and broader than the previous two VNRs. The support needed to prepare for the upcoming VNR. Indonesia developed the 2021 VNR with support from development partners. The UN System, coordinated by the UN Resident Coordinator, supported the VNR development through enrichment of the analysis of the 9 goals under review, data provision including disaggregated data on vulnerable groups, and many online serial discussions and meetings related to VNR development and data collection mechanisms. This fruitful cooperation is expected to be continued in future VNR developments. During the process of the 2021 VNR development, Indonesia and Norway reviewed each country's VNR draft. This peer review initiative demonstrated willingness to be transparent and share innovations and lessons learned. This is a reflection of Indonesia's effort in strengthening global, regional and bilateral cooperation. New and emerging challenges. The implementation for the SDGs in 2020 was faced with the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic that has changed life as we know it. Economic growth has contracted, and unemployment and poverty has increased in 2020. Government pushed all efforts in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and its impacts through policies of social restrictions, strengthening of testing-tracking-treatment system and stimulus packages, as well as the roll out of the vaccine. COVID-19 pandemic has an unprecedented shock, significantly changing interhuman relations and its implications on activities of economy, social and public services. New and emerging challenges due to the pandemic are seen in transformations in health system, acceleration of automatization and digitalization, INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 364 global value change, increased telework trend, increased in roles of artificial intelligence and big data, and green economy being the key factor in redesigning strategies for economic transformation. Strategies in redesigning economic transformation for mid and long term will focus on (1) competitive human resources through reform on health system, education system and character education; (2) productivity of economic sectors through industrialization, productivity of MSMEs and agriculture modernization; (3) green economy through low carbon economy, blue economy and energy transition; (4) digital transformation through digital infrastructure, digital utilization and strengthening of enabler; (5) integration of domestic economy through connectivity of infrastructure-super hub, maritime hub, aerial hub and domestic value chain; (6) relocation of capital city to reduce regional economic disparity. In the implementation of the achievement of these agendas, SDGs is the main instrument. Strategy numbers 3, 4, 5, and 6 are game changers in economic recovery and acceleration of economic transformation. Furthermore, strategy numbers 1 and 2 are sufficient conditions that needs to be met to enable economic transformation, which are increased productivity and competitiveness to industrialization and agricultural modernization. Concrete efforts in the acceleration of economic recovery and transformation is the implementation of 13 Major Projects in 2022, which are (1) Priority Industrial Areas and Smelter, (2) Integrated Management of MSMEs, (3) Acceleration of Renewable Energy Mix and Energy Conservation, (4) Food Estate, (5) Priority Touristic Destinations, (6) Major Project in Papua, (7) Relocation of the Capital City, (8) Reform of Social Protection System, (9) Reform of Health System, (10) Reform of Vocational Education, (11) Network of Integrated Main Ports, (12) Digital Transformation, and (13) Development of Hazardous Toxic Waste Management Facilities.Heterogenous social capital is key for collective action in response of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the examples is the Sonjo Movement conducted in the province of DI Yogyakarta which is a community movement that is organized through a WhatsApp group. This initiative facilitates mobilization of non-financial aids, as well as other supports to assist and help those affected by the pandemic. The aforementioned policies and strategies for economic transformation in response to COVID 19 pandemic are expected to accelerate the pace of development in a sustainable an green manner as a means to Built Forward Better in attaining the 2030 Agenda as instructed by the President of the Republic of Indonesia. 365 REFERENCES Alatas, Vivi, and David Newhouse.

Calculation of the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) Moderate and Severe Prevalence of Food Insecurity Based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale FAO's Voices of the Hungry (VoH) has developed a new global standard for estimating the prevalence of food insecurity using a tool called the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). FIES is a food insecurity severity experience matrix that relies on respondents' immediate responses to questions about their access to adequate food to assess their ability to access/obtain food. Sample units collected in FIES: households or individuals. The FIES Survey Module (FIES-SM) consists of 8 questions about access to food. Questions about FIES-SM focused on their own behavior and experiences related to increasing difficulty in accessing food due to limited resources. FIES calculation steps: 1. Setting up the FIES data set and weighting 2. Doing modelling with Rasch model, using package R: RM.weights3. Checking the Rasch model output (validation) - I nfit statistics (between 0.7 and 1.3) - R esidual correlation (no correlation between residuals) seen f rom the scree plot - R asch reliability (>0.7) 4. Comparing with global standards5. Calibrate with global standards 6. Determine the questions used for calculating moderate and severe food insecurity - Determine tolerance limits with a minimum requirement o f 5 questions that must be used to calculate food insecurity. The commonly used tolerance limit is 0.35 - P erform adjusted FIES against global standards - C heck the mean and standard deviation 7. Calculating moderate and severe food insecurity270 ANNEXESB. Calculation of Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) According to the FAO, undernourishment is: \"Condition of people who consume, on regular basis, amounts of food that do not provide the dietary energy need to be healthy and active\" Ideally, the PoU calculation is based on observing food consumption, calculating the energy produced from the food consumed, and comparing it with energy requirements to group individuals into a representative sample. However, in practice, there are two problems that make this direct approach difficult. First, the records carried out should assess energy consumption habits, this is to describe the normal condition of the individual. Repeated observations are needed to control for short-term variations that have no implications on nutritional adequacy. Second, individual energy needs are not actually observable. We may be able to predict an individual's energy requirements for a given age, gender, height, and activity, but we can never be sure whether the individual with the recorded food consumption is indeed an individual describing the general condition. Therefore, a model-based approach is needed to overcome this problem.Figure 1. Illustration of PoU Supporting data used to calculate the PoU include: 1. Population data by age and sex. 2. Data on calorie consumption, is approached by using data on calorie consumption per capita from the National Socio-Economic Survey (Susenas). 3. Income data, approached using Expenditure data obtained from the (Susenas) results 4. Height and weight data, approached using median height and weight data by age and sex from National Institute of Health Research and Development (NIHRD)The procedure for calculating PoU using (Susenas) data is: 1. Create a population pyramid by age group and gender. 2. Calculating daily per capita calorie consumption 3. Calculating the coefficient of variation from the daily per capita calorie consumption data. 4. Calculating the Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement (MDER) and its coefficient of variation (CV). MDER is calculated by calculating the minimum calorie requirement needed by a person according to their age and gender 5. Calculate the total coefficient of variation (CV). The total coefficient of variation is calculated by adding up the coefficient of variation and its constituent variables 6. Calculating PoU, by comparing the consumption of calories per capita with the MDER. The PoU value is the number of people whose calorie consumption is below the MDER.271 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021The MDER calculation procedure is: 1. Determine the composition of the population by age group and gender based on (Susenas) data 2. Calculate the minimum energy requirements for each age group and gender based on the average height and weight in the appropriate age group and gender 3. Calculate the MDER based on the results of Step 2 and add it to the calorie needs for pregnant women, which is 210 Kcal multiplied by the Birth Rate. 272 5.

Small-scale food producers (farmers) are producers that are structurally independent of fixed wage labor and who manage their production activities primarily with family workers. Most of the working time is spent on agricultural activities on their own farms or in their own homes. This agricultural income is a major part of their total income. Small- scale farmers are believed to be able to contribute significantly to the world's food. On the other hand, they are also estimated to be the poorest and food insecure. However, it is widely recognized that small-scale farmers are one of the main food-producing workers, and because they are in a relatively vulnerable position, it is important to promote development policies in their favor. Why is it important to focus on Small-Scale Farmers? 1. Food and nutrition security: A person is considered food safe if he always has adequate availability and access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life 2. Sustainable rural life: Life can be defined as capabilities, assets, and activities, which consist of human capital, social capital, natural capital, physical capital, and financial capital. Within the scope of indicators 2.3.1. and 2.3.2, the focus is on the sustainability and resilience of livelihoods located in rural areas. 273 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021274 Based on the results of Felix G.

Global food production: As smaller production units are better distributed in a given region and provide a more diverse range of food, the stability of small-scale farmers directly contributes to global food production and increases local and healthy food supplies Several scientific literature and policy documents categorize the determination of Small- scale Farmers on four criteria: area of land managed, number of workers employed for agricultural production (mainly family members), market orientation and economic size of the business unit. In the 2020 (citation), Integrated Agricultural Survey, the criteria used to determine Small-Scale Farmers are summarized into 2 criteria, namely the physical size and the economic size of the agricultural business. 1. Physical size of agricultural business a. Managed land area Including: - Fallow land (not planted for a certain time) - Land managed for seasonal/annual crops - Land for rent Not included: - Forest land - Abandoned land - Land for rent b. Number of livestock kept Farm size is measured in Tropical Livestock Units (TLU). TLU is a unit of livestock comparison used to compare the relative sizes of a herd. TLU is essentially an 'exchange ratio' between livestock species, obtained by converting body weight to metabolic weight. 2. The economic size of the agricultural business The size of the economy is measured based on the total income of agricultural production. However, to get comparable results in different countries, income is expressed in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Dollars or Purchasing Power Parity (US$ currency value). From the 2 criteria used, a threshold for the lowest 40% distribution or 2 (two) distribution quintiles is determined based on the recommendations of experts and is also used by the World Bank for measuring welfare. This threshold is used specifically to monitor indicators 2.3.1 and indicator 2.3.2. Indicator 2.3.1 Production volume per worker by class of plant farming/ husbandry/ fishery/ forestry. Indicator 2.3.1 is used to measure how much volume can be produced per unit of labour i.e. average labour productivity. agricultural producers, by subsector. Indicator 2.3.2 refers to the actual net income earned by small-scale food producers (farmers) from their agricultural activities. In other words, this indicator is used to measure the average income of small-scale productive and sustainable agricultural area Indicator 2.4.1 is designed to measure the extent to which more productive and sustainable food production systems are implemented.

Entrepreneurial Assistance and Community-Owned Enterprise (BUMMas) By Rumah Zakat Dealing with high poverty rate in Indonesia requires the involvement of all stakeholders. Statistics Indonesia (BPS) noted that as of September 2020 the poor population had increased to 27.55 million people. At the same time, the percentage of poor people as of September 2020 also rose to 10.19 percent. BPS also noted that the poverty rate in rural areas was much higher than that in urban areas. This unequal situation requires an alternative development approach that emphasizes the participation of the grassroots community as the subject of development. empowerment program, targeting individual micro-entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, BUMMas is a program with a group/institutional approach, namely a group-based economic empowerment program and formal institutions (social enterprises). Economic empowerment aims to strengthen the economy of rural communities, through the use of local potentials that not only generate profits, but also provide social benefits to the community. There are several stages of activities in the economic empowerment, such as the entrepreneurial assistance program provided with mentoring, entrepreneurship education, product strengthening, good manufacturing practices, legality advocacy, marketing as well as provision of business facilities and venture capital. Similar to entrepreneurial assistance, BUMMas also has several activities such as Therefore, Rumah Zakat participates in poverty alleviation efforts through economic empowerment in rural area. Rumah Zakat's economic empowerment employs two (Entrepreneurial with a social entrepreneurship approach (Community-Owned Enterprises/BUMMAS) to create new economic institutions that are directly managed by the community, whose benefits can be felt not only by the economic actors themselves, but also other people around them. Rumah Zakat's economic empowerment employs two approaches, i.e. individual and group/institutional approach. The individual approach also refers to Entrepreneurial Assistance Program. Entrepreneurial Assistance is a local potential-based economic 286 ANNEXESgroup assistance, institutional strengthening, strengthening business models, strengthening markets and business development. BUMMas program provides business capital for group as collective assistance, while Entrepreneurial Assistance program provides venture capital for individual. Rumah Zakat divides BUMMAS into 3 types: (1) BUMMAS microfinance which is engaged in savings and loans, venture capital, and the Berdaya Mart business unit; (2) BUMMAS micro business which is engaged in labor-intensive business or product processing; and (3) BUMMAS agribusiness which is engaged in sustainable agriculture/livestock and trading business development. The parties involved in this program are Rumah Zakat's Inspiration Volunteers as empowerment facilitators, as well as individual and group/institution beneficiaries that are established collectively. In 2020, Entrepreneurial Assistance program has assisted 2,809 beneficiaries with an average of IDR 1,626,608.00 for each beneficiary. In addition, Rumah Zakat currently has 196 BUMMAS with 2,900 members. Based on the results of an analysis conducted by Rumah Zakat in 2020: (1) 15% of the beneficiaries of the Entrepreneurial Assistance program have been alleviated from poverty; and (2) BUMMas managed to generate a turnover of IDR 9,681,785,811 and social funds of IDR 148,416,367 which were used to run social programs in the community where BUMMas was established. 2. Improving the Welfare of the Dayak Community through Kelulut Honeybees By Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) Sinar Mas Desa Makmur Peduli Api (DMPA) is a program developed by APP Sinar Mas to support alternative livelihoods for local communities to reduce community dependence on forest land. The main objective is to empower village communities to actively participate in sustainable forest management through agroforestry, a non-burning agricultural practice that links community prosperity, forest sustainability, and reduction of forest fires. Bahta Hamlet, Bonti Sub-District, Sanggau District, West Kalimantan, which borders one of APP's wood supplier areas, i.e. PT Finnantara Intiga, which was known for producing honey in the area. However, the honey production in Bahta Hamlet is gradually decreasing due to the lack of knowledge of the farmers who only rely on hereditary practices. This threatens the continued cultivation of Kelulut honeybees in the Dayak people who rely heavily on natural resources for their livelihoods. In 2018, the DMPA program supported Togos Naho, a 30-year-old Sub-District, District, West Togos has cultivated Kelulut bees (Trigona itama) since 2010 in Bahta which is known as a honey producer. With DMPA program's support, Togos seeks to develop sustainable and environmentally friendly cultivation. Currently, Togos is trying to introduce and share the details of his knowledge with the surrounding community on how to develop sustainable Kelulut honeybees. Togos needs to ensure that the local community comprehends and understands the basic knowledge that will improve the quality of the honey. For example, it is necessary to pay attention to the size of the beehive, as well as using gloves and vacuuming equipment at harvest. In addition, harvesting cannot be done at night and smoke should not be used. Apart from Togos, the beneficiaries of the DMPA program are the Dayak people in Bahta Hamlet. The Dayak community is a well-known traditional 287 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021community in Indonesia that preserves its cultural heritage and life. This program was held in close collaboration between APP Sinar Mas and PT Finnantara Intiga, as the supplier of APP wood located in the vicinity of the Dayak community. PT Finnantara facilitates the program and also engages local governments to increase the scope of its program so that it has a wider impact. Togos has succeeded in developing Kelulut honeybee cultivation in a sustainable manner. Currently, Togos is completing its honey with Food Production Certificate (Home Industry Production Certificate or P-IRT) for broader marketing. Several fixes are required to obtain the certificate. The teams in the DMPA and Togos programs are working to integrate local wisdom and modern knowledge standards to improve their livelihoods. 3. Economic Empowerment through Development of SME for Women Around the Operation Area By Kangean Energy Indonesia Ltd. The length of time the fisherman sails leaving his wife and family causes vulnerability for the families who are left behind\u2014especially for women. These people need additional income while they are left behind. In addition, fishermen often experience famine conditions during strong winds with minimal catches. Sometimes, the fish harvest can be so large to the point that fish price becomes really cheap and the fishermen suffer losses. In order to support the family's economy, these women took the initiative to carry out processing activities for local fishery products such as fish, seaweed and local agricultural products such as cassava and bananas into products of higher selling value. The company's strategy is to improve the economy of the community around Sapeken Sub-district as a corporate social responsibility through programs that are in accordance with the needs of the community, especially women who have the skills to make processed products. Kangean Energy Indonesia Ltd also involves various parties for this program, including the village government, PKK, the industry office and also the Sumenep District government. The beneficiaries of this program are 435 women who are members of the KEI fostered groups for various products. A total of 6 groups have also become representatives of One Village, One Product for its flagship products, namely seaweed lunkhead, seaweed snacks, shredded fish, fish balls, shredded squid, and cassava chips. This SME empowerment program is able to provide added value to fishery and agricultural products which produce high-value products with attractive packaging, namely seaweed lunkhead, shredded fish, fish balls, cassava chips and banana chips. A total of 50 business groups in Sapeken Sub-district (453 women) participated in this program with an average profit of 1-3 million/month. In addition to increasing income, this program is also able to foster an entrepreneurial spirit and also increase the self-confidence of these women. The assistance started with training on product processing followed by training in marketing, packaging, manufacturing, and obtaining a PIRT license. These assisted products have been marketed at local markets, districts, provinces to all of Indonesia and have entered exhibitions such as the Jatim Fair.288 ANNEXES4. COVID-19 Response by Filantropi By Filantropi Indonesia This program is an initiative of Filantropi Indonesia for various philanthropic responses to help the government and people affected by COVID-19. COVID-19 Response by Filantropi is conducted in the form of a website that can be accessed at covid19filantropi.id. It not only contains data and developments from various philanthropic initiatives but also the number of donations that have been collected. This website also provides a space for institutions to publish reports on the use of donated funds. All information contained on the website is collected from online searches. Therefore, this website cannot be declared to represent all philanthropic activities for COVID-19 carried out in Indonesia. Besides searching for information independently, the team also received information/data from members and other institutions. The website does not limit its benefits to philanthropic institutions only. Other sectors such as the private sector, government, community, academics, etc. can report their philanthropic activities through this media. This website has been useful for various parties, especially members of Filantropi Indonesia. Many of them use this platform as a medium to provide information on their philanthropic activities for COVID-19. In addition, this website also helps to publish accountability reports for use and donations. This is considered to increase the accountability and transparency of philanthropic institutions. Meanwhile, for the community, the website can be a medium for collecting information on ongoing COVID-19 assistance. 5. Cash-based Assistance in Lombok 20182020: From Earthquake to COVID-19 By UNICEF In response to the 2018 earthquake and the COVID-19 pandemic since 2020, UNICEF has successfully implemented the Emergency Cash Based Assistance (CBA) program for children affected by disasters in North and East Lombok. It aims to meet the basic needs of affected families with children up to six or seven years of age, pregnant women and breastfeeding women. At a later stage of recovery, cash assistance is intended to support economic revival and increase the capacity of stakeholders to sustain cash-based assistance in the context of disaster response. CBA 1 is targeting 4,200 beneficiaries in six villages in North Lombok. Payment is made in four stages, totaling IDR 4.45 million (USD 304) per household. CBA 2 represents an expansion to East Lombok District, targeting 4,500 beneficiaries in eight villages in four sub-districts. UNICEF, with support from Catholic Relief Services and the Indonesian Post Office, distributed IDR 4 million (USD 274) to each beneficiary in three stages at village distribution points. Unlike CBA 1 which focuses primarily on cash disbursement, CBA 2 is carried out as part of UNICEF's policy advocacy by strengthening the capacity of local governments, advocating for standard operating procedures and cash transfer guidelines, as well as developing safety precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic. During CBA 1 and CBA 2, UNICEF conducted studies on relevant topics such as: 1) Qualitative study on emergency multipurpose cash transfers in East Lombok, and 2) Remote COVID-19 insight study.289 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021The results of this program include: 1. More than 8,800 households received cash transfers at CBA 1 and CBA 2. Most of the assistance was used to pay for essential items (e.g. food, WASH products, school supplies), while 32% was used to access basic services (e.g. transportation to schools/hospitals, enrollment to early childhood education (PAUD), medical fees) 3. A complaint handling mechanism was established, including through a hotline and U-report 4. Training and workshops were held for partner organizations, including with local governments 290 ANNEXESGOAL 2 ZERO HUNGER LIST OF GOOD PRACTICES FOR GOAL 2 1. Food Provision during the COVID-19 Pandemic from Domestic Production By Ministry of Agriculture To overcome the possibility of a national food crisis as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, at the direction of the President of the Republic of Indonesia Joko Widodo, the Minister of Agriculture Syahrul Yasin Limpo has refocused agricultural development policies and programs, one of which is by launching the Food Availability Improvement Program in the New Normal Era. This program consists of four actions (CB), namely: CB1 :Increasing production capacity, which consists of accelerating rice planting; development of new food agriculture land in Central Kalimantan covering an area of 30.00 hectares; expansion of new planting areas for rice, corn, soybeans; and increasing high-growth food production to reduce dependence on imports. CB2 :Diversifying local food, which consists of diversifying carbohydrate-based local according to local wisdom that are focused on one main commodity for each province (cassava, corn, sago, banana, potato, and sorghum); as well as utilization of home yards to increase food availability and nutrition, by empowering 4,300 Women Groups through Sustainable Home Yard (P2L) activities. CB3 :Strengthening food reserves and logistics systems, which consists of strengthening rice reserves of the central government and district/city governments; development of village-based community food granaries in 33 provinces; development of a national food logistics system to stabilize food supply and prices through 1,548 Community Food Business Development (PUPM) and 3,796 Indonesian Tokok Tani (TTI) in all provinces; and alleviation of food insecure areas in all provinces. CB4 :Development of modern agriculture, which consists of developing smart farming, developing and utilizing screen houses, developing food estates, and developing farmer corporations. This program aims to increase the availability and domestic production of rice, carbohydrate-based food other than rice, as well as various foods around the community. It also aims to establish additional food reserves throughout districts/cities to villages and develop modern agriculture that is efficient and competitive, as well as increasing the productivity of food agriculture businesses. 291 INDONESIA'S VNR 20212. Assistance for Vegetable Farmers in the midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic By Ministry of Agriculture Four months after the COVID-19 pandemic entered Indonesia and with the imposition of large-scale social restrictions (PSBB), vegetable horticultural farmers in various regions experienced marketing difficulties and prices fell. This is confirmed by the results of a rapid assessment of the Center for Socio-Economic and Agricultural Policy (PSEKP) of the Ministry of Agriculture in four vegetable production centers in Cianjur District, West Java; Magelang District, Central Java; Banyuwangi District, East Java; and Minahasa District, North Sulawesi. Vegetable farmers experienced severe shocks in the form of major obstacles in marketing their perishable products. Regular customers such as hotels, restaurants and caterers cut off contact because their business activities declined sharply. Likewise, the volume of marketing to supermarkets and traditional markets has decreased sharply, only around 10%. Due to the large excess supply coupled by the perishable nature of vegetables, the price drops sharply. For example, in Pacet Subdistrict, Cianjur, tomatoes, which were usually sold at a contract price of IDR 31,500/kg, had to be sold very cheaply at IDR 3,000/kg. In Kaliangkrik Subdistrict, Magelang, the price of green onions was only IDR 2,500/kg to the normal 10,000/kg. In Tompaso District, North Sulawesi, curly red chilies were only valued at IDR 4,000-5,000 per kg, whereas before the pandemic it was still around IDR 15,000/kg. Most of the agricultural products from Banyuwangi District were sent to Bali and Surabaya before the pandemic, but it cannot be done anymore because of restrictions on transportation movements. Vegetable farmers in Pacet District, Cianjur overcome the problem of marketing by optimizing online sales. The Jaya Giri Multi Tani Farmers Association (Gapoktan MUJAGI) marketed their vegetables through direct selling to residential and office consumers. In mid-May 2020, this Farmer Group has explored online sales through kedaisayur.com, Bukalapak, and Tokopedia.Gapoktan MUJAGI's efforts to market their products online have paid off. Several agencies in Bogor City (about 1 hour drive from Cianjur) have responded to help overcome the difficulties of the vegetable farmers in Pacet Cianjur sub-district, one of which is PSEKP. The head of PSEKP, Sudi Mardianto, said that the purchase was carried out as a form of concern for farmers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The purchase price was agreed to be above the production price, so that farmers still profit, he said. A total of 300 packages of vegetables at a price of IDR 40 thousand per package were ordered by the office staff who were coordinated by their leaders. The vegetable package consists of various chilies, cabbage, eggplant, carrots, leeks and tomatoes. Of the 300 packages ordered, with the spirit of sharing in times of trouble, 150 packages were collected to be distributed to cleaners, security guards, and households around the office complex. According to the Chairman of Gapoktan MUJAGI, Suhendar's purchases using this pattern greatly helped the farmer's economy during difficult conditions and situations due to the pandemic. However, this difficult situation does not discourage Gapoktan MUJAGI from producing. In fact, this Gapoktan, which has seven farmer groups, continues to plant vegetables on the harvested land. According to Suhendar, this step is a solution to survive during a pandemic, coupled with efforts to expand marketing through online sales. Source: Ashari and Gunawan E. 292 ANNEXES3. Community-Based Food Safety Improvement By Food and Drug Authority Ensuring safe food is part of the effort to provide quality food that is nutritious, safe and healthy. In accordance with the mandate of Law No. 18/2012 concerning Food, food supply for the fulfillment of food community consumption is carried out by involving the participation of all stakeholders, including the community, starting from planning, implementation and supervision. The Food and Drug Authority (BPOM) initiated a Community-Based Food Safety Program, which is an intervention program that engages the community to play an active role in fulfilling food safety. This intervention is comprised of three programs, namely: (1) safe food village program; (2) safe snack program for school-age children; and (3) community-based safe market program. This program has been running since 2014 in villages/urban villages/schools/markets in 34 provinces. Intervention is carried out on the supply side, namely through the development of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the food sector in villages/urban villages in the food sector and the demand side, namely through empowerment activities for cadres and rural communities and school communities. Through this program, from 2012 to 2020, interventions or empowerment have been carried out regarding food security in 5,214 villages/urban villages and 301 markets in 34 provinces; and capacity building has been carried out to more than 15 thousand cadres and more than 105 thousand communities. The gap assessment study before and after the intervention has found an increase in food safety knowledge in the group of housewives, PKK women, teachers, youth organizations, and school students (see the infographic below). In the future, this program needs to strengthen coordination and cooperation with various stakeholders, including the government, business actors and the community in order to increase awareness and implementation of food safety, given that food safety is everyone's business. The total number of villages that have been intervened through this program is around 6.2% of 83,880 villages/urban villages, 16% of schools and 1.9% of the market. This achievement is still very low, so it is necessary to increase the scope of activities and encourage local governments to replicate this program. In this regard, BPOM is carrying out program revitalization, namely by implementing an integrated food safety program through three integration strategies: program integration, regional integration and data integration. Picture A1. Achievement of Community-Based Food (RGG) in East Aceh District, Aceh Province By Government of East Aceh District District/city governments and community institutions recognize the importance of reducing the prevalence of stunting as an investment to build a future Indonesian people who are healthy, active, intelligent, and productive. One effort that is considered as an example of best practice is an initiative by the District of East Aceh, Aceh Province, which has a fairly high stunting rate. The Regional Government of East Aceh District is implementing a program to accelerate the reduction of the prevalence of stunting called Rumoh Gampong (RGG). The main activity of RGG is to increase institutional capacity and human resources through training on stunting. In order to empower village communities and cadres in an effort to accelerate the prevention of stunting. The Regional Government of East Aceh District, Aceh Province designed the Rumah Gizi Gampong (RGG) program. This activity is carried out in an integrated and community-based manner at the gampong/village level. RGG is a model for handling and preventing stunting in an integrated manner through a family and community empowerment approach at the village level with a specific and sensitive scope of activities with a main focus on 3 aspects, namely (a) nutrition services for risk groups (PMT-local, supplementation, and other forms of nutrition services); (b) education and capacity building of families and communities; and (c) strengthening family food security, family empowerment and PHBS, and other activities according to conditions and problems in the village. The purpose of RGG in combating stunting is: a. Empowering families and communities in an effort to improve nutrition services independently by involving various related sectors. b. Increase the knowledge and skills and capacity of families and village communities in efforts to prevent and control stunting c. Empowering the community in an effort to increase food security, economic empowerment, improve hygiene and healthy living habits in support of stunting reduction. The main activities of RGG include sensitive and specific activities in the prevention of stunting, as follows: a. Nutrition service activities and increasing nutritional intake from family meals, namely: (i) routine education/counseling, (ii) family menu review (analysis of energy and nutrient availability), (iii) assistance in family menu preparation, (iv) monitoring of Local PMT consumption, (v) PKK and posyandu cadres supervised by Village Nutrition Assistants/TPGD, as well as (vi) distribution and supervision of supplementation (Vit A, Iron Tablets) and other interventions. b. Educational activities and capacity building, namely: (i) PMBA counseling for children and nutritional counseling for pregnant and breastfeeding women, (ii) PMBA module and balanced nutrition module for pregnant and breastfeeding women, (iii) parenting and stimulation of growth and development, development of simple tools for cadres, and (iv) Food Monitoring Cards (KMM) conducted by posyandu cadres, supervised by Village Nutrition Assistants/TPGD, To Eliminate Stunting By Government of Bandung City Meanwhile, the Regional Government of Bandung City, West Java Province implemented the OMABA Cooking Center Program: A Bottom-Up Solution To Eliminate Stunting. The main activity of this program is to produce healthy food for consumption of malnourished children, sent by motor transportation. This program has succeeded in increasing public awareness of the need to rapidly reduce the prevalence of stunting. The lesson from this program is that cooperation between stakeholders is one of the keys to the success of reducing stunting. In an effort to eliminate stunting, the Government of Bandung City has initiated the OMABA Cooking Center Program in Cisaranten Kidul Village, Bandung City since 1 January 2013. This program is an initiative of cadres of the Riung Health Center Technical Implementation Unit, Cisaranten Kidul Village and Cisaranten Kidul Village PKK, with material assistance and guidance from PT. Pertamina and the Government of Bandung City. The stunting rate in West Java is still higher than the national level. Cisaranten Kidul Urban Village has a high prevalence of stunting. In 2013, of the 29 cases of stunting in Gedebage District, 19 cases occurred in Cisaranten Kidul Urban Village. OMABA Cooking Center produces healthy meals for the consumption of severely malnourished children targeted by the Supplement-Recovery Feeding (PMP-T) program. The processed products from OMABA's kitchen were then sent to the children using motor transportation. This program was triggered by the impression that the implementation of the PMT-P program in this urban village was ineffective, because the food provided in the form of formula milk was often not consumed by the target children, but was sold to small shops. In addition, the limited food budget for targeted children is also an obstacle, especially considering the scattered locations of the targeted children. The OMABA program specifically helps food access for children who are stunted and helps ensure good nutrition. The target of this program is children who have previously received PMP-T assistance but have not experienced a change in weight growth. The OMABA program also demonstrates that collaboration between the government, the private sector and the community can help create positive results for government programs. Community participation in food preparation and assistance not only creates attractive and healthy nutritional intake for target children, but also ensures that food reaches the children targeted by the PMT-P program. Participation in this program, both as recipients and implementers, has also created awareness in the community about the importance of good nutrition for children. Source: City, West Java Non-governmental organizations also play an active role in efforts to reduce stunting. One of the best practices is the Bandung Tanginas Program (Bandung Responds to Stunting with Safe and Healthy Food) from the Bandung City PKK Steering Team and the Bandung Sehat Forum. The main activities of this program include the socialization of stunting prevention in 30 sub-districts, provision of healthy food intake, capacity building for posyandu cadres, and the Friday Fortune Call. These activities were carried out in partnership with related agencies in the City of Bandung and received funding assistance from several institutions such as the Bandung City Baznas, Bandung City IZI, and Pegadaian Syariah. In order to achieve Bandung zero stunting, specific interventions were carried out for pregnant women, breastfeeding women, under-five and toddlers, as well as sensitive interventions with economic strengthening through training for stunting families as an independent effort to increase family income. The activities include: 1. Socialization of stunting prevention in 30 districts 2. Providing healthy food intake for pregnant women, breastfeeding women, under-five and toddlers (Zero New Stunting) 3. Capacity building for posyandu cadres: basic health services for pregnant women and children (measuring, weighing, providing counseling), 4. Successing a family-based, community-based independent food house (RPM), within Buruan SAE neighborhood: supported by a menu creation competition and Buruan SAE photo competition, 5. Providing training for stunting families as an independent effort to increase family income: training in sewing and hair shaving (20 people per district), 6. Friday Fortune Call: calling pregnant women/breastfeeding women/parents of under-five in providing motivation and education related to stunting (by the Chairperson and Deputy of TP-PKK Kota Bandung/Healthy Bandung Forum) 7. Bandung SAE Movement (Exclusive Breastfeeding Sadayana): a campaign effort to increase public awareness of exclusive breastfeeding for infants of 0-6 months. Supported by the preparation of an ASI draft plan by the Government of Bandung City. 8. 100 percent ODF movement in Bandung City In its implementation, this program involves various stakeholders, namely: Bappelitbang, the Office of Population Control and Family Planning, the Office of Women Empowerment and Child Protection, the Health Service, the Agriculture and Food Security Service, and the Kominfo Office. The sponsors of this activity are Baznas of Bandung City, IZI of Bandung City, posyandu, 3775 women, under-five, toddlers) and 3,775 RWs. The result of this activity is an increase in the nutritional status of the community, especially the stunting target of 1000 HPK; increasing knowledge of cadres and the community about stunting, its causes and ways to prevent it; increasing economic independence of the community and the target families with stunting children, increasing the number of infants who are exclusively breastfed. The challenges of this program include minimal budget and difficulties in changing people's habitual behavior patterns. This activity is very likely to be replicated in urban and rural areas. 7. Stunting Free Village By Rumah Zakat One other best practice carried out by community organizations is the Stunting Free Village Program, which is implemented by Rumah Zakat. The main activity of this program is strengthening breastfeeding women. This program assists 526 posyandu throughout Indonesia. Activities in the Stunting-Free Village include monitoring the growth and development of children under five, providing additional nutrition, providing intensive nutrition for toddlers with nutritional problems, facilitating access to health services for toddlers with comorbidities, and providing additional supplements. In addition, there are activities for pregnant and breastfeeding women in the form of supplementation, supplementary feeding, education, nutrition consultation and mentoring. Education and workshops/training were also held for cadres or free stunting agents. Activities in the Stunting Free Village began with a data collection process and coordination with related stakeholders such as the Puskesmas and the local village government. The next process is building Rumah Gizi to provide complementary foods. The provision of complementary foods employs mutual cooperation system, where products are sold to families who can afford the capacity of village health cadres to maximize efforts to fulfill nutrition and reduce the factors that cause infection; with target beneficiaries include toddlers, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women. One of the results of this program is the increased awareness of the community and cadres about the nutritional needs of children under five and the ability to process complementary foods according to nutritional needs. Stunting-Free Village is a program pioneered by Rumah Zakat, covering 186 villages in Indonesia, starting from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Indonesia has serious nutrition problems in children under five. The prevalence of stunting, wasting, and underweight among children under five is still quite high, especially in rural areas. Rumah Zakat intends to contribute in dealing with these nutritional problems. Stunting-Free Village is an effort made by the community to free Indonesian children from the threat of stunting, through strengthening the capacity of village health cadres to maximize nutritional fulfillment and reduce infection-causing factors. The targets of the Stunting Free Village are toddlers, pregnant women and Picture A4 Documentation of Stunting Free Village Program and example of its pamphle297 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021it and the benefits will be given to toddlers who have nutritional problems. In addition, the program provides Mother Class for Toddlers, cooking classes and regular monitoring of the toddler's weight and height. Throughout 2020, the Stunting-Free Village Program has assisted 2,366 Posyandu cadres and held 466 training for them. Through this program, assistance was provided to 18,725 children under five, 496 with stunting, 72 with wasting and 204 with underweight. The program also provided counseling for mothers about child nutrition and immunization to 224 children under five. The Stunting-Free Village also makes the community and cadres better understand the nutritional needs of children under five, and are able to process complementary foods according to nutritional needs. The lessons learned in implementing a Stunting-Free Village is the limited program implementation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Toddler monitoring activities were carried out by visiting the toddler's house directly or to a limited number of associations. This program can be replicated and carried out in other areas with the same process, starting from data collection to program implementation and can be carried out similarly. The opportunity for replication is quite large, as can be seen from the distribution of the program, which to date has reached 186 points throughout Indonesia.298 ANNEXESGOAL 3 GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING LIST OF GOOD PRACTICES FOR GOAL 3 1. 5NG Program (JateNG GayeNG NginceNG WoNG MeteNG) By Government of Central Java Province This program was carried out by the Government of Central Java Province since 1 January 2016 and is still ongoing today. The purpose of this program is to increase the awareness of Central Java residents to monitor pregnant women living in the vicinity, given that the Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) and Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) in Central Java Province are still high. The activity includes observation and monitoring of the mother's condition which is divided into 4 (four) phases, namely: (1) the pre-pregnancy phase, (2) the pregnancy phase, (3) the labor phase, and (4) the postpartum phase. Health conditions and nutritional consumption of pregnant women will continue to be monitored by health workers. The positive impact of this program is that there has been a significant decrease in MMR and IMR in Central Java Province. MMR decreased by 14% per year and IMR decreased from 5,485 (2016) to 4481 (2018). The success of this program attracted USAID's attention to provide additional funding through the Jalin program. With the collaboration of USAID and 5NG, it is hoped that the impact of this program will be wider so that it can reduce stunting, improve food and conditions for pregnant women and babies.Replication opportunities in other areas are still possible. Moreover, with the assistance from the central government, local government and the private sector, the positive impact will be felt by other local communities.Source: 1. https://dinkesjatengprov.go.id/v2018/2019/03/12/ program-inovasi-unggulan-5ng-jateng-gayeng-nginceng-wong-meteng/#:~:text=Program%205Ng%20(JateNG%20GayeNG%20NginceNG,ibu%20selamat%2C%20dan%20bayi%20sehat 2.

Based on data on the HIV epidemic in Indonesia, of the 32,000 new HIV infections, as many as 50% came from young people aged 15-24 years. Through this program, UNAIDS hopes to be able to reach young people to get information about HIV based on technology and social media. UNAIDS launched \"Ask Marlo\" and \"I Dare\" programs where people can ask questions about HIV and get answers instantly. Counselors can also be accessed via chatbots, social media and this website page. So, this program received appreciation from the Indonesian Ministry of Health and the DKI Jakarta Health Service. More than 800 people have been referred to HIV testing services in Indonesia. The \"Ask Marlo\" and \"I Dare\" programs have been accessed in 20 districts/cities. Opportunities for replication of this activity are additional counselors in areas with a high HIV epidemic level. The cooperation between the government and the private sector is expected to increase the effectiveness of this program.

Unlearning Ableism can be one of the pioneers in voicing the equal rights of persons with disabilities. 4. Muhammadiyah COVID-19 Command Center (MCCC): Muhammadiyah's Contribution in Handling Covid-19 By Muhammadiyah Muhammadiyah COVID-19 Command Center (MCCC) is a special team formed by the Pimpinan Pusat Muhammadiyah (Muhammadiyah Central Leadership) to handle COVID-19. Various programs for handling COVID-19 have been carried out by Muhammadiyah-'Aisyiyah as a form of contribution from civil society in overcoming the COVID-19 problem. Since COVID-19 cases began to be found in Indonesia, Muhammadiyah and 'Aisyiyah have provided a hospital that is a referral service for handling COVID-19. To date, 86 number of Muhammadiyah and 'Aisyiyah Hospitals continue to provide COVID-19 case services in 12 provinces (DIY, Central Java, West Java, East Java, DKI Jakarta, Lampung, Sumatra, West Sumatra, Kalimantan, South Kalimantan, South Sulawesi, and West Nusa Tenggara). As 2021, as many Supervision), 2,684 Probable, 13,914 suspects, 17,820 people are confirmed positive for COVID-19 have been treated at 86 Muhammadiyah-'Aisyiyah Hospitals. In addition, there are self-isolation services provided by Muhammadiyah-'Aisyiyah in DI Yogyakarta and Jakarta with a total of 648 service users. Regarding the COVID-19 vaccination program, a total of 60 Muhammadiyah-'Aisyiyah hospitals have vaccinated 68,208 people. In the provision of health services, Muhammadiyah-'Aisyiyah distributed masks, gloves, N95 masks, cover all, cloth masks, goggles glasses, rapid tests, face shields, long plastic, and shoe covers to Muhammadiyah-Picture A7 Documentation of Huan Right Day Online Conference301 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021'Aisyiyah hospitals and clinics. In handling COVID-19, Muhammadiyah- 'Aisyiyah has initiated various programs for the community, such as: distributing masks to 1,140,936 people; spraying disinfectants at distributing kg; takjil to thermometers; distributing disinfectants to 2,895 people; distributing portable sinks assistance to 26,500 people; dissemination and education to the broader community, providing psychosocial services to 1,788 people, providing guide books for worship during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing Muhammadiyah self-isolation shelters, providing COVID-19 guidebooks, providing food security programs, distributing vegetable seeds to 20,000 people, providing educational program by using cars, providing call center services, providing volunteer education, and distributing medical devices.

The total donations collected were IDR 30,946,853,464 and Lazismu Center's donations were IDR 8,948,388,508. From the various programs that have been implemented by MCCC, the total value is IDR 346,331,834,234, with a total of 31,907,519 beneficiaries. 5. Community Tuberculosis Care Support for people affected with Tuberculosis through a pilot Mental Health and Psychosocial Support program By 'Aisyiyah Since COVID-19 pandemic emerged, most Tuberculosis patients and people affected with TB often face increasing fear of being infected by Corona virus - apart from the fear of Tuberculosis itself. In order to help addressing this problem, 'Aisyiyah, through its Community Tuberculosis program established a pilot project called Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) in October 2020. MHPSS used the basic knowledge and skills of Tuberculosis patient supporters and case managers in assisting TB patients through every treatment. These basic skills were enriched with the collaboration of Muhammadiyah COVID-19 Command Centre (MCCC) who offered their psychologists to provide necessary counselling. While MCCC provided psychologist in the national level for online specialist counselling, 'Aisyiyah provided volunteers in 14 provinces to perform an online/virtual Psychological First Aid (PFA) and refer more complex mental and psychosocial cases to the psychologist. These volunteers were recruited and given brief training and workshop about how to assess the stress level of the clients and how to provide the PFA. The workshop was done on the same event with the launching of the program. It was attended by all the PFA volunteers, patient supporters, and some representatives of Tuberculosis patients and families. The launching event's main purpose was to introduce the MHPSS services to the Tuberculosis -affected people so that they know where to seek help whenever they feel the fear of the stress. The results obtained were: 1. 15 PFA volunteers were recruited with one in national level, and the other 14 in 'Aisyiyah's Community TB care program areas,302 ANNEXES2. By the end of the 6-week pilot program, there were 8 cases recorded and handled by the PFA volunteers; 4 cases were from female TB patients, and the other 4 were from male TB patients, 3. The discovery of mental and psychosocial problems among Tuberculosis patients such as: (a) their lack of knowledge and information regarding how to deal with the TB treatment services and side effects; (b) stigma towards themselves that was induced by the fear of stigma from their societies; and (c) the fear of going to the health facilities due to COVID-19 pandemic. From this pilot program, we know that MHPSS can be very beneficial and effective for Tuberculosis -affected people (especially during this COVID-19 pandemic) if only it had more time to implement so that it could reached more broader Tuberculosis-affected people. In addition, had the PFA volunteers enough knowledge and capacity of Tuberculosis care and prevention, the program would have run more easily and more people would engage in the program. 6. Tuberculosis cadre stories By Aisyiyah In 2020, 'Aisyiyah's Tuberculosis Care program has had over 5000 active cadres who have been involved as the front liners in the Tuberculosis case finding, contact investigation, and TB treatment assistance. Some of these cadres are former Tuberculosis patients who aspire to take part in the Tuberculosis elimination program. Some others are also one of the essential parts in 'Aisyiyah board members. The former TB patient who became cadre was Marzuki, a 35-year-old man from Probolinggo district. He was really eager to educate the society where he came from about what TB is and how it can be dangerous if people are not well-aware about this disease. Other than that, he knew it first-hand how it feels to be in Tuberculosis treatment and how essential it is to have social and family support during the treatment. Marzuki established basically consisted of 30 members included houseviwes from his society and focused on the door-to-door Tuberculosis education and stigma eradication. This innovation has become indispensable approach in Puskesmas Tegaliswan, Probolinggo in case finding and Tuberculosis education. One 'Aisyiyah organization members who became cadre was Siti Maria, a 67-year-old woman from Medan, North Sumatera. She was one of the oldest cadres who have been the front-liners of Tuberculosis program since the beginning of 'Aisyiyah's Tuberculosis program in 2009. Despite her age, she still has strong courage to take part in Tuberculosis elimination program in Medan. She has various ways to educate people about Tuberculosis - from local faith-based gathering, to schools. She also is actively involved in helping Puskesmas to deliver medication to the patients, and any other activities to support the Tuberculosis treatment success. Maria was lucky, she is still healthy, strong, and has 4 children and 9 grandchildren who have always been supporting what she does until today. It is all because of the persistence and success in assisting and supporting Tuberculosis patients after 10 years of being a cadre in Medan. In 2020, she was given appreciation of being the best cadre from 'Aisyiyah due to her persistence and perseverance.303 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021GOAL 8 DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH LIST OF GOOD PRACTICES FOR GOAL 8 1. Mamuju MSMEs become Independent and Successful After the Earthquake By Indonesian Institute of Small and Medium Enterprises Strategic Study (LKS UKMI) At the beginning of 2021, there was an earthquake which affected people in Mamuju District, West Sulawesi. In the middle of the recovery process due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, this incident paralyzed the economy, including MSMEs in this area. This encourages various parties to move to help the recovery process of MSMEs in Mamuju District, including the Indonesian Institute of Small and Medium Enterprises Strategic Study (LKS UKMI). LKS UKMI is an institution that is engaged in fostering and developing MSMEs in Mamuju District, West Sulawesi since October 2010. This institution has collaborated with the BUMN Creative House as part of the BUMN Ministry program until 2017 to work together to develop MSMEs, help them grow, be independent and successful. In the process of awakening from the impact of the pandemic and earthquake disaster, as the progenitor of MSMEs in Mamuju, LKS UKMI tries to continue providing assistance to MSME actors. Even though the conditions were not as comfortable as before, LKS UKMI still tried to become a home for MSMEs in Mamuju. Source: LKS UKMIPicture A8 Documentation of LKS UKMI Activities304 ANNEXESAs a result of the earthquake, the LKS UKMI Building was destroyed and could not be used as a place to market MSME products. Therefore, LKS UKMI is currently focused on rebuilding houses for MSME actors. LKS UKMI also continues to develop previously designed coaching programs and create new programs that are more applicable and strategic. In addition, LKS UKMI also presents a showroom and prepares production tools for MSMEs as well as presenting MSME products in Mamuju tourism destinations. In its activities, LKS UKMI also collaborates with local agencies and related stakeholders. Its activities are focused on helping MSMEs that produce food and beverages, clothing, and handicrafts. This post-earthquake recovery program will be implemented between 1 July 2021 - 1 July 2022. In its implementation, LKS UKMI will also focus on presenting a digital economy ecosystem for MSME players in Mamuju. The hope is that in the short term, this program will be able to help MSMEs in Mamuju to become independent and successful again so that they can improve the social and economic welfare of the community. This program can also be applied to other areas experiencing disasters in Indonesia so that they can become a resilient economic center. 2. Local Innovation, Love Your Local Products: Endek Goes International By Chairman of the Bali Province PKK Steering Team, Industry and Trade Office, Regional National Craft Council As an area that is very popular with its tourism, Bali is an area that has been severely affected by the pandemic because not only the tourism sector but also other supporting sectors have felt the impact of the reduced tourist visits during the pandemic period. One of those affected is the craft-producing MSME players in Bali. Therefore, efforts to rise from the pandemic period are carried out in order to empower MSME actors and improve community welfare. One form of this effort is to encourage campaigns and innovations to love local products, namely the Endek fabric, which is one of Bali's cultural heritage. This innovation aims to increase the marketing of Endek Bali handicrafts by utilizing information technology so that it is more recognized at the international level. This innovation was carried out by the Head of the Bali Province PKK Steering Team, the Department of Industry and Trade in synergy with the Bali Regional National Craft Council (Dekranasda), which is supported by other parties such as the Office of Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises, the Regional Development Planning Agency, the Financial and Regional Assets Management Agency, Banking Parties, and Balimall (e-marketplace). This program focuses on mentoring, coaching and assisting Endek craftsmen MSME. In addition, this program also facilitates the fulfillment of production raw materials and capital as well as marketing to penetrate the export market. In this program, Endek handicrafts are modified to attract domestic tourists by applying Endek in the form of ready-to-use creative products such as apparel, bags, wallets and sandals. On the other hand, Endek is also produced in sheet fabric which is more attractive to foreign tourists. 305 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021As an effort to revive MSME products in the midst of a pandemic, MSME players are facilitated through exhibitions with a hybrid pattern, namely a combination of \"offline\" and \"online\" to introduce superior products. This activity aims to provide space for local designers to continue working to raise the potential of Balinese traditional woven fabrics as well as to encourage MSME players to produce products that can promote Balinese \"brand\". In terms of payment transactions, this activity is also supported by Bank BPD Bali with Bank BPD Bali QRIS service which is a banking service for Bank BPD Bali in the context of implementing the Standard National Quick Response Code for non-cash payment transactions. One of the moments that Endek is known for at international events is when Christian Picture A9.

In this agreement, it was agreed that the Endek Balinese cloth or wastra used shall be handmade by weavers in Bali using a loom. In addition, Christian Dior also fully respects the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) of Endek Bali cloth. This agreement will further introduce Endek crafts and Balinese culture in general to foreign communities and is expected to be able to encourage economic recovery in Bali.306 ANNEXES3. COVID Response by Sampoerna By PT HM Sampoerna Tbk The COVID-19 pandemic besides having a fairly large impact on the economy, thus encouraging the active involvement of various parties to overcome this impact. Through the umbrella of Sampoerna's sustainability program for Indonesia, PT HM Sampoerna Tbk has taken an active role in reducing the spread of COVID-19 by providing support for employees, business partners and communities in operational areas. In implementing its programs, Sampoerna collaborates with corporate social responsibility partners such as the Stapa Center, the Rumah Kita Foundation Sidoarjo, the Senyum Untuk Negeri Foundation and the Business Export Development Organization (BEDO), as well as the Task Force for the Acceleration of COVID-19 Handling, the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), KADIN, as well as national and regional governments. In the early stages, a mapping of the needs in Sampoerna's operational areas was carried out (in the context of this program, in Java and Bali). Then, Sampoerna distributed assistance to various hospitals and communities, in the form of 8,900 complete personal protective equipment, more than 13 million medical/non-medical masks, building more than 55 hand washing facilities, thousands of liters of disinfectant liquid, more than 385,000 hand antiseptic fluids, distributing 19,500 food packages and more than 140 tons of rice to the community. Sampoerna also donated 7 PCR machines and accessories and 14 ventilators. Sampoerna is also committed to continuing support for MSMEs in Indonesia through more than 130,000 traditional grocery stores that are members of the Sampoerna Retail Community (SRC). Assistance was provided in the form of education on health and safety protocols, distribution of more than 650,000 non-medical masks and 80,000 liters of hand sanitizers, and creation of cashier partitions to ensure physical distance from consumers. On the other hand, Sampoerna through the Sampoerna Entrepreneurship Training Center (SETC) which has been operating since 2007, provides online training that raises the topic of practical ways for MSMEs to survive during a pandemic. In addition, support is also provided in the form of food security and developing productive synergies with several stakeholders related to accelerating national economic growth through increasing the competitiveness of MSMEs. Sampoerna also paid attention to former Indonesian migrant workers affected by the pandemic by providing assistance in the form of 10,000 hygiene packages consisting of 20,000 non-medical masks, 10,000 bottles of hand sanitizers, and 10,000 drawstring bags made by SETC-assisted MSMEs. Until December 2020, Sampoerna noted that the beneficiaries of this program, including hospitals, medical personnel and the general public, were as many as 1 million beneficiaries. In its implementation, increasing public awareness of the importance of implementing applicable health protocols is a challenge that needs to be faced. This program can be replicated by increasing the collaboration of more parties and at various levels of society.307 INDONESIA'S VNR 20214. Inclusive Sustainable Economic Development (ISED) By Ministry of PPN/Bappenas and GIZ This program is a collaboration between Indonesia and Germany through Bappenas and GIZ to implement an inclusive and sustainable business model. This includes developing the human resources needed to strengthen the capacities of actors and create jobs in the private and public sectors. ISED seeks to support and promote an inclusive and sustainable job market. In general, this program is implemented through several strategies, namely (i) formulating policies for inclusive job creation; (ii) strengthening labor market supply at regional and sectoral levels; (iii) expanding the implementation of an inclusive and sustainable business model; and (iv) increasing cooperation between the government and the private sector. This program involves ministries and institutions such as Bappenas, Ministry of UKM, Ministry of Creative Economy, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Villages and PDT as well as other parties such as the NTB Regional Government, KADIN, the private sector, academics, and village communities. The targets of this program are people in Bilebante Village, Central Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara Province as well as business actors and workers in the tourism and manufacturing sectors. This program is able to increase skills and job opportunities for business actors and workers, increase business and employment in the tourism and manufacturing sectors, and increase inclusive business in the tourism sector in NTB. The implementation of the program encountered several challenges, including the lack of community awareness to do business and work as well as the minimal involvement of village communities in village development. On the other hand, cooperation with the private sector to hold training is also quite challenging to implement. ISED also prepares an exit strategy in the form of a village development guide that can be used as a reference for other stakeholders. In general, this activity has the opportunity to be replicated in other potential villages as well as collaborating with other parties. 308 ANNEXESGOAL 10 REDUCED INEQUALITIES LIST OF GOOD PRACTICES FOR GOAL 10 1. Mentor Facility to Investigate and Prosecute TIP Crimes in Indonesia By International Organization for Migration (IOM) Since 2007, Indonesia has shown its commitment to eradicate the Crime of Trafficking in Persons (TIP) by enacting Law Number 21 of 2007 concerning the Eradication of TIP and instructing the government at the national and regional levels to form an Anti-Trafficking Task Force (ATTF) through a Presidential Regulation No. 69/2008, and in addition to existing laws, in 2009, the Government of Indonesia ratified the Palermo Protocol. While substantial efforts have been made to improve the protection and criminal justice system for victims of trafficking through the involvement of law enforcement agencies in the ATTF, Indonesia has shown limited progress in investigating and prosecuting TIP cases as reported by the US Department of State Trafficking in Persons Report 2019. Although there has been some progress in the number of cases investigated, the rates of sentences imposed on perpetrators are less than permitted under the Criminal Code, and prosecution has focused primarily on individual perpetrators rather than transnational crimes, syndicates or end user companies. Some of these limitations have been highlighted in a legal review of the implementation of Law No. 21/2007 conducted by IOM and passed by the Attorney General of the Republic of Indonesia in August 2016. This legal review highlights several aspects related to the criminal justice sector such as: the need to improve the quality of victim-witness statements, increase efforts to trace the property and assets of the perpetrator, increase efforts to provide state compensation for victims of trafficking if provided with restitution. The law can neither execute nor prosecute superiors for their role in a TIP case, brings to trial legal entities with legal status or improves intra and inter-agency coordination. In the process of implementing this activity, IOM has supported the Government of Indonesia to develop a TIP Investigation and Prosecution Manual, as well as Guidelines for Law Enforcement and Protection of Witnesses and/or Victims in Handling the Crime of Trafficking in Persons. IOM also trained 161 prosecutors led by 7 trained trainers across the country on handling TIP cases, in line with Law no. 21/2007, where the need to continue capacity building in the prosecution of TIP can be widely observed outside the project.309 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021Furthermore, in the 2018 to 2020 period, IOM and the Government of Indonesia have designed, developed and launched a sustainable capacity building program for prosecutors through an innovative Mentor Facility that pairs experienced prosecutors or mentors with students. The Mentor Facility is a programme for experienced TIP practitioners to guide their counterparts in a sustained, hands-on, and practical manner in handling TIP cases. In coordination with the Attorney General's Office Center for Education and Trainings (BADIKLAT), IOM developed the e-learning platform that are used as one of the learning tools by the selected mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s during the pilot of the facility. The e-learning platform was used by the mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to learn all elements of TIP proceedings and resources on handling TIP cases. It serves as an interactive platform for prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to obtain information and consult with experienced mentors on TIP issues and case handlings. Each of the six interactive materials in the e-learning platform were also available in a webinar format and equipped with post-material tests to measure the understanding of prot\u00e9g\u00e9s towards the material in the e-learning platform. There were 14 prot\u00e9g\u00e9s directly selected by BADIKLAT, who were all required to take a final test to obtain a certificate of completion. As part of the Mentor Facility programs, IOM facilitated 14 in-person meetings between the mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s from December 2019 to February 2020. The meetings were organized to support each pair of mentors and proteges, and served as a place for in-depth mentoring, case troubleshooting, and networking opportunities. Some prot\u00e9g\u00e9s took this opportunity to seek practical guidance from their respective mentor on the TIP case they were handling. Some of them also used the meeting to re-share the TIP-related information gained from the Mentor Facility to other prosecutors or even to the community nearby. In March 2020, the evaluation meeting on the implementation of the Mentor Facility offered several recommendations that could be useful for improving the criminal justice system in prosecuting TIP cases. These recommendations consist of: 1. Establishment of an open access knowledge sharing platform with TIP-based topics to increase the capacity of law enforcement officials, 2. Increase the capacity of law enforcement officers to investigate TIP with basic investigative skills in following procedures for confiscating money and assets, and 3. Improve intra and inter-institutional coordination to support the investigation and prosecution process, including through integrated policies in the field of criminal justice, especially in restitution and asset confiscation. In addition, all participants agreed that the whole programme was effective, especially for the prot\u00e9g\u00e9s since it allowed them to still actively learn without having to hold off their main duty as prosecutor in their office. The prot\u00e9g\u00e9s also pointed out other benefits from the programme, for instance they could discuss active cases directly with TIP experts and experienced prosecutors through various platforms offered in the programme including through webinars and the WhatsApp group. As a result, all prot\u00e9g\u00e9s agreed that the programme has been helpful and practical since the knowledge could be applied directly to their work. In fact, many prosecutors prot\u00e9g\u00e9s have been considered as TIP experts in their respective office due to their good knowledge on TIP issues.310 ANNEXES2. Advancing Measures to Prosecute TIP (AMPUH) By International Organization for Migration (IOM) The 2019 TIP report notes ongoing gaps, such as a reduced number of investigations, prosecutions and punishments for TIP cases, low availability and lack of coordinated implementation of rehabilitation services for VOT, reduced allocation of adequate resources for anti-TIP efforts at the national and local levels, lack of robust victim identification procedures. Indonesia is the source, transit and destination country of TIP which affects men, women and children throughout the country. TIP for the purposes of forced labor, child sex trafficking and forced marriage are very common. Through the ongoing AMPUH project, IOM will contribute to the overall efforts put forward by the Government of Indonesia, particular through: 1. Strengthening the capacity of the Government of Indonesia to effectively prosecute TIP crimes, 2. The Indonesian government and CSOs proactively identify and protect VOT through a referral mechanism, 3. Trafficking survivors are economically independent, psychosocial stable equipped to face (Return) the drivers of migration First, this program is aimed at strengthening the capacity of the Government of Indonesia in prosecuting TIP crimes effectively. Thus, through the project, IOM collaborates with the Supreme Court to develop the training manual for judges on TIP and will provide capacity development activities for judges on TIP prosecution. In addition, IOM will closely work with law enforcement agencies, the judiciary, and the Coordinating Ministry for Political, Law and Security Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia to establish an integrated data system on the investigation, prosecution, and punishment of TIP. As complementary efforts, IOM is currently developing training materials and will later conduct trainings for university legal clinic practitioners to provide legal counseling and pro- bono assistance to VOT. To achieve the second objective, IOM with the Ministry of Women Empowerment and Child Protection, as the daily chair of the National Anti-Trafficking Task Force, are updating the SOP on integrated services for victim and/or witness of TIP. Following this, a series of trainings will be held for service providers at the national and local level on victim identification and referral to rehabilitation services and comprehensive assistance as in line with the updated SOP. As the third component of the project, IOM will continue to complement the government's fund to deliver tailored assistance to victims of trafficking. The assistance will aim towards trafficking survivors' economic independence, recovery of their social and psychosocial state, in order to equip them in facing the drivers of migration. In providing the direct services, IOM works closely with NGOs and government service providers to ensure the fulfilment of victims' rights. In parallel to this, NGOs service providers' capacities will also be developed to provide victim-centered and trauma-informed services.311 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021GOAL 12 RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION LIST OF GOOD PRACTICES FOR GOAL 12 1. Community-Based Independent Trash Management By PT. Pindo Deli Pulp and Paper Mills - Karawang (APP Sinar Mas) Even though the Indonesian government has taken initiatives for waste management, this problem cannot be resolved without the awareness of community members about responsible waste management. Changes in the mindset and behavior of both individuals and society in general, especially in managing waste responsibly, are the main things needed to achieve success in solving the waste issue in Indonesia. PT. Pindo Deli Pulp and Paper Mills (PDK), as one of the companies under Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) Sinar Mas identifies waste as one of the main problems of the community around its area. In 2016, PDK developed a community-based independent waste management program through the formation of a waste management group called \"Sahabat Lingkungan Independent Garbage Group (KSM)\". This program is focused on around 300 households, especially in Sukaluyu Village, Karawang District. Not only collecting waste, this KSM develops its goal of turning waste into economic opportunities. Picture A11 Trash management This program maintains close coordination with the local government, which provides support in the form of construction of trash bins, composter machines and the purchase of motorbikes for waste collection activities. Until 2019, around 3,150 households have been involved in this program. The beneficiaries of this program are the people around Sukaluyu Village, Karawang District, totaling around 7,000 families. Sahabat Lingkungan KSM is able to get a net income of around IDR 6,000,000 per month from the sale of non-organic waste to the recycling industry. This group is also able to create jobs such as scavenging, as well as other job opportunities in the facility. The net income earned by the group is used for infrastructure projects and to expand their activities to other fields by cultivating catfish. For each catfish harvest cycle, this group is able to generate income of IDR 20-25 million with a net profit of IDR 6-8 million. This waste bank group has been running for about 4 years and receives about 2 tonnes of waste every day collected from 7,000 households. 312 ANNEXESKSM collaborates with various stakeholders such as the Environmental Office, Public Works and Public Housing Office, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK), the private sector and universities. This collaboration is a strategic step to ensure program development and sustainability. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the waste bank operational activities continued as usual. Sales of sorted waste which have economic value have decreased slightly due to reduced demand from partners. Even so, Sahabat Lingkungan KSM continues to support community-based waste management activities in other locations. One such initiative is the development of TPS3R in Kuta Negara Village supported by the Ministry of Public Works through the Citarum Harum Program, which aims to replicate community-based waste management as managed by Sahabat Lingkungan KSM. This integrated waste management program is a clear example of how local communities can contribute significantly to achieving the national target of reducing plastic waste by 70% and managing 70% of waste by 2025. 2. Overcoming Waste Problems through Community-Based Waste Banks By PT. Eka Mas Fortuna (APP Sinar Mas) Garbage is generally seen as dirty with no value. This limited thinking is what causes waste management in Indonesia to lag behind other countries. Waste management in general still follows the concept of collect, transport, throw away - which causes most of the waste to end up in the landfill. The accumulation of garbage without proper management requires additional space for landfills, which results in the need for expensive equipment to protect the surrounding environment from its negative effects, especially odors. In collaboration with the Gampingan Bersinar Waste Bank Group, the Malang District Environmental Office and the Garbage Entrepreneur Association, PT. Ekamas Fortuna as a part of Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) Sinar Mas through its CSR program initiated a waste bank program in the Malang District area. The program was initially implemented on privately owned land, but as its development has progressed, this program has been transferred to community-owned land and is supported by the entire village. This program is designed to address educational and socialization issues related to waste collection and management for the entire community. Gampingan Bersinar Bank Group hires scavengers to collect garbage from households, schools, health centers and businesses. Once collected, the amount of waste that can be recycled is recorded and then exchanged for money. The Gampingan Bersinar Group then sells the waste to a recycling facility as a source of income. The profits collected are used to finance the operations of the waste bank, the rest is shared among members. PT Ekamas Fortuna supports group activities through capacity building, provision of new equipment, training and expanding the overall group network. The beneficiaries of this program are the people around the village of Gampingan, which number around 300 families. KSM collaborates with various stakeholders such as the Department of Environment, Ministry of Forestry and Environment, the private sector and universities. This collaboration is a strategic step to ensure program development and sustainability. Until 2019, 250 households and 15 community organizations in locations such as places of worship, schools, etc. have participated in the waste bank program. The immediate result is a 313 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021clean and healthy environment. The Waste Bank is now managed by the village government as one of the Village-Owned Enterprises called BUMDes Gampingan. Based on these initiatives and progress in the field, in November 2019, Gampingan Village was awarded the Main Category in the Village Climate Program by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. Strong commitment from stakeholders is essential to ensure the sustainability of the program. This helps to ensure that the program will have a significant and positive impact on the community, addressing waste management issues in the surrounding area. Ongoing community involvement is essential to gain momentum, support and participation, especially in the early stages of the program. Networking is essential to further open collaboration opportunities as well as increase program implementation and reach. Community-based waste management programs have tremendous potential to be replicated in other areas. The village-owned business model can be an appropriate framework for ensuring the sustainability and development of these programs. A continuous approach to key figures and environmental activists on waste management issues is needed to secure and expand support from the community. This program is designed to support the commitment of the Government of Indonesia to reduce plastic waste by up to 70%, solid waste by 30%, and ensure management of up to 70% by 2025. Even with the COVID-19 pandemic, waste bank operations are still running as usual. This community-based waste bank group continues to advocate for the importance of good waste management to the surrounding community. This program aims to create a cleaner environment without piles of trash and unpleasant odors. In addition to protecting the environment, the community waste bank program has economic benefits, so that it can improve the welfare of the group. 3. Sustainable Palm Oil Project in West Kalimantan By BASF and HENKEL To improve the living conditions of the oil palm farmers, BASF and Henkel have been working with Solidaridad since 2016 and are still ongoing today to provide training to around 5,500 farmers in Indonesia. To date, more than 1,700 smallholders have completed training programs as part of the Farmer Field School (FFS) initiative. A total of 1,559 farmers (31% women) have completed FFS courses on good agricultural practices and sustainable agricultural management. This yields an average of 15 to 15.6 tonnes of Fresh Fruit Bunches/ha/year in less than a year. In addition, the FFS Alumni Association has been established to provide sustainable support to farmers. The pilot group of 200 FFS alumni is now working towards the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification. In addition, financial literacy training has increased small farmers' knowledge of money management, responsible use of financial products and services, investment, and encouraged farmers to save for business capital. The median income of 8,785 alumni (of which 57% were women) increased from \u20ac 1,460 to \u20ac 1,610 per year (+ 10%). The FFS provides 2,400 farmers with certified seed and high-quality inputs, including subsidized fertilizers, through the K77 agricultural cooperative. About 1,400 members regularly receive SMS messages about prices and training as well as the value of the professionalism of the cooperative developed through the capacity building program. Further information is available at www.henkel.com/palmoil and http://bit.ly/palm-dialog.314 ANNEXES4. Bumi Pattimura The amount of waste in Negeri Laha is high in volume (approximately 3 tons per day on average) based on the estimated population of 1,075 households. However, the number of bins is limited and there is no temporary trash can available, while public awareness is still low to dispose of garbage in its place. Furthermore, the amount of waste, especially plastic waste sent from the ocean currents, piles up in the area. There is a group called Bumi Maluku Lestari Waste Bank in Negeri Laha which has been established and has been running since 2018 which has management and customers of 40 people. Pertamina has a concern in the environmental sector and Negeri Laha is included in the Ring 1 area of the Pattimura DPPU. Pattern of community engagement to make the people interested and turn them into loyal customers Strategy: assistance to the Bumi Maluku Lestari Waste Bank group by the CSR team of PT Pertamina DPPU Pattimura, infrastructure support and capacity building for the group's human resources, as well as assisting and bridging the expansion of the stakeholder partnership network. Parties involved: PT Pertamina DPPU Pattimura, Nature Community, other CSR program assisted groups also run by PT Pertamina DPPU Pattimura, members of the Bumi Waste VNR 20215. Indonesia Circular Economy Forum By Greeneration Foundation Circular Economy is a principle that can be used to help achieve the target of Presidential Regulation No. 27/2017 concerning National Strategy and Policy (Jakstranas) for households and household-like waste processing at the national, provincial and district levels, in which the target for waste reduction has been set at 30% and waste management at 70% by 2025. The Indonesia Circular Economy Forum (ICEF), initiated by the Greeneration Foundation, aims to accelerate the transition to the Circular Economy in Indonesia through national and international partnerships. There are four main objectives of ICEF, namely establishing ICEF as the national platform for the Circular Economy in Indonesia, promoting multi-stakeholder commitment and collaboration, promoting international engagement in the Circular Economy, and implementing a circular and sustainable business model in Indonesia.ICEF was first held in 2017 and takes place annually in partnership with many government agencies in Indonesia, the private sector, associations, communities, and foreign institutions. The total number of ICEF participants from 2017 has reached 1,600 people. Last year, the ICEF pre-event was attended by 848 participants from more than 20 countries. This year, the annual ICEF forum will be held on 21-23 July 2021 with an online scheme with the theme Toward Smart and Sustainable Cities through Circular Economy: Building Resilience during COVID-19 Recovery. In 2020, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of circular economy is emphasized in realizing smart and sustainable cities. In addition, a circular economy can contribute to economic recovery without compromising our environmental aspects. Picture A13 Documentation of Bumi Maluku Lestari Waste Bank Activities316 ANNEXESICEF is also a strategic partner of the Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas and UNDP in developing the National Strategy for the National Circular Economy in Indonesia. Apart from the annual forum, the 4th ICEF has several series of programs, namely: Circular Jumpstart, National Commitment, and Indonesiacef.id website. Three recommendations to address the challenges of implementing a circular economy in cities include policy & regulation, leadership & commitment, and education & research. 6. Buntah - Soap from Used Cooking Oil By Tria kebersihan, Buntah.id, KKN of Lampung University in Gumukmas Village Most of the household and SME sectors still frequently dispose used cooking oil into waterways, even in small amounts. Used cooking oil, commonly known as jelantah, is waste that causes damage due to hydrolysis and oxidation processes. From an environmental perspective, according to the Environmental Management Agency (BPLH), if it is not properly managed, used cooking oil can become B3 waste (hazardous and toxic) which has the potential to poison the ecosystem, disrupt the biological and chemical balance and trigger high pollution due to being discharged into waterways or land. Therefore, a responsible waste management of used cooking oil is necessary to turn it into a more useful product, one of which is used cooking oil soap.This innovation was initiated by the young generation, Tria Fadilla, involving Gajahlah kebersihan, Buntah.id, Community Service Program (KKN) of the University of Lampung at Gumukmas Village, the Women Farmers Group, Lampung Post, Metro Lampung, the Environmental Office of Lampung Province and Green Hydroponics. During the pandemic, they carried out activities such as promoting or educating through digital platforms and social media, holding offline meetings to discuss further activities and collaborating to carry out the initiative. The number of young people involved in the Buntah program was 15 people. This program is able to provide assistance in processing waste, especially used cooking oil, Picture A14 Documentation of ICEF Webinar317 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021into decorative soap which reduces pollution to the ecosystem. The used cooking oil soap products will increase the average income of the people. The program is also supported through collaboration with community partners, media, and agencies. It helps build the capacity of adults through the women of the Sekar Tanjung farmer group in Pringsewu District by teaching them how to make used cooking oil soap for 10 days, from the planning to the production stage. The number of beneficiaries is currently 30 people. This program will be developed by submitting several proposals for activities with greater impact and starting to carry out monitoring and evaluation stages, used cooking oil banks, building modules, and various other ideas.318 ANNEXESGOAL 13 CLIMATE ACTION LIST OF GOOD PRACTICES FOR GOAL 13 1. Empowerment Grow Green By Jejak Rimba Raya This program is carried out in the form of #JejakRimbaRaya campaign to walk a trail together to make the earth, nature, people, & the environment healthier and more conserved through simple Patterns and lifestyles. It also encourages real action to grow green, empower local communities, manage natural resources and help accelerate the achievement of the SDGs in Indonesia. The approaches include conservation (carbon), ecotourism, and planting of nutmeg trees. The program will be implemented in 2021 in Batee Meucanang Village, Labuhan Haji Sub-district, South Aceh District. Forest is an important place relied on by the locals for their livelihood through agricultural cultivation and various plants that ecologically contribute to the preservation of forest ecosystems and fully empower every plant commodity that has economic and market value. Since the pandemic and in the last few years, we realize that the forest ecosystem has been disrupted by various activities of some humans that damage the environment. One of them is illegal logging. This has caused damage to the function of the forest ecosystem and several commodity crops of local community farmers have also begun to have a damaged impact. Like the nutmeg plant that began to die instantly and did not bear fruit like in the last 10 years, durian fruit that did not taste sweet or even tasteless when harvested and ripe, as well as many other damaging effects due to human activities that are not environmentally friendly and destructive. Seeing the complexity of this problem, Restu, as a young man with other conscious communities, was moved to create big changes to mitigate the damage to the forest ecosystem through the Jejak Rimba Raya community which was based on research data and continued to find the right solution which we would apply in the future. And all the donations that will be collected through this fundraising will be allocated to create impactful and sustainable changes in environmental sustainability, green growth, empowerment of local communities and based on sustainable development goals as well as environmentally friendly principles.319 INDONESIA'S VNR 20212. Building Disaster Risk Reduction for City Resilience By Yayasan Pusat Kajian dan Perlindungan Anak (PKPA) Save The Children partners with Google.org to build community and children resilience in the face of natural disasters and the climate crisis. This program targets direct beneficiaries of 560,000 people, of which 30% are children who live in disaster-prone areas. The pilot project was carried out in West Java Province, specifically in West Bandung District, Bandung District, and Tasikmalaya District. The selection of pilot areas This program implements three strategies which involve stakeholders at the national and subnational levels. At the national level, this program involves members of the steering committee of BNPB, the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Ministry of Villages and PDT, as well as the Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Culture, while from non-government parties are U-Inspire, UN-Pulse Lab, BBC Media Action, and the Humanitarian Forum Indonesia where 16 religious-based organizations are incorporated. At the sub-national level, this program involves the provincial BPBD and BPBD of the three districts, the BMKG, the Geological Agency and groups of children and youth. Meanwhile, at the site level, this program partners with the West Java LPBI-NU, Village Facilitators, 10 village administrations and 10 schools in the intervention areas. The program employs the conceptual framework of Climate Smart Disaster Risk Management, Disaster Safe Education Unit, principles of child participation, and principles of digital development.The program directly increased awareness and preparedness for 46,363 people (12% children and youth). This program indirectly reaches 20,541,842 (12% children and youth). This increased capacity and awareness was achieved through training and a series of digital campaigns. This program also launched the child-friendly application BUMI KITA which provides content on disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. It also facilitates 100 children from 6 provinces to voice their aspirations directly to the legislative and executive parties regarding the climate crisis against children and child development issues in their living areas. Through this program, young people receives capacity building related to climate change issues through the Jabar Tangguh Action forum. In addition, 10 communities and 10 schools carry out disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation practices that are integrated with village development and empowerment systems. One of them is community-based and school-based climate and weather information, where residents and schools monitor rainfall to understand weather conditions in their area. Picture A.13 Planting Tree Activity was based on the vulnerability of the region where 46% of the total national disaster incidents were reported to have occurred in the West Java Region. In addition, West Java is one of the most risk areas of flooding, landslides and extreme weather associated with the climate crisis.320 ANNEXESThe activity of utilizing biogas for household energy supply, in addition to supporting SDG 13 Climate Action, also supports SDG 1 No Poverty, SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy, and SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth. There are about 30 ha of post-mining land and other moor locations in three villages, namely Keningar, Ngargomulyo, and Sumber Villages which are owned by local residents. After mining activities with heavy equipment were ceased (in 2014), it left the critical land barren. ICCTF collaborates with SESAMI (Sedya Samahita Memetri Indonesia), a local NGO, to develop activities at the site level to fulfill household energy by utilizing biogas. The aim of this project is to reduce GHG emissions and the intensity of GHG emissions from livestock waste by producing renewable energy (biogas), low-emission waste (bioslurry), and compost, which are good for soil and ecosystem quality, and increase carbon stock (from activities revegetation).3. Utilization of Biogas for Household Energy Supply By Sesami The challenges in implementing this activity are partly because the lands are usually owned by widows and elderly, which tends to be uncooperative. The loss of land boundaries at the activity location in the long term will have the potential to create conflicts between land owners in the use of land titles that Picture A15 Biogas making process Picture A16 Impact of the programThis activity was carried out in Keningar Village and Ngargomulyo Village, Magelang District, Central Java Province. Through this project, local people are trained to build a biodigester and operate a nursery center. This project also helps local communities to rehabilitate land formerly used as mining site and replant them with various kinds of trees. ECONOMY ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL321 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021have been certified. In addition, the land on the site is barren sand that grows only grass and shrubs, and requires special techniques to support the success of the activity. Another challenge is the need to involve various parties to support the success of this program. This program has the opportunity to be replicated (scaled-up) by several Ministries/Agencies such as the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Ministry of Village, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and Ministry of Agriculture, as well as various parties outside the government in various locations in Indonesia. 4. Improving the Food and Economic Security of Vulnerable Communities through Sustainable Agriculture By FIELD Foundation Activities to increase food security and the economy of vulnerable communities through sustainable agriculture, in addition to supporting SDG 13 Climate Action, also support SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, and SDG 14 Life Below Water. There are 400 ha of shrimp ponds in Kanaungan village in Labakkang sub-district, Pangkep, South Sulawesi which always experience crop failure. The use of chemical fertilizers continues to increase, while the income of farmers is decreasing. ICCTF in collaboration with the FIELD Foundation carries out several activities to increase sustainable food production and the economy for vulnerable communities. Tambak Field School has been established to stop the use of chemical fertilizers and replace them with organic fertilizers. The Agricultural Field School was also developed to increase the productivity of rice and horticulture. Mangrove planting in aquaculture areas has also been carried out. In addition, the community has also succeeded in applying rice farming and yard horticulture organically by making independent fertilizers. This project has generated additional income for the local community and reduced production costs. Picture A17 Documentation of FIELD Foundation activities322 ANNEXES The challenges in implementing this program include the location of activities in Pangkep District which is an area with relatively low agricultural productivity. In addition, a comprehensive understanding of farmers - which concerns: plant types and varieties, proper planting time, more water efficient cultivation techniques, and integrated pest management methods - has not been optimally mastered by farmers in order to adapt to climatic conditions. Another thing that becomes a challenge is the low level of community income and dependence on dry land with low productivity. These challenges were successfully overcome and resulted in various benefits. This program has the opportunity to be replicated (scaled-up) by several Ministries/Agencies such as the Ministry of Public Affairs, the Ministry of Village, the Ministry of Public Works and Housing, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture, as well as various parties outside the government in various locations in Indonesia.Picture A18 Impact of the program323 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021GOAL 16 PEACE, JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS LIST OF GOOD PRACTICES FOR GOAL 16 1. Collaboration for the Issuance of Birth Certificates for All By UNICEF Indonesia The Government of Makassar City and Gowa District have received support from UNICEF in the 2017-2019 period to increase the coverage of birth certificate ownership in their respective regions. UNICEF's role is to facilitate and support cross-sector collaboration between civil society organizations and local governments. Based on administrative data derived from the Population Administration Information System (SIAK), the program prioritizes seven sub-districts in Makassar City and eight sub-districts in Gowa District which have the lowest coverage of birth certificate ownership. The program is designed to bring services closer to children, whether children living in remote areas or children who are in unfavorable situations such as children in poor households, children living in slum areas, children with disabilities or children with parents with disabilities, children pursued by law, or children stigmatized because of a certain disease who live in a care institution. The local government of Makassar City launched the Program in 2017 by making visits to schools or mobile services in strategic locations. Puskesmas, maternity clinics and hospitals are strategic locations to bring services closer to the moment a birth occurs and to integrate health care centers for children aged 5 to 18 years. Two teams of 100 staffs and volunteers were deployed to implement the program in Makassar City and the surrounding islands. The team was assigned to provide a one-stop service for a variety of services, such as information on population registration, verification of population documents, and printing of birth certificates. The team also collaborated with community organizations concerned with population registration, such as organizations that focus on issues of children and women, education, and social workers. In 2018, the Department of Population and civil registration of Makassar City and Gowa District launched an online-based registration system to connect population and civil registration offices with hospitals and health centers. To implement it, more than 50 officers were trained as operators in charge of verifying supporting documents (such as KTP and KK). This service allows newborns to receive birth certificates immediately, and the family card will be updated before the mother and baby leave the hospital or childbirth clinic.324 ANNEXESThe impact of this program can be seen with a significant increase in ownership of birth certificates from 58.5% (2016) to 95% (2019) in Makassar City, and from 40.4% (2016) to 99.6% (2019) in Gowa District. The results of this program even exceeded the national target of 85%. In addition, the ease of obtaining a birth certificate further encourages mothers to give birth in health facilities accompanied by skilled health workers. This can contribute to a reduced risk of maternal and child mortality. Ownership of population documents also has an impact on increasing vulnerable groups' access to health and social protection programs funded by the government. 2. People Living with HIV in Indonesia are Free from Stigma and Discrimination Thanks to a Supportive Response and Environment By UNAIDS The Indonesian government is committed to implementing a strategy to accelerate the achievement of HIV prevention known as the Fast Track Commitment as an effort to achieve the target to stop the AIDS epidemic in Indonesia by 2030. Through this Fast Track Commitment, the Government of Indonesia sets a target that as many as 90% of people with HIV can find out their status, 90% of people who already know their HIV status can access treatment, and 90% of people with HIV who have accessed treatment can experience a decrease in the amount of virus in their blood (viral suppression). Achieving these targets requires several things, one of which is the provision of a supportive environment in which people living with HIV and key population groups who are vulnerable to HIV are free from stigma and discrimination in various areas of their lives, including in the fields of health, education, employment, as well as justice. In its efforts to support the Indonesian government in achieving these targets, UNAIDS is implementing a program to create an enabling environment and the elimination of laws/policies that hinder the HIV response in Indonesia through cooperation with relevant ministries and state agencies such as the Ministry of Health, the Coordinating Ministry for PMK, BAPPENAS, Komnas HAM, Komnas Perempuan, and also civil society groups. UNAIDS implements this program by producing policy studies and advocacy, campaigns and information dissemination, to assisting in the preparation of a National action plan related to the creation of a supportive environment for the HIV response. One of the achievements made by this program is the inclusion of women and children living with HIV as one of the priority groups of beneficiaries in the 2020-2024 National Human Rights Action Plan. In addition, along with Komnas HAM, Komnas Perempuan, and civil society groups UNAIDS also provided input related to human rights-friendly policies in the HIV sector, especially in the discussion process of the RKUHP, the Bill on the Elimination of Sexual Violence, and the Bill on Family Resilience. In its implementation, UNAIDS faces challenges in multisectoral coordination, especially after the disbandment of the AIDS Commission in 2017. However, as a lesson, UNAIDS is currently encouraging multi-sectoral coordination across ministries by involving civil society groups.325 INDONESIA'S VNR 20213. Progressive and Leading Young Women By Plan International Indonesia Based on the 2010-2035 Indonesian Population Projection data from Statistics Indonesia, there are around 45 million women population aged 0-19 years in 2020. With this large number, young women have great potential to encourage development in Indonesia. However, these efforts require women empowerment and encouragement for gender equality. Seeing this potential, Plan International Indonesia, in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemenkeu), initiated the Girls Leadership Program as a forum for teenagers and young women aged 15-24 years to channel their aspirations towards their vision of equality and development, to be able to empower their community. The Girls Leadership Class, which started at the end of 2020, successfully selected as many as 120 participants who were referred to as \"Girls Leaders\". The Minister of Finance has the role of principal mentor, capacitating selected participants with materials related to access to education and the use of technology. Capacity building for the selected participants was continued with mentoring activities by inspiring young mentors and experts, followed by a selection of action plan proposals up to the implementation stage covering 31 regions, and then closed with inter-generational dialogue. The intergenerational dialogue is a forum to invite stakeholders to support the leadership of children and young women and involve them in the development process. The Girls Leadership Class also managed to reach 2,620 other people through their Youtube channel. In February 2021, 31 Girls Leaders, three of whom represented groups with disabilities, implemented their action plans with their communities. As a result, the Girls Leaders successfully carried out 95 activities in 25 cities/districts in Indonesia. With a diverse focus on issues, including the issue of education and technology, this activity succeeded in reaching 3,361 direct beneficiaries. In addition, several communities led by participants also received support, such as the Be With You Community, which received financial support from one of the investors to develop the concept of empowering women in business. The Panti Carita Community has also succeeded in getting support from the Communication and Information Office of Jepara District in a project to educate children in an orphanage. This activity is expected to support the increase in the participation of young women in the policy-making process from the community level to higher levels. 4. Creating a Safe and Child Friendly School: Anti-Bullying Program in Schools By Setara Foundation, Indonesia Melayani Foundation (YIM), and the Provincial Governments of South Sulawesi and Central Java, supported by UNICEF Indonesia National data from the 2015 Global School Health Survey (GSHS) shows that 21% of children aged 13-15 have experienced bullying in the past month.326 ANNEXESUNICEF together with government, universities, youth, and community-based organizations designed an intervention model to prevent bullying in junior high schools (SMP) in Indonesia. Based on the workshops and by adapting the Roots model from America, the intervention program seeks to build a positive school climate through student-led activities. This approach is documented in a comprehensive module entitled 'Roots as a Bullying Prevention Program for Junior High Schools (SMP)' which was developed with UNICEF, Setara Foundation, Indonesia Mengabdi Foundation (YIM), and the provincial governments of South Sulawesi and Central Java. In the Roots program, students are encouraged to \"propose\" their peers to become agents of change based on social networking theory. The change agents that have been formed will be included in 15 Roots module training sessions designed for junior high school students aged 12-15 years. Through training, trained Roots Agents can understand and identify various forms of bullying and develop and implement coping strategies. In addition, teachers also have a role to play in capacity building through positive discipline and prevention of bullying. In 2017, Roots has been implemented in two junior high schools in Makassar and two junior high schools in Gowa. As an implementing partner, YIM held training for 10 facilitators from staff and members of the Children's Forum. This pilot program managed to reach 3,568 students. The results of the evaluation of the program show that bullying has decreased by 29% and victimization has also decreased by 20%. Teachers and facilitators also noted important advances in the positive behavior of students, including those selected to be agents of change.Seeing the success of the previous pilot program, the Office of Women's Empowerment and Child Protection of South Sulawesi Province in 2019 began to replicate the Roots program in several locations such as Makassar City, Maros, Gowa, East Luwu, and Bulukumba. Twenty facilitators have been given training to implement Roots in one school in each district/city. In addition, the Makassar City Education Office also provided financial support for teacher training in five schools and the application of Roots in two schools. Then, in 2020, UNICEF and its implementing partner, YIM, received funding from the Ministry of Education and Culture (Kemendikbud) to replicate Roots in 50 schools in South Sulawesi and Central Java. After implementing the program several times, several adjustments took place, including the delivery of a \"character-based education concept and value\" module for students in Islamic schools. In addition, in response to the ongoing pandemic, YIM produced a video tutorial on \"Roots in a New Normal Life\" to help teachers deliver online bullying prevention guidelines. Some of the lessons learned from the Roots program include that the involvement of teachers as facilitators can help the sustainability of the bullying prevention program, increasing teacher expertise in positive discipline can encourage more effective responses to complaints of bullying, it is important to link the Roots program with the value of character-based education promoted by the Ministry of Education and Culture and to increase the involvement of school management to the development of child-friendly regulations. There is potential for implementing the Roots program online but there needs to be an assessment first in the context of a pandemic.327 INDONESIA'S VNR 20215. Mitigating the Impact of a Pandemic on Prisoners and Detainees for Children and Adults By Minister of Law and Human Rights of Republic of Indonesia Prison and detention facilities in Indonesia are closed institutions that have high occupancy rates and even tend to exceed capacity. This situation makes it prone to the spread and transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, after President Joko Widodo designated COVID-19 as a non-natural national disaster, the Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia issued a Decree of the Minister of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia Number M.HH-19.PK.01.04.04 of 2020 concerning Expenditure and Release of Prisoners and Children through Assimilation and Integration in the Context of Prevention and Control of the Spread of COVID-19. This Ministerial Decree is the government's response to preventing the spread and handling of COVID-19 in incarceration and detention facilities such as Correctional Facilities (Lapas), Child-Specific Correctional Facilities (LPKA), and State Detention Centers (Rutan). The release of prisoners through assimilation and integration in the form of parole and pre-release parole, were granted to adult prisoners who have served 2/3 of their sentence on 31 December 2020. For children, release through integration and assimilation can be granted if he/she has served half of his/her sentence on 31 December 2020. Assimilation activities are carried out at the house of each prisoner with guidance and supervision carried out by the Correctional Center and reports by officers submitted online. As of June 2020, Indonesia has released 992 children of prisoners and convicts, about half of the number of children in detention and imprisonment facilities in June 2020 (UNICEF, 2020). During 2020, there are at least 57,000 prisoners who have received assimilation (Dirjen Pemasyarakatan KemenkumHAM, 2021). 328 ANNEXESGOAL 17 PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE GOALS LIST OF GOOD PRACTICES FOR GOAL 17 1. Optimizing Local Resources By Penabulu Foundation Penabulu Foundation initiates domestic resource raising in a fairly wide range of activities. This ranges from knowledge transfer, advocacy, support for policy formulation to funding. The foundation explores various forms of local power, promotes it, and links it with other local forces, including local government. This link is manifested in a \"Lokadaya\", which is a digital \u2014 crowdsourcing \u2014 platform to raise public resources, distribute, and convert them in a variety of innovative activities in the field. This initiative has started since October 2020 when 57 local CSOs committed to developing the \"Lokadaya\" platform by first identifying and sharpening all the needs for developing community activities. This activity is planned to be held until September 2022. Lokadaya contains three main features, \"Change Story\". The \"Power Raising\" feature is an arena for raising resources in the form of public donations, non-fund donations (volunteering, equipment, tools or other asset support), as well as partnerships or collaborations. The \"Partner Profile\" feature is a medium for linking CSO local service initiatives to the targeted public/target audience. Meanwhile, \"Change Story\" is a directory of ongoing initiatives. So far, \"Lokadaya\" has been able to involve 200 civil society organizations (CSOs) in 34 provinces, which carry out innovative activities with the community. \"Lokadaya\" is a bridge connecting development actors \u2014 government, society and the private sector \u2014 and capitalizes all forms of power. The various activities that have been carried out can be divided into three classes, namely physical development, economic development, and social services development. Physical development takes the form of improving village street lighting, building city parks and managing residents' waste, recycling used cooking oil into soap and diesel fuel for mosque, making nests for owl that preys on ricefield rat, and harvesting rainwater in coastal villages. The development of social services includes the provision of children's libraries, services to refer and assist TB patients during their treatment, village legal assistance, patrol and coordination of land fire mitigation, as well as campaigns and advocacy for government regulations/policies with residents. Among other things, economic activities include assisting women cotton farmer economic institutions in the production process.329 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021This initiative has the potential to be replicated, reproduced and developed in various places. This expansion will reach more stakeholders with innovative ideas, including distributing more resources. Above all, local power is its main characteristic, so that the link that is formed is actually an aggregation of all forms of local specialties and initiatives. The Sambirata Spice Village Program was initiated in 2019 and lasts until March 2021 with the concept of CSV (Creating Shared Value). Sambirata village, a 'least developed village' in Banyumas, Central Java, was chosen because of its great potential for cardamom development. This program was developed together with the local farmer group \"Kridoyuono\", the Sambirata Village Government, and the Banyumas District Agriculture Office. The Kridoyuono Farmer Group itself has 270 members, consisting of 240 old farmers and 30 young farmers under 30 years of age. Some of these young farmers are those who returned home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This program was carried out in the form of cooperation in the development and utilization of cardamom (Amomum Cardamomum L.) which is one of the raw materials needed for herbal medicine production at PT Sido Muncul. PT Sido Muncul provides farmers with a variety of support, such as superior seeds, fertilizers, equipment, counseling, and technical assistance, from the planting, maintenance and harvesting stage, to post-harvest processing into raw materials that adhere to factory standards. This cooperation includes guidance for making organic fertilizers for the purpose of improving the village environment and reducing dependence on chemical fertilizers. PT Sido Muncul purchased all the crops that have been processed into simplicia at market prices or prices that are fair and beneficial to both parties. However, this program is not without its share of problems. While cardamom can be produced well, it cannot be dried optimally. As a result, the produced cardamom was often rotten 2. Sambirata, Empowered Spice Village By PT Industri Jamu and Farmasi Sido Muncul Tbk. and caused losses to farmers. Farmers need a drying machine and energy to drive it. Currently, the drying machine has been successfully made by utilizing energy from the Micro Hydro Power Plant (PLTMH). This micro-hydro-power guarantees the availability of electricity supply for cardamom business activities. Further programs were developed to intensify productivity, both at the site level and at the business management level. Various trainings and business management developments continue to be carried out. At the site level, the intensification of cardamom cultivation is being developed. Unproductive land \u2014 even home yards \u2014 is used for cultivating cardamom and even other spices. At the same time, digital marketing is now being driven as part of business management development. Through this approach, cardamom has increased the capacity of Sambirata farmers, both as farmers and as business actors. This is a long-term program. Replication has been carried out in several other neighboring districts. In fact, the development is also carried out for other types of spice plants, because PT Sido Muncul requires more than 160 types of raw materials from medicinal plants. That way, expansion occurs in terms of area and in terms of types of plants.330 ANNEXES3. \"Temali\" - Bringing Together and Uniting Volunteers By Indorelawan - Jakarta Temali Program (\"Meet and Greet\") is a collaborative program between Indorelawan and the Indika Foundation between August and December 2020. Indorelawan is an online-based non-profit organization that brought together social organizations that need volunteers with anyone who wants to volunteer. Meanwhile, Indika Foundation is a foundation established by PT Indika Energy that promotes integrity, achievement, unity in diversity, cooperation and social responsibility. The Temali program focuses on capacity building for organizational leaders and volunteers in character education in times of crisis. This program targets young people in the age range of 17-25 years. In particular, this education is directed at developing empathy and critical thinking through a series of campaigns and classes divided into four groups, namely an online class for representatives of social organizations, who want to learn about empathy, critical thinking and other materials about character and capacity development, such as leadership, social programs, communication strategies and others. Similar classes are also directed at individual volunteers, with the name \"Temali Camp\", with an emphasis on applying empathy and critical thinking in daily life practices by involving people with different backgrounds and thoughts. \"Temali Handbook\" is a character and capacity building module for social organizations and volunteers that can be accessed and downloaded for independent learning. Meanwhile, \"Temali Campaign\" is online content in the form of animated videos, posters, and comics as a medium for studying empathy and critical thinking. As the program develops, Temali modules have been expanded to cover themes of self-leadership, designing impactful social programs, increasing organizational scale, volunteer management, monitoring and evaluation of programs, as well as developing storytelling skills for social organizations. Above the principles of empathy and critical thinking, Indorelawan itself takes on the role of a volunteer hub that brings young people to care more about social, economic and environmental issues. Online interactions and rubrics are hosted on the https://www.indorelawan.org/ site. Various activities and enabling organizations are recorded on this site, to make Indorelawan a node of concern and learning for the stakeholders involved in it. So far, no less than 577 young volunteers are involved in various Indorelawan activities. At the same time, Indorelawan has raised resources from 196,548 people and 3,330 organizations to provide the driving energy for 5,016 activities.331 INDONESIA'S VNR 2021 5LIST OF OF VNR INDONESIA 2021 332 ANNEXES 330 5.
