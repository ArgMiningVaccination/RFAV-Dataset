Don't despair\u2014we've got expert tips that will help. Moisturize Courtesy American Academy of DermatologyThis is extremely important, says [Michele S. Green, MD](https://www.michelegreenmd.com/), a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, and don't be stingy. Apply moisturizer generously on the affected skin at least twice a day, preferably when skin is damp to lock in moisture. The National Eczema Association gave its seal of approval to [Av\u00e8ne XeraCalm A.D Lipid-Replenishing Eczema Calming Moisturizer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00XXNM7Q6/?tag=reader0b-20). Take Hot water can further irritate nummular eczema, so when bathing or showering, go for cooler water and don't spend more than 15 minutes bathing. \"Adding colloidal oatmeal to your bath can help relieve itching that can occur with all types of eczema,\" Dr. Green says. Some products, such as [Aveeno Baby Cleansing Therapy Moisturizing Wash](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0054J2GT0/?tag=reader0b-20), contain healing colloidal oatmeal. (You can also DIY by pouring one cup of store-bought oatmeal to your lukewarm bath as it fills.) Know when to step up your nummular eczema treatment Nummular eczema treatment is similar to treatments of other forms of eczema, and sometimes bathing and moisturizing just isn't enough to get rid of the condition. Steroid creams are available OTC and as prescriptions, when dermatologists need the big guns to treat nummular eczema. Sometimes, steroids may not be appropriate due to risks like skin thinning. In those cases, non-steroid topicals, such as tacrolimus (Protopic) or pimecrolimus (Elidel), can help. These creams block an immune system chemical called calcineurin that plays a role in the inflammation. Another topical crisaborole (Eucrisa) blocks PDE4 enzymes within the skin that have been linked to inflammation. \"The important thing is that we have a lot of options to treat nummular eczema,\" says [Jeffrey Fromowitz, MD, FAAD](http://www.dermatologyofboca.com/), a dermatologist in Boca Raton, FL. These are the [eczema treatments that dermatologists use on themselves](https://www.thehealthy.com/skin-health/eczema/eczema-treatments/). Look out for signs of infection Courtesy American Academy of DermatologySometimes, nummular eczema can become infected, often by staph bacteria. How can you tell? The coin-shaped sore may develop a yellowish crust. See your dermatologist as you may need a topical or oral antibiotic to kill the infection. Break the cycle This is key for all forms of eczema including nummular eczema, Dr. Fromowitz says. \"Once the skin barrier disruption occurs, the inflammatory cycle starts, and that means itching and scratching,\" he explains. \"When we scratch an itch, our body releases more itch-causing histamines. We need to break the itch-scratch cycle to allow the skin barrier to heal.\" Frequent moisturizing can repair the barrier and help break this cycle. Sometimes, prescription-strength barrier repair creams like [EpiCeram](http://www.epiceram-us.com/) are warranted, he says. In addition, oral antihistamines may help you sleep through the itch of nummular eczema.
