Natural faith is \"the trust\" in things, objects, and situations. We could call it earthly faith. We use earthly faith more than we realize. Earthly faith is trusting things we know are trustworthy. Earthly faith is activated mostly through our subconscious mind. We sit down in a chair with faith that the chair will hold us up. We turn on a light switch by faith that the lights will come on. Your faith is stronger than mental assent! Faith sees. We turn on a cold-water faucet, and water begins to flow. We trust the chair, the light switch, and the water faucet to activate what we need. Is this similar to our faith in God? There is a big difference between natural and spiritual faith. Spiritual Faith There is also spiritual faith. Spiritual faith is a conscious decision. Spiritual faith happens when we place our trust in God. Giving our trust to God releases the element of faith inside of us. This God-kind of faith is the connector between God the Father and us. \"For it is by grace you have been saved through faith. It is not from yourself or anything you've done, but the gift of God.\" (Ephesians 2:8, NKJV) We are saved by grace through faith. In this sense, \"faith\" is belief. The word \"faith\" actually means; \"to be persuaded.\" So, faith is persuasion. Our key text in this writing prompt reveals the power of faith. \"Israel is led by the city of Samaria, and Samaria is led by its weak king, Remaliah's son. If your faith is not strong, you will not have strength enough to last.\" (Isaiah 7:9, NCV) Faith is a strength. The text indicates that when our faith is not strong, our strength will not endure. Let's reverse the principle. When our faith is strong, our strength will last. Faith is a force. The Scripture is clear about the power of faith. \"And what more shall I say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Barak and Samson and Jephthah, also of David and Samuel and the prophets: who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in battle, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again.\" (Hebrews 11:32-34, NKJV) Faith determines what happens. Did you see the power of faith and the outcomes that faith birthed? Faith overcomes \"For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world \u2014 our faith.\" (I John 5:4, NKJV) Did you see it? Faith overcomes the world. The contrast is faith versus the world. Faith has the power and strength to overcome anything and everything this world throws at believers. Faith resists \"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world.\" (I Peter 5:8-9, NKJV) Again, faith has the strength to resist the devil. Faith strengthens \"But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.\" (Luke 22:32, NKJV) Notice how faith does not fail the believers. So, faith sustains them. The ability to stand or to be maintained is a factor of strength. We see the believers were sustained and strengthened by the substance of faith. Faith is not weak or feeble. The fact is, faith is a sustaining force. Faith conceals hope. Faith is the substance of hoped-for things. Faith lasts. Faith holds our strength like our veins holds our blood. Faith is a substance. \"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\" (Hebrews 11:1, NKJV) Faith sees beyond this world. Some only believe in what they can see. The world says seeing is believing. God says believing is seeing. The things we see were not made with seen things. They were made with words. God's spoken word created them. By faith, we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.\" (Hebrews 11:3, NKJV) Share a story about how your faith turned around a difficult circumstance, or leave a comment.
