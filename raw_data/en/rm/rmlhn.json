Funding has been managed by Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA). This guide is the first of its kind for the Australian lamb finishing industry, and has resulted in a framework of recommended procedures and guidelines encompassing industry best practice that will be valued by all stakeholders. Lambs finished outdoors or in sheds, as well as containment areas, are covered by this guide and include environmental, nutritional, design, management, supply chain, animal health and welfare recommendations. Topics within each section include all aspects of the subject, and may appear in multiple sections to avoid the need for cross referencing when using this guide as a reference. The development of the guide was preceded by an extensive review of the literature relating to the lamb finishing industry. The literature review was published by Meat & Livestock Australia in March 2007, titled \"Best practice fo r production feeding of lambs: A review of the literature\" (see www.mla.com.au or www.productivenutrition.com.au/facts.html ). The development phase of this guide included extensive stakeholder consultation to ensure it serves all members of the industry, is sustainable and relevant. Thank you to all of the stakeholders who have contributed to this project to date.

National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems ii Introduction Purpose The purpose of this document is to provi de the intensive feeding sector of the sheep and lamb industry with recommended proc edures for management that align with current environmental, animal welfare and community expectations as well as guidelines for current best practice. The recommended procedures provide the basis for the Planning and Management Checklists that are designed to assist producer's benchmark and assess their system against this document. Scope These recommended procedures and guidelines encompass requirements for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems (from hereon referred to as intensive feeding system(s)), within conventional out door and intensive indoor shed systems, as well as the use of containment areas. While the recommendations in this document may be applied to all containment areas, adherence is not intended for containment areas that are only constructed and used for drought feeding (also known as drought lots) during periods of severe or serious rainfall deficiency. Definitions of each system are provided in the glossary of terms. These recommendations apply to those responsible for the care and management of sheep and lambs in intensive feeding systems, including owners, managers and livestock handlers. Where legislation requires a higher standar d than that recommended here, the higher standard will apply. This document is not intended to be enforceable under legislation. Documents that are enforceable under legi slation which are referenced in this document include the Australian Standards and Guidelines for the Welfare of Animals - Land Transport of Livestock (Animal Health Australia (AHA), 2008) and the Model Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals: The Sheep (CSIRO, 2006). Note: The Model Code of Practice for the Welfare of Animals: The Sheep (CSIRO, 2006) is currently being updated. More information is available from Animal Health Australia or on-line http://www.animalwelfarestandards.net.au Introduction National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems iii Interpretation This document contains chapters each including: Heading - identifies the subject matter of the chapter Objective - the intended outcome(s) for each chapter Recommended procedures - the minimum recommendations that should be met for agreement with this guide. The reco mmended procedures are intended to be clear, essential and verifiable statements. Prescr iptive recommendations are only written where they can be substantiated through proven scientific research. However, not all issues are well defined by scientific research or are able to be quantified, and as a result, simply written recommendations that are not prescriptive but focused on an outcome are also provided. Guidelines - the recommended practices to achieve more productive and sustainable intensive feeding systems, or to provide a safe environment for contained sheep which may be considered in addition to the recommended procedures. Notes - explanation of the context of the recommended procedures and guidelines, (the notes are advisory statements for background information). The term sheep includes sheep and lambs where appropriate except where otherwise stated.

National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 8 Environment and Design The intensive sheep and lamb feeding industry is a relatively immature industry with limited research completed in the areas of site design and environm ental protection. The information contained in this section is based on available research and extrapolation of data from documents such as the National Guidelines for Beef Cattle Feedlots in Australia, SCARM Report 47 (PISC, 2002). The recommended procedures and guidelines in this section are not considered exhaustive or applicable under all possible circumstances. Situati ons should be assessed on a site by site basis and, provided environmental objectives are achieved and relevant environmental authorities are satisfied, alternative methods or practices may be acceptable. Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 9 2. Environmental protection Objective To site, construct and manage intensive feeding systems in a manner which addresses environmental sustainability and encourages community acceptance. Recommended procedures It is recommended that: Guidelines Further guidelines include: 2.1 General - Intensive feeding systems be sited, constructed and operated so that nutrients, salt, organic matter and water components of effluent and manure are effectively contained and sustainably utilised. - Effluent and manure management strategies should include; o sale o land application. 2.2 Water protection - Intensive feeding systems be sited, constructed and operated so that underground and surface water resources do not become contaminated. - Where the site is to be located above groundwater resources at risk of infiltration/contamination an expert independent assessment should be conducted prior to establishment. - Groundwater management strategies should include infiltration reduction around the intensive feeding area and manure stockpiles. - Groundwater quality should be monitored on a regular basis. Monitoring frequency should be included in the intensive feeding system's environmental management plan. - Surface water management strategies should include management of; feeding area and manure stockpile runoff, effluent, irrigation tail waters and contaminated stormwater runoff from effluent irrigation areas, contaminated sub-surface flow, or discharge of contaminated groundwater. Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 10 2.3 Land protection - On site waste utilisation areas be of sufficient size and capacity to accommodate the wastes generated from the intensive feeding systems' activities with no deleterious build up of waste constituents in the soil. - Effluent and manure utilisation areas and the spreading of effluent and manure should ensure that land is not degraded. Land degradation issues that should be considered include; o decline in soil structure o salinisation o acidification o waterlogging o chemical contamination o erosion. Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 11 3. Site selection Objective To ensure the site selected for intensive feeding systems takes into consideration availability of feed and water supplies, infrastructure, natural site features, animal welfare and environmental sustainability. Recommended procedures It is recommended that: Guidelines Further guidelines include: 3.1 General - The site has suitable all weather access. - The site not be developed in flood prone areas unless safeguards are incorporated. - Where development is proposed on an environmentally unfavourable site, engineering solutions or superior management practices be implemented to prevent any negative environmental impact. - All-weather access to storage and feed preparation areas should be provided. - Site selection will affect the economics, animal welfare and the environmental management of the site. The site selected should be one which avoids the need for costly environmental protection and community amenity measures. - To ensure the intensive feeding systems has minimal impact on the surrounding environment it should be located close to: o feed supplies o finisher lambs o saleyards o abattoirs o transport routes, and o labour. - Site selection should minimise the effects of extreme weather. 3.2 Soil - Soil types at the site be suitable for or modified to suit water, manure and stock management. The key elements are: o smooth, stable, compactable soil types to prevent infiltration through the surface of pen areas o soil types for holding ponds be - The pens should be located on a stable, smooth compacted area. This will prevent infiltration of water, prevent breakdown of the pen floor, facilitate drainage, manure collection and removal and enhance animal welfare. Areas which have natural springs, or expansive heavy clays are unsuitable. - Feedlots and containment areas constructed Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 12 impermeable to water and of a suitable nature for dam construction o soils in the manure utilisation area have sufficient buffering capacity to sustain the continuous application of water, nutrients, salts and organic matter present in manure o suitability for sheep under all weather conditions. - Where rocky outcrop areas are identified as aquifer recharge points, they not be used as sites for intensive feeding systems or containment areas. should have suitable clay or gravely clay applied and compacted to a depth of up to 300 mm dependent on soil type and local council guidelines. - Impermeable pond linings may include impermeable barriers such as clay which may be imported, or other materials such as polyethylene. - Soil types for effluent utilisation areas should be deep and well drained, and suitable for cropping under continuous irrigation. 3.3 Water - The site have access to an adequate supply of suitable quality water to service the needs of all livestock on site and for feed preparation. - The site have access to an adequate supply of water for activities such as dust and fire control. - When assessing water requirements it is necessary to determine: o daily requirements: up to 6.5 litres of water per head per day in hot weather, averaging 3-4 litres per head per day over a 12 month period o total annual requirement o peak short-term requirements o flow rates o trough cleaning requirements. - Water licenses and allocations may be required therefore water resource officers should be consulted to ascertain the legal requirements for the site. - At least 3 days of peak drinking water supply should be held in storage in case of emergencies. - A contingency plan should be in place in the event of prolonged interruption of water supply. 3.4 Waste management - On site waste utilisation areas be of sufficient size and capacity to accommodate the wastes generated from intensive feeding system's activities with no deleterious build up of waste constituents in the soil. - Holding ponds be impermeable and if not they be lined with an impermeable lining. - For land application the spreading rate of effluent and manure should be determined by the nutrient component of the effluent which requires the largest area for spreading, after considering soil nutrient composition and utilisation by the crop to be grown. Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 13 3.5 Community amenity - A buffer zone be maintained between intensive feeding systems, watercourses and sensitive community receptors. - The desirable separation distance from the intensive feeding system and each sensitive receptor should be a function of the source, strength and frequency of the odour, dust or noise, the prevailing weather, and the nature of the intervening terrain (refer to section 6.2 (Separation distances) page 27). - Siting of sheds will be subject to local government planning approval and building permits. - Sites should not be selected where there is a reasonable expectation that developments incompatible with intensive feeding systems are likely within its lifetime. - Consideration should be made of the impacts of increased traffic on: o road infrastructure o noise and dust o road safety. Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 14 4. Design and construction Objective To design and construct intensive feeding systems that are environmentally sustainable, efficient and provide for animal welfare. Recommended procedures It is recommended that: Guidelines Further guidelines include: 4.1 General - Intensive feeding systems be sited, constructed and operated so that odour, noise or dust does not cause unreasonable interference with neighbouring properties. - Adequate fire fighting equipment be available to control a fire within an intensive feeding system. 4.2 Feeding area pens - When designing high use areas such as feeding and watering points the following be considered: o slope o aspect o location and size o shade o shelter o surface and equipment protection. - Outdoor pens be constructed across the slope and aligned with the natural contour of the land, to avoid pen to pen drainage. - Pen slopes be adequate to ensure that water drains freely. - Feeding areas within outdoor pens be located on the high side of the pens. - Intensive feeding areas should be designed with a northerly aspect to maximise solar radiation and evaporation rates. - Outdoor pen surfaces should be evenly graded and compacted to form a smooth surface with no hollows. - Naturally occurring or artificially created pen slopes should be between 2% and 8%. Slopes greater than 6% should only be utilised if the length of the pen slope is reduced to avoid erosion. - Concrete aprons or compacted rubble should be constructed around high use areas such as feeding and watering points to a minimum width of 2.0 metres. - Mounds should not be constructed within pens as they impede drainage, can increase odour generation, and make pen cleaning more difficult. Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 15 -Sick pens should be constructed to accommodate sheep and lambs requiring treatment and allow animals to recover in a less competitive environment. - Sick pens should: o be close to the main pen area to reduce the distance sick animals must travel o have a stocking density of no more than 50% of the main pens o be downwind of the main pens to minimise the risk of air borne disease transmission. 4.3 Fences and laneways - Fences, laneways and facilities be constructed in a way that minimises the risk of injury to sheep. - Careful consideration should be given to the layout of pens, lanes and gates. The intensive feeding systems can only operate at maximum efficiency when it has been designed with consideration of the day to day activities, their timing, and ease of operation. Avoid having to open or close laneway gates to access the feeding area with feed out machinery. - Fences and laneways should not hinder the movement of equipment or stock, and within sheds and feedlots, should not interfere with pen cleaning. - Outdoor laneways should be wide enough for vehicle access, but narrow enough to promote the efficient movement of stock. 4.4 Shade and shelter - Shade or shelter not substantially impede the drying of the pen surface, or pen cleaning. - The potential fire risk of shade and shelter materials be considered. - Design and construction of the site should take into account the potential for extreme weather. - Shelter should be provided to minimise exposure to extremes of cold and hot weather, and reduce exposure to high mid- summer solar radiation. - Shade or shelter may be provided by securely fenced off straw bales or trees, galvanised sheeting, shade cloth or sheds. - The design of the shade structures should: o ensure that both ventilation beneath the structure and afternoon shade area are Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 16 maximised o have their axes oriented to allow the shade to move across the pen during the day and to encourage drying of the pen floor o be angled towards the north-west to maximise available shaded area during the hottest part of the day. Shade structures should be located in the western half of the pen o be high enough to enable pen cleaning equipment to drive beneath without damage from the machine or accumulation of exhaust fumes and/or be easily removed to facilitate pen cleaning. - Engineering advice should be sought in the design and placement of shade due to the potential load the structure must bear, wind loading and the requirement for air circulation. - The current recommendation for shade allowance for outdoor feeding systems is 0.4m2 per lamb. - Natural or artificial windbreaks may be used to reduce the wind velocity through intensive feeding systems. - Windbreaks to reduce the effects of cold should be provided in the form of scrub or planted trees, long grass or artificial shelter. 4.5 Sheep handling facilities - When building or modifying sheep handling facilities the following should be considered: o construction and maintenance to minimise the risk of injury and disease o passageways, races, entrances and exits should account for the behavioural patterns of sheep o the floors of sheds and yards should have surfaces that minimise the risk of injury and disease and allow sheep to stand and walk comfortably o appropriate provision of feed and water. Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 17 4.6 Feeding and watering equipment - Water troughs be well separated from feeding areas. - Feeding equipment be designed and constructed in a way that ensures efficient and safe feed delivery to sheep and lambs whilst minimising wastage and contamination. - Feeding equipment ensures all sheep and lambs have sufficient access to feed. The trough length allocation will depend upon feeding method - ad libitum or restricted feeding. - Feed and water troughs be of a construction that prevents sheep and lambs being able to climb into or through them. - Water troughs be designed and constructed in a way that ensures all sheep and lambs have sufficient access whilst minimising wastage and contamination from feed, manure and urine. - Water pressure and/or flow rates and capacity be sufficient to supply water in troughs at all times. - Feeding and watering equipment should be designed to minimise spillage and the accumulation of waste, manure and urine beneath them. - Watering equipment should be able to be easily cleaned, with the waste water being directed away from the pen area. - The optimum positioning of feeding and watering within feedlot pens has not been determined. However, equipment should be located in such a position as to: o optimise access to minimise the effect of dominant behaviour o avoid injury to sheep and lambs o minimise stress o avoid contamination. - As the temperature of the drinking water can affect intake, water reserves should be kept as cool as possible. To prevent temperature build up in the water troughs from limiting intake, facilities should provide a rapid supply of cool water. - Water supply pipes should be underground. - While shade over water troughs can assist with maintaining cooler water, provision of extended shade areas around the trough should be avoided as this will encourage sheep to camp in the area and may prevent others having access to water. 4.7 Stocking density - The size of feedlot, shed and containment area pens be large enough to provide adequate feeding, watering and living area per animal while minimising the rate of build up of manure and spilt feed. - Sufficient space within outdoor feeding systems and sheds should be provided to facilitate normal social behaviour. - The optimum stocking density for outdoor intensive feeding systems is yet to be determined. Current recommendations suggest 3 - 5 m 2 per head. - The optimum stocking density for shedded intensive feeding systems is yet to be determined. Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 18 -Table 4-1 below shows the current recommended minimum area per lamb for different numbers of lambs per pen in intensive shed finishing systems. Anecdotal evidence suggests that to optimise lamb growth and performance greater area may be required. Table 4-1 - Minimum area per lamb for various group numbers in intensive finishing sheds. No. of lambs Area/lamb (m2) <8 lambs 0.9 8-15 lambs 0.8 16-30 lambs 0.6 >31 lambs 0.5 The above guide is intended for an average liveweight of 40-55kg. If heavier sheep are to be fed a greater area per head should be provided. Source: Australian Animal Welfare Standards and Guidelines for the Welfare of Sheep (CSIRO, 2006). 4.8 Drainage system - Spillage and waste water drains directly into a drainage system. - A drainage system minimises the risk of groundwater and surface water contamination, and promotes the rapid drying of the pen surface after a rainfall event. This drainage system includes where appropriate: o diversion banks or drains upslope of outdoor feeding pens to divert external freshwater away from the complex o drains within the controlled drainage area to convey runoff to the treatment and storage systems o solids separation by gravity settling where the runoff is retained for sufficient time on a pond, terrace, or basin to allow the majority of the entrained solids to settle out by gravity o holding or storage ponds of sufficient - Diversion banks or drains should be designed to carry peak flow rates from a design storm event which has an average recurrence interval of 20 years. Diversion banks and drains should carry this flow at a non-scouring velocity. - Catch drains should be designed to carry peak flow rates resulting from a design storm with an average recurrence interval of 20 years, with a runoff coefficient of 0.8, at a non scouring velocity. - Sedimentation systems should be designed to cater for the peak flow rate of runoff from a design storm having an average recurrence interval of 20 years, and using runoff coefficients for the feedlot pens, roadways and other hard areas of 0.8 and 0.4 for grassed areas. The system should be designed to deposit solids settling at a maximum velocity of 0.005 m/s. The volume required to achieve settling at Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 19 size to contain major storm events and/or extended periods of storage. - Where composting areas exist, all runoff from this area be controlled and managed. the required velocity is determined by the equation: Equation 4-1 - Volume required for settling at a prescribed velocity. V = Qp x (l/w) x ( /v) where, V = sedimentation system volume (cubic metres) Qp = peak inflow rate from a design storm having an average recurrence interval of 20 years (cubic m/s) l/w = length to width ratio, where l is along the direction of flow = Lambda is a scaling factor which accounts for silt accumulation and removal frequency. Values are shown in Table 4-2 for three types of sedimentation systems. Table 4-2 - Scaling factor. Sedimentation system type l/w Basins 2 - 3 2.5 Terraces 8 - 10 1 Ponds 2 - 3 6 v = flow velocity (m/s), maximum = 0.005m/s - Holding ponds or evaporative systems should capture and store effluent following treatment in a sedimentation system. Evaporative systems are not the preferred method of effluent treatment however where annual evaporation is significantly greater than average rainfall they may be used. Consideration must also be given to the seasonality of rainfall and the predicted time and duration of intensive feeding. o Where holding ponds are used the volume needed to contain major storm events and for extended storage periods (annual water balance) should both be calculated and the pond sized to accommodate whichever is the greater. Major storm event: Holding ponds should be able to contain the runoff from a 1 in 20 year 24 hour storm event, with runoff coefficients of 0.8 for pens, roadways and other hard areas, and 0.4 for grassed and Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 20 other areas. Annual water balance: Holding ponds should be capable of containing at least the runoff from a 90 percentile wet year using a water balance calculation which uses at least monthly inflow, evaporation and water withdrawal information. Runoff coefficients should be determined on a site by site basis, and should be from 0.3 to 0.5. Your local authority should be consulted to determine state specific requirements as other specifications may be applicable. o Evaporative systems should be broad and shallow and able to contain the runoff from a 96 percentile wet year. Runoff coefficients should be determined on a site by site basis, and should be from 0.3 to 0.5. - Pond spillways should be designed to discharge a 1 in 50 year design storm event at non scouring velocity. - The minimum pond freeboard (vertical distance from the normal water surface to the top of a confining wall) is 0.9 metres - Where effluent is spread onto irrigation areas a terminal system should be included as part of the drainage system to collect irrigation tailwater and manage contaminated stormwater runoff from effluent irrigation areas. - The terminal system should be able to accommodate the effluent tailwater volume plus storm water runoff from the irrigation area. As determined by the equation: Equation 4-2 - Volume required for terminal system. V = a + b where, V = volume of terminal system (cubic metres) a = effluent irrigation tailwater (cubic metres) b = storm water runoff from the effluent irrigation area (cubic metres). 12 mm runoff allowance is recommended for Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 21 environmentally sensitive locations (eg unprotected water courses). In environmentally non-sensitive locations other means of managing the runoff may be suitable such as vegetated buffer strips or artificial wetlands. - The drains, sedimentation system, holding or evaporation ponds, and terminal systems should be lined with a material which prevents the infiltration of water. The permeability standard used in many states is 1 x 10-9 m/sec. This requires a good quality, non dispersive clay as a source material and may need compaction to achieve the desired permeability standard. Where suitable clay is not available an artificial membrane such as a geotextile or High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) will be required. 4.9 Manure stockpiles - An area be set aside within the controlled drainage scheme of feeding systems for use as a manure stockpile. The ground surface of the manure stockpile area be prepared in a way which makes it impervious, and promotes runoff into the drainage system. - The stockpile area should be used for the temporary storage of manure when the soil conditions are unsuitable for land spreading of manure. Manure and mortalities may be composted in the stockpile area. 4.10 Effluent and manure utilisation areas - On site waste utilisation areas be of sufficient size and capacity to accommodate the wastes generated from intensive feeding system's activities with no deleterious build up of waste constituents in the soil. - Sufficient area of crop or pasture should be available for effluent and manure spreading. Application rates will depend on soil type and current nutrient load of both soil and effluent. Harvesting crops and grazing pastures should prevent nutrient build up. This should be verified through annual testing of soils to verify the sustainable reuse of nutrients. - The annual loading rate of each of the major constituents of the effluent and manure (nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, salt, water) should be calculated. The area required for effluent or manure utilisation will be the largest calculated for any individual constituent. o Effluent irrigation: The design criteria should be based on effluent utilisation in a 90 percentile wet year. Loading parameters which must be considered Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 22 include hydraulic (water) load from effluent and all other sources, biological oxygen demand, nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus and salt. Annual loading rate of effluent should be determined by the constituent requiring the largest area, or lowest application rate to match the amount spread with the amount removed. o Manure spreading: The nutrient composition (nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus) and salt content of the manure, and the yield and nutrient composition of the crop should be estimated and balanced to determine the area required for manure utilisation. 4.11 Carcass disposal - General carcass disposal should be conducted by composting within a suitable composting site, including, a composting bunker, manure stock pile or windrow. All runoff from the composting area must be controlled and managed. The windrow is one of the simpler methods which can be used to compost carcasses. 1. Place a layer of dry organic matter 30 centimetres deep on the ground over an area slightly larger than the carcass. Straw, sawdust or hay are all suitable. 2. Place the dead animal on the bed and cover with another layer of the dry organic material to a depth of 30 centimetres. 3. Cover all of this with semi-dry organic material such as feedlot pen manure, stockpiled manure, or silage. This layer needs to be at least 60 centimetres deep to contain odours and exclude scavengers. 4. Allow the pile to \"work\" for 20 days undisturbed. Internal temperatures should reach between 65 - 75\u00b0C. 5. After 20 days, or when the internal temperature falls below 60\u00b0C, turn the pile and expose the carcass. Cover the Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 23 carcass again with 30 centimetres of dry organic material and 60 centimetres of semi-dry material. 6. Allow the pile to \"work\" for another 20 days undisturbed. Internal temperatures should reach 70\u00b0C and then slowly decrease. After the 40 days only large bones and some wool will remain. The composted carcass can then be incorporated with manure or solid wastes for spreading on land. - Where carcass disposal through composting can not be conducted burial is a suitable method. - For mass mortalities or disposal of infected stock burial is the preferred method of disposal. In this method carcasses should be deeply buried in a completely sealed pit to prevent the escape of fluids and/or infectious agents. If sufficient good quality clay is not available the pits may need to be lined with high density polyethylene (HDPE) or other such material to prevent leakage. - The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) in your state may have specific regulations in relation to burial as a method of disposal and requirements for the location, construction, sealing and monitoring of pits. Contact your state EPA office for details. - During construction topsoil should be separated from subsoil to allow replacement when the pit is sealed. Where appropriate, excavated soil should be placed on the upslope side of the pit to divert surface runoff from entering the pit. - The following dimensions are recommended for disposal of stock through burial: o depth: approximately 4 metres o width: no greater than 3 metres o length: will be dependent on number and size of carcasses for burial Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 24 o backfill: 1.5 - 2 metres of backfill should be placed over carcasses as carcasses decompose additional soil should be added to accommodate subsidence the pit should be monitored over the following months and when subsidence has stopped the surface of the pit should be sealed with clay and levelled then covered with topsoil. Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 25 5. Requirements for inte nsive shed feeding systems Objective Intensive shed feeding systems are managed in a way that ensures the health and welfare of stock is maintained. Recommended procedures It is recommended that: Guidelines Further guidelines include: 5.1 General - Intensive shedded feeding systems have adequate natural ventilation, or mechanical ventilators to assist in the removal of excessive heat, moisture, carbon dioxide, dust, noxious gases and infectious organisms from the ambient environment. - Adequate fire fighting equipment be available to control shed fires. - Reasonable action be taken to protect sheep from predation. - Lighting be adequate to allow inspection of all sheep. - Where shed floors are elevated, they should be high enough for the safe operation of people and machinery. - Shed orientation should account for potential extremes of temperature that may be encountered during the operation of the facility. - All ventilation equipment (ie shutters, fans, removable panels) should be checked regularly to ensure it is fully operational. - Sheds with controlled or forced ventilation that rely on automatic equipment should be inspected daily or have a back-up system in the event of mechanical failure. - Fire alarms should be fitted and regularly checked for function in all sheds. There should be a contingency plan in the event of fire. - Natural or artificial light should be made available for a minimum of nine hours per day. - A portable source of lighting should be available to inspect sheep at night or in times of insufficient light. - Flooring for sheep should be installed and maintained in a manner that minimises slipping, falling and injury. Appropriate materials may include wooden slats, steel grating or woven wire mesh. - Where woven wire mesh is used as pen Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 26 flooring the mesh should be constructed to provide adequate support for the sheep's feet. 5mm diameter wire with 18mm aperture is considered an appropriate mesh size. - Shed flooring should be designed and maintained in a way that reduces the build up of manure. Where plastic/rubber mats are used they should be woven to allow manure to pass through. - Loading facilities should be designed to efficiently and safely move sheep into and out of the shed. - Pests such as birds and rodents should be controlled within sheds. Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 27 6. Community amenity Objective Intensive feeding systems implement strategies to encourage community amenity through consideration of separation distances, odour and dust minimisation, pest management and visual impacts. Recommended procedures It is recommended that: Guidelines Further guidelines include: 6.1 General - Offensive odours, noise and dust be minimised to ensure that negative effects on neighbouring properties and/or sensitive areas are kept to a minimum. - Pests be controlled within intensive feeding systems. - Intensive feeding areas should be designed with a northerly aspect to maximise solar radiation and evaporation rates. - Dust should be controlled within intensive feeding systems. See section 8.1 for further information regarding dust control measures. - Intensive feeding systems (including associated buildings) should be sited so that topography and vegetation are used effectively to reduce the visual impact of the operation. 6.2 Separation distances - Separation distances exist between intensive feeding systems and sensitive areas to address community amenity. - Separation distances be preserved between all effluent treatment systems or land disposal areas and sensitive features at all times. Note : Separation distances below refer to the distance from the closest point of the intensive feeding system's boundary to the receptor. For the purposes of deriving separation distances the intensive feeding system includes pens, handling facilities, sedimentation systems, holding ponds and manure stockpile and composting areas. - Intensive feeding systems should consider separation distances in two contexts: 1. Fixed separation distances - these separation distances are not dependent on individual site information and will be the same for all sites. Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 28 Table 6-1 - Fixed separation distances Feature Distanc e Public road - except as below 200 m Public road - unsealed with less than 50 vehicles per day excluding feedlot traffic 50 m Major watercourse 200 m Other watercourse 100 m Property boundary 20 m 2. Variable separation distances - are based on the dispersion of odours from their source. They are used to determine allowable sheep numbers and management practices necessary to satisfy adopted air quality objectives for individual sites. The following equations provide estimates of: o the maximum allowable standard sheep units at any one time for a site from a sensitive receptor at a given distance; Equation 6-1 - Maximum allowable standard sheep units for site. N = (D S) \u00b2 o the minimum allowable distance for a specified number of standard sheep units from a sensitive receptor. Equation 6-2 - Mi nimum allowable distance of site from sensitive receptor. D = N x S where, N = Maximum number of standard sheep units at any one time. A standard sheep unit is defined as a sheep of 60 kilograms live weight, see Table 6-2. D = Separation distance in metres between the closest points of the feedlot, including the pens, manure storage areas, effluent system and loading or unloading facilities and the most sensitive receptor or impact location. S = Composite Site Factor (= S1 x S2 x S3 x S4) Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 29 The factors S1, S2, S3, and S4 relate to stocking density, receptor type, terrain and vegetation and can be determined from the tables below. Standard Sheep Units (SSU) Different operations cater for different sized animals. Larger sheep and lambs usually produce more manure than smaller animals, and hence have a greater potential for odour production. The guidelines allow the manure and odour potential of different weight sheep and lambs to be derived from SSUs by the use of Table 6-2. The equivalent cattle SCU figure should be used when cattle and sheep feedlots are built as one development or in close proximity to each other in order to determine the separation distance for the combined feedlots. Note: Standard Sheep Units (SSU) are not equal to Dry Sheep Equivalents (DSE). Table 6-2 - Standard sheep units conversion table Sheep liveweight (kg) Standard Sheep Unit (SSU) Equivalent Standard Cattle site factor (S) The composite site factor is calculated from a range of factors to account for site specific information and is determined by the following equation: Equation 6-3 - Equation to determine the composite site factor (S). Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 30 S = S1 x S2 x S3 x S4 The tables below detail the information required to derive the value for 'S' S1 - Stocking density factor First determine the class of the feedlot from Table 6-8, page 36. Then determine the stocking density which is the area available per standard sheep unit held in the pen. Table 6-3 provides the S1 factor for each class of feedlot by stocking density. Table 6-3 - Site factor S1 Stocking density (m2/SSU) S1 factor Class 1 Class 2 Class 3 & 4 1.0 49.5 67.9 83.8 1.5 46.5 63.3 78.1 2.0 43.5 58.7 72.4 2.5 40.5 54.1 37.6 49.5 60.9 and over 26.6 35.7 44.0 S2 - Receptor factor The receptor factor will vary depending on the likely receptor type and is determined from Table 6-4. For a town, the distance is measured from the closest point of the proclaimed town boundary. For a rural farm residence, the distance is the closest part of the residence itself, excluding any yards. Rural residential (or rural living) developments result from land subdivision into blocks of land which are larger than town residential blocks but smaller than traditional commercial agricultural blocks. This usually results in houses being spaced closer than farming residences but further apart than in towns and cities. Where more than 5 rural residential blocks adjoin each other they can be considered a rural residential development. These developments can be broadly divided into two categories: Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 31 o Intensive rural residential developments are defined as individual blocks of less than 1 hectare. o Extensive rural residential developments are individual blocks which range from 1 - 10 hectares. Public areas are those subject to occasional community use. Higher values are appropriate for public areas used frequently or sensitive in nature such as schools and frequently used halls and recreation areas. Table 6-4 - Site factor S2 Receptor Type Value Large towns (>2000) 1.6 Towns (100 - 2000) 1.2 Small towns (20 - 99) 1.0 Intensive rural residential developments 1.0 Extensive rural residential developments 0.7 Rural farm residence or rural school 0.3 Rural church/community centre 0.2 Public area 0.05 S3 - Terrain factor The terrain factor varies according to topography and is determined from Table 6-5. This factor is primarily concerned with air drainage flow paths at night time (the katabatic wind effect), or the impact of low level night time temperature inversions. High relief is regarded as up-slope terrain or a hill that projects above the 10% rising grade line from the feedlot. Thus the receptor location will be either uphill from the feedlot or be behind a significant obstruction which would deflect low velocity air movement away from the receptor. Low relief is regarded as terrain which is generally below the 2% falling grade line from the feedlot. Thus the receptor will be downhill from the feedlot. A valley drainage zone has topography at low relief (as above) with significant confining side walls. Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 32 Topographical features of the selected site may adversely affect the odour impact under certain circumstances. During the early evening or night time under low wind speed conditions, population centres located in a valley complex at a lower elevation than a feedlot may be subject to higher odour concentrations as a result of down-valley wind or the occurrence of low-level inversions. Unless site specific information has been gathered under conditions dominated by low wind speeds, the value for the S3 factor given in Table 6-5 should apply. Table 6-5 - Site factor S3 Topography Value Flat 1.0 High relief >10% 0.7 Low relief >2% 1.2 Valley drainage 2.0 S4 - Vegetation and surface roughness factor The vegetation and surface roughness factor will vary according to vegetation density and intervening topography between the intensive feeding systems and the receptor. The factors in Table 6-6 assume that the selected factor is continuous between the feeding systems and the receptor. Where the vegetation and roughness is variable or not continuous, judgement should be used in selecting an appropriate composite factor. The tree cover may disappear during the life of the intensive feeding system requiring a reassessment of stock numbers. The values suggested for S4 given in Table 6-6 for tree covered areas should be used with care by regulatory bodies and a number of provisions should qualify an approval given on this basis. For example, no concession should be given for an intention to plant a barrier, and should an occupier fail to maintain a stipulated barrier then a reduction in the allowed number of stock would be necessary. However, operators Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 33 should be encouraged to plant and maintain upper storey and lower storey vegetation between the system and the receptor. This will modify wind speed through the system, improve visual amenity, odour dispersion, dust reduction and noise attenuation. If these trees cast shade onto the pen areas consideration should be given to the procedures and guidelines in section 4.4 (Shade and shelter) of this document. Table 6-6 - Site factor S4 Intermediate Landscape Value Few trees, long grass 1.00 Pasture, crops, no trees 1.00 Undulating landscape 0.93 Level wooded landscape 0.85 Heavy forest 0.77 Heavy timber 0.77 Hills and valleys 0.68 - For large scale intensive feeding systems with complex topographic or meteorological features or other significant odour sources nearby, then it may be more appropriate to determine the potential odour impact by odour source modelling. On site meteorological data may be required. - Effluent treatment systems which are adjoining or in close proximity to the feedlot should adhere to the separation distances determined from Equation 6-2 except for the separation distances prescribed for roads, water courses and property boundaries, these are described in Table 6-7. - Solid and liquid waste disposal areas should adhere to the separation distances detailed in Table 6-7 dependent upon the disposal methods described below. Where more than one category of disposal to land is used the method which requires the greatest separation distance is used to determine the separation distance. Method A o discharge by injection directly into the topsoil at a rate not exceeding either the hydraulic or nutrient and salinity limits determined for the soil type. Environment and design National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 34 Method B o solids that have been completely composted o effluent having a solids content of not more than 1%. Method C o mechanical spreaders in combination with \"ploughing-in\" type equipment o downward effluent discharge nozzles o discharged material is not projected to a height of more than 2 metres above ground level.

Acidosis Also known as grain poisoning, ru minal stasis or grain engorgement. Predisposing Factors: Acidosis is caused by accumulation of large amounts of ruminal lactic acid following ingestion of diets that are high in fermentable carbohydrate or low in effective fibre. Acidosis occurs most commonly in grain fed animals. Acidosis commonly occurs: - when sheep are first given access to grain - when there is a sudden increase in the amount of grain being fed - if excessive grain is consumed - when there is a change in the type of grain or concentrate being fed or even the same grain type but from differing sources - as a result of accidental access to bagged grains in sheds, spilt grain under silos or other grain stores or depots - as a result of inadequate supply of effective/long fibre or a fibre source that is unpalatable. Sheep should be introduced gradually to grai n over a two week period whilst ensuring adequate palatable roughage is available. Equally any ration changes should be conducted gradually to ensure time for ruminal adjustment. Wheat, triticale, rye, barley and oats are (in t hat order) the most likely grains to cause acidosis. Overeating does not usually occur when anima ls are first offered grain because they have not developed a 'taste' for the new feed. Overeating is more likely to occur when animals are: - offered large amounts of grain after a period of abstinence, - offered a sudden increase in amount or sudden change to a more 'dangerous' grain, or - allowed access to their normal full ration after a short period of starvation or cold stress. High moisture rations can reduce rumen pH due to reduced saliva production. Silage for example requires less chewing to reduce particle size to allow flow of digesta through the rumen. High quality silage may also be acidic with a pH reading below 5. Reduced chewing, reduced saliva production and acidic silage may increase acid load. Adding unsaturated fats and oils (such as vegetable and fish oils) may increase acidosis risk through reducing fibre digestibility and rumen pH. Signs and Symptoms: Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 61 Symptoms associated with acute (rapid onset) acidosis: - rumen contents become acidic, falling below 5.0 - excessive fluid build up within rumen and intestinal contents lead to a distension of the abdomen - inappetence, depression, isolation, panting, dehydration, - laminitis (lameness) - diarrhoea/scouring and possibly - death. Symptoms associated with subclinical (before symptoms are readily observed) acidosis include: - a reduction in rumen pH, and motility - a reduction in rumination (cud chewing) - great daily variation in feed intake, reduced feed efficiency and a reduction in average daily growth rates - faeces may vary from firm to diarrhoea and may appear foamy, with gas bubbles and/or contain undigested fibre or gr ain and/or mucin/fibrin casts. Control and Prevention: The gradual introduction of high risk feeds (starch rich grains and/or high starch, low fibre feeds such as grain-based pellets) to sheep and lambs is the most effective prevention option. Whole grain should be gradually introduced to sheep and lambs over the following periods: - Oats: 3-5 days - Barley, triticale, rye, sorghum and wheat: 14 days - Lupins: 3-5 days - Beans: 5 days - Peas: 14 days. Processed grains need to be introduced to stock over a longer period of time. Total mixed ration systems can assist in the prevention of acidosis through providing a balanced ration containing hay and grai n. These rations can reduce grain engorgement, reduce the rate of feed fermentation and the rate of passage through the gut. Antibiotics, ionophores and rumen buffers can be incorporated into the feed as a prophylactic measure. Antibiotic compounds active against gram pos itive bacteria are very effective against acidosis. These compounds include avoparcin and virginiamycin. They have the potential to reduce feed costs and greatly simplify management when switching sheep from all roughage to high-grain diets. Rumen buffers commonly used to reduce acidosis risk include: Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 62 - sodium bicarbonate ( at 0.75 to 1.5% w/w) - magnesium oxide (at 0.5 to 0.975% w/w) plus sodium bicarbonate, and - calcium carbonate at w/w (barley or triticale) or 3% w/w (wheat). Buffers like sodium bicarbonate, sodium bentonite or limestone may however be ineffective at the rates at which they are included in diets. For example to neutralise the amount of acid produced during fermentation of 1 kilogram of grain requires 300 to 500 g of sodium bicarbonate. Inclusion of sodium bicarbonate at 2% (20kg per tonne) equates to only 20 grams of bicarbonate per kilogram of grain consumed. A combination of buffers, adequate fibre within a ration (to promote rumination and saliva/bicarbonate production by the anima l) and a slow introduction of grain will however help to reduce acidosis risk. Grain selection is also important. Safer grains are generally those with lower starch content or where the hull has not been removed (eg oats). Wheat is high in starch and its starch is very soluble, more soluble than barley starch. Oat starch is soluble but oats are relatively low in starch. Lupins contain very little starch and are relatively high in fat. When feeding cereal grains without acidosis preventatives feeding frequency is important. Animals fed grains on a daily basis will perform much better than those fed irregularly as they will almost certainly be subject to acidosis. When changing feeds, there should be a gradual changeover. For example if changing from wheat to oats or oats to barley, mix the new feed into the old feed over at least four feeds before the old feed is finished. Faecal consistency score should be monito red daily to identify potential problems before they become significant (refer Appendix 1 Faecal consistency scores). Treatment: 'Treatment' of an affected flock involves c hanging the ration to avoid initiating new cases - affected sheep are generally left to recover on their own. Grain should be removed from the diet and good quality roughage (hay) offered ad libitum until recovered. Treatment is based on neutralising the excessive ruminal lactic acid. Treat with 60 g magnesium oxide (causmag) and 15 g sodium bicarbonate in 1 litre of water as a drench for each sheep. Drafting off the affected cases may be prac tical in large mobs with small numbers affected. Valuable stock or animals that fail to respond to treatment should receive veterinary attention. Treatment should also focus on re-establ ishing the rumen microbe population. This can be achieved through drenching with a probiotic.

Often described as acute (short) or chronic (long term) with (suppurative) or without (non-suppurative) pus present. This condition is Erysipelothrix , Actinomyces, Streptococci, Staphylococci, Chlamydia and Histophilus organisms. Arthritis is common in Australian sheep. Most cases begin in lambs prior to weaning. It commonly occurs when the bone surfaces in one or more joints become damaged, most cases as a result of bacteria circulating in the bloodstream, settling and multiplying in the joints. Predisposing Factors : The pathogens that cause arthritis are all present in the environment. Some can survive for up to 9 months under favourable conditions or may only survive a few days within the gastrointestinal tract or faeces. Most cases of arthritis are associated with wound contamination (particularly at marking and dipping time). Lambs are the most susceptible to infection. Many sheep yards and high use areas such as feedlots have the bacteria in the soil. Signs and Symptoms : Joint fluid is increased in volume, joints may increase in size and be soft to touch, sheep may appear lame, depressed and have an elevated temperature. In chronic cases joints are enlarged, firm to touch and have restricted movement. Control and Prevention : Facilities, equipment used during ma rking, shearing etc and the immediate environment need to be clean. Dust is to be avoided. Yards should preferably be temporary with a grass base and the envi ronment dry. Allow 2 weeks for shearing cuts to heal before introducing sheep to a feedlot or containment area. The risk of infection can also be reduced through minimising stress as stress reduces immune function and resistance to infection. A vaccine is currently available for prevention of Erysipelothrix induced arthritis. Treatment : Sheep will respond to early antibiotic treatment to reduce the extent of joint damage. Once infection has been present for 2-3 weeks, antibiotic treatment is of little benefit as damage to the bone surfaces in the joint has already occurred. Penicillin is effective in most instances. Antibiotic therapy must be carried out for at least 4 days, or the infection may reappear. Chronic cases of arthritis may need to be euthanised. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 64 18. Bloat (ammonia induced) Ammonia-induced bloat (as opposed to frothy-bloat) results from ruminants eating feed containing high levels of rumen-degradable nitrogen. In the rumen, the ingested nitrogen is rapidly converted to ammonia, which is then converted into microbial protein and other forms of nitrogen. The ingestion of excessive quantities of such nitrogen can result in a build-up of ammonia gas in the rumen. Predisposing Factors : Rations high in rumen-degradable protein (such as legume based silage) may predispose animals to bloat. Signs and Symptoms: Excess ammonia may lead to: - alkalosis (abnormally high alkali levels in blood or body fluids) - rumen stasis (cessation of normal rumen contractions) - lack of eructation (belching to release stomach gas via the mouth) - bloating (gut distension). Control and Prevention: The following management practices are recommended: - provide a high energy concentrate. This concentrate provides the extra energy required to metabolise the high levels of nitrogen, and thus reduces the build-up of ammonia gas. - minimise the proportion of feeds containing high levels of rumen degradable protein. Treatment: Treatment of ammonia bloat may include the following: - 60ml of paraffin oil or similar - induce animals to walk until eructation (belching) - provide low quality hay to stimulate rumen function. If not administered early, treatment is unlikely to be effective. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 65 19. Coccidiosis The majority of young sheep harbour coccidia how ever the disease (coccidiosis) is much less common and generally occurs in animals less than 3 months of age. Coccidiosis is caused by a microscopic protozoan parasite known as Eimeria spp found in the intestinal wall of affected sheep. Predisposing Factors : Predisposing factors include: - stress - poor nutrition, - worm infestations, - faecal contamination of feed - overstocking of lambs and weaners under moist conditions. In intensive feeding systems lambs are most susceptible to coccidiosis soon after their introduction into the feedlot or containment area. Signs and Symptoms : Between 20 to 60% of the mob are usually affected. Sheep almost invariably have a concurrent problem such as a heavy worm burden, E.ovis infection or nutritional or physical stress. Acute scouring persists for a few days. Recovery period may be several weeks, during which time there is no scouring, but the appetite is poor and weight gains and wool production are reduced. Acute symptoms include: - anorexia - abdominal pain - diarrhoea or dysentery. Chronic symptoms include: - lack of appetite, and poor growth rates - dehydration - weakness - soft, grey faeces which may contain blood - recumbency and death. Control and Prevention: Keep stress to a minimum, control concurrent disease problems and ensure lambs are well fed. Avoid placing lambs and weaners in situations where faecal contamination of feed may occur. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 66 Coccidiosis may be prevented with good management and the use of coccidiostats (lasalocid) in the feed or mineral additive. If outbreaks of coccidiosis have occurred previously within an intensive feeding system the use of coccidiostats should be employed. Treatment: Seek veterinary advice, separate infected lambs from the mob and treat with prescribed drugs or drenches. Sulphonami de drugs or drenches are commonly used. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 67 20. Feed toxins A wide range of organic and inorganic compounds may occur in feedstuffs. Residues in animal products destined for human consumption are of primary concern. Animal feeds are routinely subject to cont amination from many sources, including environmental pollution, insects, microbes and toxins of both plant and microbial origin. Toxins originating from plants are called phytotoxins . These include alkaloids, glucosinolates, and saponins, many of which are bitter and/or have unpleasant odours which reduce palatability. Toxins originating from microbial action and/or animals are called mycotoxins , and zootoxins respectively. Fungal contaminants include those responsible fo r mould growth within feeds. Such feeds are generally: - less palatable, may reduce dry matter intake and lead to performance losses of 5 - 10% - may have reduced digestibility and energy c ontent (by as much as 10%) due to moulds deriving energy from the feed's protein, fat and carbohydrate - may produce harmful levels of potent mycotoxins and cause health problems. To prevent mould formation: - minimise grain moisture content at harvest (<15%) - remove old-grain, damaged kernels, and any foreign matter from storage silo's etc - check grain periodically for temper ature, moisture, and insect damage - if moulds and mycotoxins are suspected test a sample and formulate ration to account for quality of contaminated feed and class of stock to be fed (mature stock before feeding to younger stock) - dilute contaminated feed with good quality feed - consider the feeding of binder materials such as bentonite. Feed toxins can be identified through laborator y analysis. Where a toxin is suspected the feed should be tested and a veterinarian consulted for specific treatments. Stockfeed declarations should be obtained from suppliers including a description of the feed, chemical residue status and withholding periods and a statement detailing any contamination risk. By-products should be analysed by an accredited laboratory to avoid mineral toxicities. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 68 21. Flies and parasites Control and Prevention: Sheep and lambs that become fly struck should be treated without delay in an appropriate manner To help ensure that fly strike does not occur within intensive feeding systems an operator should employ any or all of the following preventative techniques: - tactical crutching/shearing during high prevalence periods - worm control to prevent scouring - strategic chemical use - use of fly traps - selecting sheep with reduced susceptibility to strike - selecting sheep with correct tail length. Sheep and lambs must be regularly inspected and tested for parasites. Parasites such as worms, fluke and lice should be controlled within intensive feeding systems. All sheep and lamb groups should be inspected on arrival to an intensive feeding system for parasites, and if found to be infested should be treated and/or quarantined for sufficient time to prevent spread to other animals. Faecal egg counts and drench resistance testing should be undertaken for sheep and lambs prior to admission to an intensive feeding system. If drench resistance testing is not undertaken, then the property of origin drench resistance should be considered before drenching. Sheep and lambs should be regularly inspected for parasites before and after treatment to ascertain its effectiveness and identify any parasite resistance problems. Stress should be minimised on sheep and lambs to optimise immune function and thus assist against parasite burden.

Hypomagnesaemia See Mineral deficiency - Magnesium Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 70 24. Laminitis Laminitis is caused by the release of toxins within the bloodstream following consumption of excess dietary energy or protein. This causes a swelling of the sensitive part of the hoof, cutting off blood flow to the bone part of the hoof which then becomes soft and weak and easily bruised or damaged. Predisposing Factors: - excessive consumption of grain, lush grass or legumes - rapid changes in diet - excess protein in diet relative to forage - purulent infections. Signs and Symptoms: Affected animals appear lame and are hesitant to stand or move unless provoked. Animals can also suffer from a fever. Chronic laminitis may lead to hoof malformation. Control and Prevention : Provision of good-quality roughage and/or removal of affected animals form the feeding system will facilitate recovery. Treatment : Usual treatments are: - prolonged rest - pain relief - anti-inflammatory drugs - carefully balanced rations. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 71 25. Minerals As well as energy and protein, sheep are known to need at least 14 different minerals in order to maintain good health and production. Conduct a risk analysis of potential mineral defici ency(s) by obtaining information relating to the animals past (0-3 months) feed and management conditions. All feeds should be individually analysed to identify any deficiencies. Professional nutritional advice should be sought in regards to ensuring the diet contains sufficient vitamin and mineral content. Table 25-1 below lists sheep mineral requirements and toxicity levels. Table 25-1 - Mineral requirements of sheep per kilogram of dry matter intake. Mineral Requirement Toxic Level Calcium 0.22-0.82 % - Phosphorus 0.16-0.38 % - Magnesium 0.12-0.18 % - Potassium 0.50-0.80 % - Sulphur 0.14-0.26 % - Sodium 0.09-0.18 60-150 ppm Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 72 26. Mineral deficiency - Calcium Calcium is needed for: - the formation and maintenance of bones and teeth - transmission of nerve impulses - muscle contraction - blood clotting - activation of a number of enzymes. A dynamic system involving calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D exists to maintain a relatively stable concentration of calcium in the blood. Calcium and phosphorus are stored in bone and mobilised into the circulatory system to maintain adequate levels in the system. The small intestine is the major site of calcium absorption. Hypocalcaemia (or milk fever) is an abnormally low level of blood calcium. In sheep it is usually seen in ewes in late pregnancy but can be seen in all classes of animals. The disease may occur when the body fails to mobilise enough calcium from the bones to maintain normal blood calcium levels. Predisposing Factors : Factors inducing hypocalcaemia include: - grain based diets with inadequate calcium supplementation - sudden drops in temperature - sudden stress - sudden change in diet. Signs and Symptoms: The disease strikes suddenly and usually affects a number of animals in the flock. Stock go down suddenly and may show any of the following signs: - neck turned back - muscle weakness - paralysis - muscle tremors - \"proppy\" or staggering gait with head held high - going down and refusing to rise - falling over when stood up - vaginal prolapse. Control and Prevention : Finely ground limestone (calcium carbonate) is commonly included(1 - 1.5% w/w) when feeding grains. Acid salts (ammonium sulphate, magnesium sulphate etc) Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 73 included at 0.5% (w/w) may increase Calcium absorption from within the small intestine, improving overall calcium availability. Treatment: Consult your veterinarian regarding the best options for diagnosis and treatment. Affected animals generally respond quickly to an injection of commercial calcium solution at the recommended dose rate if treated quickly. Blood calcium level is not a good indicator of a dietary calcium deficiency because blood calcium is reflective of both calcium intake and calcium mobilization from bone. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 74 27. Mineral deficiency - Copper Copper is a component of at least 10 enzymes and is involved in body, bone and wool growth. Predisposing Factors : Predisposing factors include: - low soil copper - sandy soils - winter-spring season - poor autumn break - wet winter - poor clover growth, and - ingestion of high levels of molybdenum, sulphur, zinc, iron, cadmium and calcium may decrease copper availability. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 75 28. Mineral deficiency - Magnesium Magnesium is an activator of many metabolic enzymes. These enzymes control reactions that range from the breakdown of glucose for energy to the replication of DNA, which is necessary for cell division. Most magnesium is stored in the skeleton, but it is only in growing lambs that this store can be used to replete a magnesium deficient diet. Grass staggers/hypomagnesaemia may affect stock in late autumn, winter and spring. It can cause significant losses in production, even when there are no signs of illness. Grass tetany or grass staggers occurs when blood magnesium levels fall below a critical level. This occurs when animals are consuming feed that has low available levels of magnesium, or as a result of increased body demands for magnesium. This condition is not commonly experienced in intensive feeding systems however it is important to monitor for stock on pastures (ie after release from containment areas). Predisposing Factors : Hypomagnesaemia within intensive feeding systems is rare but may occur if: - cold, wet and windy conditions with little or no shelter resulting in short periods of fasting - animals are either fat and losing condition, or very thin - roughage used within the ration was produced from pasture heavily fertilised with nitrogen and/or potash fertiliser - calcium intake is excessive in comparison to magnesium intake. Forages that are prone to causing hypom agnesaemia are generally deficient in magnesium and sodium and have an excess of potassium. Sodium is involved in transporting magnesium into cells, so it is critical to maintain adequate sodium to facilitate proper magnesium utilisation. Excess potassium consumption interferes with magnesium absorption from the gut, thus exacerbating the condition of low dietary magnesium. In areas where grass tetany is prevalent, it is critical to consider not only dietary magnesium intake but also dietary levels of sodium and potassium. Signs and Symptoms : Symptoms of the disease include: - restlessness and/or an over-alert appearance - staggers - excitability - in some cases aggressiveness. In severe cases animals may convulse or die without warning. Control and Prevention : Prevention is preferable to treatment as hypomagnesaemia often occurs without warning. Magnesium stored in the body is not rapidly available so prevention Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 76 involves supplementing the animals with magnesium during the period of greatest risk. There are several magnesium supplements available from rural suppliers or veterinarians that can be used - Causmag (magnesium involve: - spraying magnesium oxide onto hay. This is one of the cheapest and most reliable methods of providing magnesium. A mixture of 500 grams of magnesium oxide and molasses mixed in two litres of water is poured evenly onto the cut edge of the bale about 12 hours before feeding. Feed this treated hay at the rate of 100 sheep per bale. Don't feed untreated hay until this hay has been eaten. - treating hay before baling allowing 500 gr ams of magnesium oxide, to a 'bale length' of windrow or adding magnesium oxide as a dry powder (500 g/bale) during baling, by means of a salting applicator attached to the baler - grass tetany blocks provide magnesium as a palatable 'lick'. A major disadvantage of this method is that all the animals may not consume sufficient magnesium. - epsom salts or magnesium chloride may be added to the ration or water supply. This can be done at a rate of 500g per 100 litres of drinking water for Epsom salts and 420g per 100 litres of water for magnesium chloride. There are several disadvantages in using this method. Epsom salts are unpalatable and not readily accepted by stock and water consumption is variable with environmental conditions (eg temperature and feed mo isture levels) and can therefore influence the amount consumed by each animal. - drenching stock with magnesium oxide or Epsom salts mixed in water is an effective but time consuming, method. Hypomagnesaemia risk can also be reduced through: - providing adequate salt - a high fibre and high energy diet - minimising physiological and environmental stress so as to not reduce magnesium absorption. Treatment : Treatment must be prompt to be effective. It is best to inject a combined calcium and magnesium solution (100ml for sheep) under the skin in the area behind the shoulder and over the ribs. Massage the area well after injecting the solution to spread the fluid and aid its rapid absorption into the blood stream. Treated animals should be given adequate shelter and identified so that a response to treatment can be judged. In some cases, repeat treatment may be needed. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 77 29. Mineral deficiency - Phosphorus Phosphorus works in conjunction with calcium in the formation of bone and is a component of DNA, the molecules that make up chromosomes and control genetic inheritance. Phosphorus is also involved in the chemical reactions of energy metabolism. 75 to 80% of a sheep's phosphorus is stored in the skeleton. Due to their mutual role in bone metabolism, calcium and phosphorus supplementation are usually considered simultaneously. The reco mmended calcium-to-phosphorus ratio in ruminant diets is 2:1. Significant deviation from this ratio can result in abnormal bone growth and a condition known as urolithiasis (see urinary calculi below). Phosphorus deficiencies, although rare, may occur when sheep are fed: - dry, mature plants - a ration with a high Ca:P ratio - a ration low in Vitamin D. Signs of a severe P deficiency include depressed appetites, poor growth rates, softening of the bones, lameness and an increased susceptibility to bone fractures, defective teeth and reproductive problems. Acute phosphorus deficiency is unusual in in tensive feeding systems as cereal grains typically have sufficient levels of phosphorus. Calcium phosphates can be used to correct deficiencies. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 78 30. Mineral deficiency - Potassium Required for normal functioning, potassium is a major intracellular cation essential for some enzyme functions, the normal contractibility of muscle, nerve impulse transmission and other functions of the nervous system. Potassium is also important to renal function, acid-base balance as well as electrolyte and water balance. Potassium deficiency may lead to poor appetite, reduced performance, and stiffness, especially in the joints of the front legs. High levels of potassium may also interfere with magnesium absorption and may lead to a magnesium deficiency. Grain often contains less than 0.5% potassium and supplementation may be necessary in high-concentrate rations containing limited quality fibre. Hays, haylage or silage made from lush pastures generally contain adequate levels of potassium. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 79 31. Mineral deficiency - Sodium The requirement for sodium and chlorine is commonly expressed as a salt requirement. Both sodium and chlorine function to maintain the volume, pH and osmolarity of body fluids. Sodium is involved in muscle and nerve function. Chlorine is essential for hydrochloric acid production in the abomasum and for carbon dioxide transport. The salt requirement for sheep on complete mixed rations is met when salt comprises approximately 0.5% of the total diet. Problems may occur if salt content of water is high. Sheep can tolerate water containing 1.0 to 1.3 percent salt over a relatively long period of time but cannot tolerate water containing more than 1.5 to 2.0 percent salt. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 80 32. Mineral deficiency - Zinc Zinc is required for normal immune system function and by enzymes needed during the metabolism of protein and carbohydrate. Deficiency symptoms of zinc include: - ill thrift - excessive salivation - scabby skin on the legs - slow wound healing - loss of hair - dermatitis. A deficiency of zinc is rare under normal feeding conditions. High calcium intakes may interfere with zinc absorption in the gut and induce a zinc deficiency and calcium supplementation should therefore be carefully monitored and controlled in an intensive feeding system. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 81 33. Nitrate/nitrite poisoning Nitrate in the diet of ruminants is normally broken down by microbial action in the rumen, first to nitrite and then to ammonia. Ruminants can tolerate fairly high levels of nitrate in their diet if the intake is spread over the whole of the feeding day and if their diet is also high in readily available carbohydrate, which is needed to fuel the microbial activity in the rumen. If an animal's nitrate intake is too high, or if conditions are not right for the conversion of nitrite to ammonia in the rumen, nitrite will accumulate and may be absorbed into the blood. Nitrite may also be directly absorbed from wet or mouldy fodder as microbial action may convert nitrate to nitrite under these conditions. Nitrite reduces the ability of the blood to transport oxygen throughout the body of the animal. Excessive nitrite levels effectively induce a drop in available oxygen within the system and death may occur. Predisposing Factors : Some important factors leading to a build-up of nitrate in the plant include: - continuous cloudy conditions for 4 to 5 days - high temperatures - low moisture - frost - high applications of nitrogen fertiliser (over 60 - 100 kg N/ha in one application). These conditions, in isolation, may not lead to a significant rise in plant nitrate levels. If, however, several of these factors coincide and are sustained for a period of 4 to 5 days, then an appreciable rise in plant nitrate levels is likely. Signs and Symptoms : Symptoms of nitrate poisoning in the live animal include: - marked anaemia - bright-red (changing to brown) blood - diarrhoea - abdominal pain - profuse salivation and purging, and - muscular spasms - paralysis. Signs of nitrite poisoning include: - difficulty in breathing, with gasping, rapid breaths - weakness, trembling and staggering - severely affected animals will go down, convulse and die Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 82 - blood has a dark brown appearance which is obvious at post mortem, however the blood returns to its normal colour a few hours after death - pin-point haemorrhages may be present in the heart and trachea along with general congestion of the blood vessels. Control and Prevention : Where feed is suspected to be high in nitrates a sample should be analysed for N- nitrates prior to use. High risk feeds should not be fed or fed sparingly with additional low-risk feeds so as to dilute the nitrate and/or nitrite intakes. Hungry stock must never have access to feeds containing potentially toxic levels of nitrates or nitrites. If nitrate or nitrite poisoning is suspected remove the high risk feed and provide palatable good quality hay. Treatment : Nitrate toxicity is difficult to diagnose as affected animals are usually found dead. If you suspect nitrate or nitrite poisoning, seek immediate veterinary advice. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 83 34. Pink eye Also known as contagious ophthalmia or conjunctivo-keratitis. Predisposing Factors: Outbreaks of pink eye are common in intensive feeding systems and are caused by specific bacterial infections ( Chlamydia psittaci or Rickettsi). Pink eye is further aggravated by Vitamin A deficiency or irritations due to dust, flies, grass seed infestation or windy conditions. Signs and Symptoms: The eyeball of infected animals becomes white or pink, and if infected in both eyes the animal may be blind. Affected animals lose weight and may die of thirst if unable to find water. Recovered animals have resistance for varying lengths of time, usually longer than nine months. Control and Prevention: Reduce dust by carefully selecting the site for the feedlot or containment area (see section 8.1 for ways to reduce/prevent dust). Remove sheep and lambs showing symptoms (blindness in both eyes) and place them on to good feed out of the feedlot or containment area. Check all eyes for infection or grass seeds when introducing animals to the feeding system. Treatment: Many proprietary ointments are available but recent research indicates that treatment may have little effect on the course or severity of the disease. Unless the condition is severe and results in ulceration of the cornea, most sheep and lambs recover with or without treatment. Antibiotic ointment should be used in severe cases. Most sheep will recover if left alone but ensure that they have access to feed and water and any grass seeds should be removed from the eye. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 84 35. Pleurisy/pneumonia Pneumonia is an acute infectious disease that causes widespread financial losses from death, reduced live weight, delayed marketing, treatment costs and unthriftiness among survivors. Pneumonia occurs in all breeds and both sexes. Although adult sheep are susceptible, it is more common in lambs 5 to 7 months old and young nursing lambs. Predisposing Factors : Pneumonia is caused by Mannheimia haemolytica (formerly known as Pasteurella haemolytica ) but risk and incidence are increased during periods of: - high humidity, - excessive heat - dust (see section 8.1 for ways to reduce/prevent dust) - damp bedding - irritating gases such as ammonia. Signs and Symptoms : Pneumonia strikes quickly. The first sign of the disease may be sudden deaths within 2-3 days of infection. More often, affected animals will exhibit the following symptoms during the first 5-6 days of an outbreak: - fever of 41-42\u00baC - nasal discharge - droopy ears and lowered head - lack of appetite - gauntness - loss of weight - laboured and rapid breathing - coughing and lameness (caused by arthritis). Control and Prevention : Effective management of pneumonia requires reducing stress factors. For example, try to avoid transport of sheep and lambs during inclement weather. Similarly, you can take steps to avoid excessive crowding, overheating, chilling or combining stress factors. If sheep are shedded ensure the facility is well ventilated. Treatment : Must be based on early identification of affected individuals. Injectable antibiotics are the best way to achieve rapid response and recovery. Antibiotics such as penicillin, tetracyclines and others are commonly used. In serious outbreaks treatment of all exposed sheep and lambs for several days is advisable. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 85 36. Polioencephalomacia Also know as Vitamin B1 deficiency, Polio, PEM or Star Gazing Disease. Polioencephalomacia is a condition that is induced through thiamine or Vitamin B1 deficiency. This is usually a result of the production or ingestion of thiaminases which destroy thiamine. Predisposing Factors : Sudden changes to or high grain diets can result in the production of thiaminases which break down and destroy thiamine, pr edisposing the animal to thiamine deficiency. Ingestion of thiaminases from ce rtain plants or chemicals can also lead to polioencephalomacia. Signs and Symptoms : Sheep may appear 'blind' with a 'star-gazing' posture and/or move in circles. Most outbreaks involve less than 5% of the mob with deaths often occurring over a period of weeks. Control and Prevention : Dietary supplementation with thiamine is recommended to aid in the prevention of the disease. Control once cases are suspected within a flock can include measures such as providing additional roughage and/or changing feed type. Providing additional thiamine through subcutaneous injection or oral drenches can be implemented to help control further cases. Treatment : Treatment must begin early in the course of the disease as irreversible brain damage will occur if the disease progresses. Inject 10mg/kg IV initially then repeated IM every 12 hours for a total of 4 treatments, if necessary. Response to treatment is generally good if it is given early in the course of the disease. Mildly affected animals generally respond within 6-8 hours and may fully recover within 24hrs. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 86 37. Prolapse Predisposing Factors: Rectal prolapse is a complex disease condition in sheep. The following factors have been proven or suggested as causative factors; - Sex: ewe lambs are more likely to have a rectal prolapse than wether lambs. Females lay down more internal fat, particularly in the pelvis. When a lamb strains or coughs, fat can't hold the rectal tissue and hind gut in place. - Diet: rectal prolapses occur most commonly in feedlot lambs and other lambs being finished on high concentrate diets. Overly fat lambs are more prone to prolapsing. Inadequate fibre within a diet may lead to constipation, increased straining and ultimately prolapse. - Age: lambs in the post-weaning period are more likely to experience a rectal prolapse than young lambs or adult sheep. - Coughing: chronic coughing, due to infection or dusty feeds, may lead to an increased incidence of rectal prolapses. - Diarrhoea: coccidiosis and diarrhoea cause irritation and straining, which may cause prolapse in susceptible lambs. - Genetics: some breeds or crosses may have a genetic predisposition to rectal prolapses. - Short tail docks: several studies have implicated short-tail docks as a cause of rectal prolapses in lambs fed high-concentrate diets. When tails are docked too short (above the 3rd palpable joint), muscles attached to the tail bone are weakened and prolapse may occur. Signs and Symptoms: Rectal prolapse in lambs usually begins as a small round area protruding, often when the lamb coughs or lies down. The pr olapse will swell and tears in the rectum are commonly seen. Over time, the length of prolapsed rectum increases. Control and Prevention: Balanced diets with adequate fibre to reduce the risk of constipation and bowel irritation should reduce the incidence of rectal prolapse. Minimising the use of dusty feeds and dust levels within a feedlot will also reduce coughing (see section 8.1 for ways to reduce/prevent dust). Treatment: Veterinary advice must be sought to treat affected animals. While treatment may be successful it is usually costly. Generally immediate euthanasia is recommended. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 87 38. Pulpy kidney Also known as enterotoxaemia. Caused by the sudden increase in the intestine of Clostridium perfringens, type D . All ages of sheep may be affected but rapidly growing lambs between 3 and 24 weeks of age are most at risk. High-grain diets can predispose lambs to pulpy kidney. It is essential that lambs are vaccinated, before entering the intensive feeding systems, with at least a 3-in-1 vaccine. If lambs have not been previously vaccinated, a second vaccination may be needed if they are in the intensive feeding system for more than four to six weeks. Predisposing Factors : Occurs mainly in heavily grain fed sheep, lambs grazing lush rapidly growing pasture or cereal crops. Two things are necessary for the bacteria to start rapid multiplication: - highly nutritious food material in the intestines - the movement of food along the intestinal tract must temporarily stop. These conditions occur most often when sheep are introduced to grain or grain feeding is rapidly increased. Those with the greatest feed intake (usually the best lambs in the mob) are the most susceptible. Feed conditions containing little fibre such as grain, nuts, concentrated rations and lush improved pastures which do not stimulate bowel movements have been associated with some outbreaks. Signs and Symptoms : There will be signs of kicking with froth at the mouth. The carcass becomes distended and decomposes rapidly and the skin will have a purple colour. A post mortem conducted more than one hour after death will show the kidneys to be lighter in colour than normal and jelly-like. The small intestine is very distended with gas, even at the time of death. Clinically affected cases show deep depression, lag behind the mob, stagger and knuckle over, lie down, become comatosed and die. Most show signs of central nervous system stimulation including atax ia, champing of the jaws, salivation, hyperventilation and convulsions before death (signs similar to polioencephalomalacia). The disease typically develops very quickly and death occurs within hours of disease signs becoming apparent. Mature sheep survive longer than lambs, but usually no more than 24 hours. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 88 Control and Prevention : The most effective preventative measures currently available include vaccination and avoidance of sudden changes in feed. Where sheep or lambs are purchased, a National Vendor Declaration (NVD) detailing the animal's vaccination history should be received at the time of delivery. Vaccinate sheep and lambs before commencing feeding regardless of vaccination history. If the lambs are purchased and their vaccination history can not be obtained, two vaccinations 4-6 weeks apart should be given to ensure protection. To help control an outbreak reduce grain intake and increase roughage in diet. Burn infected carcasses to reduce organism numbers. Treatment : Impractical as 90% of cases are found dead. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 89 39. Salmonellosis Predisposing Factors : Causal bacteria include Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella bovis-morbificans . Outbreaks of salmonellosis are usually associated with: - over-crowding - food deprivation for more than 36 hours - stress related factors including transport - consuming feed or water contaminated by vermin or faecal material. Stress is a key factor in most outbreaks of salmonellosis, increasing susceptibility to infection and increasing the number of bacteria passing out in the faeces. Signs and Symptoms : The disease generally occurs in outbreaks with morbidity rates of 5% to 30% and cause mortality rates of 25%. Some affected animals die within hours of the onset of signs, most die within 1 to 5 days. Infected animals may appear: - depressed - dehydrated - with severe, putrid, very fluid diarrhoea, sometimes with strands of mucosa and blood. Recovery in survivors is slow and these sheep lose much body weight over the course of the illness. Control and Prevention : Reduction of stocking density, removal of affected/dead sheep and removal of the entire mob to another area may help limit an outbreak. Preventative measures include: - minimising stress - reduce contamination of soil, flooring and water - isolate and treat infected animals - antibiotic treatment to control outbreak. Pen surfaces should be evenly graded and compacted to form a smooth surface with no hollows to prevent lambs drinking pooled, stagnant water. Treatment : Veterinary advice should be sought. Antibiotics effective against Salmonella can be given either as an injection or drench. Unfortunately the results are usually disappointing as by the time a sheep shows obvious signs of scouring, severe damage has already occurred. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 90 40. Scabby mouth Also known as Orf. A highly infectious viral disease caused by a strain of the Parapoxvirus family that can affect sheep at any age. The condition leads to scabs around the mouth as well as other areas of exposed skin. Death rates amongst infected sheep are generally relatively low. Predisposing Factors : The virus is capable of remaining within the soil for many years. Minimising stress and injury to the soft tissues of the mouth will reduce risk of infection. Use of coarse, hard fibre in a ration should be minimised to reduce damage to the lips of confined animals. Signs and Symptoms : The disease takes three weeks to run its course. It is characterised by pustules and/or ulcers located on the lips and inside the mouth. Eating appears painful and therefore intake is reduced significantly during this time, although affected lambs can usually consume smooth grains such as lupins. Lesions on the pasterns causing acute lameness may also occur. All lesions are susceptible to fly strike or secondary infection. Control and Prevention : All sheep and lambs should be inspected for sign of scabby mouth prior to entering an intensive feeding system. Vaccination at marking or several weeks prior to lambs entering a feedlot is effective at preventing outbreaks of the disease. Treatment : Spread in a flock through direct contact with infected sheep or infective material is rapid and can lead to a large proportion of the flock becoming infected. In the advent of an outbreak all affected sheep should be isolated to prevent transmission to other stock. If required and practical the remaining stock should be vaccinated if susceptible. There is no spec ific treatment available and generally the disease will clear up in about three to four weeks. Infected animals should be provided with palatable feed and treated to prevent blowfly strike. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 91 41. Urea poisoning Also known as ammonia toxicity Urea poisoning is usually caused by the ingestion of pure urea. Predisposing Factors : Ingestion of excessive amounts of urea in bl ocks, in mixed feed, or when sheep drink pools of water on the top of urea blocks after rain. Excessive rumen ammonia is absorbed through the rumen wall into the blood stream, leading to paralysis of the muscles an d brain. This condition is usually fatal. Signs and Symptoms : Abdominal pain, nervous signs including excess salivation, and sudden death. Animals also tend to show extreme nervous symptoms. Control and Prevention : Ensure that urea is mixed thoroughly with feed when used as a supplement. Keep blocks out of the rain in sheltered areas to ensure excessive intake cannot be achieved through drinking water pooled on top the block. Treatment : Not usually successful. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 92 42. Urinary calculi Also known as water belly, urolithiasis or bladder stones. Urinary calculi is a common disease of male sheep caused by the formation of small stones (calculi) in the urinary tract that block urine flow and may lead to the rupture of the bladder or urethra. The calculi usually lodge in either the sigmoi d flexure, a large \"s\"-shaped curve of the penis just behind the scrotum, or in the urethral process. The main cause is thought to be an imbalance of calcium in relation to phosphorus and is therefore commonly seen in sheep and lambs fed a predominantly cereal based diet. Predisposing Factors : Nutritional and seasonal factors are associ ated with the incidence of urinary calculi such as: - feeding concentrates, high in phosphorus, without calcium supplementation - silicates, present in either grasses or grain - reduced water intake (cold weather, inadequate supply etc) - alkaline water (pH greater than 8.5) - inadequate fibre intake. Several factors contribute to the development of urinary calculi, most relating to a low calcium to phosphorus ratio. This ratio should be maintained at a minimum of 2:1. Concentrates are generally high in phosphorus relative to calcium, so that calcium- phosphorus ratios of 1:1 are not unusual in cereal based rations. Signs and Symptoms : Symptoms may vary from mild to severe depending on the degree of urinary tract obstruction. Symptoms may include: - an arched back and the lamb may appear to 'kick' at its belly - dull and disinterested in feed or water - slow urine flow with straining - tail twitching. If the urethra has ruptured, swelling along the penis will be observed, indicating the presence of urine in the tissues. Close examination of animals affected with the disease will often reveal salt crystals adhered to the wool around the prepuce. Control and Prevention : Veterinary advice must be sought to treat affected animals. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 93 The most important preventive measure is to ensure a correct calcium-phosphorus ratio. Chemical analysis of the ration is advisable to ensure calcium intake is adequate. Preventative measures include: - provision of good quality water - inclusion of 1 to 1.5% (w/w) feed grade limestone within the ration - addition of between 1 to 5% of sodium chloride to ration to increase water intake - ensure a balanced mineral intake - addition of between 0.5 to 1% (w/w) of acid salts such as ammonium chloride to acidify the urine and help prevent the formation of calculi. Treatment : In a feedlot or containment area situation treatment is seldom practical and rarely successful. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 94 43. Vitamins Vitamins are important for the control of many physiological processes in the body. Inadequate intake of vitamins A, D and E are the most common deficiency conditions. Vitamin B 12 deficiency occurs when cobalt intake is inadequate. Injectable forms of vitamin A, D, E and B 12 are commercially available. These are reasonably cheap, and are generally recommended if sheep and lambs have not had access to green feed within three months of entering an intensive feeding system, or are from cobalt-deficient areas. Conduct a risk analysis by obtaining informati on relating to the animals past (0-3 months) feed and management conditions. Professional nutritional advice should be sought in regards to ensuring the diet contains sufficient vitamin and mineral content. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 95 44. Vitamin A Many authors consider vitamin A to be the most important vitamin in the body because of its role in normal growth, protective mucous membranes, reproduction and sight. Vitamin A is produced in sheep through the conversion of beta-carotene (found in green feed) into Vitamin A in the intestine and liver. Symptoms can often be subclinical and pass unnoticed. Predisposing Factors : Green feed is a major source of Vitamin A for sheep and lambs. Unfortunately 'curing' of hay destroys most of the beta carotene contained within green feed. Hay, combined with the use of high rates of cereal grains containing little beta carotene, may therefore lead to a Vitamin A deficiency within a feedlot program. Vitamin A is particularly susceptible to damage during processing of feeds. Availability can be reduced through: - oxidation by moisture or heat - hay making - grinding or pelleting of feeds - extended storage periods. Signs and Symptoms : Signs and symptoms of Vitamin A deficiency include: - night blindness - conjunctivitis and a blue haze over the eyeball - inappetence - in-coordination - muscular weakness - scouring - lameness - partial paralysis - abortions - urinary calculi - convulsions culminating in death. Control and Prevention : Adult sheep normally have sufficient stores within the liver of Vitamin A for up to 6 months without supplementation. Lambs however, do not have the same amount of bodily stores and if they are born duri ng drought will need supplementation once they reach 4 months of age. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 96 Green feed or a Vitamin A injection or drench can be used to prevent deficiency occurring. Dose rate of 1 million Internati onal Units (IU) (drench) or \u00bd million IU's (injection) gives sufficient Vitamin A for 2 months. Sheep fed dry rations in a shed should receive supplementary vitamin A as a routine management procedure. Treatment : Sheep with signs of Vitamin A deficiency respond rapidly to treatment which can include access to green feed or injection or drenches of vitamin A. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 97 45. Vitamin B 12 Also known as cobalt deficiency Cobalt is required for the production of Vitamin B 12 by micro-organisms in the rumen. Absorption of Vitamin B 12 occurs primarily in the small intestine and is enhanced by slower rates of movement of material through the in testine. The principle storage organ for Vitamin B12 is the liver. Vitamin B 12 is essential for the growth of cells, energy production and wool production in sheep. Production losses, particularly in young sheep can be significant if Vitamin B 12 levels are low. Predisposing Factors : Spring pastures generally have lower levels of trace elements due to faster growth, and lower uptake of elements from the soil. Feeds used for finishing lambs sourced from these pastures may conceivably be cobalt deficient. Signs and Symptoms : If symptoms are observed they may include: - diminished appetite - poor condition - weakness - wool becomes open and lifeless - anaemia - discharge from the eyes - death. Growth rates and wool production are affected by marginal cobalt/Vitamin B 12 deficiency, with these losses exceeding 15% in severely cobalt-deficient areas. A marginal deficiency is of greatest concern because production losses may go unnoticed. A 'tail' in the flock is characteristic of this form of the deficiency. Control and Prevention : Sub-cutaneous injection of vitamin B 12 is recommended for the immediate treatment of deficient animals and for short-term (up to 3 months) prevention of deficiency. It is often administered at marking time. Intra-ruminal cobalt pellets ('bullets') are the most efficient method of long-term prevention in endemically deficient areas. They are usually administered to weaners or hoggets. Older, larger sheep are easier to dose with pellets. Oral drenches of cobalt salts are used but give only short-term protection. Salt licks and mineral blocks may be effective provided sheep ingest sufficient amounts to meet requirements. Treatment : Intramuscular and sub-cutaneous injections of Vitamin B 12 are available. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 98 46. Vitamin D Vitamin D is formed by the action of sunlight or other sources of ultraviolet light rays upon sterols in the skin of animals or in plant tissue. Ewes can supply sufficient vitamin D in their mi lk for the first 4-6 weeks of a lamb's life. Vitamin D is stored in the animal's fat so an adult animal is less susceptible compared to younger classes simply due to higher fat reserves. Vitamin D increases the absorption and metabolic use of calcium and phosphorus. It helps regulate blood calcium levels and the co nversion of inorganic to organic phosphorus. Predisposing Factors : Deficiencies are rare in Australia. Shedded animals and areas within Tasmania and parts of southern Victoria where there is often insufficient sunlight for vitamin D production are however high risk areas. Sheep with black pigmented skins or long wool receive less sun exposure than white skinned and short wooled sheep. Signs and Symptoms : Commonly seen symptoms include: - ill thrift - stiffness - shifting lameness - hunched back - abnormally high incidence of broken bones - rickets. Control and Prevention : Provision of good quality sun-cured hay will generally prevent Vitamin D deficiencies. Injectable and oral vitamin D supplements are also available. Treatment : Blood tests may be misleading. Diagnosis is usually made at post mortem. Consult your veterinarian regarding the best options for diagnosis and treatment. Animal health National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 99 47. Vitamin E The specific physiological function of vitamin E is not clear. Health issues such as stiff-lamb and wh ite-muscle disease can be prevented through administering supplemental Vitamin E. A close relationship exists between selenium and vitamin E. Predisposing Factors : Vitamin E deficiency is often associated with: - feeding weaners on hay or grain over extended periods - high-grain rations with limited or no roughage, especially high-moisture harvested grains - feeding grains or roughages that are low in selenium - high fat levels in ration - lengthy storage of feeds - high drying temperatures for feeds. Signs and Symptoms : As lambs increase their dry feed consumption and begin to gain weight rapidly, the fastest growing lambs are the most susceptible to showing signs of Vitamin E deficiency. Vitamin E deficiency symptoms include: - 'stiff muscled' appearance - recumbency - animals appear bright and alert but are reluctant to stand - death through heart failure when stressed or excited - pale muscles upon autopsy. Control and Prevention : Vitamin E supplements can be used to help ensure sufficient levels are in the diet. Treatment : When the diagnosis is confirmed, treat with an oral drench of water-soluble Vitamin E using a dose rate of 3000 IU per animal.

Wool biting / coat chewing Once sheep start wool biting, some seem to be come habitual biters and are difficult to stop. In some systems, principally shedded operations, wool biting does not occur for some years but in others it has appeared as soon as three months. Predisposing Factors : The primary predisposing factor for wool biti ng is believed to be diets low in effective fibre. Other suspected factors include: - mineral imbalance (particularly zinc) - parasitism - boredom - habit - depraved and/or deprived appetite - shortage of fibre - bullying. Signs and Symptoms : Sheep that have been bitten often show patches of raw skin. Sheep become distressed and lose condition. Control and Prevention : When wool biting occurs, watch closely what is happening. This may give an indication as to which of the above is the main problem. Provision of low quality roughages such as straw will, in many situations, alleviate boredom, improve ration fibre levels and reduce the incidence of wool biting. Treatment : Provision of low quality roughage such as cereal straw.

Food safety and quality Objective Production principles implemented by intensive feeding systems ensure the highest possible standards of food safety and quality. Recommended procedures It is recommended that: Guidelines Further guidelines include: 49.1 Food safety - Export slaughter intervals and/or withholding periods be satisfied and declared prior to sale, processing or export. Note : For information regarding up to date withholding periods and/or export slaughter intervals visit www.apvma.gov.au . - Sheep and lambs should be free from manure and soil to minimise the risk of meat contamination. - Sheep and lambs with dags should be keyhole crutched prior to sale. - Excessively dirty sheep and lambs should not be sent for slaughter to minimise risk of carcass contamination. 49.2 Food quality - To avoid carcase and pelt damage electric prodders not be used. - To avoid stress which affects meat quality electric prodders not be used. - Transport operators should be accredited with TruckCare and adhere to the Australian Standards and Guidelines for the Welfare of Animals: Land Transport of Livestock . (2008) Animal Health Australia, Canberra (or subsequent editions). - Stressors which affect meat quality should be minimised or avoided; these include: o excessive time off feed and/or water o rapid mustering o poor handling facilities and techniques including lifting lambs by the wool o the use of non muzzled dogs o the presence of dogs o transport o minimising sheep and lamb movements where possible. For example, where sheep and lambs are being sold for Supply chain management National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 103 slaughter, direct delivery to the processor will reduce handling and stress which will result in improved meat quality. - To optimise eating quality lambs should: o be gaining at least 100g/day for crossbreds and 150g/day for Merinos for two weeks prior to slaughter o be at the consignment property for a minimum of two weeks prior to dispatch to slaughter. - Vitamin E should be included in the diet to optimise meat shelf life. Note: Meat Standards Australia (MSA) has detailed information regarding factors affecting meat quality. Links to this information can be found on the MLA website. MLA has published a Tips & Tools (Aug 2010) :\"Vitamin E stabilises the colour of out of season lamb meat\". 49.3 Curfew - Total time off water not exceed the time periods given below: o lambs less than 4 months of age - 28 hours o sheep and lambs greater than 4 months of age - 48 hours o ewes known to be more than 14 weeks pregnant, excluding the last 2 weeks - 24hrs. Source: Australian Standards and Guidelines for the Welfare of Animals: Land Transport of Livestock (2008) Animal Health Australia, Canberra. - Ewes in the last two weeks of pregnancy not be deprived of water. - Feed curfews (on-farm) for transport not exceed 24 hours. The total time off feed (including transport time) not exceed 48 hours. Note: Curfew periods are currently under review. Seek latest information from MLA website. Supply chain management National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 104 49.4 On-farm quality assurance Note : Quality assurance programs change from time to time and while the following information is correct at the time of publishing, it is recommended that regular contact is maintained with program providers or updates are sought as required. It should also be noted that new programs become available or replace existing programs from time to time and the information provided in this section is not an exhaustive list of all programs available. - Livestock Production Assurance (LPA) is an on-farm food safety certification program designed to help the red meat industry strengthen the food safety systems currently in place. The LPA program was developed in accordance with Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) principles and presents producers with basic animal production and record keeping requirements designed to ensure the production of safe food. Independent audits are conducted to ensure the program's integrity is maintained. LPA is required by all producers who use National Vendor Declaration forms for the sale of sheep and lambs. There are five requirements each of which has its own food safety outcome ensuring that meat from producer's livestock is fit for human consumption; o property risk assessment - making sure that stock are not exposed to areas contaminated with persistent chemicals. o safe and responsible animal treatments - ensuring stock at sale don't contain unacceptable chemical residues. o stock foods, fodder crops, grain and pasture treatments - ensuring stock are not exposed to feeds that contain unacceptable chemical residues. o preparations for dispatch of stock - ensuring stock are fit for transport, not stressed and contamination is minimised during transport to destination. o livestock transactions and movements - ensuring that stock can be traced if Supply chain management National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 105 required. - AgriSure is an on-farm quality management program. The AgriSure program ensures that management activities are conducted in a consistent and repeatable manner, provides a \"building block\" upon which a producer can readily introduce and implement additional specific market requirements and also be utilised as a training tool for staff (including family members). - The AgriSure program provides a framework for optional market specific modules, one of which is LPAS. For meat to be eligible to be labelled as grain fed lamb or hogget, it must have been sourced from an LPAS certified enterprise accredited by AUS-MEAT. - Further information about AgriSure can be found at www.mla.com.au and further information about grain fed lamb and hogget standards can be found at www.ausmeat.com.au Supply chain management National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 106 50. Supply chain management systems Objective To foster the supply of quality product to meet market requirements and expectations in a profitable and sustainable manner. Recommended procedures It is recommended that: Guidelines Further guidelines include: 50.1 General - Sheep and lamb husbandry procedures should maximise carcass and skin quality. This includes ensuring vaccinations are administered in the loose skin behind the ear or back of the head, ensuring that sheep and lambs are free of weed seeds and that electric prodders are not used. - The health of sheep and lambs should be checked prior to sale. Financial returns will generally be discounted where sheep and lambs have conditions such as arthritis, tapeworm, excessive burr or seed and pleurisy. - The Australian Standards and Guidelines for the Welfare of Animals: Land Transport of Livestock (2008) Animal Health Australia, Canberra mandates that sheep and lambs must be fit for travel. - Vertical supply chains and alliances may include any or all of the following participants: o seedstock producer and finisher or processor o store lamb breeder alliance with finisher o finisher(s) and agent - provides the benefits of increased throughput and security for the agent, more secure market outlets for stock meeting specification and hence reduced risks for producers, scope for value based marketing, lower selling costs through negotiated rates and improved Supply chain management National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 107 understanding of customer's needs. o producer(s)/finisher(s) and/or processor - the customer obtains the security of the supply of specific stock and opportunities to differentiate product on the basis of region or Quality Assurance (QA) programs. Members of such an alliance gain an improved understanding of partners and customers needs, improved feedback, opportunity to negotiate value based marketing, lower selling costs through fewer transactions, greater security of throughput for finisher and processor. o finisher(s) and retailer or exporter - well established producer groups may decide to enter into a supply chain alliance with a retailer or exporter as a means of improving their longer term business prospects by getting closer to ultimate customers. Thus the group could maintain ownership of the carcase through the processing stage and use a service works for processing and boning. The customer gains for greater security of supply and reduced seasonality through dealing with a large supply group. The members of such an alliance benefit with improved knowledge of the customers needs, feedback on matching carcase attributes with consumer requirements, lower marketing costs through single sale direct to retailer or exporter instead of two transactions and a greater opportunity to improve security of supply and to reduce seasonality of supply for retailers and exporters. o processor and retailer or exporter o all supply chain individuals - provides the customer with trace back for quality assurance. Also offers a reduction in transaction costs for all involved. - Feedback systems between producers/finishers and customers should be in place to provide information on product performance that can be utilised to improve productivity of all parties. Supply chain management National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 108 51. Marketing Objective Intensive feeding systems market their product in a way that exploits the product's positive attributes while minimising risk associated with mark et fluctuations or sub-standard product. Recommended procedures It is recommended that: Guidelines Further guidelines include: 51.1 General - Intensive feeding systems enterprises and/or supply chain managers should select from or use a combination of the following marketing systems: o over the hooks - price schedule grids o over the hooks - trading o forward contracts o on-farm purchases o saleyards. - All associated advantages and disadvantages of each marketing system should be considered. - Gross margin budgets should be completed prior to sheep and lambs entering intensive finishing systems and marketing agreements being put in place. - Feedback between processors and producers should be freely available and unreserved - The following factors should be considered that will influence dressing percentage of lambs: o breed - Merino and first cross lambs tend to have lower dressing percentages than second cross lambs by 1.5 - 3.5%. o sex - ram and wether lambs will dress approximately 0.5-1.5% lower than ewe lambs of similar carcase weight. o time off feed - dressing percentages Supply chain management National procedures and guidelines for intensive sheep and lamb feeding systems 109 increase by; 1% after 4 hours off feed, 2% after 12 hours and 4% after 24 hours. o fat score Table 51-1 - Effect of fat score on dressing percentage. Fat score Indicative dressing % for second cross lambs 1 41 2 43 3 45 4 47 5 49 o wool length - freshly shorn lambs have higher dressing percentages than woolly lambs. o processing - there will be variances in dressing percentages between sheep and lamb processed for the export and domestic markets and between processors.
