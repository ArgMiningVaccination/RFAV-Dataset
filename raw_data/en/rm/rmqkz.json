It has never been subjected to any type of clinical trial and does not guarantee or ensure that a reaction will not occur. It is a supportive recommendation for healthy children and adults required to receive vaccines for any number of reasons. The following recommendations are based on dosing Vitamin A in a liquid form, with 5,000 IU PER DROP. a. Infants and toddlers up to 30 pounds: Vitamin C: (give in divided doses) o 5 mg per pound orally in juice for 3 days before; o 10 mg per pound orally in juice the day of the vaccine and o 5 mg per pound orally in juice for 3 days after the vaccine. Vitamin A: o 5, 000 IU (one drops) in juice for 3 days before the vaccines; o 10,000 IU (two drops) in juice the day of the vaccine; and o 5,000 IU (one drop) in juice for 3 days following the vaccine b. Toddlers from 31 to 50 pounds: Vitamin C: (give in divided doses) o 15 mg per pound orally in juice for 3 days before; o 30 mg per pound orally in juice the day of the vaccine and o 15 mg per pound orally in juice for 3 days after the vaccine. Vitamin A: o 10,000 IU (two drop) in juice for 3 days before the vaccines; o 15,000 IU (three drops) in juice the day of the vaccine; and o 10,000 IU (two drop) in juice for 3 days following the vaccine. c. Children from 51 to 100 pounds: Vitamin C: (give in divided doses) o 30 mg per pound orally in juice for 3 days before; o 50 mg per pound orally in juice the day of the vaccine and o 30 mg per pound orally in juice for 3 days after the vaccine. Vitamin A: (give in divided doses) o 15,000 IU (three drops) in juice for 3 days before the vaccines; o 25,000 IU (five drops) in juice the day of the vaccine; and o 15,000 IU (three drops) in juice for 3 days following the vaccine d. Adults: 100 pound and up Vitamin C: (give in divided doses) o 1000 mg orally 4 times/day for 3 days before; o 1500 mg orally 4 times/day the day of the vaccine and o 1000 mg orally 4 times/day for 3 days following the vaccine. Vitamin A: o 20,000 IU orally for 3 days before; o 50,000 IU (ten drops) orally in juice the day of the vaccine and o 20,000 IU (four drops) orally in juice for 3 days after the vaccine. Vitamin A for Recommended for Immune Support Vitamin A is important for resisting viral infections and may reduce vaccine reactions when given prior to a dose of a viral vaccine (ie polio, MMR, chickenpox, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and influenza). These recommendations are based on dosing Vitamin A in a liquid form, with 5,000 IU PER DROP. OVER CONCERN ABOUT VITAMIN A TOXICITY: According to the Merck Manual, vitamin-A toxicity was reported in arctic explorers who developed drowsiness, irritability, headaches and vomiting, with subsequent peeling of the skin, within a few hours of ingesting several million units of vitamin A from polar bear or seal liver. These symptoms cleared up with discontinuation of the vitamin-A rich food. The only other reference to vitamin-A toxicity resulted from taking megavitamin tablets more than 100,000IU/day of synthetic vitamin-A per day for many months. Unless you are an arctic explorer or indulging in huge doses of vitamin A or taking more than 3 tablespoons of cod liver oil per day, it is virtually impossible to develop vitamin-A toxicity. As for children, a study carried out in Rome, Italy found no congenital malformations among 120 infants exposed to more than 50,000 IU of vitamin A per day. A study from Switzerland looked at blood levels of vitamin A in pregnant women and found that a dose of 30,000 IU per day resulted in blood levels that had no association with birth defects.

It is also an inhibitor of histamine, a substance released during allergic reactions. As a powerful antioxidant, Vitamin C can neutralize harmful free radicals, pollutants and toxins. There are two types of Vitamin C supplements: ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate. Generally, ascorbic acid can cause hyperacidity and often is associated with stomach upset. Vitamin C ascorbates are generally recommended to avoid these side effects. Powdered Vitamin C is best use for more accurate dosing. Usually, each teaspoon contains 4000 mg of Vitamin C. The math to calculate the correct dosage can easily be determined by the brand. For example, if 4000 mg = 1 teaspoon, then 1000 mg = 1/4 teaspoon; 500 mg = 1/8 teaspoon 250 mg = 1/16 teaspoon A sign of too much vitamin C is loose stools. Although unlikely, if you or your child experiences loose stools, decrease the vitamin C dose by 50%. For further recommendations regarding the use and dosage of vitamin C in children, see www.DrSuzanne.net Vitamin D Recommendations for Immune Support Doctors seem to have a fear of recommending ANY amount Vitamin D for fear of causing Vitamin D toxicity. But while Vitamin D toxicity can occur, it is a rare phenomenon. Interestingly, it seems like EVERYONE is always concerned about taking excess Vitamin D- while almost no one is aware of or even slightly concerned about vitamin D deficiency. Types of Vitamin D There are two types of vitamin D supplements available for purchase (vitamin D2 and vitamin D3). Vitamin D2 is medically known as \"ergocalciferol,\" and vitamin D3 is medically known as \"cholecalciferol.\" Experts now agree that vitamin D3 the form that should be consumed. Tolerable Upper Limit of Vitamin D Most governments have set a 'Tolerable Upper Limit' also called a 'safe upper limit' dosage for vitamin D supplements. This is the dosage that can be taken safely for extended periods of time. The European (and American) tolerable upper intake levels of vitamin D are: Infants 0 to 12 months: 25ug or 1000 IU per day Children 1 to 10 years: 50ug or 2000 IU per day Older children: 4000 IU per day Adults: 4000IU per day; with medical risk factors, such as osteoporosis, up to 10,000IU/day Who is at risk to overdose on Vitamin D? The reported risks of vitamin D over dosage are from is rarely reported. When it happens, it is usually seen in the elderly or in children when the label instructions are not appropriately followed. For example, a liquid supplement may contain 5000IU per drop and this is mistaken for 5000IU per dropperful, One dropperful is generally 30 drops, leading to a dose of 150,000IU. If this happens continually, massive quantities of Vitamin D can result in overdose. Early symptoms of Vitamin D overdose symptoms include nausea, abdominal cramps, muscle spasms, weakness and vertigo. To find out more about Vitamin D, go to www.VitaminDCouncil.org or the "}
