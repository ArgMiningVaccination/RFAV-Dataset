Phone (740) 376-4000 Fax (740) 376-4896 http://www.marietta.edu2 MARIETTA COLLEGE The Nine Core ValuesAt the center of a MARIETTA COLLEGE education are Seven Core Values that form the foundation for learning and living. 1. Liberal Arts Foundation MARIETTA COLLEGE reaffirms the liberal arts as foundational in an education of the highest quality. Undergraduates in traditional majors and professional programs take a variety of general education courses in the primary areas of knowledge. This time-tested approach to learn - ing stresses the development of skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, and effective communication, and upholds the value and breadth of our intellectual heritage. 2. In-Depth Programs of Study MARIETTA COLLEGE is committed to offering programs of study that prepare undergraduates for challenging careers or admission to well-respected graduate and professional schools. It offers select gradu - ate degrees consistent with the mission of the College and where it has the expertise and resources to meet or exceed baselines of excellence. Both graduate and undergraduate degree programs promote an active engagement with learning and opportunities to apply knowledge to practical experiences. 3. Global Perspective and Diversity MARIETTA COLLEGE prepares students to thrive in a diverse society and in a world where social interaction, work, and exchange occur across geographical, cultural, and linguistic boundaries. They learn that economic growth, political stability, human adaptation, and sustainability all rely upon cooperative efforts among the nations and peoples of the world. 4. World of Work MARIETTA COLLEGE maintains its founders' emphasis on education \"in the various branches of useful knowledge,\" and we believe that the liberal arts remain the best preparation for any career. Through class -room instruction, the use of technology, independent research, and practical experiences in their chosen fields, as well as through a wide variety of opportunities to lead and serve in collaboration with others, students prepare for productive lives. \"A contemporary liberal arts education\" means preparation for the world of work and the ability to translate knowledge into effective action. 5. Community MARIETTA COLLEGE, primarily a residential college for its under - graduates, is dedicated to the development of the whole student and affirms the interdependence of life inside and outside of the classroom. In this dynamic community, students, faculty, and staff share a com - mitment to integrity and respect for others and develop our distinctive ethos. Believing that the work of all employees at the College contrib - utes to the students educational experience, we strive to provide the necessary tools and working environment and promote a commitment to service and self-direction among College employees. Graduates of the College comprise \"the long blue line,\" an alumni community forged in friendships and common experiences. 6. Leadership MARIETTA COLLEGE offers students opportunities to be citizen- leaders both on and off campus and thus to prepare themselves for leadership and responsible citizenship in their professions and their communities. Professional programs convey the ethical standards appropriate to their professions and in other ways prepare students for leadership in their fields. 7. Service MARIETTA COLLEGE is part of a historic town and for almost two centuries has served its region through the education, arts, and intellec - tual enrichment it brings to the surrounding community. Likewise, the students, faculty, and staff of MARIETTA COLLEGE find opportunities for civic engagement and for learning through service on the campus, in the region, and beyond.The Seven Core Values 2013-2014 COLLEGE CATALOG 3 From the President It is my pleasure to welcome you to Marietta College. Since its founding in 1835 Marietta has been recognized as one of the outstanding liberal arts colleges in the United States, and we retain today the original goal of educating students in \"the various branches of useful knowledge.\" We aim to help you to find the best within yourself, to challenge you to hone existing skills and seek new areas of expertise, and to invite you to become a contributing member of a vital intellectual community. During your academic and residential life at Marietta College you will work with members of an outstanding faculty and staff, all of whom are committed to your intellectual and personal growth. We believe that a liberal arts education provides excellent preparation for graduate school, for professional school, for a range of careers, and for a productive and reward - ing life. Marietta students are our greatest source of pride and our alumni have gone on to become critical thinkers, leaders, and problem-solvers committed to a lifetime of discovery and equipped for the rapidly changing world of the 21st century. From the President At Marietta you will find opportunities to learn in many ways, and I urge you to seek and utilize stimulating classroom experiences, one-on-one meetings with faculty members, learning communities of students and faculty who connect two or more courses around a com - mon theme, study abroad and internship opportunities, and formal and informal study with other talented students. You will have at your disposal leading-edge technological resources and some of the best new academic and residential facilities to be found on any campus, including the Legacy Library, the Anderson Hancock Planetarium, and Harrison Hall. Marietta's advantages, including our liberal arts model, our profes - sional programs, our commitment to a student-centered learning environment, and our excellent resources and facilities, are consistent with the Seven Core Values articulated in our Strategic Plan Focused on Distinction; A Plan for Marietta College 2010-2015 and presented on the previous page. However, none of these advantages can replace your own dedication, your desire to educate yourself and design your curriculum, and your willingness to contribute to the Marietta College community. With that in mind, and in keeping with our Core Values, I suggest you consider the following as you use this catalog and plan your studies. Seek breadth and depth in your liberal arts education. The liberal arts (artes liberales) were originally defined in the classical world as the components of an education befitting a free person, and this education was thought to include the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric), and the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). Today, we consider a liberal arts education to include a range of educational experiences allowing us to understand what it means to be human, how to define our roles in society, how social systems interact in the modern world, and how science and mathematics allow us to understand the natural world in which we live. In addressing these important ques - tions, the liberal arts curriculum combines depth in a chosen area of specialization with breadth in a range of curricular areas. The Marietta College general education program consists of courses in various sub - jects and your faculty advisor will assist you as you design your plan. Be ambitious, be bold, and seek to educate yourself in your major area and in several other fields offered at Marietta. Harness your passion. As you pursue your general education curricu - lum and explore possible majors, you will undoubtedly discover areas that excite and challenge you in unexpected ways. Keep an open mind when considering these new areas of study, since you may develop a passion for subjects you have not previously encountered. Nurture these interests and you will soon know that success often depends as much on engagement and dedication as it does on talent and experi - ence. I encourage you to find those areas of endeavor that become your personal passions\u2014areas that sustain you, challenge you, and bring out your best. Commit to pursuing your passion and you will enrich your life. Seek opportunities to learn in a variety of settings. You will quickly see that Marietta faculty members are committed educators who deliver an outstanding classroom experience on a daily basis. However, they are also committed scholars who seek to create knowledge in their chosen field. You will have opportunities to engage in the scholarly work that creates this knowledge, to meet with faculty members out - side of the classroom, to hear their advice on a range of topics, and to see first-hand the dedication they have for their work with Marietta students. Alumni frequently report that the best part of their Marietta experience was the opportunity to work closely with our faculty, and that the friendships they formed with faculty mentors have lasted for decades after graduation. Seize the opportunity to develop these last - ing relationships. Become a citizen of the world. The curricular and co-curricular experi - ences available on the Marietta campus are designed to prepare you for the world after college. However, there is rarely a substitute for direct experience and you can gain that experience in various ways. Get to know others who hail from different parts of the country and the world, seek to understand the views of those whose beliefs differ dramatically from your own, and study the languages and cultures of other coun - tries. You are part of a community in which we celebrate our diversity, so take full advantage of the opportunities presented. Also, consider internship and study abroad opportunities that allow you to live and work in another environment and bring your education to bear on new experiences. And then commit to sharing those experiences with the campus community when you return. Live up to our community standards. Members of the Marietta College community are expected to adhere to high standards of ethical behav - ior. The Pioneer Pledge commits you to honesty, integrity, responsibil - ity, respect, and engagement, and other members of the community will expect you to live up to this Pledge in at least three general ways. First, your academic work must be your own if it is to contribute in meaningful ways to your education. Second, living in the College community requires that you give careful consideration to the needs 4 MARIETTA COLLEGE From the Presidentand rights of others before you undertake any course of action. And third, as a member of the larger local community, you will be expected to volunteer and contribute. We are all fortunate to live and work in the midst of supportive neighbors and, when you take the opportunity to serve, you show your appreciation and develop the skills and habits that will benefit you and others when you leave campus and join other communities. Be a community leader. The Marietta College of today is the sum of our various contributions, and it functions best when community members are willing to assume leadership responsibility. Campus organizations enrich the residential experience and your involvement will allow you to develop your own skills while helping others to do the same, and the programs of the McDonough Center are designed to provide important leadership training and guidance. With the vast array of academic and social organizations active on our campus, there are many opportuni - ties to get involved. Find those groups whose mission appeals to you and seek those with which you will stretch yourself. Contribute your talents whenever you can and you will help keep Marietta College the exciting and dynamic institution it is today. I hope you will embrace these challenges and seek to develop your skills in these and many other areas. You will face difficulties as you commit to a high standard of achievement, and then you will be amply reward - ed when you overcome these difficulties. This is an important part of your Marietta College experience, as it is of any worthwhile experience, and I am confident that the work you do today will position you for success in the years to come. Remember, too, that the faculty and staff join me in pledging our assistance throughout your time here, and you will have the support of a dynamic and creative learning community in which your contributions will be valued and respected. I urge you to make the very most of your time at Marietta College and I look forward to assisting you and celebrating your successes. Joseph W.

These Core Values are to be found on page 2 of the Catalog. The College Marietta College traces its roots to the establishment of the Muskingum Academy, which was founded by pioneer settlers in 1797, in Marietta, Ohio. Accordingly, the College has been recognized as one of America's 37 \"Revolutionary Colleges.\" The Academy became the first institute of higher education in the Northwest Territory. In 1835, the State of Ohio created Marietta College by granting a charter to offer college- level degrees. Marietta has always been a private, non-sectarian, co- educational (from 1897), residential college. But antiquity guarantees nothing, and in its mission statement, the College professes to offer a contemporary liberal arts education, mean - ing that the College provides academic programs that are based on the best of the past and have a high relevance for today. The traditional liberal arts have always been the core of the College's intellectual life. For example, the College's Phi Beta Kappa chapter dates from 1866, making it one of the oldest in the nation. Examples of the College's ability to stay \"contemporary\" are the establishment some years ago of programs in petroleum engineering and in athletic training, both of which were the first to receive separate professional accreditation at a private college. A recent addition which is taking on increasing sig - nificance in the undergraduate curriculum is a program in Investigative Studies. The program provides opportunities for students, in any dis - cipline, to undertake research projects within a mentoring relationship with a member of the faculty. The College provides financial support for students participating in the program. Also, unusual teaching opportunities have been developed for students, again regardless of discipline, in China and Brazil. Adding distinctiveness to the programs at Marietta is The McDonough Center for Leadership and Business, the nation's first developed oppor - tunity for undergraduate students to examine issues clustered around the themes of civic engagement and corporate leadership. And so, the College invites students to explore the ideas of the past and discover their meaning for today while simultaneously providing a preparation for life after college. The College has consistently been ranked by U.S. News & World Report as one of the best private colleges in the Midwest. The Fall 2011 enrollment at the College was 1474 undergraduate ( 1402 full-time and 72 part-time) and 141 graduate ( 83 full-time and 58 part-time) students. The students came from 42 states and 19 countries. The male-to-female ratio is close to 50:50, while the student- to-faculty ratio is an attractive 13:1. Accreditation The College offers degrees at the undergraduate and graduate level. Undergraduate degrees are Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering. At the graduate level, two masters programs are available: Master of Arts in Psychology and Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies. The College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central Association. The College's Department of Education and all teacher licensure programs are accredited by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and approved by the Ohio Department of Education. The petroleum engineering program is accredited by the Education Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering, and the athlet - ic training program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education. The College's Department of Music is accredited by the National Association of Schools Of Music (NASM). The chemistry program is approved by the American Chemical Society. The public accounting program (150 semester hours, 4 1/2-year) has been approved by the Accountancy Board of the State of Ohio as satisfying the requirements for students wishing to sit for the Uniform Certified Public Accounting examinations. This accounting program also meets the requirements of most states with 150-hour education requirements. The College's two masters programs have all been approved by the Ohio Board of Regents and by the Higher Learning Commission. The Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies is accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission for Physician Assistant programs. The graduate programs are described in a separate Graduate Programs Catalog. The College's Mission Today Marietta College provides a strong foundation for a lifetime of leader - ship, critical thinking, and problem solving. We achieve this mission by offering undergraduates a contemporary liberal arts education and graduate students an education grounded in advanced knowledge and professional practice. Intellectual and creative excellence defines the Marietta experience. The City The city of Marietta, Ohio, was settled in 1788 by Revolutionary War veterans led by General Rufus Putnam, and became the Northwest Territory's first organized American settlement. Marietta, a city of 15,000, has retained a particular pioneer spirit of independence and New England charm. The first educational leaders came from Massachusetts and Vermont. Marietta is a rivertown situated at the confluence of the Ohio and Muskingum Rivers - at one time it was possible, by leaving the Ohio River and joining the Muskingum River, to travel by boat from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes. Regular stops are still made at Marietta by the passenger steamboats Delta Queen and Mississippi Queen . The origins of the city and its continuing links with the rivers are reflected in two fine museums: the Campus Martius Museum and the Ohio River Museum (at both of which, incidentally, students may intern). The College and the City 2013-2014 COLLEGE CATALOG 9 The College and the City Marietta is part of a much larger Mid-Ohio Valley metropolitan area which includes nearby Parkersburg, West Virginia. This area sustains a combined population of around 150,000. Marietta is located 15 miles north of Parkersburg; 90 miles northwest of Charleston, West Virginia; 120 miles southeast of Columbus, Ohio; 140 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and 170 miles south of Cleveland, Ohio.

FYE First Year Experience Course (SUBJ 199) The First Year Experience course is a specially designated 100 or 200 level course designed to engage students in college level learning, which often means learning on one's own to a degree greater than was true in high school. Taken during the first semester, the course introduces first year students to the important skills of critical think - ing in the context of a class small enough to encourage discussion and interaction. Students in each FYE are housed together in First Year Residence Halls in order to promote a sense of community and to provide opportunities for educational activities in living areas. Many FYE courses are part of learning communities, helping students to form and deepen friendships by sharing more than one class together. Academic advising is organized through FYE and through other required freshmen courses. The FYE course may be an existing course within a department that introduces a discipline or fulfills a gen - eral education requirement. Courses developed as FYE topics courses designed to explore an issue or topic from a specific disciplinary per - spective are numbered 199. The course is graded with a letter grade, A-F. (Students transferring from other colleges with 25 or more credits are exempt from this requirement. This exemption does not apply to students who took college level courses while enrolled in high school.)

Lewis The mission of the Department of History is to provide coursework in history for both majors and non-majors which will give students access to the virtually limitless realm of human experience. Students' personal perspectives thus will be broadened and they will be set on the path toward responsible citizenship in a democratic society. The history program will also help students become more effective commu - nicators and will increase their ability to acquire, interpret and derive meaning from a variety of historical texts. Finally, students will become discerning connoisseurs of different ideas and sources of information. Those who graduate with a major in history will have moved beyond information and knowledge to an understanding of how historians do their work and what it means to be a historian. In short, they will be prepared to teach the discipline, succeed in graduate programs or work in other capacities as professional historians. In addition to offering a major and a minor in History, the department participates in the interdisciplinary majors and minor in Asian Studies as well as European Studies, and Latin American Studies. These minors are described under \"Area Studies\" elsewhere in this section of the Catalog.

Organizational Communication/Public Relations (See Communication for major and minor) Petroleum Engineering Edwy R. Brown Department of Petroleum Engineering and Geology Website: http://www.marietta.edu/~petr/ Chair: Dr. Robert W. Chase (Bob.Chase@marietta.edu) Professor: David C. Freeman Associate professors: Ben W. Ebenhack, Andy Grimm, Dr. Benjamin Thomas; assistant professors: Dr. Paul Daniell, Dr. Rakibul Sarker; Technician: Daniel R. Jones Secretary: Laura Pytlik Petroleum engineering is a specialized discipline that prepares students primarily for careers in the exploration, production, processing and transportation of crude oil and natural gas. The petroleum engineer deals with a product that cannot be seen, held, examined or tested until it has been located in rock formations deep within the earth and brought to the surface. In light of this, petroleum engineers must be capable of designing, drilling, completing and analyzing subsurface well systems; characterizing and evaluating subsurface geological formations and their resources; designing and analyzing systems for producing, injecting, and handling fluids; applying reservoir and production engineering principles and practices to optimize resource 90 MARIETTA COLLEGE Undergraduate Programs Petroleum Engineeringdevelopment and management; and applying economics to these tasks under conditions of risk and uncertainty. The engineering science and technology involved in petroleum engineering also has direct applica - tion in the fields of environmental engineering and hydrology where subsurface well systems are used to access fluids in the earth. The department's vision for the Petroleum Engineering program is to be recognized by the global petroleum industry and educational institutions as one of the premier petroleum engineering programs in the United States. The program's mission is to graduate well-rounded baccalaureate petroleum engineers who are prepared for entry-level positions in the petroleum industry, graduate school, and life-long learning and professional development, and are capable of becoming professional engineers and leaders in the global petroleum industry. For more on the program and its objectives, goals, and learning out - comes please consult the website. Admission Policy for Pre-Petroleum Engineering: The Pre-Petroleum Engineering Program can typically accommodate no more than 90 first-year students. Priority will be given to students with the highest academic promise and to those who declare an intention to major in this subject before April 1. This field of study relies heavily on mathematical skills. Students accepted into the entering class must be ready for calculus in the first year. An ACT score in math below 25, an SAT in math below 570, or a score on our math placement test that indicates a need for Intermediate Algebra (MATH 080), predict that a student is not ready to begin in Pre-Petroleum Engineering as a first-year student. Students needing MATH 080 will not be accepted into the Pre-petroleum Engineering Program but may be able to join later when their performance in math indicates a readiness for calculus. Pre-petroleum students who do not have a GPA above 2.500 at the end of the first semester and those who do not have at least a 2.750 GPA in 32 hours of required courses at the end of the first year will be required to seek another major. Conversely, first-year students of high ability who were accepted into the College but could not begin in Pre- petroleum Engineering because of space limitations may be eligible to join after successfully finishing their first semester at Marietta College. Students transferring into the program from another campus should have a GPA of at least 3.000. Requirements for a major in Petroleum Engineering: (133 hours are required for the B.S.P.E. degree.)

The eight-semester course sequence recommended for petroleum engineering majors that follows is designed to provide students with a logical progression of courses beginning with fundamental courses in mathematics and general sciences. In turn, these courses provide a foundation for engineering science courses that give students the tools necessary for solving engineering design problems that are the real focus of the major in junior-and senior-level petroleum engineering courses. There is an inherent strong emphasis in the curriculum on the development of critical thinking and communication skills. All majors seeking employment in the U.S. are expected to take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Exam during their senior year. Passing the exam is not a requirement. The FE Exam represents the first formal step in the process of becoming a registered professional engineer. It is also recommended that all majors join the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Students interested in majoring in Petroleum Engineering will be required to complete the following courses with a cumulative grade point average of 2.5 or higher to gain admittance into the Petroleum Engineering program. 112; CHEM 131, 132, 133, 134.

Prerequisite: Communication 101 Credit: 3 Hours PHIL 211 Philosophy in Science Fiction L The genre of science fiction arose in the mid-20th century as thoughtful people questioned the meaning of science and technology, and the massive historical and cultural forces these had suddenly set in motion. This was the age of the aftermath of the two World Wars, the first atomic bombs, the Cold War, the Senate hearings conducted by Joseph McCarthy, Sputnik, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Science fiction arose in the popular culture as a response to the ongoing anxi - ety of this age, bemoaning the prospect that we had come to the point where there could be a limit to the number of tomorrows the human race may still have. This class will examine science fiction as a means to explore the unprecedented rise of science and technology that continues still today. We shall examine what science fiction was and what it has become, and how this reflects historical and cultural constants and changes. One thing that seems constant is the problem that the rise in science is not accompanied by similar improvements in human ethics and psychology\u2014and this continues to provide fodder for the genre even today. Texts for this course include a wide variety of novels, short stories, and films from representative figures, including Vonnegut, Heinlein, Spinrad, Dick, Asimov, Causey, Aldiss, Scheckley.

Student-Designed Major The academic interests of some students may be served through the creation of a student-designed major drawn from curricula of two or more departmental programs. These majors are intended to be inter-disciplinary, self-designed programs of study distinctive from conventional majors offered at MC or other colleges and universities. A student-designed major must be focused on a particular subject area, and be comparable in rigor to that of a conventional major. All other requirements of the general education curriculum must be fulfilled. Students who wish to propose a student-designed major should: Have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.000. Submit the proposal to the Curriculum Committee no later than the fall semester of the junior year. Identify a faculty advisor who will help develop the program of study, approve course selections, and oversee the progress of the student through the curriculum. The student-designed major should: Include 35 to 60 credit hours. Have no more than 2/3 of the credit hours drawn from an existing major. Include no more than 2/3 of the credit hours from the courses already completed. Designate the course or courses that will serve as the major's capstone. Include in-depth independent studies, off campus experi - ences and internships in the major, where possible and appropriate.The written description and rationale for the major should include: A title for the major. An explanation of how the major will help the student to achieve career objectives. A list of the courses in the proposed major grouped by subject areas and indicating which courses have been com - pleted. A rationale for each course (or groups of related courses) in the program of study. If the program of study corresponds with a conventional major at another institution, a close correspondence between major content areas must be dem - onstrated. The signature of the faculty supervisor. A copy of the student's transcript. If the proposal is approved, the chair of the Curriculum Committee will submit a copy of the student-designed major to the Records Office and the Provost's Office. Minor(s) Students may elect to complete the requirements for one or more minors. A minor consists of 18 to 24 credit hours, and includes a rea - sonable distribution of lower and upper division courses. Except where a course is offered only on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grade basis, all courses used in satisfaction of a minor must be taken for a letter grade. A minimum grade point average of 2.00 is required for all courses offered in satisfaction of the minor. Each minor must include at least 12 hours that do not overlap the chosen major or other minor(s). A minimum of six of the credit hours presented for graduation with a minor area must have been earned at Marietta College. A graduate of Marietta College who desires to complete a second major or minor must notify the registrar of this intention and abide by the requirements of the major/minor and the policies governing majors/ minors set forth in the catalog in force at the time of such notification. Such a student, however, need not meet the general education require - ments of the catalog in force. Individualized Courses These courses include directed research, independent study, intern - ship, and tutorships. A student may take a total of nine hours toward graduation in any combination of the above hours with the restriction that there be no more than two hours of tutorship. Students may register for individualized courses by submitting a completed Learning Contract or Internship Registration Form to the Records Office. These forms, available from the Records Office, must be completed by the student and the supervising faculty member. If necessary, the Curriculum Committee will answer questions concern - ing the appropriate level of suitability of material. Several departments have additional restrictions on directed research, independent studies, 2013-2014 COLLEGE CATALOG 117 Curricular Options and Enhancementsinternships, and tutorship courses. Students should consult with the appropriate department chair for more information. Directed Research The student conducts a research project under the supervision of the instructor. The courses will be listed as 195, 295, 395, or 495 and may provide from 1 to 3 credit hours. Independent Study These courses allow the student the opportunity to complete course work that is not otherwise offered. The Independent Study is a course whose content is not currently listed in the course catalog. The inde - pendent study cannot be used to review course content presented in existing courses described in the catalog. The courses will be listed as 196, 296, 396, or 496 and may provide from 1 to 6 credit hours. Academic Internships An academic internship is a work and learning experience shaped by reflection and goal-setting and performed under the mentorship of an instructor and an on-site supervisor. These internships typically earn academic credits and often a letter grade. Internship courses will be listed as 197, 297, 397, or 497 and provide from 1 to 3 (or in excep - tional cases more) credit hours. Please refer to the Career Center web site for internship resources and a checklist of procedures. Tutorships These courses allow students to receive credit by helping other college students learn. The courses will be listed as 198, 298, 398, or 498 and may provide from 1 to 2 credit hours. Note that a student may apply no more than two credit hours of tutorship toward the graduation requirements. Special Programs The McDonough Center for Leadership and Business: The Leadership Program The McDonough Center for Leadership and Business, endowed by a gift in memory of Bernard P. McDonough, has been designed to allow students to study leadership through a multidisciplinary liberal arts perspective. The chief mechanism for this study is the McDonough Leadership Program, which involves students in varied activities. A student's participation in the Leadership Program can take several forms: Major in International Leadership Studies Minor in Leadership Studies Certificate in Leadership Studies Teacher Leadership Certificate Enrolling in a LEAD course or \"D\"-designated courses. The specific requirements of each of these programs are listed under Leadership in the Undergraduate Programs of Instruction section of the Catalog. Course work includes both academic courses examin - ing leadership analytically and courses that introduce students to leaders of local, national, and international repute. Some courses, like Foundations of Leadership, will be offered with the Leadership title (e.g. Leadership 101 or LEAD 101, Foundations of Leadership). Other courses having a significant leadership focus will be offered by departments across the entire campus (e.g. Political Science 210, The Presidency and Executive Leadership). The latter courses carry a \"D\" designation in the course listings distributed by the Records Office for the purpose of preregistering for the following semester. Admission to the McDonough Leadership Program for the major, minor or certificates is competitive and requires a separate application. Contact the Office of Admission, (800) 331-7896, (740) 376-4600 for application material and information.

A student usually spends the first three years at Marietta and two years at Ohio University, Case Western Reserve, or Columbia. When completed, the student earns a Bachelor of Arts or Science degree from Marietta College and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree from the second institution. In addition, programs are available with Columbia University wherein a qualified student earns a B.A. or B.S. degree at Marietta and then completes requirements for a Master of Science degree in some branch of engineering during the subsequent two years or less at the engineer - ing school. These programs permit the student to discover and develop aptitudes under a liberal arts program before making a commitment to a techni - cal field of study. In an age of technology, these educational experiences should prepare the graduate for a fuller life and more effective profes - sional career through a wider acquaintance with the humanities, social sciences and fine arts. Course requirements for the Marietta phase of the program vary some - what depending on the field of engineering and the Marietta major the student wishes to pursue. The engineering schools recommend, however, that engineering binary students take at least the following courses while at Marietta: two semesters of basic physics; two semesters of general chemistry; three semesters of calculus; one course in differential equations; one course in computer science; courses in the social sciences, arts, and humanities. most of the requirements for the Marietta major. Because of time constraints, students interested in this program should contact the Engineering Binary Advisor before freshman registration in the fall.

Students satisfactorily completing the required courses and required Praxis II exams will be eligible for early child - hood, middle childhood, intervention specialist, or adolescent/young adult licenses. Reading and early childhood generalist endorsement programs are also available. If possible, all students planning to seek teaching licenses should indi - cate an intent to pursue licensure in the freshman year. When a student enrolls in the first education course (usually Education 110) the student will be classified as pursuing a licensure program. Upon completion of the requirements and at least 45 hours of College credit, the student may apply for admission into the Professional Education Licensure Program. Music Education students should follow the procedures outlined by the Department of Music. For more information, contact: Dr. Dorothy Erb Chair, Department of Education Erwin Hall - Room 101 Marietta College 215 Fifth Street Marietta, OH 45750 e-mail: erbd@marietta.edu Pre-Law Program Education for the practice of law consists of an undergraduate educa - tion followed by a three-year course of study in law school. Students should develop certain basic skills and insights including: comprehen - sion and expression in words; critical understanding of the human institutions and values with which the law deals; and analytical think - ing. Marietta College provides an education that helps its students gain competence in writing and speaking; study the humanities, the sciences, and the social sciences; and, enter deeply into a field of study. These are the types of skills sought by schools of law. There is no single major that best prepares a student to study law.

Medical, dental, and veterinary schools seek students who not only have a sound education in the basic sciences, but who also have developed communication skills and have foundations in the humanities and social sciences. Although most pre-medical, pre-dental and pre-veterinary students at Marietta major in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, or athletic train - ing, other majors may be more suitable for some students. Because some students later decide not to pursue a career in the health pro - 2013-2014 COLLEGE CATALOG 123 Curricular Options and Enhancementsfessions, a major should be chosen on the basis of genuine interest. Although most medical profession schools do not specify a preference for a particular major, they do require that the student complete a cer - tain core group of courses. For example, many medical schools require the following: one year (8 credit hours) of biology; two years (16 credit hours) of chemistry including a year of organic chemistry; one year (8 credit hours) of physics; one year (7-8 credit hours) of mathematics including calcu - lus; one semester of literature. Courses such as these should be completed by the spring of the junior year in order to be prepared adequately for the national admission examinations (MCAT, DAT, VAT or GRE). Some schools also specify other courses in the humanities and social sciences. Because these requirements vary among schools and according to the type of health profession, the pre-professional student should seek advice about course selection from an advisor as well as the Marietta College Pre- Medical Committee. The Pre-Medical Committee consists of representatives from the Departments of Biology and Chemistry. In addition to advising stu - dents in the selection of courses, the Committee collects and dissemi - nates information regarding professional school admission require - ments, national admission examinations, and application procedures. The Committee is also responsible for organizing faculty recommenda - tions regarding students seeking admission to schools of the health professions. Available to pre-medical students at Marietta College is the \"Rounds Program.\" Several physicians at Marietta Memorial Hospital have agreed to allow qualified pre-medical students from Marietta College to make \"rounds\" with them. This might entail such things as visiting hos - pitalized patients with their physicians, observing surgery, or spending some time in the physician's office as he or she examines patients. Participating physicians may include emergency room physicians, internists, surgeons, obstetricians, gynecologists, pathologists, radiolo - gists, and practitioners in other specialties in medicine. This program is available to qualified pre-medical students who have reached their junior year. A similar program exists with local practitioners for pre- dental and pre-veterinary students.

Certificates differ from majors and minors in that they may be awarded independent of any degree or major . They are particularly attractive to students who may already have a degree and simply need to document additional academic training. Although the requirements for a certificate vary, all certificates require the stu - dent to:: 1. complete a minimum of 12 hours; 2. take at least half of the required hours and no fewer than 12 hours at Marietta College; and 3. earn a minimum grade point average of 2.00 for courses completed as part of the Certificate. Some certificates may require standards above the minimum. Certificate in Leadership Studies (CLS) Requirements for the CLS are successful participation in EXCEL Workshop; Leadership 101, 103, 140, 201, 203, 240; one three-hour leadership-designated course; plus 50 hours of approved community service. Teacher Leadership Certificate (TLC) Requirements for the TLC are successful participation in EXCEL Workshop; Leadership 101, 103, 140, 210; Education 110, 253; plus 25 hours of approved community service to be completed through Leadership 101 and 103. Certificate in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) Requirements for the certificate are 18 hours, including: one course in language analysis (either English 380 or Linguistics 320); one course in language teaching pedagogy (Linguistics 321); one course in language in the social context (either Linguistics 231 or Linguistics 232); one course in second language acquisition (Linguistics 341); 6 hours in one foreign language. Note: The Marietta College Certificate in TEFL is designed for students who wish to teach abroad. It does not satisfy state requirements for endorsement of a teaching license in public schools in Ohio. Certificate in Vocal Pedagogy Requirements for the certificate are 14 hours in music: MUSC 121, 122; MUED 225, 325, and 425; 6 hours of applied vocal study (exclud - ing preparatory study - MUSC 150); and one semester of applied teaching through the music department. For complete details of these requirements the students should refer to the Marietta College Music Handbook available from the Music Office, Hermann Fine Arts Building.124 MARIETTA COLLEGE Undergraduate Degrees - Graduation RequirementsUndergraduate Degrees - Graduation Requirements Records Office, Registrar: Tina Perdue (e-mail: records@marietta.edu) Marietta College offers programs leading to undergraduate (bach - elor's) degrees and graduate (master's) degrees. In addition, associate degree and certificate programs are available and described elsewhere in the Catalog. The graduation requirements for bachelor degrees are described below. Graduation Requirements It is the student's responsibility to ensure that he or she understands the requirements, policies and procedures governing the academic program being followed. The student is also responsible for notify - ing the Records Office by submitting appropriate forms, concerning the addition or removal of a major, minor, or certificate from his or her program of study, and classes added or dropped, or changed on their schedule. The College strongly encourages students to review questions concerning their curriculum requirements with the Records Office. In cases where there is a disagreement of interpretation of part of the curriculum requirements, the Academic Standards Committee will be the final arbiter. To receive a bachelor's degree from Marietta College the following requirements must all be satisfied: 1. The Credit Requirement 2. General Education Requirement 3. The Upper-level Courses Requirement 4. The Major Requirement 5. The Grade Point Requirements (a) Overall (b) Major 6. The Residency Requirement 7. The Graduation Application Requirement Undergraduate students usually earn degrees using the requirements of the Catalog in effect during their first year. Students may choose to switch to a more current Catalog in force during their time as a student at Marietta subject to the following restrictions; (a) The requirements of the Catalog to which the student wishes to switch must be met in their entirety. (b) Students may use any Catalog in use within the six academic years after their matriculation. (c) Continuing Education students may use any Catalog within eight academic years after their matriculation. 1. The Credit Requirement Each student must complete at least the number of credit hours speci - fied below.

Students should refer to the appropriate departments in the Undergraduate Academic Programs of Instruction section of the Catalog. For some majors, careful planning may be required to complete both general education and major requirements within the hours specified above. 2. General Education The College believes that a foundation in the traditional liberal arts is an essential preparation for any career. The General Education require - ment provides opportunities to study in breadth and complement the in-depth study required of a major. A student's general education and work in his or her major run in parallel through a student's time at Marietta. The General Education program at Marietta is based on the College's Seven Core Values and requires study across a distribution of areas. The program is based on disciplines and cognate areas rather than administrative structures. In outline, the General Education curriculum requires study as follows. The letters correspond to the distribution code indicated in the course listings issued each semester by the Records Office. The same code is used on the College's website.

The intent of a \"W\" course is to provide students with opportunities to write, to receive feedback from their instructors and/or peers, and to demonstrate how to write in a particular style or discipline. English Composition, WRIT 101, is a prerequisite for all Writing Proficiency courses. The criteria for Writing Proficiency courses are: 1. Writing 101 is a prerequisite. 2. Clear description of the writing assignments in the course syllabus. 3. Implementation of a pedagogical strategy to improve stu - dent writing skills. No single model is necessarily appro - priate to all disciplines and courses. The course should include preliminary process assignments that culminate in one or more completed works, as the emphasis of Writing Proficiency courses is to help students improve the quality of the final work. The number of final and process assignments in the course is left up to the instructor, but the writing pedagogy should reflect the commitment of the course to improve student writing. Rules applied to General Education courses: (a) Unless otherwise stated, general education requirements may be satisfied only by three or four hour credit courses.128 MARIETTA COLLEGE Undergraduate Degrees - Graduation Requirements(b) With the exception of Writing Proficiency Courses, no course can count for more than one general education requirement. However, a single course may count as both a course for a major/minor/certificate and a general educa - tion requirement.

All Marietta students must complete either a major selected from the list shown under Undergraduate Programs of Instruction or a student- designed major. A major will include a capstone course or experience. These capstone experiences will culminate and synthesize the learning that has taken place over the entire undergraduate career, building not only on the courses within the major, but exercising also the student's abilities in writing, speaking, thinking critically, and solving problems. While the specific form of the capstone varies across the programs of instruc - tion, it often includes independent work such as original research, an internship, artistic performance or creation, a teaching practicum, or a practical consultancy that applies theory and knowledge to a business or other organization. The criteria for a student-designed major are shown under Academic Policies and Practices as are the requirements for students pursuing a second major. A General Studies major (B.A.) is available only to stu - dents enrolled in the Continuing Education Program. (See Continuing Education section of the Catalog for more details.) 5. The Grade Point Requirements. Marietta College uses a 4.0 grading system where A = 4 quality points, B = 3, etc., with +/-, so, for example, B+ = 3.33 quality points. (The grade A+ can be awarded but earns only 4 quality points.) For details see \"Grading System\" in the Academic Policies and Practices section of the Catalog. (a) Overall. Each student must earn at least an overall 2.000 grade average. (b) Major. Each student must earn at least a 2.000 grade aver - age in his/her major.

This legislation is designed to protect the privacy of a student's educational records. Academic Policies Confidentiality of Student Records Information held by the College in any office (e.g. Records Office, Provost's Office, Office of the Dean of Student Life, Student Health Center, Career Center, Admissions Office, Student Financial Services Office, Cashier's Office, Business Office, and faculty offices) is released for off-campus use only with the student's written consent or upon subpoena, with the exceptions listed below. Data classified as directory information, which may be released to any - one by the College on request, includes the student's home and local addresses, telephone, e-mail, photographs, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, date of graduation, major field of study, schedule of classes, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, and, if a member of an athletic team, weight and height. In addition, information about a student's accomplishments, such as participation in recognized student activities and receipt of awards and honors, may be communicated to news media, parents and the high school the stu - dent attended, unless the student specifically requests that such com - munication not take place. Such a request must be in writing and sent to the Office of College Relations, Irvine Administration Building. Such requests must be resubmitted at the beginning of each academic year and may cover no more than one year. A request for non-disclosure of directory information may be filed in writing with the Office of the Dean of Student Life, Andrews Hall. Student records (i.e. grades, disciplinary action, health records, etc.) may be released to parents or legal guardians only with signed consent of the student. The student must provide the College with a signed waiver for such release of information. Waiver forms are available in the Records Office and the Office of the Dean of Student Life. See the Parent Notification Policy in the Student Handbook for specific circumstances in which exceptions may be made. Similarly, student account information can only be released to parents, legal guardians, or other third parties with the student's consent. The student must sign a waiver specifically authorizing the release of finan - cial information and provide it to Marietta College Student Accounts. The waiver (Authorization to Release Financial Information) can be obtained at the Student Accounts web page. As of January 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education's FERPA regulations expand the circumstances under which your education records and personally identifiable information (PII) contained in such records \u2014 including your Social Security Number, grades, or other private information \u2014 may be accessed without your consent. First, the U.S. Comptroller General, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local education authorities (\"Federal and State Authorities\") may allow access to your records and PII without your consent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal- or state-supported education program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is \"principally engaged in the provision of education,\" such as early childhood educa - tion and job training, as well as any program that is administered by an education agency or institution. Second, Federal and State Authorities may allow access to your education records and PII without your con - sent to researchers performing certain types of studies, in certain cases even when we object to or do not request such research. Federal and State Authorities must obtain certain use-restriction and data security promises from the entities that they authorize to receive your PII, but the Authorities need not maintain direct control over such entities. In addition, in connection with Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems, State Authorities may collect, compile, permanently retain, and share without your consent PII from your education records, and they may track your participation in education and other programs by linking such PII to other personal information about you that they obtain from other Federal or State data sources, including workforce development, unemployment insurance, child welfare, juvenile justice, military ser - vice, and migrant student records systems. Confidentiality of Student Images/Photos Photographs or video of students held by the College in any office (e.g., College Relations, Admission, etc.), and obtained through an orches - trated or planned photo or video shoot cannot be used or released for marketing purposes of the College without written consent from the student. Photographs or video taken during live events (e.g., athletic contests, Commencement, Matriculation, etc.) are allowed to be used, unless the student has a signed request on file with College Relations to not use any images or likenesses of them on file. This request is valid for one year and must be re-submitted each academic year. Confidentiality of Transcripts A student's transcript may be reviewed only by authorized person - nel of the College, the student, and individuals specified by FERPA. Generally, the Records Office must have written permission to release information from the student's transcript. See above for information regarding release of academic records to parents. Academic Dishonesty Dishonesty within the academic community is a very serious matter, because dishonesty destroys the basic trust necessary for a healthy educational environment. Academic dishonesty is any treatment or representation of work as if one were fully responsible for it, when it is in fact the work of another person. Academic dishonesty includes cheating, plagiarism, theft, or improper manipulation of laboratory or research data or theft of services. A substantiated case of academic dis - honesty may result in disciplinary action, including a failing grade on the project, a failing grade in the course, or expulsion from the College.Academic Policies and Practices 2013-2014 COLLEGE CATALOG 131 Academic Policies and PracticesIf a substantiated case of academic dishonesty results in a failing grade in the course, a student who chooses to withdraw from the course will receive a grade of \"F.\" In cases of suspected academic dishonesty, the instructor is advised to consult with his or her chair and, if deemed necessary, with the Dean of the Faculty. If it is determined that academic dishonesty has occurred, it is the responsibility of the instructor to notify the Dean of the Faculty and the Dean of Student Life of any penalties which have been applied. Those offices will keep a record which may guide action in case of another offense in the future. Academic Grievances Marietta College is committed to the highest principles of academic and personal integrity and a sensitive regard for the rights of others. Essential to these rights are the individual responsibilities of faculty and students. Faculty are responsible for clearly communicating their grading poli - cies, testing procedures, and expectations of student performance at the beginning of each course, as described in the Faculty Manual . Students are responsible for following these policies and fulfilling those expectations. Although students have the right to their opinions about course content and delivery, they remain responsible for learning the content of the course. The procedures for grievances are outlined in the Student Handbook. Class Attendance It is the responsibility of individual instructors to evaluate the impor - tance of student class attendance in determination of course grades. Accordingly, each instructor prepares at the beginning of each semes - ter a written statement setting forth a policy for consideration of unex - cused absences, makeup examinations, and related matters, which will be in force for that semester. The statements are filed with the Dean of the Faculty and a statement of policy on attendance appropriate to each class is read at the first class meeting. A faculty member may not change the time of a final examination, either for a class or for individuals. Such changes may be made only by the Dean of the Faculty. Missed Class Time Due to Co-Curricular Events or Religious Observances Classes missed due to participation in college-sponsored co-curricular events or college-recognized religious observances are considered excused absences provided appropriate procedures are followed. The student must notify the instructor at the earliest possible time before the absence and arrange to make up missed work as defined by the instructor's syllabus. The co-curricular activity must be a performance, professional meeting, or athletic contest to be considered an excused absence. The religious observance must appear on the College's cal - endar of religious observances in order to be considered an excused absence. If it does not, an excused absence can be granted only if the student requests special permission from the Dean of the Faculty. An excused absence allows the student to make up exams or quiz - zes given during the absence, or to reschedule oral presentations. It is the responsibility of the student to get notes from the class and to compensate as much as possible for the absence. It is also the student's responsibility to work with the instructor in determining an appropri - ate time for make-up assignments. Students must recognize that many classroom and laboratory activities cannot be replicated and that absences may be detrimental to their performance. Academic Practices Registration Currently enrolled students are expected to schedule courses for the upcoming semester during the Pre-registration period that begins in the 10th week of the semester. Registration priority is determined by credit hours completed. In order to register for courses, a student must receive clearance from the Business Office, including payment of the annual pre-registration deposit during the spring semester. Students are responsible for arranging an advising session with their academic advisor as a required component of the registration process. After meeting with their advisor, students will submit their registration online via WebAdvisor on the MyMarietta portal. To receive academic credit for a course, a student must be registered for the course during the term in which the work is done. Changing Courses Students may change their course schedule electronically through the last Friday before the semester begins. Changes made after this time require submission of the appropriate paperwork, including advisor consent, to the Records Office. The College interprets the submission of the Course Add/Drop form or Withdrawal form to indicate that the student understands how the requested course changes affect his or her degree requirements. Students receiving financial aid or veterans benefits must meet with the appropriate official in Financial Services. Changing courses within the first two weeks of the semester (add/drop period). To change courses, the student may obtain a Course Add/Drop form from the Records Office. This form allows students to add courses until the end of the first week of classes and drop courses from their sched - ule until the end of the second week of classes. To complete the form, the student must obtain the signature of his or her advisor. Courses dropped during this period will not be recorded on the student's tran - script. Withdrawing from courses after the add/drop period A student has the option to withdraw from any courses except the First Year Seminar (FYE 101), the College Life and Leadership Laboratory (FYE 102), Writing 101, and Communication 101 through the last day of classes. Students withdrawing from courses after the second week of classes must obtain a Withdrawal form from the Records Office. This form, once completed and signed by the student, must be signed by the course instructor, and the student's advisor to verify that they have been consulted. If the signed form is returned to the Records Office by the end of the 9th week of classes, a grade of W will be assigned. If this is done after the 9th week of classes, a grade of WF will be assigned. The course and grade will appear on the student's transcript. Refer to the section on Grading System below for more details.132 MARIETTA COLLEGE Academic Policies and PracticesFor any physical education courses meeting fewer than the normal 15 weeks of the semester, the add/drop-withdrawal periods will be pro- rated by the chair of the Department of Health and Physical Education. For other courses meeting fewer than the normal 15 weeks of the semester, the add/drop-withdrawal periods will be pro-rated by the Registrar of the College. Waitlisted Courses If a course is closed (filled to capacity), a student may elect to be added to a waitlist. Prior to the start of the term, when a seat becomes available in a waitlisted course, the first student on the waitlist will be notified by email. The student will be given three days to contact the Records Office and accept or decline the available seat. If the opening is declined or there is no response by the end of the third day, the student will be dropped from the waitlist and the next student on the list will be granted permission to enroll in the course. In order to benefit from this process, students will need to check their Marietta College email account regularly. Special Rules for First-Year Courses All first-year students will enroll in the First Year Experience course, FYE 101 during the fall semester. In addition, all first-year students must complete English Composition, WRIT 101 and Fundamentals of Oral Communication, COMM 101 with grades of C- or better. Students may not enroll in WRIT 101 and COMM 101 during the same semester. Students designated by Admissions and the Director of the Academic Resource Center as \"At-Risk\" are also required enroll in FYE 102. International students are required to take a special cultural tran - sitions section of FYE 102 (FYE 112). Students may not withdraw from the First Year Experience course, FYE 101, the College Life and Leadership Laboratory, FYE 102/112, English Composition, WRIT 101 or Fundamentals of Oral Communication, COMM 101. Any exception to this policy can be made only by the Assistant Dean for the First Year Seminar for FYE 101 and 102/112, the chair of the Department of English for WRIT 060/101, and the chair of the Department of Communication for COMM 101. Grades Grading system Midterm and final letter grades and their equivalents in quality points are: A+ = 4.00 A = 4.00 A - = 3.67B+ = 3.33 B = 3.00 B- = 2.67C+ = 2.33 C = 2.00 C- = 1.67D+ = 1.33 D = 1.00 D- = 0.67 F = 0.00 Grades mean: A, Excellent ; B, Good ; C, Average ; D, Poor, but passing ; F, Failure Other report abbreviations and their meanings are: I, Incomplete; P, S, W, WF, Withdrawn failing = 0.00; Registered, grade only); Au, Audit; NR, Not reported; CIP, Course in Progress.1. An Incomplete (I) may be given when the student, for reasons beyond his or her control, is unable to complete the work of a course. It may also be given at the end of the first semester in two-semester courses (honors projects, independent study projects, and internships) if the course is unevaluated at the end of the first semester. In all cases neither the grade nor the hours of incomplete are counted in the com - putation of the semester or cumulative grade point averages. An incomplete must be removed prior to the due date of midsemester grades for the semester following receipt of the incomplete unless the course instructor notifies the Records Office this requirement should be waived. Otherwise, the grade of incomplete automatically becomes a grade of F. (Students will not be notified in advance of this automatic grade change.) Incompletes may be extended, by request of the instruc - tor, to the end of the semester following the semester in which the incomplete was first granted. Further extensions would be determined by petition to the Academic Standards Committee. 2. A Pass grade (P) applies only to the College Life and Leadership Laboratory (FYE 102). Pass means the equivalent of mastery of the material at least at an 80% level. FYE 102 work which does not achieve a Pass grade will be graded with a letter grade of F. FYE 102 completed with a Pass grade will provide 1 hour towards the credit requirement for graduation, but will not be included in the computation of the stu - dent's cumulative grade point average. 3. Failure (F) is given for failure to meet the standards of the course; or failure to complete the work of the course. A student who fails to take the final examination in a course will receive F, unless excused by the Academic Standards Committee. If a substantiated case of academic dishonesty results in a failing grade in the course, a student who chooses to withdraw from the course will receive a grade of F. Any course for which the grade of F is received may be repeated only under the regular letter grading system. 4. Withdrawn (W) is an unevaluated grade given for withdrawal: (a) for medical or other extenuating circumstances at any time during the semester; (b) at the option of the student until the end of the 9th week of the semester after consultation with the instructor of the course, and the student's academic advisor. 5. Withdrawn-failing (WF) is a mandatory grade for students who withdraw from a course after the 9th week of the semester and not fall - ing within the conditions of 4(a) above. The WF grade will be counted on the same basis as an F in calculating a student's average. 6. Some departmental courses are only graded S/U. Satisfactory means the equivalent of at least C- work, whereas work rated below C- would be graded as Unsatisfactory . Courses graded S/U will not be included in the computation of the stu - dent's cumulative grade point average. Only courses with Satisfactory grades will be awarded credit. Any course in which a grade of U is received may be repeated only under the regular letter grading system. 7. Registered but unevaluated at midsemester (X), is given when the course instructor cannot fairly evaluate a student's performance for a midsemester grade report. 2013-2014 COLLEGE CATALOG 133 Academic Policies and Practices8. Any student may elect to audit (AU) a course, that is, to take it for noncredit. If a student chooses to audit a course, he or she is not required to take examinations or meet any of its academic obligations, and no grade is awarded. The student may choose this option until the end of the add period at the beginning of the semester (first week of class). After this time, the decision is irreversible. 9. Repeating courses: with the exception of FYE 101 sections not offered to the general college population and FYE 102/112, students are allowed to retake a course at Marietta College at any time. a) Any course in which a grade of U or F is received may be repeated only under the regular letter grading system. b) Credit for the course will be given only once, and is determined by the most recent grade in each course (if a student retakes a course and receives an F, they lose credit for the course). c) The official transcript will show the student's complete record, but the grade point average will be computed on the basis of the most recent grade in each course. This policy of the College will be noted when a transcript is sent out. d) Courses repeated at other institutions do not affect the stu - dent's grade point average. Policy Regarding Grades in the Event of Complete Withdrawal 1. The grade of \"W\" will be recorded for each course for which a student was registered if the student withdraws from the College starting the first day of the semester but before the end of the ninth week of the semester. 2. The grade of \"WF\" will be recorded for each course for which a stu - dent was registered if the student withdraws from the College after the ninth week of a semester. Under certain circumstances, such as family catastrophe or substantiated medical problems, grades of \"W\" may be recorded after the ninth week at the discretion of the Provost. 3. If a substantiated case of academic dishonesty results in a failing grade in the course, a student who withdraws from the College will receive a grade of F for the course. Satisfactory-Unsatisfactory Grade Option Students with junior or senior standing and a cumulative grade point average of 2.00 may elect to take one course per semester in which the evaluation is made on a satisfactory-unsatisfactory basis, instead of the usual letter grades. The following conditions apply to this option. 1. Courses taken to fulfill requirements for a major, minor or certificate and the general education requirements for graduation are excluded from this option; 2. The student exercising this option will do so with the permission of his or her advisor at the time of registration. In accord with the cur - rent practice for changing courses, the student will not be allowed to convert to the regular grading system or to convert a course from the regular grading system after the first week of the semester; 3. The instructor will be apprised of the student's taking the course under the option, with the understanding that the student will satisfy the same requirements for entrance into and completion of the course expected of students enrolled under the regular grading system;4. With the approval of the Curriculum Committee: (a) A department may elect to offer a course only on an S/U basis; enrollment by a student in such a course does not deprive that student of the opportunity to use the S/U option for another course during that same semester; (b) A department may elect to exclude any course from the S/U option. 5. When an instructor is permanently replaced after the first week of the semester, students are allowed the option (which must be exercised within one week) of changing their choice of receiving a grade in the course to one of receiving an S or U. The student is also given the oppor - tunity to withdraw from the course whether or not the nine-week drop period has passed; 6. Any student may elect to take any Lifetime Activity Course in physi - cal education on an S/U basis. Such election need not satisfy the above conditions and does not preclude the election of an additional S/U course under the above conditions; 7. Any use of the S/U option other than specified above may be autho - rized by the Curriculum Committee with the concurrence of the appro - priate department chairperson. Auditing courses Courses may be audited by individuals interested in the topic and who do not wish to receive academic credit for their participation. Regularly enrolled students are permitted to audit courses within the maximum load of 18 credit hours without charge, but must first secure written permission from the course instructor. Courses selected by a student for auditing may not be changed for credit, or vice versa, after the end of the first week of classes. Students who register to audit a course but stop attending may be administratively withdrawn from the course and assigned a grade of W (see Grading section) at the discretion of the registrar. Transfer credits Marietta students who wish to take courses elsewhere for possible transfer of credit to Marietta College should secure advanced approval through the Records Office. Credit will be allowed for courses equivalent to or similar to those offered by Marietta College and completed with a grade of \"C-\" or better, although transfer credit from non-accredited institutions is not guaranteed. The credit hours transferred in will be shown as transfer credits on the student's Marietta College transcript and can be used to satisfy the credit hour requirement for graduation, but the grades earned for transferred courses are not included in computing the student's cumulative grade point average for the Marietta College degree. Transfer hours do not count as hours \"in residence.\" Students planning to transfer in credits are reminded of the College's Residence Requirement for graduation. Credit hours transferred in from an institution following a \"quarter\" or a \"unit\" program will be converted to \"semester\" hours. Details can be obtained from the Records Office.134 MARIETTA COLLEGE Academic Policies and PracticesAdvanced Placement, CLEP and similar programs Under certain circumstances, a student may offer for consideration credits earned through the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) Advanced Placement (AP) Program, the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP), the DANTES Subject Standardized Tests (DSST), the International Baccalaureate Diploma (IB), and/or departmental credit by examination. Credit earned through these specific programs may be used at Marietta College: 1) in satisfaction of elective credit; 2) in satisfaction of majors, minors, and certificates, subject to the approval of the department chairperson; 3) in satisfaction of the communication components of the general education requirements (subject to departmental policy for each examination) . College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) Advanced Placement (AP) Program High school students who demonstrate achievement on Advanced Placement Program tests as administered by the College Entrance Examination Board may have the results submitted to Marietta College to be considered for credit. At the end of the Undergraduate Admissions section of the Catalog, a table shows the scores required for College credit to be received. Scores of 3 may be considered for waiver of prerequisites with departmental approval. With appropriate scores, students may receive up to 8 semester hours credit for each examination. College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) Under certain circumstances a student may offer for consideration credits earned through the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) of The College Board. Students will not be eligible to receive CLEP credit for courses when college credit has been awarded for the same course or more advanced courses in that same subject area. To receive credits for a CLEP examination, the student must provide a score report from CLEP and have obtained the minimum accepted score for that exam as determined by Marietta College departmental policies. The College will grant a total of up to 36 hours of credit by examination through CLEP/DANTES toward graduation. Information concerning CLEP minimum scores and examinations for which credit is awarded may be obtained from the Academic Resource Center (ARC). DANTES Subject Standardized Tests (DSST) The College also accepts credit through DANTES Subject Standardized Tests (DSST). The College will grant a total of up to 36 hours of credit by examination through CLEP/DANTES toward graduation. Information concerning DANTES may be obtained at the Academic Resource Center (ARC). International Baccalaureate Diploma The College recognizes the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program for admission purposes and advanced placement. Students who have received the IB Diploma will be granted general college credit for up to two higher level IB courses in which they achieve grades of 5 or better. Decisions on placement and credit in departmental majors, minors, and certificates are made by the Registrar in consultation with the appropriate department chairs. American Council on Education (Armed Services) The College considers the recommendations of the American Council on Education when reviewing an application for transfer credit. The recommendations are contained in the Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Services and the National Guide for Credit Recommendations for Noncollegiate Courses. The recom - mendations are considered when assessing for possible award of credit successfully completed courses listed in these publications and which are equivalent to or similar to courses offered at Marietta College. Credit by Examination Departmental credit by examination is available for some Marietta College cataloged courses. Courses successfully taken by examina - tion will be indicated with a grade of S (Satisfactory) on the College transcript. A student may take an examination only once for any given course. Information regarding such examinations can be secured from the appropriate department chairperson. Academic Advising Academic advising is viewed as an integral part of the educational process and every undergraduate at Marietta College will have an aca - demic advisor. Advising is the process by which the student is directed to significant knowledge of self and of the College and its resources and requirements. Student's Responsibility It is the student's responsibility to ensure that he or she understands the requirements, policies and procedures governing the academic program being followed. The student is also responsible for notify - ing the Records Office by submitting appropriate forms, concerning the addition or removal of a major, minor, or certificate from his or her program of study, and classes added or dropped, or changed on their schedule. The College strongly encourages students to review questions concerning their curriculum requirements with the Records Office. In cases where there is a disagreement of interpretation of part of the curriculum requirements, the Academic Standards Committee will be the final arbiter. First Year Students The instructor in a first-time student's First Year Experience course (FYE 101), or its Learning Community partner where applicable, is typically the academic advisor for at least the first two semesters. The academic advisor assists the student with the registration process and other aspects of academic advising. The student is encouraged to select an advisor from among the faculty teaching in the student's major by the beginning of the third semester but no earlier than midsemester of the second semester. 2013-2014 COLLEGE CATALOG 135 Academic Policies and PracticesChange of Advisor To change academic advisor, the student should first approach a fac - ulty member of the department in which the student plans to major. (Alternatively, a student may ask the chair of the department to recom - mend an advisor.) If the faculty member agrees to accept the student as an advisee, the student must fill out the Change of Advisor form available in the Records Office. Transfer Students The Office of Admission will assign an academic advisor to transfer stu - dents who are not required to enroll in the First Year Seminar. Where a transfer student has decided on a major, the Office of Admission will consult with the chair of the relevant department before assigning an academic advisor. Academic Status Full-time Students The minimum semester load for a full-time student is 12 semester hours of courses. The normal semester load for the Bachelor degree is 15 to 18 hours. This load typically allows students to complete the Bachelor degree within four years. Students with a 3.00 or greater cumulative grade point average, or those who can demonstrate a need to do so, may take more than 18 hours with the permission of their advisor and the Registrar. Consult the section of the catalog on \"Table of Fees\" concerning the fee for hours in excess of 18. Part-time Students Anyone may enroll as a part-time student. Part-time students are lim - ited to academic work totaling 11 hours (but usually take less) for credit in any one semester, whether taken in day or evening sessions or both. Part-time students may not participate in intercollegiate sports or certain extracurricular activities, and may not affiliate with College fraternities or sororities. Part-time students are charged on a semester- hour basis. Continuing Education Students Continuing Education status is open to students of 24 years of age or older. Detailed information concerning this classification may be obtained from the office of Graduate and Continuing Studies. Classification A candidate for a Bachelor degree is classified according to the follow - ing schedule of credit hours earned: Freshman 0 - 24 Sophomore 25 - 58 Junior 59 - 91 Senior 92 or moreAcademic Standards Committee The Academic Standards Committee responds to problems arising from academic deficiencies of individual students, petitions for exemp - tion from requirements of the curriculum, and petitions related to transfer of credits. Students wishing to petition the committee should follow this format/ content: 1. A concise statement of the action or decision sought by the peti - tioner. Examples are: Request waiver of requirement in the curriculum, Request for reconsideration of transfer of course credit Request for appeal of probation or dismissal 2. A rationale for the action or decision being sought. 3. Other documents that verify claims made by the petitioner or that support the requested action or decision. Examples are: Letter(s) from advisor, instructors, or both Letter(s) from psychologist, counselor, physician, or minis - ter Letter(s) from employer(s) Completed petitions must be submitted to the Records Office no later than 48 hours before a regularly scheduled committee meeting. Electronic submissions are preferred. Academic Standing A student is either \"in good academic standing\" or \"on academic pro - bation.\" A student's status is dependent on the number of semesters enrolled and the grade point average earned. As indicated below, a student in good academic standing may also be on \"academic warning\" because of performance within a semester. For a student to be in good academic standing, the student must achieve or exceed the following minimum grade point average based on the number of semesters a student has completed as a full-time student (12 hours or more attempted in the semester). Semesters Completed Minimum GPA Two semesters or fewer Three semesters or more 1.8 2.0 When a student falls below the appropriate minimum grade point aver - age listed above, that student is no longer in good academic standing. The College's procedures for this situation are detailed in the section below \"Academic Warning, Probation, Dismissal.\" Similar rules are applied by the Federal and State authorities and the College for maintaining eligibility for financial aid. Please refer to the \"Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress\" in the Undergraduate Tuition, Fees and Financial Aid section of this Catalog. Academic Warning, Probation, Dismissal The Marietta College Community is dedicated to the academic success of all students and our goal is to aid students in their progress toward graduation. The policies governing academic warning, probation and dismissal are designed to help ensure that a student is making satisfac - tory progress toward degree completion. 136 MARIETTA COLLEGE Academic Policies and PracticesA student will receive an academic warning when his/her semester grade point average falls below 2.0. Academic warning is used to alert students to potential problems with unsatisfactory academic progress. The purpose of academic probation is to inform students when they are not meeting the normal aca - demic standards expected of college level students; encourage students to re-evaluate their motivation and to develop strategies for academic success; encourage students to spend more time on academic endeavors. Upon their placement on academic probation, students will receive a letter from the Academic Resource Center identifying strategies to improve their academic performance. Students are also required to meet with a staff member of the ARC and their academic advisor to dis - cuss their probationary status within the first two weeks of the semes - ter. During these meetings, each student will complete a Probation Contract outlining the College's expectations regarding attendance and performance and requiring the student to commit to specific efforts identified to support academic success. Should a student fail to com - plete the Probation Contract or to honor the agreed upon terms of the contract, s/he may be considered for an Administrative Withdrawal (see below). Should a student's cumulative grade point average remain below the stated minimum for two consecutive semesters, the Academic Standards Committee will review the individual's academic record and determine whether to dismiss the student from the College. A student may appeal the decision to dismiss to the Academic Standards Committee. A student can also be considered for dismissal by the Academic Standards Committee with no prior warning or probationary period when his or her performance drops significantly below the minimum stated above Restrictions applying to Students on Probation The following restrictions apply 1. A student on academic probation may enroll in no more than 14 credit hours each semester. 2. The following co-curricular restrictions will apply to a stu - dent on academic probation a. They are ineligible to participate in any college athletic team or club sport. b. They may not hold office in any campus organization or social fraternity or sorority. c. They may not travel off campus to a meeting or trip with any college organization or club unless required to do so for an academic program. d. They may not represent the college in any on campus or off campus public events or other co-curricular activities (e.g., plays, musical performances, student newspaper) unless required to do so for an academic course. e. They may not register for courses that require co-cur - ricular participation, unless required by their major. The above restrictions, credit hours and co-curricular, first apply in the semester subsequent to that in which the student is placed on academic probation, with the exception that for first year students, implementation of the above co-curricular restrictions will occur at the end of the spring semester. The restrictions continue in force until the student has returned to \"good academic standing\", with the exception that when a student has earned a semester grade point average of 2.0 or better, with a minimum of 12 credits calculated in the last semester attended (Fall or Spring), co-curricular restrictions will not be enforced for the following semester. All appeals will be handled by the Academic Standards Committee. At the beginning of each semester, a list of students on co-curricular restriction will be available in the Records Office. All faculty, staff and administrators that directly or indirectly supervise co-curricular activities are responsible for checking with the Records Office to ensure that students are eligible to participate in a co-curricular activity. The Provost of the college is responsible for enforcing adherence to the academic probation policy by all members of the college community. Readmission after Dismissal A student who has been dismissed for insufficient grade point average may be considered for readmission on probation if that student has been away from Marietta College for at least a summer plus one semes - ter, and can submit evidence of maturity and motivation. Examples of such evidence are: Transcript of credits earned at an accredited college or uni - versity Letter(s) from employer(s) Record of service in the armed forces A student dismissed for insufficient grades, readmitted, and separated from the College again for the same reason, is thereafter ineligible to return. Fresh Start Policy Under the Fresh Start Policy, students readmitted to the College after an absence of five or more years may petition the Academic Standards Committee to have their previous grade point average eliminated. If the petition is approved, the student receives credit for all courses previously taken and passed with a grade of \"C\" or better and no credit for courses in which a grade of \"C-\" or lower was earned. All the work previously taken is ignored in computing the student's cumulative grade point average, except for the purpose of calculating eligibil - ity for graduating with honors. All courses and grades remain on the student's record. Under the Fresh Start Policy, a student must be re- enrolled for a minimum of 30 semester hours before becoming eligible for graduation. Administrative Withdrawal Marietta College reserves the right to administratively withdraw a student who is not demonstrating a serious academic effort. Failure to demonstrate a serious academic effort is defined as, when in the judgment of the instructor, the student's ability to derive a meaningful educational experience with regard to the content and learning objec - tives of the course is impaired. This may include but is not limited to: excessive absences; failure to submit homework; and/or failure to complete quizzes, exams or other classroom-based measurements of progress as required by the specific course. 2013-2014 COLLEGE CATALOG 137 Academic Policies and PracticesWhen such failure is reported to the Registrar, the Registrar shall com - municate with each of the student's instructors to determine whether the student has demonstrated or has failed to demonstrate a serious academic effort, as defined above. Reports may originate from any faculty member or administrator. If a student is found to have failed to demonstrate serious academic effort, the Registrar will recommend withdrawal to the Provost. The student may be administratively with - drawn from the College by action of the Provost. Prior to any decision, the Provost will solicit additional information from the Dean of Students Office to determine if the student is in good standing in these areas. After all information is reviewed, the Provost will schedule a meeting with the student to discuss the findings and to consult with the student about the circumstances and possible consequences. In the event of an administrative withdrawal, resident students will be required to vacate college housing; students may lose eligibility for financial aid; and other services, activities, and benefits of enrollment at the College will be terminated. In accordance to current practice as outlined in the Undergraduate Catalog, the effective date of administrative withdrawal must be during the first five weeks of the semester to receive any partial refund. A \"WF\" grade is given to students with an administrative withdrawal due to failure to demonstrate serious academic effort. A \"W\" may be given prior to the end of the ninth week of the semester, at the Provost's discretion, depending on circumstances leading to the administrative withdrawal. A \"WF\" grade is computed into the grade point average as 0.00 grade points per credit hour. In the event of a decision to administratively withdraw a student for failure to demonstrate serious academic effort, the student may, within 24 hours, appeal to the Academic Standards Committee. The Committee may either uphold or reverse the decision of the Provost.

For further information on this plan contact: Tuition Management Systems 1-888-285-3052 Refunds Following Withdrawal The College may provide a partial refund only when the student receives written consent from the Dean of Student Life to withdraw or take a leave of absence or when the Dean of Student Life dismisses the student. The effective date of withdrawal, leave of absence, or dismissal must be during the first five weeks of classes for the semester to receive any partial refund. The date of withdrawal, leave of absence, or dismissal determines the proportion of tuition and student fee refunded: During the first week of the semester, 90 percent; second week, 80 percent; third week, 70 percent; fourth week, 60 percent; fifth week, 50 percent. The College will offer no refund after the fifth week of classes unless the withdrawal is for medical purposes and the student is enrolled in the Tuition Refund Insurance plan. Students who drop from full-time to part-time (i.e., less than 12 hours) within the first two weeks of classes will be charged the per-hour tuition rate, and financial aid awards will be adjusted to reflect the change in status. No adjustments will be made to a student's account after the first two weeks of classes due to a drop from full-time to part-time. Overload fees will not be pro-rated, nor refunded for courses dropped after the first two weeks of classes. No portion of the housing charge is refundable. The College prorates board charges according to the period that the student used the dining service. Payments to Federal and State Financial Assistance Programs Special rules govern repayments to government financial aid programs when a student withdraws before the end of the term. Please refer to the Withdrawal, Refunds, and Financial Aid section, later in this section of the Catalog. Insurance Tuition Refund Insurance The College encourages all students to purchase Tuition Refund Insurance. If a student is unable to complete the semester because of medical reasons, the insurance allows the student to withdraw at any time from Marietta College and receive a 80 percent refund of tuition, room and board. A qualified physician must certify the disability. Without this insurance, a student could lose a significant investment in tuition and fees. Participation in the Tuition Refund Plan is optional. Those who wish to participate must do so before the first day of fall classes. Students will receive information about this insurance program through the mail during the summer. International Student Insurance Participation in the insurance plan is required of all international students unless the student can show to the satisfaction of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion that s/he is covered by a plan in their home country which provides equal or near equal coverage. The plan requires a copay and provides benefits for physician office and hospital visits, testing, treatment, and medicine associated with an injury/ illness. The plan does not cover dental or eye care costs. For more information on the insurance plan, students should contact the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Personal Property Insurance The College does not provide insurance coverage or reimbursements for loss of students' personal property at the College or while on trips. The College encourages families to review their homeowner's or rent - er's policies to determine if their personal property is covered while at Marietta College. Many insurance providers offer a rider to the primary policy to insure personal property away from home. Transcripts Two types of transcripts are available. Unofficial transcripts, for the student's use, do not bear the seal of the College. They may be sent directly to the student and are free of charge. Official transcripts are sent directly to schools and other institutions of higher education, prospective employers, etc. as designated by the student. Official transcripts may also be sent directly to students in sealed envelopes. Fees apply as shown below.

Financial Aid and Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress The Marietta College financial aid programs make a Marietta educa - tion accessible to those who, for financial reasons, might otherwise be unable to attend. Whereas the family has the responsibility to meet college costs to the extent it is able, Marietta College tries to build a partnership with each family that will bridge the gap between the fam - ily's contribution and College costs. Financial Aid Sources of Assistance There are three principal types of aid that are potentially available to college students: 1. Grant or scholarship, which the student does not have to repay; 2. Loan, which the student usually must repay with interest, after leaving college; and 3. Part-time employment, for which the student is paid and is expected to budget as part of the means of meeting educa - tional expenses. 1. Grants and scholarships a. Government Programs The Federal Pell Grant is the result of the Higher Education Amendments of 1972. This grant represents the foundation, or base program, of all federal financial aid for undergraduate students, and is combined with other aid resources to meet need. The Pell Grant was created to assist lower income families. The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) is a need-based grant program developed to assist low income families. Grants consist of a combination of federal and College funds. The Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant program provides grants of up to $4,000 per year to students who intend to teach in a high need subject area in a public or private elementary or secondary school that serves students from low- income families. This grant reverts to an Unsubsidized Stafford loan if the student does not complete the teaching requirement within 8 years of graduation/program completion. The Ohio College Opportunity Grant (OCOG) is a state program providing grants to eligible Ohio residents enrolled as undergraduate students.

Students are eligible for up to two non-need-based Marietta College awards which may not exceed the cost of tuition. Marietta College is committed to partnering with students and their families to make a Marietta College education affordable. Marietta College Grants represent our institutional commitment to afford - ability and consist of College funds awarded on the basis of need to students enrolled full time at the College. Determination of need is made using information provided to the Office of Student Financial Services through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Funding for these grants considers all institutional gift aid sources. Marietta College Grants are funded in part through the generosity of alumni and friends of Marietta College. During the academic year or in subsequent years, you may find that your current Marietta College Grant may be fully or partially funded through a named scholarship. Students will receive funds in subsequent academic years if they con - tinue to demonstrate financial need, maintain satisfactory academic progress, and demonstrate good citizenship. Endowed and Gift Scholarships are awarded to students on the basis of financial need and restrictions set at the establishment of the fund. A listing of these endowed and gift scholarships appears in the Endowment Resources section of this Catalog. Generally, Endowed and Gift Scholarships are awarded to Marietta College students of at least sophomore standing. The Yellow Ribbon GI Educational Enhancement Program (Yellow Ribbon Program) is a provision of the Post-9/11 Veterans Education Assistance Act of 2008. Qualifying eligible veterans, their dependents, or spouse may receive 100% of Marietta College tuition and fees assistance through receipt of a combination of Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Benefits, the VA Yellow-Ribbon Program, and Marietta College's Yellow Ribbon Award Program. This tuition and fees benefit program includes both undergraduate full and part-time enrollment. Only individuals entitled to the maximum benefit rate (based on ser - vice requirements) may receive this funding. Determination of a vet - eran's eligibility is made by the VA and the veteran must file an online application with the VA (www.gibill.va.gov). Beyond the GI Bill or other VA educational benefits, most student veterans may be eligible for financial aid such as federal or state grants and Federal Direct student loans. Student veterans may also be eligible to receive a Marietta College scholarship or merit award, as determined through the admission process. However, VA benefits supersede 2013-2014 COLLEGE CATALOG 147 Undergraduate Tuition, Fees, and Financial AidMarietta aid consideration. When a veteran receives 100% in tuition benefits through the GI Bill or other VA education benefits they will not receive additional Marietta College financial aid or scholarships above the cost of tuition and fees. Submitting the FAFSA and determining financial aid eligibility can assist in helping veterans pay for college once their GI bill or other VA education benefits have been considered. 2. Loans a. Government Programs The Federal Perkins Loan provides need-based loans to students. Each loan consists of a combination of federal and College funds. No interest is charged or repayment of principal required until nine months after the recipient ceases to be enrolled at least half-time as an undergradu - ate or graduate student. No interest or payment is required while in military service, the Peace Corps, or VISTA, for up to three years. Thereafter, five percent simple interest is charged and regular monthly payments of not less than $40 are required. The law provides for cancellation of the loan under certain condi - tions for those who teach, are in active military service, or serve as law enforcement officers, and provides for deferments in certain circum - stances. Federal Stafford Loans are available to students through Marietta College's Direct Loan Program. An origination fee and guarantee premium are charged by the lender at the time each loan is made. Repayment of Stafford Loans begins six months after the student ceases to be enrolled at least half-time. Thereafter, simple interest is charged and regular monthly payments of not less than $50 are required. Federal Stafford Loans are available in both subsidized and unsub - sidized versions. Interest subsidies by the government are limited to loans used to meet need as demonstrated through the federal method - ology. Unsubsidized loan funds are available to students without need, but require the student to pay interest charged while enrolled and dur - ing the six-month grace period. b. Marietta College Programs PPG Industries Foundation Loans were established in 1982 to provide low interest loans to needy and worthy students. N. G. Franklin White Loan Fund provides loans to students meeting certain conditions. First preference is given to applicants from Morgan County in Ohio, then to applicants from adjacent counties. Students who plan to teach receive some preference. Need and worthiness are prerequisites in all cases. Interested students should consult with the Office of Student Financial Services. The loan was established in 1970 from the estate of the late Dr. White, a noted entomologist and native of Morgan County. The Charles E. Schell Loan Fund was established as a result of gifts provided by the Charles E. Schell Foundation. Loans are available to students from Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, or adjoining states, who display unmistakable loyalty to the United States and its institutions. Recipients must be citizens of, and born in, the United States. The Educational Foundation of The Ohio Society of Certified Public Accountants funded a short-term loan fund in 1989. Loans up to $300, interest-free if repaid by the end of the semester, are available to students enrolled in classes within the Department of Business & Economics. Application should be made to the department secretary. 3. Student employment The Federal Work-Study Program (FWSP) provides work opportuni - ties to students demonstrating financial need. There are employment opportunities on campus and in local non-profit, community service agencies. The Student Employment Office , in cooperation with the Office of Student Financial Services, provides students with referrals to part- time jobs on the basis of individual needs, abilities, and time available for work. Application Process To apply for assistance through the federal financial aid programs, students must submit to the federal processor the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). In many states, including Ohio and Pennsylvania, this form also serves as the vehicle through which students apply for state assistance. The FAFSA is generally available in January online at www.fafsa.gov or from the Marietta College Office of Student Financial Services. To be considered for assistance, students must be citizens of the United States or Canada, and must be formally admitted to one of the College's degree programs. Renewal of Aid Eligibility for need-based assistance is determined, in part, by the results of an analysis of information provided the College through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or Renewal Free Application for Federal Student Aid (RFAFSA). Additional factors include satisfactory academic progress and good citizenship. Level of and eligibility for assistance can vary from year to year as a result of factors such as changes in family circumstances, availability of aid resources, and revisions in federal and state laws and regulations. To receive federal assistance, a student may not be in default on a National Defense/Direct Student Loan (NDSL), Perkins Loan, Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL), Stafford Loan, Supplemental Loan for Students (SLS), Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS), or any other federal loan program. Additionally, a student must not owe a refund on a Pell Grant, a Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG), a State Student Incentive Grant (SSIG), or any other Title IV Program at any college, university, or post-secondary institution. Each male student must also document compliance with Selective Service Administration regulations. Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress Federal and state regulations, and Marietta College policy, require students to make satisfactory progress toward completion of their degree in order to maintain eligibility for financial assistance. Progress will include a measurement of all course work attempted at Marietta College. Evidence of progress includes grades, work projects, and/or other factors that are measurable against a norm. The College assesses 148 MARIETTA COLLEGE Undergraduate Tuition, Fees, and Financial Aidthe student's academic progress at least once each year. 1. Satisfactory academic progress is a condition for receipt of all financial aid resources administered by the College. Awards to students subsequently determined to have not met the financial aid standards or who have been dismissed will be withdrawn. Questions about the financial aid stan - dards of satisfactory academic progress may be addressed to the Office of Student Financial Services. 2. The financial aid standards of satisfactory academic prog - ress apply to federal, Ohio, and Marietta College resources. Different standards might be required for funds provided by other state and private agencies and, where applicable, will be governed by those standards. 3. Satisfactory academic progress is reviewed at the completion of each semester, with decisions on eligibility for continued assistance made at the completion of each academic year. Academic year is defined as two semesters of enrollment. A completed academic year would have occurred when hours were attempted in any two semesters. A student may have earned hours in the fall and not attend again until the fall of the next year. An academic year in this case would have occurred at the end of the second fall semester. 4. Students will be offered only one opportunity to appeal a loss of financial aid. Appeals by those denied aid because of failure to meet these standards should be directed to the Associate Director of Student Financial Services for consideration by the Financial Aid Committee on Academic Progress. Members of the committee include the Director and Associate Director of Student Financial Services, and a member of the Student Life staff. The Associate Director of Student Financial Services convenes the committee. Marietta's financial aid standards of satisfactory academic progress required for retention of eligibility for financial aid involve qualita - tive and quantitative measures. The qualitative measure examines the quality of the student's academic performance as measured by grade point average. The quantitative measure examines the student's progress towards completion of the number of credit hours required to receive a degree. Note that the financial aid standards are not the same as those applied by the Academic Standing Committee to determine whether a stu - dent is in good academic standing. The financial aid standards are minimum requirements a student must meet to retain financial aid eligibility, provided the Academic Standing Committee and Provost determine that the student is academically eligible to enroll at the institution. A student may be ineligible to receive aid through failure to meet the financial aid standards, or may have met the financial aid standards but be ineligible to enroll at the College. Qualitative Measure The qualitative measure of academic progress consists of two parts. The first measures the cumulative GPA required for credit hours earned; the second measures the cumulative GPA required after two academic years. Students must have achieved the stipulated cumula - tive grade point average for the credit hours specified. The measure of the qualitative component of satisfactory academic progress is graduated, taking into account varying levels of enrollment. Credit Hours Earned Required Cumulative GPA 0 to 24 hrs 1.6 25 to 58 hrs 1.8 59 hrs and higher 2.0 In addition, a student must have achieved a 2.0 GPA at the end of two academic years regardless of how many hours enrolled for each semester. Quantitative Measure The quantitative measure of academic progress also consists of two parts. The total hours attempted may be no greater than 150% of total hours required for the degree program in which the student is enrolled. When progress is checked, a student must earn at least 67% of the credit hours attempted. Below is the maximum attempted hours that will be allowed for any particular degree program: Degree Credit Hours Required for DegreeHours Attempted Associate of Arts 61 91 Bachelor of Arts 120 180 B.A. Public Accounting150 225 Bachelor of Fine Arts120 180 Bachelor of Music 120 180 Bachelor of Science 120 180 B.S. in Athletic Training137 205 B.S. in Petroleum Engineering133 200 A student will be granted an allowance for one change of major or sec - ond degree. A student who changes his or her major will be allowed a maximum number of attempted credit hours equal to the credit hours attempted at the point of making the major change or starting the sec - ond degree plus the maximum allowable attempted hours for the new major. When progress is checked, a student must still earn at least 67% of the total credit hours attempted. For a student pursuing a double major, the maximum credit hours attempted will be 150% of the total of the general education require - ments plus the courses required for the two majors. Incompletes, Course Repetitions, Withdrawals, and Non-credit Remedial Courses In each of the above situations, courses will count towards the credit hours attempted when measuring both the quantitative and qualitative component of academic progress. If a student has lost eligibility for financial aid because of failure to make satisfactory academic progress, all incompletes must be resolved prior to determining renewed eligibility for aid. 2013-2014 COLLEGE CATALOG 149 Undergraduate Tuition, Fees, and Financial AidFresh Start Students readmitted to Marietta College under the Fresh Start program will automatically be granted a probationary semester of financial aid. Students making satisfactory academic progress during that probation - ary semester will continue to have eligibility for financial aid as long as they continue to meet qualitative and quantitative requirements on a cumulative basis from the point of readmission. However, they are eligible to receive financial aid for no more than 150% of the total hours required for the degree program in which the student is enrolled including hours attempted prior to entering the Fresh Start program. Students who fail to make satisfactory progress in their probationary semester or any semester thereafter will lose aid eligibility and be treat - ed as any other student who has already had a probationary semester of financial and their entire Marietta College record will be considered in determining when aid can be reinstated. Transfer Students To determine the satisfactory progress of a student transferring to Marietta, evaluation of the quantitative and qualitative measures for the terms completed will be based on the point of the student's entry into the College. For example, a student transferring into the College with 30 credit hours of prior course work will be measured against the standards for those who have completed 30 credit hours at the College. Specific Appeal Procedures A student who has been denied financial aid because of failure to maintain satisfactory academic progress may make a one-time appeal to the Financial Aid Committee on Academic Progress. The appeal must be in writing, either in the form of a letter, a fax or e-mail. It should be sent to the Associate Director of Student Financial Services and must be received by the date directed in the letter the student will receive notifying of loss of financial aid. The appeal letter should show that the student recognizes the cause of prior academic difficulties and has identified remedies that will ensure future academic success. Each appeal will be considered on an individual basis. Special attention will be given to students deemed to be educationally disadvantaged under \"special circumstances\". When the Committee has made its decision, the student will be notified in writing. If the appeal is granted, the student will be on probation for one semester and must complete the requirements stated in the response letter to continue receiving aid past the probationary semester. A student may choose not to immediately appeal the withdrawal of aid and instead decide to withdraw from school for a semester. At the end of that semester, the student may make an appeal to the Financial Aid Committee on Academic Progress for reinstatement of aid for the subsequent semester. The appeal must be in writing, either in the form of a letter, a fax or e-mail. It should be sent to the Associate Director of Student Financial Services and must be received no earlier than the midpoint of the semester the student has withdrawn and no later than one month prior to the beginning of the semester in which he or she wishes to return. The letter should state what the student has done to prepare him or herself to succeed if aid is reinstated. When the Committee has made its decision, the student will be notified in writ - ing. If the appeal is granted, the student will be on probation for one semester and must complete the requirements stated in the response letter to continue receiving aid past the probationary semester. Students who have lost financial aid and have been denied an appeal may choose to continue taking classes at Marietta College while fund - ing their education from non-financial aid resources. (It is important to note that the only way to raise the Marietta College GPA is to take class - es at Marietta College. Credits transfer from other schools but grades taken at other schools do not affect the Marietta College GPA.) If, after one semester, a student thinks he or she is making significant progress towards meeting the satisfactory academic progress requirements but has not achieved the standard that would automatically qualify for reinstatement of financial aid, he or she may make a one time appeal to the Financial Aid Committee on Academic Progress for reinstatement of aid for the subsequent semester. The appeal must be in writing, either in the form of a letter, a fax or e-mail. It should be sent to the Associate Director of Student Financial Services and must be received no later than one month prior to the beginning of the semester in which they wish to have their aid reinstated. When the Committee has made its decision, the Associate Director will notify the student in writing. If the appeal is granted, the student will be on probation for one semester and must complete the requirements stated in the response letter to continue receiving aid past the probationary semester. If a student is granted a probationary semester and withdraws from the college after the first two weeks of that semester, that semester will be considered the probationary semester and the grade point average recorded at the end of the semester will be the official grade point aver - age for consideration of continuation of financial aid. In all cases, if an appeal has been granted and the student does not com - plete the requirements set by the Committee, financial aid will be lost until the qualitative and quantitative standards for their enrollment status have been met. However, at the discretion and initiative of the Director of Student Financial Services, one additional probationary semester may be granted under two situations. One additional probationary semester may be granted if the student does not meet the required semester GPA but does earn a GPA which is 2.0 or above. However, at the end of this additional probationary semester, the student must have earned a 2.0 cumulative GPA or their financial aid eligibility will be revoked until they have met the qualitative and quantitative standards for their enrollment status. The other situation is when, having been granted a probationary semester based on an appeal, a student brings their cumulative GPA to a 2.0 or above and then later loses financial aid eli - gibility because of subsequent failure to maintain satisfactory academic standards. Normally, the student would be ineligible for financial aid until the cumulative GPA returned to at least 2.0. However, if after losing eligibility for a second time, the student earns a semester GPA that is exceptional, the Director of Student Financial Services may elect to grant the student one additional probationary semester. However, at the end of this additional probationary semester, the student must have earned a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or their financial aid eligibility will be revoked until they have met the qualitative and quantitative standards for their enrollment status. Any time the student meets the qualitative and quantitative standards for their enrollment status, financial aid eligibility is automatically reinstated. 150 MARIETTA COLLEGE Undergraduate Tuition, Fees, and Financial AidWithdrawal, Refunds, and Your Financial Aid A student who withdraws from the College during a semester might be eligible for a partial refund. The refund is determined according to the policy outlined earlier in this Catalog. If the College grants a refund, some of the financial aid might be returned to the provider. It is possible to lose all of the financial aid offered for that semester. If the financial aid package includes federal financial aid, the College will follow the federal refund policy for fed - eral funds. The Marietta College refund policy will be followed for all non-federal funds. The student may be responsible to repay to the aid provider the difference between what has been earned in financial aid (based on length of enrollment in the semester of withdrawal) and what the school has returned to the provider. According to federal regula - tion, the amount of federal aid earned is equal to the percentage of the payment term completed. If the day of withdrawal occurs on or before 60% of the semester is completed, the percentage earned equals the per - centage of the semester completed. If the withdrawal date is after the 60% point, the student has earned 100% of federal money. If the reduc - tion in charges exceeds the amount of financial aid to be returned to the financial aid programs and there is no resulting unpaid balance on your student account, the excess funds will be returned to the student. Refunds to the following financial aid program accounts will be calcu - lated according to published federal and state regulations. Repayments are credited to accounts in the following order:1. Unsubsidized Stafford loans, 2. Subsidized Stafford loans, 3. Unsubsidized Direct loans, 4. Subsidized Direct loans, 5. Federal Perkins loans, 6. Federal PLUS loans, 7. Pell Grants, 8. ACG and SMART Grants 9. Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, 10. Other Federal Title IV aid (excluding work-study), and 11. Other programs as required by the program. A sample calculation may be obtained by contacting the Office of Student Financial Services. State Grant Refund The percentage of Ohio's state grants and scholarships that the student is entitled to retain toward payment of tuition charges is the same as the percentage of the adjusted tuition charged to the student. The remainder is refunded to the state. Refunds to programs of other states will be made in accordance with the regulations of those programs. Marietta College Refund The amount refunded to Marietta College's financial aid funds is the same as the percentage of the reduction in tuition, room and board. 2013-2014 COLLEGE CATALOG 151 Graduate Programs - Continuing Education ProgramGraduate Programs Marietta College offers two programs leading to a master degree: Master of Arts in Psychology (M.A.P.) Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies (M.S.P.A.S.) Information on the Graduate Programs can be obtained either from the separate Graduate Programs Catalog or the program director listed above. Continuing Education Program Registrar: Tina Perdue (ce@marietta.edu) The College believes that education should be a life-long venture and so for over half a century, Marietta College has provided a Continuing Education Program to area citizens that makes available a variety of programs at the certificate, associate degree, bachelor degree and master degree level. Information on the master degrees offered are described in the Graduate Programs Catalog. Undergraduate courses are open to Continuing Education students of 24 years of age or more, attending part-time, and who possess at least a high school diploma or equivalent. Bachelor Degrees Students may complete the requirements for any of the majors or minors offered by the College by attending day and evening classes. In addition, Continuing Education students may pursue a General Studies major described below. The graduation requirements for a bachelor degree awarded through the Continuing Education Program are the same as those listed elsewhere in the Graduation Requirements section of the Catalog. The General Studies major is open only to Continuing Education students. The requirements for this major are twenty four (24) credit hours in one department (for this purpose, accounting, economics, finance, management and sports management are considered one department), and twenty four (24) credit hours drawn from two addi - tional departments. The second set of 24 hours must have at least nine hours from each department. Associate Degrees The associate degree option is open only to Continuing Education students. The degrees available are the Associate of Arts Degree in Business Administration and the Associate of Arts Degree in Liberal Arts. Both degrees require 61 credit hours of course work. Credits for courses numbered below 100 do not count toward the minimum credits required for the degree. All courses taken for the associate degrees may be applied to a bachelor degree at the College. At least 15 of the last 18 credit hours for either of the degrees must be completed at Marietta College. The course requirements for the associate degrees are: Associate of Arts Degree in Business Administration General Requirements 25 Hours WRIT 101 COMM 101 Fine Arts Diversity and Global Perspectives Historical Perspectives Scientific Inquiry with lab Literary Analysis Leadership and Ethics Required concentration courses 9 Hours ECON 211 ECON 212 ACCT 201 Electives in Business & Economics 18 Hours Course 1 Course 2 Course 3 Course 4 Course 5 Course 6 General Electives: Any department 9 Hours Course 1 Course 2 Course 3 Total Hours Required 61 Hours Associate of Arts Degree in Liberal Arts General Requirements 28 Hours WRIT 101 COMM 101 Fine Arts Diversity and Global Perspectives Historical Perspectives Social Analysis Scientific Inquiry with lab Literary Analysis Leadership and Ethics Area of concentration* 24 Hours First area 12 Hours Course 1 Course 2 Course 3 Course 4 Second area 6 Hours Course 1 Course 2 Third area 6 Hours Course 1 Course 2 General Electives: Any department 9 Hours Course 1 Course 2 Course 3 Total Hours Required 61 Hours * Areas of concentration refer to areas of study within a department, e.g. psychology, business & economics, or history.

All general education and major requirements must be fulfilled. Admission to the Continuing Education Program Eligibility Continuing Education courses are open to any person at least 24 years of age who holds at least a high school diploma or its equivalent. Application Formal application is not required of Continuing Education students until after they have completed 12 credit hours at Marietta College. However, Continuing Education students who wish to apply for finan - cial aid must complete a Continuing Education application and meet the admission requirements of the College. Transfer of Credit Marietta College welcomes students transferring course work from other colleges and universities. Most Continuing Education students include some transfer work as part of their degree program. Credit hours transferred in from an institution following a \"quarter\" or a \"unit\" program will be pro-rated to \"semester\" hours. Details can be obtained from the Records Office. Any transferring student should be aware of the College's Residency Requirement which stipulates that a minimum of 36 of the last 43 hours of course work must be completed at Marietta College in order to receive a Bachelor degree, and 15 of the last 18 hours of credit used in fulfillment of the requirements for the associate degree must be completed at Marietta College. Additionally, for the bachelor degrees eighteen hours in the major must be courses taken at Marietta College. Prospective students are encouraged to make an appointment with the Registrar to discuss questions about the Continuing Education Program. Students who are re-entering college may find it useful to have a review and evaluation of their previous course work. This may also be done as part of the preregistration interview process prior to each semester. Fees Tuition for Continuing Education courses at the undergraduate level is $380 per credit hour. The fee for auditing a course is $120 per credit hour. The College may provide a partial refund only when the student drops or withdraws from one or more courses during the first five weeks of classes to receive any partial refund. The date of drop or with - drawal determines the proportion of tuition and student fee refunded: During the first week of the semester, 100 percent; second week, 80 percent; third week, 70 percent; fourth week, 60 percent; fifth week, 50 percent. The College will offer no refund after the fifth week of classes. Continuing Education Policies Course Load The normal academic load for Continuing Education students is six credit hours, but a maximum of eleven credit hours is permitted. Auditing A student may elect to audit a course, with approval from the course instructor. If a student chooses to audit a course, he or she is not required to take any of the examinations or meet any of the other academic obligations of the course. No grade or credit is recorded; however, a record of the course audit is kept on the student's transcript in the Records Office. The fee for a Continuing Education student auditing a course is $120 per credit hour. Students who register to audit a course but stop attending may be administratively withdrawn from the course and assigned a grade of W (see Grading section) at the discretion of the registrar. Non-traditional study Courses listed in the Catalog that are not otherwise conveniently avail - able to Continuing Education students may be taken on a non-tradi - tional study basis. In most cases the delivery system, not the course content, is all that is changed. Individually designed independent study projects are also available. In each case, a learning contract is prepared by the student and instructor, which defines the time frame for the course, reading assignments, degree of contact between the instructor and student, and other expectations and methods of evaluation.

Marietta College has one of the oldest chapters of Phi Beta Kappa. Membership of Phi Beta Kappa is arguably one of the highest honors that can be awarded an undergraduate student. This section describes not only the various honor societies with chapters on the campus, but also the range of co-curricular activities from which a student can select. Honor Societies Phi Beta Kappa was founded in 1776 at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. It is the oldest national academic honor society in the United States. The Gamma of Ohio chapter at Marietta College was established in 1860; it was the third chapter in Ohio and the 16th in the nation. To be considered for election to membership, a student must be of good character and must have achieved a scholastic record of out - standing excellence in a broad program of studies, a significant part of which must lie within the area known as the liberal arts and sciences. Normally, students are elected during the spring semester of their senior year. In addition, the highest ranking eligible member of the junior class may be elected during the spring semester. Membership in Phi Beta Kappa is conferred as the result of an election by the local chapter. There is no list of precisely specified requirements which, if met, will result in automatic election to Phi Beta Kappa. The chapter does have certain minimum criteria for consideration for elec - tion which are given below. To aid in evaluating breadth of education, the Marietta chapter of Phi Beta Kappa groups academic areas, departments, and courses in the liberal arts and sciences into three broad categories. These categories, or groups, are similar to, but not identical with those used in the College Catalog to specify the General Education distribution require - ments for graduation from Marietta College. Group A: communication, art, English, literature, linguistics, modern languages, music, theatre. Group B: economics, political science, psychology, sociology, history, philosophy, religion. Group C: astronomy, biology, chemistry, environmental sci - ence, geology, mathematics, physics. The criteria for consideration for election to Phi Beta Kappa are as follows: 1. The student must take at least 60 hours of work in residence at Marietta College. 2. The student must achieve a grade point average sufficient for graduation with honors (3.5 or better) and must gradu - ate in the upper tenth of the class. 3. Because election to Phi Beta Kappa emphasizes breadth and depth of scholarship, the student's record must display evi - dence of both.The student must display breadth of education by completing, in addi - tion to Writing 101 and Communication 101, at least fifteen credit hours of course work in each of groups A and B and fourteen credit hours in group C. Courses from at least three departments or areas in each group must be included, and not more than six credit hours (or eight in the case of laboratory courses) from a single department may be counted. Advanced courses in areas outside the student's major group are encouraged. No course for which the grade is below C may be count - ed. Mathematics 113, Art 245 and Music 303 are also not counted. Courses that are not included among the offerings of the departments listed in groups A, B, and C, such as Leadership, Honors and Gender Studies courses also may be eligible for consideration by the chapter under the intent of criterion 3. Any such course will be evaluated individually. The chapter will determine whether the course qualifies as liberal arts or sciences and, if so, the appropriate group in which to place it. The chapter reserves the right to elect students who do not quite meet every aspect of criterion 3, but whose records clearly display evidence of breadth and depth consistent with the intent of the criterion. Students desiring additional information should contact one of the officers of the Marietta College chapter. (Chapter President: Dr. Kathryn N.
