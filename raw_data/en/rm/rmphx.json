Use of exogenous estrogen is contraindicated in women with a known or suspected history of breast cancer. INTRAROSA has not been studied in women with a history of breast cancer. ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In four (4) placebo-controlled, 12-week clinical trials [91% - White Caucasian non-Hispanic women, 7% - Black or African American women, and 2% - \"Other\" women, average age 58.8 years of age (range 40 to 80 years of age)], vaginal discharge is the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reaction in the INTRAROSA treatment group with an incidence of 2 percent and greater than reported in the placebo treatment group. There were 38 cases in 665 participating postmenopausal women (5.71 percent) in the INTRAROSA treatment group compared to 17 cases in 464 participating postmenopausal women (3.66 percent) in the placebo treatment group. In a 52-week non-comparative clinical trial [92% - White Caucasian non-Hispanic women, 6% - Black or African American women, and 2% - \"Other\" women, average age 57.9 years of age (range 43 to 75 years of age)], vaginal discharge and abnormal Pap smear at 52 weeks were the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions in women receiving INTRAROSA with an incidence of 2 percent. There were 74 cases of vaginal discharge (14.2 percent) and 11 cases of abnormal Pap smear (2.1 percent) in 521 participating postmenopausal women. The eleven (11) cases of abnormal Pap smear at 52 weeks include one (1) case of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), and ten (10) 3.

As we celebrate the beginning of our 30th anniversary year, we recommit to our mission by providing the highest quality of health information through both print and electronic portals. OBG MANAGEMENT: Print and electronic portals for knowledge acquisition Experienced clinicians acquire new knowledge and refresh established concepts through discussions with trusted colleagues and by read- ing journals and books that contain information relevant to their practice. A continuing trend in professional development is the accelerating tran- sition from a reliance on print media (print journals and books) to elec- tronic information delivery. Many clinicians continue to enjoy reading medical journals and magazines. ObGyns are no diff erent; 96% report reading the print edition of medical journals.1 At OBG Management we are committed to continue to mail you a monthly copy of our journal. However, in the time-pressured setting of o ce- and hospital-based patient care, critical information is now frequently accessed through an electronic portal that is web based and focused on immediately answer- ing a high priority question necessary for optimal patient care. OBG Man- agement provides our community with rapid access to electronic ver- sions of the journal and all previously published editorial material. Many web exclusives are found online as well, including audio and video tech- niques and commentary. Th e OBG Management website has a powerfulsearch engine, which permits our readers to rapidly and conveniently access all previously published articles. In addition, our commu- nity members that have provided us with electronic contact information receive regular electronic commu- nications about recently published literature (Clinical Edge), highly read articles and topical alerts from the journal, and MD-IQ quizzes to help review recent research and guide- lines in an interactive medium. Th e information base needed to practice medicine is massive and con- tinues to grow rapidly. No single print textbook or journal can cover this vast information base. Libraries of print material are cumbersome to use and 30 years in service to you, our community of women's health clinicians It is all about your professional development and well-being, as well as your patients' health and well-being Robert L.

Electronic portals are the only means of providing immedi - ate access to all medical knowledge. Electronic technology enables the aggregation of vast amounts of infor - mation in a database that is rapidly accessible from anywhere, and new search technology is making it easier to quickly locate the information you need. The next frontier in medical information exchange is the appli - cation of artificial intelligence to cull \"answers\" from the vast aggre - gation of data. By combining all available medical information and artificial intelligence processes, in the near future, clinicians will be able to instantaneously get an answer to a question they have about how to care for a specific patient. A decade ago, when a question was entered into an Internet search engine, the response was typically a list of potential websites where the answer might be located. In the past few years, with the integration of huge databases and artificial intelligence, some advanced search engines now provide a specific answer to a ques - tion, followed by a list of relevant websites. For example, if you enter this question: \"What countries have the greatest number of people?\" into the Google search tool, in less than 1 second a direct answer is provided: \"China has the world's largest popu - lation (1.4 billion), followed by India (1.3 billion). The next most populous nations\u2014the United States, Indone - sia, Brazil and Pakistan\u2014combined have less than 1 billion people. \" The next step in medical information communication will be the deploy - ment of artificial intelligence systems that can directly answer a query from a clinician about a specific patient.

The guidance we receive from our Board and the expert editorial material generated by our authors is critical to advanc - ing the quality of OBG Manage- ment. Our Board members and authors care deeply about improv - ing women's health and closing gaps between current and optimal practice. Our Board members and authors are truly expert clinicians with vast experience. Our readers can have great confidence in their recommendations. Improving clinician wellness and resilience and reducing burnout Clinicians throughout the world are reporting decreased levels of pro - fessional fulfillment and increased levels of burnout.2-4 This epidemic is likely caused by many factors, including the deployment of poorly designed electronic health systems, the administrative guidance for cli - nicians to work faster with fewer sup- port staff, increasing administrative and secretarial burden on clinicians, and institutional constraints on cli - nician autonomy. Many of these problems only can be addressed at the level of the health system, but some are in the control of individual clinicians. In the upcoming years, OBG Management will prioritize deep - ening the knowledge about the fac- tors that support clinician wellness and share approaches that may help you to improve your wellness and resilience and reduce your experi - ence of burnout. Recent research reports that increasing your focus on showing gratitude to other important people in your life will enhance your wellness. In a study completed in a health care setting, 102 clinicians were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: 1) write about gratitude and work, 2) write about hassles and work, or 3) do not write about work. Those assigned to the 2 writing groups were instructed to write on their topic twice weekly for 4 weeks. At the end of the study the clinicians assigned to the gratitude writing assignment reported less stress and fewer depressive symptoms than the clinicians assigned to the other 2 groups.5 The investigators con- cluded that among clinicians a struc- tured exercise to focus thoughts and feelings on expressions of gratitude is an effective approach to reduce stress and depressive symptoms. I recommend that you complete \"the gratitude exercise\" (see box on this page). The future of obstetrics and gynecology is bright Medical students are electing to pur- sue a career in obstetrics and gynecol- ogy in record numbers. The students entering the field and the residents currently in training are superbly pre - pared and have demonstrated their commitment to advancing repro - ductive health by experiences in advocacy, research, and community service. We need to ensure that these super-star young physicians are able to have a 40-year career that is pro - ductive and fulfilling. l RBARBIERI@FRONTLINEMEDCOM.COM Dr. Barbieri reports no financial rela- tionships relevant to this article.

Try the gratitude exercise outlined below. To prepare for the exercise you will need about 15 minutes of uninterrupted time, a quiet room, and a method for recording your thoughts (pen/paper, elec- tronic word processor, voice recorder). Sit quietly and close your eyes. Spend 5 minutes thinking about the people in your life whose contributions have had the greatest positive impact on your devel- opment. Think deeply about the importance of their role in your life. Select one of those important people. Open your eyes and spend 10 minutes expressing in writing your thoughts and feelings about that person. Once you have completed expressing yourself in writing, commit to reading your words, verbatim, to the person within the follow- ing 48 hours. This could be done by voice communication, video conferencing, or in-person.

COMMENT & CONTROVERSY COMMENT & CONTROVERSY mdedge.com/obgmanagement 10 OBG Management | January 2018 | Vol. 30 No. 1 FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF LABOR, PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE ROBERT L. BARBIERI, MD (EDITORIAL; AUGUST 2017) Questions value of ACOG/ SMFM guidelines The labor management guidelines recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gyne- cologists (ACOG) and the Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) are terrible. Now retired, I trained in 1959-1963. In my career as an obste- trician, my primary cesarean delivery rate was 10% or less, and part of that was external pressure from people who did not know how to deliver a baby. Persistent occiput posterior position is a problem of inadequate flexion of the head, often due to inef- fective contractions earlier. In such a situation, \"pit\" early! Rotate the head if you must, and teach residents how, please. The guidelines do not discuss the exhausted mother who goes home after a long labor or hours of pushing. I have interviewed new obstetricians in my community as early as 1980 who did not know what deep transverse arrest was. There, I am done voicing my disgust with obstetrics as it is practiced today. James Honig, MD Merritt Island, Florida Managing difficult labor scenarios I concur with Dr. Barbieri's views on labor management that watchful waiting and giving the patient ade- quate time to progress naturally is the key to increase the chances of vaginal delivery. After all, labor is a physi- ologic process and should progress naturally. Having said that, I would like to know Dr. Barbieri's views on handling certain circumstances in which patients these days land in the labor room, including 1) postdated pregnancy with reduced fetal move- ments and not in labor; 2) full-term/ postterm pregnancy with free-floating head and poor Bishop score; 3) full- term pregnancy with niggling pains for more than 1 week; and many such conditions that place you in the dilemma of whether to induce, know- ing that chances of failure are high. Manju Hotchandani, MD New Delhi, India Midwives always use patience to guide labor As a Certified Nurse-Midwife since 1985 (now retired), \"patience\" in managing labor has always been my guide, as it has been for my midwifery colleagues. This is another exam- ple of ACOG finally acknowledging the truths we women have always known, without crediting the wis- dom of midwives over the centuries. Lamaze International's 6 Healthy Birth Practices also must have been their guide. \"Evolving concepts of normal labor progress, \" as though this was new information, would be humorous if it were not so frustrating! Marsha Kelly, CNM Charlotte, North CarolinaDr. Barbieri responds The readers of OBG ManageMent have vast clinical experience, and we can all learn from their insights and guidance. On behalf of all our readers, I thank Drs. Honig and Hotchandani and Ms. Kelly for taking the time to share their expert advice. Every clinician involved in the birth process is deeply committed to a safe delivery for both mother and baby. Clinicians guide the birth pro- cess based on the unique charac- teristics and needs of each woman. Dr. Honig advocates for the active management of the labor process, while Ms. Kelly advocates for less intervention. Both approaches to labor management may be optimal depending on the unique clinical needs of each woman. Dr. Hotchan- dani inquires about managing com- mon obstetric presentations. In my practice, induction is recommended for all women postterm who report consistently reduced fetal movement with the goal of reducing the risk of sudden intrauterine fetal demise. For healthy women at term with painful contractions and reassuring fetal sta- tus, but no cervical change, we sup- port and counsel the patient and offer therapeutic rest with morphine. For women at term with a floating head and poor Bishop score, we would not intervene, until 41 weeks' gestation when we would initiate gentle cervi- cal ripening with mechanical or phar- macologic treatment.

A maternal-fetal medicine physician tackles 3 high-priority obstetric topics: managing opioid use disorders in pregnant women, protocols for postpartum hemorrhage, and new carrier screening recommendations The past year brought new information and guidance from the American Col - lege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) on many relevant obstetric topics, making it difficult to choose just a few for this Update. Opioid use in pregnancy was an obvi - ous choice given the national media attention and the potential opportunity for interven - tion in pregnancy for both the mother and the fetus/newborn. Postpartum hemorrhage, an \"oldie but goodie, \" was chosen for several rea - sons: It got a new definition, a new focus on multidisciplinary care, and an exciting novel tool for the treatment toolbox. Finally, given the rapidly changing technology, new screen - ing recommendations, and the complexity of counseling, carrier screening was chosen as a genetic hot topic for this year. Opioids, obstetrics, and opportunities Reddy UM, Davis JM, Ren Z, Greene MF; Opioid Use in Pregnancy, Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, and Childhood Outcomes Workshop Invited Speakers. Opi- oid use in pregnancy, neonatal abstinence syndrome, and childhood outcomes: Executive summary of a joint workshop. Obstet Gynecol. 2017;130(1):10-28. ACOG Committee on Obstetric Practice. opinion No. 711: Opioid use and opioid use disorder in 2017;130(2):e81-e94. The term \"opioid epidemic\" is omni- present in both the lay media and the medical literature. In the past decade, the United States has had a huge increase in the number of opioid prescriptions, the rate of admissions and deaths due to prescription opioid misuse and abuse, and an increased rate of heroin use attributed to prior prescrip - tion opioid use. Obstetrics is unique in that opioid use and abuse disorders affect 2 patients simul - taneously (the mother and fetus), and the treatment options are somewhat at odds in that they need to balance a stable maternal status and intrauterine environment with the risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Additionally, pregnancy is an opportunity for a woman with opioid use disorder to have access to medical care (possibly for the first time) leading to the diagnosis and treatment of her disease. As the clinicians on the front line, obstetricians therefore require educa - tion and guidance on best practice for man- agement of opioid use in pregnancy. In 2017, Reddy and colleagues, as part of Update 0118.indd 11 12/21/17 2:13 PMUPDATE obstetrics mdedge.com/obgmanagement 12 OBG Management | January 2018 | Vol. 30 No. 1 Medication- assisted treatment prevents withdrawal symptoms and cravings, decreases relapse risk, improves compliance, and leads to better obstetric outcomesFAST TRACKa joint workshop on opioid use in pregnancy, and a committee opinion from ACOG provided the following recommendations. Screening Universally screen for substance use, start- ing at the first prenatal visit; this is recom- mended over risk factor-based screening. Use a validated screening tool. A tool such as a questionnaire is recommended as the first- line screening test (for example, the 4Ps screen, the National Institute on Drug Abuse Quick Screen, and the CRAFFT Screening Interview). Do not universally screen urine and hair for drugs. This type of screening has many limitations, such as the limited number of substances tested, false-positive results, and inaccurate determination of the frequency or timing of drug use. Information regarding the consequences of the test must be provided, and patient consent must be obtained prior to performing the test. Treatment Use medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine or methadone, which is pre - ferred to medically supervised withdrawal. Medication-assisted treatment prevents with - drawal symptoms and cravings, decreases the risk of relapse, improves compliance with pre - natal care and addiction treatment programs, and leads to better obstetric outcomes (higher birth weight, lower rate of preterm birth, lower perinatal mortality). Know that buprenorphine has several advantages over methadone, including the convenience of an outpatient prescription, a lower risk of overdose, and improved neo - natal outcomes (higher birth weight, lower doses of morphine to treat NAS, shorter treat - ment duration). Prioritize methadone as the preferred option for pregnant women who are already receiving methadone treatment (changing to buprenorphine may precipitate withdrawal), those with a long-standing his - tory of or multi-substance abuse, and those who have failed other treatment programs.Prenatal care Screen for comorbid conditions such as sexually transmitted infections, other medi - cations or substance use, social conditions, and mental health disorders. Perform ultrasonography serially to mon- itor fetal growth because of the increased risk of fetal growth restriction. Consult with anesthesiology for pain con- trol recommendations for labor and delivery and with neonatalogy/pediatrics for NAS counseling. Intrapartum/postpartum care Recognize heightened pain. Women with opioid use disorder have increased sensitiv - ity to painful stimuli. Continue the maintenance dose of meth- adone or buprenorphine throughout hospi- talization, with short-acting opioids added for a brief period for postoperative pain. Prioritize regional anesthesia for pain control in labor or for cesarean delivery. Consider alternative therapies such as regional blocks, nonopioid medications (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen), may cause acute withdrawal. Encourage breastfeeding to decrease the severity of NAS and maternal stress and increase maternal-child bonding and mater - nal confidence. Offer contraceptive counseling and ser- vices immediately postpartum in the hospi- tal, with strong consideration for long-acting reversible contraception. Opioid prescribing practices Opioids are prescribed in excess post- cesarean delivery. Several recent studies have demonstrated that most women are prescribed opioids post-cesarean delivery in excess of the amount they use (median 30-40 tablets prescribed, median 20 tab - lets used).1,2 The leftover opioid medication Update 0118.indd 12 12/21/17 2:13 PMmdedge.com/obgmanagement Vol. 30 No. 1 | January 2018 | OBG Management 13ACOG's new PPH definition reflects a shift in focus from simply responding to a certain amount of bleeding to using a multidisciplinary action plan for treatmentFAST TRACKusually is not discarded and therefore is at risk for diversion or misuse. A small subset of patients will use all the opioids prescribed and feel as though they have not received enough medication. Prescribe post-cesarean delivery opi- oids more appropriately by considering individual inpatient opioid requirements or a shared decision-making model.3 Prioritize acetaminophen and ibuprofen during breastfeeding. In a recent editorial in OBG Management, Robert L. Barbieri, MD, recommended that whenever possible, acetaminophen and ibuprofen should be the first-line treatment for breastfeeding women, and narcotics that are metabolized by CYP2D6 should be avoided to reduce the risk to the newborn.4 WHAT THIS EVIDENCE MEANS FOR PRACTICE Universal screening for substance use should be performed in all pregnant women, and clinicians should offer medication-assisted treatment in conjunction with prenatal care and other supportive services as the standard therapy for opioid use disorder. More selective, patient-specific opioid prescribing practices should be applied in the obstetric population. Postpartum hemorrhage: New definitions and new strategies for stemming the flow ACOG Committee on Practice Bulletins\u2014Obstetrics. From the the new ACOG practice bulletin, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is redefined as \"cumulative blood loss greater than or equal to 1,000 mL or blood loss accompanied by signs or symptoms of hypovolemia within 24 hours after the birth process (includes intrapartum loss) regardless of route of deliv - ery. \" Although this does not seem to be a huge change from the traditional teaching of a 500-mL blood loss at vaginal delivery and a 1,000-mL loss at cesarean delivery, it reflects a shift in focus from simply responding to a certain amount of bleeding to using a multi - disciplinary action plan for treating this lead- ing cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Focus on developing a PPH action plan As part of the shift toward a multidisciplinary action plan for PPH, all obstetric team mem - bers should be aware of the following: For most postpartum women, by the time they begin to show signs of hemodynamic compromise, the amount of blood loss approaches 25% of their total blood vol- ume (1,500 mL). Lactic acidosis, systemic inflammation, and a consumptive coagu- lopathy result. Risk stratification prior to delivery, recog- nition and identification of the source of bleeding, and aggressive early resuscitation to prevent hypovolemia are paramount. Experience gleaned from trauma mas- sive transfusion protocols suggests that judicious transfusion of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets in a 1:1:1 ratio is appropriate for obstetric patients. Additionally, patients with low fibrinogen levels should be treated with cryoprecipitate. The use of fixed transfusion ratios and standardized protocols for recognition and management of PPH has been dem- onstrated to increase earlier intervention 13 12/21/17 2:13 PMUPDATE obstetrics mdedge.com/obgmanagement 14 OBG Management | January 2018 | Vol. 30 No. 1 Tranexamic acid was shown to reduce mortality from obstetric bleeding when given within 3 hours of deliveryFAST TRACKand resolution of hemorrhage at an ear- lier stage, although the maternal outcomes results have been mixed. Multidisciplinary team drills and simula- tion exercises also should be considered to help solidify training of an institution's teams responsible for PPH response. Novel management option: Tranexamic acid In addition to these strategies, there is a new recommendation for managing refractory PPH: tranexamic acid, which works by bind - ing to lysine receptors on plasminogen and plasmin, inhibiting plasmin-mediated fibrin degradation.5 Previously, tranexamic acid was known to be effective in trauma, heart surgery, and in patients with thrombophil - ias. Pacheco and colleagues recently dem- onstrated reduced mortality from obstetric bleeding if tranexamic acid was given within 3 hours of delivery, without increased throm - botic complications.5 ACOG recommends its use if initial medical therapy fails, while the World Health Organization strongly rec - ommends that tranexamic acid be part of a standard PPH package for all cases of PPH (TABLE).6 WHAT THIS EVIDENCE MEANS FOR PRACTICE Postpartum hemorrhage requires early, aggressive, and multidisciplinary coor- dination to ensure that 1) patients at risk for hemorrhage are identified for preven- tive measures; 2) existing hemorrhage is recognized and quickly treated, first with noninvasive methods and then with more definitive surgical treatments; and 3) blood product replacement follows an evidence- based standardized protocol. Tranexamic acid is recommended as an adjunct treat- ment for PPH (of any cause) and should be used within 3 hours of delivery. Carrier screening\u2014choose something ACOG Committee on Genetics.

Committee opinion No. Carrier screening for genetic conditions. Obstet Gy- necol. 2017;129(3):e41-e55. Ideally, carrier screening should be offered prior to pregnancy to fully inform couples of their reproductive risks and options for pregnancy. If not performed in the preconcep - tion period, carrier screening should be offered to all pregnant women. If a patient chooses screening and screens positive for a particular disorder, her reproductive partner should then be offered screening so that the risk of having an affected child can be determined. New ACOG guidance on prepregnancy and prenatal screening Carrier screening recommendations have evolved as the technology available has expanded. All 3 of the following strategies now are considered \"acceptable\" according to 2 recently published ACOG committee opinions.

One such example is Tay-Sachs disease screening in Ashkenazi Jewish patients. Panethnic screening, which takes into account mixed or uncertain backgrounds, involves screening for a certain panel of disorders and is available to all patients regardless of their background (for example, cystic fibrosis screening offered to all preg - nant patients). Expanded carrier screening is when a large number of disorders can be screened for simultaneously for a lower cost than pre - vious testing strategies. Expanded carrier screening panels vary in number and which conditions are tested by the laboratory. An ideal expanded carrier screening panel has been debated in the literature but not agreed on.7 ObGyns and practices therefore are encouraged to develop a standard counsel - ing and screening protocol to offer to all their patients while being flexible to make avail - able any patient-requested screening that is outside their protocol. Pretest and posttest counseling, including a thorough family his - tory, is essential (as with any genetic testing) and should include residual risk after testing, potential need for specific familial mutation testing instead of general carrier screening, and issues with consanguinity. Three essential screens Regardless of the screening strategy chosen from the above options, 3 screening tests should be offered to all pregnant women or couples considering pregnancy (either indi - vidually or in the context of an expanded screening panel): Cystic fibrosis. At the least, a panel of the 23 most common mutations should be used. More expanded panels, which include hundreds of mutations, increase detection in non-Caucasian populations and for milder forms of the disease or infer- tility-related mutations. Hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell, - and -thalassemia). Complete blood count and red blood indices are recom- mended for all, with hemoglobin elec- trophoresis recommended for patients of African, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, or West Indian descent or if mean corpuscular volume is low. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The most recent addition to ACOG's recom- mendations for general carrier screening due to the relatively high carrier frequency (1-in-40 to 1-in-60) and the severity of the disease, SMA causes degeneration of the spinal cord neurons, skeletal muscular atro- phy, and overall weakness. Screening is via polymerase chain reaction for SMN1 copy number: 2 copies are normal, and 1 copy indicates a carrier of the SMN1 deletion. About 3% to 4% of patients will screen nega- tive but still will be \"carriers\" due to having 2 copies of the SMN1 gene on 1 chromosome and no copies on the other chromosome. WHAT THIS EVIDENCE MEANS FOR PRACTICE All pregnant patients or patients considering pregnancy should be offered carrier screening as standard reproductive care, including screening for cystic fibrosis, hemoglobinopathies, and spinal mus- cular atrophy. Ethnic, panethnic, or expanded carrier screening (and patient-requested specific screening) all are acceptable options, and a standard screening and counseling protocol should be determined by the ObGyn or practice.

But how will ObGyns be impacted by the push to incentivize them for delivering value in their work? Although much of health care policy has become politically divisive lately, one area of agreement is that, in the United States, we have unsustainable health costs and the ex- orbitant amount our country pays for health care does not translate to improved out- comes. Th e United States spends more than most other developed nations on health care (roughly, $9,403 per capita in 2014) but has some of the lowest life expectancies, along with the highest maternal and infant mortal- ity rates, compared with peer nations.1-4 One of the key culprits in our health sys- tem's ineffi ciencies is the fee-for-service pay- ment model. Fee-for-service incentivizes the delivery of a high volume of care without any way to determine whether that care is achiev- ing the desired outcomes of improved health and quality of life. Not only does fee-for- service drive up the volume of care but it also rewards the delivery of high-cost services, regardless of whether those services provide what is best for the patient. During the previous administration, Sec- retary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Mathews Burwell set goals for moving away from fee-for-service in Medicare and in the health system more broadly. Congress also passed legislation that provides incentives for Medicare providers to transition away from fee-for-service with the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA). While fee-for-service remains the predomi- nant form of payment for many physicians, value-based payment arrangements are gaining a toehold. In 2014, 86% of physiciansVALUE-BASED MEDICINE: PART 1 Value-based payment: What does it mean, and how can ObGyns get out ahead? Paying for value seems to be all the rage in health care right now.

Those fees accounted for nearly 72% of revenue.5 This percentage likely will continue to decrease over the next few years as government and private payers seek to promote value-based payment systems. Assessing quality \"Value\" in the context of health care is often defined as quality or outcomes relative to costs.6 Before payers can reward value, there must be measurement of performance to de- termine the quality of care being delivered. Quality measures are tools to help quantify ac- cess to care, processes, outcomes, patient ex- perience, and organizational structure within the health care system. ObGyns likely encoun- ter process, outcome, and patient experience measures most frequently in their practice. Although outcome measures are gen- erally held as the gold standard for quality measurement, they are often hard to obtain\u2014 either because of issues of temporality and rarity of events or because the data are hard to capture through existing formats. In lieu of measuring outcomes, process measures are often used to determine whether certain services that are known to be tied to desired health outcomes were delivered. Patient ex- perience measures are also rising in popular- ity and are seen as a critical tool to ensuring that care that purports to be patient-centered actually is so. Measures are specified to different levels of accountability, ranging from the individual physician all the way to the population. Some measures also can be specified at multiple levels. One major concern is the problem of attribution\u2014that is, the difficulty of assign- ing who is primarily responsible for a specific quality metric result. Because obstetrics and gynecology is an increasingly team-based spe- cialty, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that measures that are used to reward or penalize providers should reflect performance at the care team or practice level, not at the indi- vidual physician or health care provider level.7 As consolidation of providers continues, it is expected that team-based care will increase and that the use of advanced practice provid- ers will increase.8 Data to determine performance can come from a variety of sources, including claims, electronic health records (EHRs), paper medical record abstraction, birth cer- tificates, registries, surveys, and separate reporting mechanisms. There are pros and cons of these various sources. Because ad- ministrative claims data are so easily obtain- able, many measures have been developed based on this data source, but there are sig- nificant limitations to assessments made with such data. These limitations include inherent problems with translating clini- cal diagnoses into specific codes and inad- equate documentation to support particular diagnoses and procedure codes.9 Claims data are limited by what physicians and other health care providers code for in their claims, making proper coding an essential skill for ObGyns to master. Although there has been an increase in measures that rely on clinical data found in EHRs and registries\u2014which are more robust and capture a wider breadth of indicators\u2014 claims-based measures still form the basis for many reporting programs because of stan- dardization and ease of access to data. Data quality will become increasingly more impor- tant in a value-based payment world because completeness, risk adjustment, and specific- ity will be determined by the data recorded. This need for data quality will require that im- provements be made in the user interface of EHRs and that providers pay specific attention to making sure their documentation is com- plete. New designs for EHRs should assist in that task, and data extraction should become a by-product of documentation.10 Paying for value In an attempt to move away from fee-for- service medicine, payers and employers are adopting alternative payment models (APMs) that are intended to reward physicians and other health care providers for delivering value. Although APMs can be a catchall term, the Health Care Payment Learning and Ac- tion Network (LAN), a multi-stakeholder Wieand 0118.indd 18 12/21/17 2:21 PMmdedge.com/obgmanagement Vol. 30 No. 1 | January 2018 | OBG Management 19FAST TRACK CONTINUED ON PAGE 25There are 4 categories of alternative payment models; ACOG supports those categories that move away from fee-for-service payments that lack any link to quality or outcomes collaborative convened by the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, has laid out a framework for the different types of APMs11 (FIGURE). This framework provides a com- mon reference point for concepts related to value-based care. Although ACOG does not endorse all the concepts and principles included in the LAN white paper, it does support moving away from fee-for-service payments that lack any link to quality or outcomes. Originally, the LAN envisioned that all physicians, pro- viders, and hospital systems would move in the direction of adopting Category 4 APMs, but in the recent \"refresh\" of the LAN's white paper, the authors recognized that not all en- tities will be able to move toward population- based payments\u2014nor will it be beneficial for all providers to do so. ACOG agrees that not all ObGyns will be able to thrive under FIGURE Alternative payment models: The APM Framework11 Wieand 0118.indd 19 12/21/17 2:21 PMAre your adult patients with iron de ciency anemia (IDA) getting what they need from oral iron therapy? INDICATIONS Injectafer\u00ae (ferric carboxymaltose injection) is an iron replacement product indicated for the treatment of iron de ciency anemia (IDA) in adult patients who have intolerance to oral iron or have had unsatisfactory response to oral iron, and in adult patients with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION CONTRAINDICATIONS Injectafer is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Injectafer or any of its inactive components. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic-type reactions, some of which have been life-threatening and fatal, have been reported in patients receiving Injectafer. Patients may present with shock, clinically signi cant hypotension, loss of consciousness, and/or collapse. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity during and after Injectafer administration for at least 30 minutes and until clinically stable following completion of the infusion. Only administer Injectafer when personnel and therapies are immediately available for the treatment of serious hypersensitivity reactions. In clinical trials, serious anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions were reported in 0.1% (2/1775) of subjects receiving Injectafer. Other serious or severe adverse reactions potentially associated with hypersensitivity which included, but were not limited to, pruritus, rash, urticaria, wheezing, or hypotension were reported in 1.5% (26/1775) of these subjects.In clinical studies, hypertension was reported in 3.8% (67/1775) of subjects. Transient elevations in systolic blood pressure, sometimes occurring with facial fl ushing, dizziness, or nausea were observed in 6% (106/1775) of subjects. These elevations generally occurred immediately after dosing and resolved within 30 minutes. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypertension following each Injectafer administration. In the 24 hours following administration of Injectafer, laboratory assays may overestimate serum iron and transferrin bound iron by also measuring the iron in Injectafer. ADVERSE REACTIONS In two randomized clinical studies, a total of 1775 patients were exposed to Injectafer, 15 mg/kg of body weight, up to a single maximum dose of 750 mg of iron on two occasions, separated by at least 7 days, up to a cumulative dose of 1500 mg of iron. Adverse reactions reported by 2% of Injectafer- treated patients were nausea (2.1%); and dizziness (2.0%). The following serious adverse reactions have been most commonly reported from the post-marketing spontaneous reports: urticaria, dyspnea, pruritus, back pain, arthralgia, and syncope.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: For patients weighing 50 kg (110 lb) or more: Give Injectafer in two doses separated by at least 7 days. Give each dose as 750 mg for a total cumulative dose not to exceed 1500 mg of iron per course. For patients weighing less than 50 kg (110 lb): Give Injectafer in two doses separated by at least 7 days. Give each dose as 15 mg/kg body weight for a total cumulative dose not to exceed 1500 mg of iron per course. The dosage of Injectafer is expressed in mg of elemental iron. Each mL of Injectafer contains 50 mg of elemental iron. Injectafer treatment may be repeated if iron deficiency anemia reoccurs. Administer Injectafer intravenously, either as an undiluted slow intravenous push or by infusion. When administering as a slow intravenous push, give at the rate of approximately 100 mg (2 mL) per minute. When administered via infusion, dilute up to 750 mg of iron in no more than 250 mL of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP , such that the concentration of the infusion is not less than 2 mg of iron per mL and administer over at least 15 minutes. When added to an infusion bag containing 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP , at concentrations ranging from 2 mg to 4 mg of iron per mL, Injectafer solution is physically and chemically stable for 72 hours when stored at room temperature. To maintain stability, do not dilute to concentrations less than 2 mg iron/mL. Inspect parenteral drug products visually for the absence of particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The product contains no preservatives. Each vial of Injectafer is intended for single-use only. Any unused drug remaining after injection must be discarded. Avoid extravasation of Injectafer since brown discoloration of the extravasation site may be long lasting. Monitor for extravasation. If extravasation occurs, discontinue the Injectafer administration at that site. DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS: 750 mg iron / 15 mL single-use vial CONTRAINDICATIONS: Hypersensitivity to Injectafer or any of its components. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic-type reactions, some of which have been life-threatening and fatal, have been reported in patients receiving Injectafer. Patients may present with shock, clinically significant hypotension, loss of consciousness, and/or collapse. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity during and after Injectafer administration for at least 30 minutes and until clinically stable following completion of the infusion. Only administer Injectafer when personnel and therapies are immediately available for the treatment of serious hypersensitivity reactions. In clinicaltrials, serious anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions were reported in 0.1% (2/1775) of subjects receiving Injectafer. Other serious or severe adverse reactions potentially associated with hypersensitivity which included, but not limited to, pruritus, rash, urticaria, wheezing, or hypotension were reported in 1.5% (26/1775) of these subjects. Hypertension: In clinical studies, hypertension was reported in 3.8% (67/1,775) of subjects in clinical trials 1 and 2. Transient elevations in systolic blood pressure, sometimes occurring with facial flushing, dizziness, or nausea were observed in 6% (106/1,775) of subjects in these two clinical trials. These elevations generally occurred immediately after dosing and resolved within 30 minutes. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypertension following each Injectafer administration. Laboratory Test Alterations: In the 24 hours following administration of Injectafer, laboratory assays may overestimate serum iron and transferrin bound iron by also measuring the iron in Injectafer. ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In two randomized clinical studies [Studies 1 and 2, See Clinical Studies ], a total of 1,775 patients were exposed to Injectafer 15 mg/kg body weight up to a maximum single dose of 750 mg of iron on two occasions separated by at least 7 days up to a cumulative dose of 1500 mg of iron. Adverse reactions reported by 1% of treated patients are shown in the following table. Table 1.

Transient decreases in laboratory blood phosphorus levels (<2 mg/dL) have been observed in 27% (440/1638) patients in clinical trials. Post-marketing Experience: Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following serious adverse reactions have been most commonly reported from the post-marketing spontaneous reports with Injectafer: urticaria, dyspnea, pruritus, arthralgia, and syncope. One case of hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was reported in a subject who received 500 mg of Injectafer every 2 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. Partial recovery followed discontinuation of Injectafer. DRUG INTERACTIONS: Formal drug interaction studies have not been performed with Injectafer. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. Risk Summary Adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women have not been conducted. However, animal reproduction studies have been conducted with ferric carboxymaltose. In these studies, administration of ferric carboxymaltose to rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused fetal malformations and increased implantation loss at maternally toxic doses of approximately 12% to 23% of the human weekly dose of 750 mg (based on body surface area). The incidence of major malformations in human pregnancies has not been established for Injectafer. However, all pregnancies, regardless of exposure to any drug, has a background rate of 2 to 4% for major malformations, and 15 to 20% for pregnancy loss. Injectafer should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal Data Administration of ferric carboxymaltose to rats as a one-hour intravenous infusion up to 30 mg/kg/day iron on gestation days 6 to 17 did not result in adverse embryofetal findings. This daily dose in rats is approximately 40% of the human weekly dose of 750 mg based on body surface area. In rabbits, ferric carboxymaltose was administered as a one-hour infusion on gestation days 6 to 19 at iron doses of 4.5, 9, 13.5, and 18 mg/kg/day. Malformations were seen starting at the daily dose of 9 mg/kg (23% of the human weekly dose of 750 mg). Spontaneous abortions occurred starting at the daily iron dose of 4.5 mg/kg (12% of the human weekly dose based on body surface area). Pre-implantation loss was at the highest dose. Adverse embryofetal effects were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity. A pre- and post-natal development study was conducted in rats at intravenous doses up to 18 mg/kg/day of iron (approximately 23% of the weekly human dose of 750 mg on a body surface area basis). There were no adverse effects on survival of offspring, their behavior, sexual maturation or reproductive parameters. Nursing Mothers: A study to determine iron concentrations in breast milk after administration of Injectafer (n=11) or oral ferrous sulfate (n=14) was conducted in 25 lactating women with postpartum iron deficiency anemia. Mean breast milkiron levels were higher in lactating women receiving Injectafer than in lactating women receiving oral ferrous sulfate. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. Geriatric Use: Of the 1775 subjects in clinical studies of Injectafer, 50% were 65 years and over, while 25% were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. OVERDOSAGE: Excessive dosages of Injectafer may lead to accumulation of iron in storage sites potentially leading to hemosiderosis. A patient who received Injectafer 18,000 mg over 6 months developed hemosiderosis with multiple joint disorder, walking disability and asthenia. Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was reported in a patient who received Injectafer 4000 mg over 4 months. Partial recovery followed discontinuation of Injectafer. DESCRIPTION: Ferric carboxymaltose, an iron replacement product, is an iron carbohydrate complex with the chemical name of polynuclear iron (III) hydroxide 4(R)-(poly-(1 4)- O--D-glucopyranosyl)-oxy-2(R),3(S),5(R),6-tetrahydroxy- hexanoate. It has a relative molecular weight of approximately 150,000 Da corresponding to the following empirical formula: [FeO x(OH) y(H2O)z]n[{(C 6H10O5)m(C6H12O7)}l]k, where n 103, m 8, l11, and k 4 (lrepresents the mean branching degree of the ligand). Injectafer (ferric carboxymaltose injection) is a dark brown, sterile, aqueous, isotonic colloidal solution for intravenous injection. Each mL contains 50 mg iron as ferric carboxymaltose in water for injection. Injectafer is available in 15 mL single- use vials. Sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid may have been added to adjust the pH to 5.0-7.0. Vial closure is not made with natural rubber latex. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action: Ferric carboxymaltose is a colloidal iron (III) hydroxide in complex with carboxymaltose, a carbohydrate polymer that releases iron. Pharmacodynamics: Using positron emission tomography (PET) it was demonstrated that red cell uptake of 59Fe and 52Fe from Injectafer ranged from 61% to 99%. In patients with iron deficiency, red cell uptake of radio-labeled iron ranged from 91% to 99% at 24 days after Injectafer dose. In patients with renal anemia red cell uptake of radio-labeled iron ranged from 61% to 84% after 24 days Injectafer dose. Pharmacokinetics: After administration of a single dose of Injectafer of 100 to 1000 mg of iron in iron deficient patients, maximum iron levels of 37 \u00b5g/mL to 333 \u00b5g/mL were obtained respectively after 15 minutes to 1.21 hours post dose. The volume of distribution was estimated to be 3 L. The iron injected or infused was rapidly cleared from the plasma, the terminal half-life ranged from 7 to 12 hours. Renal elimination of iron was negligible.NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenicity with ferric carboxymaltose. Ferric carboxymaltose was not genotoxic in the toxicology studies: in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) assay, in vitro chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, in vitro mammalian cell mutation assay in mouse lymphoma L5178Y/TK+/- cells, in vivo mouse micronucleus test at single intravenous doses up to 500 mg/kg. In a combined male and female fertility study, ferric carboxymaltose was administered intravenously over one hour to male and female rats at iron doses of up to 30 mg/kg. Animals were dosed 3 times per week (on Days 0, 3, and 7). There was no effect on mating function, fertility or early embryonic development. The dose of 30 mg/kg in animals is approximately 40% of the human dose of 750 mg based on body surface area. CLINICAL STUDIES: The safety and efficacy of Injectafer for treatment of iron deficiency anemia were evaluated in two randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2). In these two trials, Injectafer was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg body weight up to a maximum single dose of 750 mg of iron on two occasions separated by at least 7 days up to a cumulative dose of 1500 mg of iron. Trial 1: Iron Deficiency Anemia in Patients Who Are Intolerant to Oral Iron or Have Had Unsatisfactory Response to Oral Iron Trial 1 was a randomized, open-label, controlled clinical study in patients with iron deficiency anemia who had an unsatisfactory response to oral iron (Cohort 1) or who were intolerant to oral iron (Cohort 2) during the 14 day oral iron run-in period. Inclusion criteria prior to randomization included hemoglobin 1 subjects were randomized to Injectafer or oral iron for 14 more days. Cohort 2 subjects were randomized to Injectafer or another IV iron per standard of care [90% of subjects received iron sucrose]. The mean age of study patients was 43 years (range, 18 to 94); 94% were female; 42% were Caucasian, 32% were African American, 24% were Hispanic, and 2% were other races. The primary etiologies of iron deficiency anemia were heavy uterine bleeding (47%) and gastrointestinal disorders (17%).

ACOG has undertaken its first foray into value-based payments by developing an \"episode group\" related to benign hys- terectomy, with attendant quality measures. (An episode group is a collection of services associated with treating a condition or per- forming a procedure that are both clinically and temporally related.) The goal in creat- ing episode groups is to create alignment across payers so that ObGyns are not faced with multitudinous payer-specific metrics and reporting requirements. As the benign hysterectomy episode group is refined and adopted by payers, ACOG plans to expand to other treatments and, eventually, develop condition-based episode groups that incen- tivize the most appropriate treatment options for patients. Current forms of APMs are mostly Cat- egory 2 and 3 models. Rates of proper screen- ing for cervical and breast cancer have been used as performance metrics for bonus pay- ments. Major payers have pushed specific metrics as cutoffs for limiting narrow net- works.12 For example, Covered California, the state health care exchange, has set a nul- liparous term singleton vertex cesarean rate of 23.9% by 2018 as a necessary standard for inclusion of a hospital's entire services (ob- stetric and nonobstetric) in their network. Episode group payments for total obstetric care included in the episode routine services, such as ultrasonography, have been previ- ously utilized to discourage overutilization. Such payment incentives can lead to un- derutilization of resources, however, which might lead to poorer outcomes and therefore result in overall greater cost. For example, poor screening for fetal anomalies or poorly managed medical conditions such as diabe- tes can lead to markedly increased costs in neonatal management. Therefore, some au- thorities have proposed tying incentives for obstetric care to performance outcome mea- sures in neonatal care as a method of find- ing \"sweet spots\" for utilization of complex services and episode groups. Such models will depend on more robust clinical informa- tion sources and standardization.8 How can ObGyns succeed? So what does success look like under these value-based payments for ObGyns? This is new territory, in a rapidly changing envi- ronment in which providers who flourished under the fee-for-service system will only survive under the new system if they become knowledgeable about the nuances of the new payment methods. Providers should under- stand that success is going to be defined as reaching the \"Triple Aim\"13 of improving the health of the population, containing costs, and improving the experience of health care. Practice patient-centered care. One way to better position yourself is to focus on de- livering patient-centered care and improving customer service in your practice. By imple- menting patient satisfaction surveys, you can identify where you are most vulnerable. One option is to utilize the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Clini- cian and Group Survey, developed by the US Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality. However, there are other assessment tools available, and you should investigate what works best for your practice. Code properly. Another key to making sure you are in an optimal position is to properly document and code the services you deliver. Accurately capturing the clinical complexity of your patients will help down the road with risk adjustment and risk stratification for cost and quality measures. Many payment mod- els, including episode groups, are built on the fee-for-service system, so coding for services is still important in the transition to alterna- tive models. Modern EHRs are building new tools to assist clinician documentation, such as tools that aid coding. Carefully groomed and up-to-date problem lists can help pro- viders keep track of appropriate testing and screening by enabling decision support tools that are imbedded in the systems. Although upgrading can be expensive, especially for small group practices, the development of Wieand 0118.indd 25 12/21/17 2:21 PMmdedge.com/obgmanagement 26 OBG Management | January 2018 | Vol. 30 No. 1 FAST TRACKValue-based payment When reviewing payor contracts, understand the performance measures you are being held accountable for, how your patients may affect the measures, and whether the measures are within your control \"software as a service\" or cloud-based EHRs will likely drive individual costs down.10 One example of point-of-care decision support that ACOG is spearheading to sup- port our Fellows is the ACOG Prenatal Record (APR) by Dorsata.14 The APR is an application designed by ObGyns to work seamlessly with an existing EHR system to improve clinical workflow, save time, and help ObGyns sup- port high-quality prenatal outcomes. The APR uses the same simplicity, flexibility, and familiarity of the original paper-based flow- sheet, but in an electronic format to integrate ACOG guidance, which provides a more ro- bust solution. The APR uses information such as gestational age, pregnancy history, the problem list, and other risk factors to provide patient and visit-specific care plans based on ACOG clinical practice guidelines. It was designed to help reduce physician burden by creating an easy-to-navigate electronic flow- sheet that provides everything ObGyns need to know about each patient, succinctly cap- tured in a single view. ACOG also offers comprehensive coding workshops across the country and webinars on special coding topics to help Fellows learn to properly code their services. Availing your- self of these educational opportunities now so that you are better prepared to transition to value-based payment is a great way to en- sure success in the future. Chances are that some of your payers are already requiring you to report on metrics or tracking your performance using claims data. Pay attention to the performance mea- sures that you are being held accountable for by payers when you review your payer con- tracts. Make sure you understand how your patients may fall into and out of the measure numerators and denominators. Ask yourself whether these metrics are ones that you can reasonably influence and that are within your control. Of course, you can also reach out to ACOG for help. We are here to educate, in- form, and guide you on these changes and provide assistance to ensure your success. Send inquiries to: practicemanagement@ acog.org. References 1. The World Bank.

Lonky, MD, MPH In medicine, specifically gynecology, we are ac- customed to a \"screen, triage, and treat\" sec- ondary cancer prevention approach. The advent of the Pap smear, the subsequent discovery of the role of human papilloma virus (HPV) (and impor - tantly its often-treatable precursors) testing in as- sessing risk for cervical cancer, health care access improvements (due to the myriad of insurance vehicles), and acceptable therapies for precursors and cancer have led to a dramatic reduction in cer - vical cancer incidence and mortality in industri- alized countries.1 Begun in the mid-20th century, this progress continues today. HPV vaccine: A quantum leap in cancer prevention HPV vaccination as primary prevention is a major breakthrough. With vaccination, a viral precur - sor can be immunologically blocked from causing carcinogenesis for the most prevalent HPV strains. This reduces not only cancer but also precursors and benign condyloma, which drain the health care economy for access to diagnosis and therapy in what I call the \"revolving door of lower genital tract precursor emergence and regression. \" HPV vaccination has not reached a desired rate in the United States due to social mores and other barriers to acceptance that deserve attention in a separate article. Where does that leave us when women present with concerning symptoms or family history and want impactful care that could potentially save their life? We should refocus our mind-set from screening, triage, and treatment to risk assessment and reduction of cancer sequelae. More importantly, we must educate women that the efforts that work for one cancer do not work for another cancer. The conundrum of ovarian cancer detection The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' patient education page on ovarian cancer states that unlike the Pap test for cervical cancer and colonoscopy for colon cancer, there currently is no screening test to detect ovarian can - cer in asymptomatic women.2 Ideally, a screening test should be able to de- tect ovarian cancer in, preferably, an early treat- able stage. In fact, however, when average-risk women undergo screening\u2014such as with trans - vaginal ultrasonography or a cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) test\u2014many of those with abnormal re - sults may undergo unnecessary surgery and ex- perience resultant potential harm.3 The potential harm outweighs the preventive utility in average- risk women. This leaves the gynecologist to detect cancer at an early treatable stage or to tertiary prevention of mortality (not the cancer itself) from ovarian cancer. Beginning with clinical history and physical exami - nation findings, some cases receive relevant triage ul- trasonography and serum-based surveillance tests.

DEFINING SMOKING HARM Study finds risk even before conception BY DOUG BRUNK AT ACOG 2017 SAN DIEGO - Smoking during the period of fetal organogenesis is associated with an increased risk of some birth defects, results from a large retro- spective analysis demonstrated. \"Significant amounts of research have looked into the effects of smoking on pregnancy ,\" lead study author Madeline Perry said in an interview prior to the annual clinical and scientific meeting of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \"From this we've learned a lot, such as how smoking contributes to adverse fetal outcomes like intrauterine growth restriction. However, less research has evaluated how smok- ing influences congenital birth defects. There are studies that, suggest this connection. However, this study is unique in that in order to better un- derstand this relationship, it looks at smoking in the months leading up to pregnancy as well as during the first trimester. While it's understood that smoking during pregnancy can have negative effects on both the mother and the fetus, I was especially interested in how smoking even before conception can affect fetal development.\" Ms. Perry , a second-year medical student at the University of Cincinnati and her associates conduct- ed a population-based retrospective cohort analysis AHCA IN FOCUS How the health care bill may affect women BY ALICIA GALLEGOS Dramatic changes could be on the horizon for women's health care should the contr versial American Health Care Act of 201 (AHCA) become law .

Fine-tuning ovarian cancer risk assessment Sadly, since we do not have a primary prevention modality, like a vaccine, for ovarian cancer, we are left to fi nd this cancer early instead of at a treat- able precancerous stage. It is possible that, soon, we may have more powerful screening tests (high negative predictive value) and triage tools (high positive predictive value) to identify women at risk and avoid unnecessary surgeries. We evaluate the challenges and opportunities of assessing risk for ovarian cancer in various pa- tient scenarios in the roundtable discussion on page SS7, featuring Drs. Leslie Randall, Jason Wright, and Devansu Tewari. In addition, on page SS5, Dr. Jeanine Genkinger describes the epidemiology of ovarian cancer and explores the risks associated with gene mutations and risk assessment models. References 1.

Genkinger, PhD, MHS Ovarian cancer is considered a rare, but highly fatal, cancer unless it is detected early. In 2017, an estimated 22,440 cases of ovarian cancer occurred in the United States.1 The most common (60%) and aggressive type of epithelial ovarian cancer is the high-grade serous type.2 Overall, only 44% of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer survive more than 5 years post - diagnosis.3,4 Yet, when ovarian cancer is detected at a localized stage (15% of cases), the 5-year survival rate is 94%.3,4 A number of reasons exist for the late diagnosis and high fatality rate, including few known modifi - able risk factors, no effective screening tools, and lack of early diagnostic symptoms unique to ovar - ian cancer. Thus, approaches to prevent disease or identify it at earlier stages are critical to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this deadly disease. Genetic and reproductive risk factors Identifying known risk factors for ovarian cancer is crucial for early detection and risk assessment. Women with mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene are at a much higher risk for developing ovar - ian cancer (16%-68% for BRCA1 and 11%-27% for BRCA2 ).5-16 Yet, a continuum of risk exists even for women with the same mutation, which contrib - utes to difficulty in clinical decision making. Women with a family history only have a much higher risk of ovarian cancer than the gen - eral population17 such that having 1 affected first- degree relative increases a woman's risk 3-fold, and having multiple affected relatives increases a woman's risk 11-fold.18However, family history and/or genetic predis- position19 accounts only for 5% to 10% of cases.19,20 The majority of other risk factors for ovarian cancer are reproductive: older age at menarche, menopausal hormone use, and endometriosis.21,22 By contrast, tubal ligation and oral contraceptive (OC) use are estimated to lower ovarian cancer risk by 30% to 50%, and parity, breastfeeding, and hysterectomy are additional known or suspected preventive factors.23-28 Risk assessment model utility Currently, validated risk assessment models that integrate established risk factors exist for primary prevention. The Rosner model includes age at menopause, age at menarche, OC use, and tubal ligation; the concordance statistic (area under the receiver operator curve [AUC]) is 0.60.29 The Pfei- ffer model includes OC use, menopausal hormone therapy use, and family history of breast or ovarian cancer, with a discriminatory power of 0.59.30 The Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium model includes 17 risk factors and 17 genome-wide sig - nificant single nucleotide polymorphisms (BRCA1 and BRCA2 were not included); the AUC increased only to 0.66.31 Due to their modest discriminatory power, these models have limited screening potential.30 Screening provides no mortality benefit Currently, the US Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend screening for ovarian cancer.32 Findings from recent large clinical trials of serum cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) and transvaginal ul - trasonography demonstrated that these screening The author reports no financial relationships relevant to this article. 0118 SS Genkinger.indd 5 12/21/17 2:26 ON PAGE SS14SPECIAL SECTION Ovarian cancer epidemiology modalities do not confer a benefit for mortality.33-35 In fact, in the intervention arm participants had in - creased false-positive results, with at least 1 serious complication and/or adverse event.33-35 The major concern regarding CA 125 is that it may not be specific enough to ovarian cancer; in fact, CA 125 is elevated in benign conditions, such as pregnancy and menstruation, and is expressed in only about half of early-stage ovarian cancers.36,37 Targeted screening in high-risk patients has potential These previous studies examining screening approaches were employed in average-risk women and may not represent the findings from a targeted approach in high-risk women. In the future, one suggestion for improved screening is a 2-tiered ap - proach in which risk assessment models are used to identify high-risk women, who are then targeted for screening with a panel of markers that repre - sent pathways to disease. This combined approach may reduce false-positives and improve mortality compared with using risk assessment or screening alone. Recent modeling supports this approach as effective for other diseases, such as breast cancer.38-40 References 1. American Cancer Society. Cancer Facts & Figures 2017.

Lonky, MD, MPH, 3 leading gynecologic oncolo - gists use a case-based approach to discuss their strategies for assessing patients at risk for ovarian cancer. Considerations include patient age, his - tory, genetic profile, and symptoms. Assessing the premenopausal high-risk patient with positive family history, genetic concerns Neal M. Lonky, MD, MPH: Your patient is at high risk for ovarian cancer due to a strong family his - tory or genomic concerns. She is premenopausal and has no symptoms. What overall management approach would you take for this patient? Leslie M. Randall, MD: For women with true ge- nomic concerns, prevention is far preferred to sur- veillance. The specific high-risk genes are BRCA1, PMS1, and EpCAM), and the minimum these women is a risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO). RRSO is recommended between 30 and 35 years of age for BRCA1 mutation carriers, and between 40 and 45 years for carriers of the other mutations listed, regardless of menopausal status. This is true for all age groups and in both symp - tomatic and asymptomatic patients. If women have undiagnosed but suspected genetic mutations, they should be referred for ge - netic counseling and possible testing based on es- tablished criteria. Until better screening modalities are available, identifying these women for RRSO is our best method for improving ovarian cancer Dr. Lonky reports that he has received grant or research support from Merck & Co.

ILLUSTRATION: KIMBERLY MARTENS FOR OBG MANAGEMENT 0118 SS Roundtable.indd 7 12/21/17 2:25 PMmdedge.com/obgmanagementSPECIAL SECTION Optimal risk assessment and management of the potential ovarian cancer case SS8 OBG Management | January 2018mortality. Screening, however, can be considered for mutation carriers who do not meet these age criteria, desire future childbearing, or are not yet willing to undergo RRSO, as well as for women with a strong family history who test negative for mutations in these genes. There is no current standard recommendation for screening, but clinicians can start by educating patients regarding the symptoms of ovarian cancer and performing an annual pelvic examination. Fur - ther testing protocols include at least a yearly trans- vaginal ultrasound scan and a serum cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) test. This approach was not successful in the general population as reported by the Pros - tate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) screen- ing project.1 Screen-detected cancers in the PLCO were predominantly diagnosed in stages III or IV , and at the expense of false-positive results attribut - able to ultrasound findings that prompted unneces- sary surgeries and subsequent complications. An alternative strategy of reserving ultraso - nography for women with a rising annual CA 125 level (termed \"multimodal screening\") was stud - ied in the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKTOCS).2 While multimodal screening was associated with less un - necessary surgery, cancers were still diagnosed at an advanced stage. There was a trend for mortality reduction, however, for women who had normal screening for the initial 7 to 14 years of monitoring. Finally, a third approach, the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA), also employs a math - ematical CA 125 trend model with increased fre- quency (measurement of CA 125 every 3 months).3 In the high-risk, genomic concern population, this strategy showed improved sensitivity for early stage disease compared with historical methods, even before the CA 125 level was greater than 35 U/mL. The ROCA, however, requires further study in a larger cohort before it can be accepted as standard of care. Jason D. Wright, MD: Appropriate risk assess- ment typically is the first step when considering screening for ovarian cancer. Women with a per - sonal or family history of breast and ovarian cancer should undergo genetic counseling. For those who meet the criteria for genetic testing, testing for del - eterious mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes can be performed. Women with a BRCA mutation are considered at high risk and warrant heightened surveillance and consideration of risk-reducing surgery. Many commercially available genetic tests now evaluate a panel of genes in addition to BRCA1 and BRCA2 . While those genes are associated with ovarian cancer, the risk is generally lower than that associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 . Data on how best to manage patients with abnormalities in these lower-penetrance genes are more limited. For a premenopausal woman who has not com - pleted childbearing, transvaginal ultrasonography with serum CA 125 testing can be considered. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network currently endorses such screening in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation starting at age 30 to 35 years.4 It should be noted that the benefit of such screening is uncertain, and screening has not been shown to reduce mortality in these women. The frequency of screening is at the discretion of the clinician, but it is often performed at an interval of every 6 months. Devansu Tewari, MD: The most important thing always to consider in someone presumed to have a high risk of ovarian cancer is the accuracy of their family history. Clearly a first-degree relative, such as a mother, daughter, or sister with ovarian cancer, or someone who has tested positive for a genetic mutation needs to be confirmed. If the patient is considered at high risk based on family history alone, a referral to a geneticist is warranted to determine if testing is needed. Un - fortunately, screening opportunities\u2014other than routine gynecologic examinations\u2014outside of a clinical trial are limited. The postmenopausal high-risk patient with no symptoms of ovarian cancer Dr. Lonky: What is your approach for a postmeno- pausal patient who has no symptoms? Dr. Randall: My approach in the asymptomatic, postmenopausal patient is much like that for the premenopausal one: RRSO for known genetic mu - tation carriers, genetic testing for potential carri- ers, and the option to use ultrasound and CA 125 monitoring in the rest. In women with significant family history (ovarian cancer in more than 1 first-degree rela - tive), RRSO might be considered in those who are medically fit for surgery. Hysterectomy could be CONTINUED ON PAGE SS10 0118 SS Roundtable.indd 8 12/21/17 2:25 PMmdedge.com/obgmanagementSPECIAL SECTION Optimal risk assessment and management of the potential ovarian cancer case SS10 OBG Management | January 2018CONTINUED FROM PAGE SS8 considered for women with indications such as high-grade cervical dysplasia, postmenopausal bleeding, or the need for tamoxifen therapy.5 In addition, women with BRCA1 mutations might be at higher risk for serous uterine cancers, and this should be discussed during surgical planning for RRSO.6 Hysterectomy increases the risks of sur- gery, but these risks can be minimized by using a minimally invasive surgical approach. Dr. Wright: Postmenopausal women with a BRCA mutation who have not undergone oophorec - tomy should strongly consider prophylactic RRSO. RRSO typically is recommended between the ages of 35 and 40 after the completion of childbearing. Since women with BRCA2 mutations have later onset of ovarian cancer, RRSO can be delayed until 40 to 45 years of age in these patients. Dr. Tewari: An asymptomatic patient without a genetic mutation should undergo routine annual gynecologic examinations. Screening outside of a clinical trial is not recommended. Women carry - ing a known genetic mutation, such as a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, should have undergone risk- reducing surgery to remove the tubes and ovaries; those who have not already had RRSO should be counseled to do so. The issue related to hysterec - tomy needs to be discussed with these patients, given studies showing increased rates of uterine papillary serous cancers,6 and if a personal history of breast cancer exists this may need to be factored in as well. Suspicious symptoms in a premenopausal high-risk patient Dr. Lonky: Please describe your management ap- proach for a premenopausal patient who has cur- rent symptoms. Dr. Randall: According to Goff and colleagues, symptoms that are concerning for ovarian can - cer include pelvic and abdominal pain, urinary urgency and/or frequency, increased abdominal size and bloating, and early satiety present for less than 1 year and occurring more than 12 days per month.7 Although not always specific to ovarian cancer, the presence of these symptoms increases the performance of diagnostic testing. Dr. Wright: Yes, clinicians should have a height- ened suspicion in women who have persistent symptoms that have been associated with ovarian cancer. This is particularly true for high-risk women with a BRCA mutation or those with a family history of ovarian cancer. These patients should undergo pelvic examination, transvaginal ultrasonography, and assessment of serum CA 125. Dr. Randall: For these women, I start with abdomi- nal and pelvic examinations, followed by abdominal and vaginal ultrasound with serum markers based on the presence and appearance of a pelvic mass. If the mass is large (>10 cm) and/or complex, in this age group I consider tumors of both epithelial and nonepithelial ovarian origin, in addition to colorec - tal cancer, and perform tests for CA 125, carcinoem- bryonic antigen (CEA), germ cell markers markers (inhibin B and testosterone). Large masses will need to be managed surgi - cally, and unless they appear purely simple on ul- trasound and all serum markers are normal, these should be managed by a gynecologic oncologist, especially in the setting of genomic concerns. If imaging shows a smaller mass or ascites alone, CA 125 and CEA typically are adequate markers, and the patient should be referred for gynecologic oncology evaluation and consideration for sur - gery. Benign diagnoses, such as endometriosis, pelvic abscess, and ectopic pregnancy, should not be excluded in this age group for fear of cancer. Dr. Tewari: Any symptoms such as worsening abdominal or pelvic pain, bloating, urinary fre - quency, or gastrointestinal changes that do not improve should trigger a gynecologic examination followed by a transvaginal ultrasound to rule out a pelvic mass. If the patient carries a genetic muta - tion, I would include a CA 125 test to correlate with the imaging findings. For known BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic carriers, I would recommend prophylactic removal of both the tubes and the ovaries if childbearing has been completed (ages 35 to 40 years), and I would con - sider extending the age limit into the mid-40s for BRCA2 carriers, given the later age of presentation. Suspicious symptoms in a postmenopausal high-risk patient Dr. Lonky: And how would you manage a post- menopausal patient who reports having current symptoms? 0118 SS Roundtable.indd 10 12/21/17 2:25 PMmdedge.com/obgmanagement January 2018 | OBG Management SS11Dr. Tewari: I would follow the same approach for a symptomatic postmenopausal patient as for a pre - menopausal patient. Dr. Wright: I agree. As with symptomatic pre- menopausal patients, we should be suspicious of ovarian cancer-related persistent symptoms in postmenopausal women, especially high-risk women who have a BRCA mutation or family his - tory of ovarian cancer. Pelvic examination, trans- vaginal ultrasonography, and assessment of serum CA 125 are warranted. Dr. Randall: I would mention that, in postmeno- pausal women, the risk of malignancy is greater for epithelial ovarian and nongynecologic prima - ries, such as colon and breast cancer. In addition, the risk for germ cell tumors is much lower than in premenopausal women, and that for sex cord stromal tumors is somewhat equivocal. Therefore, patients should have up-to-date breast and colon screening, and serum studies can be limited to CA 125 and CEA. In these patients, the threshold for gynecologic oncology referral and surgical eval - uation should be low. The premenopausal average- risk woman with symptoms Dr. Lonky: Consider a woman at average risk for ovarian cancer who is premenopausal and has cur - rent symptoms. Please describe your management approach for this patient. Dr. Wright: While ovarian cancer is often consid- ered the \"silent killer, \" some symptoms have been associated with ovarian cancer. As mentioned, women with ovarian cancer frequently describe symptoms of abdominal and pelvic pain, early satiety, bloating, and urinary urgency and fre - quency. Although these symptoms are common in the general population, women with ovarian cancer tend to experience them more frequently as well as persistently. An ovarian cancer symp - tom index has been developed; it includes pelvic and abdominal pain, urinary urgency and fre - quency, increased abdominal size, bloating, and difficulty eating or feeling full, with symptoms present for less than 1 year and for more than 12 days per month. While some studies have found that these symptoms are useful in detect - ing ovarian cancer, others have questioned the overall value of symptomatology.Patients and clinicians should have a height- ened suspicion for ovarian cancer when these symptoms are noted. When they do occur, evalu - ation can include pelvic and rectovaginal exami- nation along with transvaginal ultrasound and measurement of serum CA 125. CA 125 is a non - specific marker and is often elevated, particularly in premenopausal women. If the results of these tests raise concern for ovarian cancer, patients should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist or a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and man - agement of ovarian cancer. Dr. Randall: In this age group, other markers, such as human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) and a multi - variate index assay (OVA1), might be helpful. HE4 is especially helpful when an elevated CA 125 is likely due to benign disease, such as endometrio - sis, adenomyosis, or leiomyomata. In these cases, HE4 is much less likely to be falsely elevated, and the Risk of Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA) can be used to calculate risk, but the HE4 level alone is sufficient to triage benign from malignant masses in low-risk patients.8,9 OVA1 can be used to assist in the triage of pelvic masses planned for surgery due to size or symptomatology to benign gyneco - logic or gynecologic oncology surgeons. Of note, if the CA 125 is elevated, OVA1 also will be elevated and therefore less helpful than in cases where the CA 125 is normal. Dr. Tewari: Without an abnormal finding on imag- ing, I would not order a CA 125 test given the high false-positive rate. If a mass is identified, its clinical features would determine if a CA 125 test is warranted as well as the next steps in surgical management. Dr. Randall: Fortunately, premenopausal women at average risk for ovarian cancer typically have be - nign diagnoses, even when they are symptomatic. I would perform the same evaluation as in the high- risk patient, but I would have a higher threshold to suspect cancer, to refer to oncology, and to recom - mend or perform immediate surgical intervention. The postmenopausal average- risk woman with symptoms Dr. Lonky: Your average-risk patient is postmeno- pausal and has current symptoms. What is your management approach? Dr. Randall: The approach in this age group is the same as that for the average-risk premenopausal 0118 SS Roundtable.indd 11 12/21/17 2:25 PMmdedge.com/obgmanagementSPECIAL SECTION Optimal risk assessment and management of the potential ovarian cancer case SS12 OBG Management | January 2018patient with symptoms, but cancer diagnoses including ovarian, endometrial, colon, or meta- static breast cancer are higher on the differential. Again, up-to-date breast and colon screening, endometrial biopsy for postmenopausal bleeding and abnormal uterine lining thickness, ultraso - nography, and serum markers are the mainstays for evaluation. Pre- and postmenopausal average-risk patients with no symptoms Dr. Lonky: What is your approach for women who are at average risk for ovarian cancer and have no symptoms\u2014whether they are premenopausal or postmenopausal? Dr. Wright: Among average-risk women\u2014whether they are premenopausal or postmenopausal\u2014 routine screening for ovarian cancer is not recom - mended. Overall, the prevalence of ovarian cancer in the general population is low. Therefore, even screening tests with a high specificity have a low predictive value for the detection of ovarian can - cer, and they require evaluating a large number of women without cancer. This is problematic for ovarian cancer\u2014which requires that women un - dergo surgery to diagnose a cancer. Two large screening trials, one in the United States and one in the United Kingdom, evaluated the utility of screening average-risk women with CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasonography for the detection of ovarian cancer.1,2 Neither trial was able to demonstrate a reduction in mortality with screening. Both trials noted that a significant num - ber of women require surgical intervention to de- tect 1 case of ovarian cancer, and that surgery was associated with significant morbidity. Based on these data, the US Preventive Services Task Force considers the harms of screening to outweigh the benefits and classifies ovarian cancer screening as category D. Dr. Randall: I agree, as shown in the PLCO and UKTOCS trials, the harms of screening currently outweigh any benefit.1,2 Therefore, aside from screening for indications for genetic testing, I do not recommend any special testing in these age groups. Dr. Tewari: The annual gynecologic examination gives ObGyns an opportunity to ask about symp - toms that may be suggestive of ovarian cancer. Other considerations Dr. Lonky: Are there any other special case con- cerns to discuss? Dr. Tewari: A lot of focus has centered around screening, which ignores the evidence for war - ranting increased symptom awareness. We need to convey to women the need to be aware of ovar - ian cancer symptoms, especially those listed in the ovarian cancer symptom index. Use of the symp - tom index has been associated with identifying the disease at earlier stages, which is important because that is when response and cure rates are higher. Dr. Randall: I would like to mention additional im- aging. Computerized tomography (CT) and mag- netic resonance imaging (MRI) should be reserved for cases with abnormal ultrasound findings. CT with intravenous contrast has poor sensitivity for soft-tissue definition and is best employed to detect ascites, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, perito - neal carcinomatosis, obstruction. T2-weighted MRI with gado - linium contrast has excellent soft-tissue resolution and can be particularly helpful to differentiate ovar - ian and uterine masses in premenopausal women faced with surgery who desire to retain fertility. Advanced imaging techniques, such as posi - tron emission tomography (PET), increase costs significantly and often do not change manage - ment beyond that derived from CT or MRI studies. Therefore, PET should not be used routinely in the workup of these women. Dr. Wright: Similar to liquid biopsies, there is in- terest in detecting ovarian cancer cells that are ex- foliated through the lower genital tract. These cells could be obtained in a manner that is similar to collecting a specimen for a Pap test. A technology currently being developed by PapGene Inc uses cells collected from the cervix and examines them for molecular abnormalities. A pilot study found that the test identified 9 of 22 (41%) ovarian can - cers. These types of tests are currently being evalu- ated as a potential modality to aid in the detection of ovarian cancer. Dr. Lonky: Please explain what liquid biopsies are and how can they be used in gynecology. Dr. Wright: Liquid biopsy is a test in which a blood sample is collected and analyzed to look for tumor cells. The hope with liquid biopsies is that ovarian cancer could be detected at an earlier CONTINUED ON PAGE SS14 0118 SS Roundtable.indd 12 12/21/17 2:25 PMEverything she needs with the services you expect. \u00a92016 Laboratory Corporation of America\u00ae Holdings All rights reserved. 16094-1216LabCorp offers a comprehensive test menu that supports the continuum of care.

Liquid biopsy requires that tumor cells are present in the bloodstream and that these cells have molecular abnormalities that can be used to dis- tinguish the tumor cells from normal cells. There currently are several promising technologies available, and many are undergoing testing and evaluation. At present, this is not a test that is used routinely in practice. Dr. Tewari: Yes, they are the newest wave in next- generation sequencing. With no effective screening strategies for ovarian cancer to date, liquid biop - sies serve as a potential future option. Although the technology of next-generation sequencing is improving by the minute, its role in gynecologic cancers at this time is more one of potential and promise than widespread acceptance. However, that day may not be far off as more and more stud - ies are showing successful comparisons. Dr. Randall: Liquid biopsies are attractive because not only do they save the patient the inconvenience, risk, and cost of a surgical or CT-guided percutane - ous biopsy but also they are associated with a very quick turnaround time (days versus 3 to 4 weeks for tissue biopsy) for timely clinical decision making. If better markers of early stage gynecologic cancers of all types are validated, this technique has significant potential for screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of response to therapy. n References 1.

It is performed on 77% of males born in the United States and on 42% of those born elsewhere who are living in this country.2 Whether it is performed depends not only on the parents' race, ethnic background, and religion but also on region: US circumcision rates range from 74% in the Midwest to 30% in the West, and in between are the Northeast (67%) and the South (61%).3 Circumcision is not without controversy. Some claim that it is unnecessary cosmetic surgery, that it is genital mutilation, that the patient cannot choose it or object to it, or that it decreases sexual satisfaction. In this article, I review 8 common ques- tions about circumcision and provide data- based answers to them.1. Should a newborn be circumcised? For many years, the medical benefits of cir- cumcision were scientifically ambiguous. With no clear answers, some thought that parents should base their decision for or against circumcision not on any potential medical benefit but rather on their family or religious tradition, or on a social standard, that is, what the majority of families in their community do. Over the past 20 years, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated real medical benefits of circumcision. In 2012, the Ameri- can Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), which previously had been neutral on the subject, issued a task force report concluding that the health benefits of circumcision outweigh its risks and justify access to the procedure.3,4 However, the report stopped short of recom- mending circumcision. Opponents have expressed several con- cerns about circumcision. First, they say, it is painful and unnecessary, and performing it when life has just begun takes the decision away from the adult-to-be, who may want to be uncircumcised as an adult but will have no recourse. Second, they say circumcision will diminish the adult's sexual pleasure. However, there is no proof this occurs, and it is unclear how the claim could be adequately verified.58 common questions about newborn circumcision As the medical benefits of male circumcision become more widely known, it is important to dispel the myths and describe the evidence surrounding this traditional surgical practice Henry Michael Lerner, MD Dr. Lerner is Assistant Clinical Professor, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.

What is the best analgesia for circumcision? Although in decades past circumcision was often performed without any analgesia, in the United States analgesia is now standard of care. The AAP Task Force on Circumci- sion formalized this standard in a 2012 policy statement.4 For newborn circumcision, an- algesia can be given in the form of analge- sic cream, penile ring block, or dorsal nerve block. Analgesic EMLA cream (a mixture of local anesthetics such as lidocaine 2.5%/ prilocaine 2.5%) is easy to use but is minimally effective in relieving circumcision pain,6 al- though some investigators have reported it is efficacious compared with placebo.7 When used, the analgesic cream is applied 30 to 60 minutes before circumcision. Both penile ring block and dorsal nerve block with 1% lidocaine are easy to adminis- ter and are very effective.8,9 They are best used with buffered lidocaine, which partially re- lieves the burning that occurs with injection. With both methods, the smaller the needle used (preferably 30 gauge), the better. These 2 block methods have differ- ent injection sites. For the ring block, small amounts of lidocaine (1.0 to 1.5 mL) are given in a series of injections around the entire cir- cumference of the base of the penis. The dor- sal block targets the 2 dorsal nerves located at 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock at the base of the penis. Epinephrine, given its vasoconstric- tive properties and the potential for necrosis, should never be used with local analgesia for penile infiltration. Analgesia can be supplemented with comfort measures, such as a pacifier, sugar water, gentle rubbing on the forehead, and soothing speech.10 3. What conditions are required for safe circumcision? As circumcision is not medically required and need not occur in the days immediately after birth, it should be performed only when conditions are optimal: A pediatrician or other practitioner must first examine the newborn. The newborn must be full-term, healthy, and stable. \u2014The best time to circumcise a baby born prematurely is right before discharge from the intensive care nursery. The penis must be of normal size and with- out anatomical defect\u2014no micropenis, hy- pospadias, or penoscrotal webbing. The lower abdominal fat pad must not be so large that it will cause the shaft's skin to cover the exposed penile head. If there is a family history of a bleeding dis- order, the newborn must be evaluated for the disorder before the circumcision. The newborn must have received his vita- min K shot. 4. What is the best circumcision method? Circumcision can be performed with the Gomco circumcision clamp, the Mogen cir- cumcision clamp, or the PlastiBell circumci- sion device. Each device works well, provides excellent results, and has its pluses and mi- nuses. Practitioners should use the device with which they are most familiar and com- fortable, which likely will be the device they used in training. In the United States, the Gomco clamp is perhaps the most commonly used device. It provides good cosmetic results, and its metal \"bell\" protects the entire head of the penis. Of the 3 methods, however, it is the most difficult\u2014Health benefits of circumcision3 Prevention of phimosis and balanoposthitis glans and penile retraction disorders, and penile cancer. Fewer infant urinary tract infections. Decreased spread of human papillomavirus-related disease, including cervical cancer and its precursors, to sexual partners. Lower risk of acquiring, harboring, and spreading human immunodeficiency virus infection, herpes virus infection, and other sexually transmitted diseases. Easier genital hygiene. No need for circumcision later in life, when the procedure is more involved. Lener 0118.indd 28 12/21/17 2:22 PMmdedge.com/obgmanagement Vol. 30 No. 1 | January 2018 | OBG Management 29the partially cut foreskin must be threaded be- tween the bell and the clamp frame before the clamp is tightened. In many cases, too, there is bleeding at the penile frenulum. The Mogen clamp, another commonly used device, also is used in traditional Jew- ish circumcisions. Of the 3 methods, it is the quickest, produces the best hemostasis, and is associated with the least discomfort.10 To those unfamiliar with the method, there may seem to be a potential for amputation of the head of the penis, but actually there virtually is no risk, as an indentation on the penile side of the clamp protects the penile head. The PlastiBell device is very easy to use but must stay on until the foreskin becomes necrotic and the bell and foreskin fall off on their own\u2014a process that takes 7 to 10 days. Many parents dislike this method because its final result is not immediate and they have to contend with a medical implement during their newborn's first week home. Electrocautery is not recommended. Some clinicians, especially urologists, use electrocautery as the cutting mechanism for circumcision. A review of the literature, however, reveals that electrocautery has not been studied head-to-head against tradi- tional techniques, and that various signifi- penile head, severe burns, meatal stenosis\u2014have been reported.11,12 It is certainly not a mainstream procedure for neonatal circumcision. Evaluate penile anatomy for abnormalities Before performing any circumcision, the head of the penis should be examined to rule out hypospadias or other penile abnormali- ties. This is because the foreskin is utilized in certain penile repair procedures. The pedia- trician should perform an initial examination of the penis at the formal newborn physical within 24 hours of delivery. The clinician per- forming the circumcision should re-examine the penis just before the procedure is be- gun\u2014by pushing back the foreskin as much as possible\u2014as well as during the procedure, once the foreskin is lifted off the penile head but before the foreskin is excised.5. When is the best time to perform a circumcision? The medical literature provides no firm an- swer to this question. The younger the baby, the easier it is to perform a circumcision as a simple procedure with local anesthesia. The older the baby, the larger the penis and the more aware the baby will be of his surround- ings. Both these factors will make the proce- dure more difficult. Most clinicians would be reluctant to perform a circumcision in the office or clinic after the baby is 6 to 8 weeks old. If a fam- ily desires their son to be circumcised after that time\u2014or a medical condition precludes earlier circumcision\u2014the procedure is best performed by a pediatric urologist in the op- erating room. 6. What are the potential complications of circumcision? The rate of circumcision complications is very low at 0.2%.13 That being said, the 3 most common types of complications are Take steps to ensure the best circumcision outcome Just before the procedure, have a face-to-face discussion with the parents. Confirm that they want the circumcision done, explain exactly what it entails, and let them know they will receive complete aftercare instructions. Make sure one of the parents signs the consent form. Circumcise the right baby! Check the identification bracelet and confirm that the newborn's hospital and chart numbers match. Prevent excessive hip movement by securing the baby's legs. The usual solution is a specially designed plastic restraint board with Velcro straps for the legs. Examine the infant's penile anatomy prior to the procedure to make certain it is normal. For pain relief, administer enough analgesia, as either dorsal nerve block or penile ring block (the best methods). Before injection, draw the plunger of the syringe back to make certain that the needle is not in a blood vessel. During the procedure, make sure the entire membranous layer of foreskin covering the head of the penis is separated from the glans. Watch the penis for several minutes after the circumcision to make sure there is no bleeding. Lener 0118.indd 29 12/21/17 2:22 PMmdedge.com/obgmanagement 30 OBG Management | January 2018 | Vol. 30 No. 1 Potential complications include postoperative bleeding, infection, penile damage, and sliding of the penile shaft's skin up and over the glansFAST TRACK8 common questions about newborn circumcision postoperative bleeding, infection, and dam- age to the penis. Far and away the most common com- plication is postoperative bleeding, usually at the frenulum of the head of the penis (the 6 o'clock position). In most cases, the bleed- ing is light to moderate. It is controlled with direct pressure applied for several minutes, the use of processed gelatin (Gelfoam) or cel- lulose (Surgicel), sparing use of silver placement of a polyglycolic acid (Vicryl) 5-0 suture. Infection, an unusual occurrence, is seen within 24 to 72 hours after circumcision. It is marked by swelling, redness, and a foul- smelling mucus discharge. This discharge must be differentiated from dried fibrin, which is commonly seen on the head of the penis in the days after circumcision but has no odor or association with erythema, fever, or infant fussiness. True infection should be treated, in collaboration with the child's pe- diatrician, with a staphylococcal-sensitive penicillin (such as dicloxacillin). More serious is damage to the penis , which ranges from accidental dilation of the meatus to partial amputation of the penile glans. Any such injury should im- mediately prompt a consultation with a pe- diatric urologist. More of a nuisance than a complication is the sliding of the penile shaft's skin up and over the glans. This is a relatively frequent oc- currence after normal, successful circumci- sions. Parents of an affected newborn should be instructed to gently slide the skin back until the head of the penis is completely exposed again. After several days, the skin will adhere to its proper position on the shaft. 7. What is a Jewish ritual circumcision? For their newborn's circumcision, Jewish par- ents may choose a bris ceremony, formally called a brit milah, in fulfillment of religious tradition. The ceremony involves a brief reli- gious service, circumcision with the traditional Mogen clamp, a special blessing, and an offi- cial religious naming rite. The bris traditionally is performed by a mohel, a rabbi or other re- ligious official trained in circumcision. Many parents have the bris done by a mohel who is a medical doctor. In the United States, the avail- ability of both types of mohels varies. 8. Who should perform circumcisions\u2014obstetricians or pediatricians? The answer to this question depends on where you practice. In some communities or hos- pitals, the obstetrician performs newborn circumcision, while in other places the pedia- trician does. In addition, depending on local circumstances or the specific population in- volved, circumcisions may be performed by a pediatric urologist, nurse practitioner, or even out of hospital by a trained religiously affili- ated practitioner. Obstetricians began doing circumci- sions for 2 reasons. First, obstetricians are surgically trained whereas pediatricians are not. It was therefore thought to be more ap- propriate for obstetricians to do this minor surgical procedure. Second, circumcisions used to be done right in the delivery room shortly after delivery. It was thought that the crying induced by performing the circumci- sion helped clear the baby's lungs and in- vigorated sluggish babies. Now, however, in-hospital circumcisions are usually done in the days following delivery, after the baby has had the opportunity to undergo his first physical examination to make sure that all is well and that the penile anatomy is normal. Clinician experience, proper protocol contribute to a safe procedure In the United States, a large percentage of male infants are circumcised. Although cir- cumcision has known medical benefits, the procedure generally is performed for fam- ily, religious, or cultural reasons. Circumci- sion is a safe and straightforward procedure but has its risks and potential complications. As with most surgeries, the best outcomes are achieved by practitioners who are well Lener 0118.indd 30 12/21/17 2:22 PMmdedge.com/obgmanagement Vol. 30 No. 1 | January 2018 | OBG Management 31trained, who perform the procedure un- der supervision until their experience is suffi cient, and who follow correct protocol during the entire operation.

During vaginal delivery, a shoulder dystocia was encountered. The baby was born within 60 seconds using the McRoberts maneuver and suprapubic pressure. The ObGyn charted mild shoulder dystocia. The child has decreased mobil - ity of his left arm. MRI studies and surgical findings confirmed brachial plexus rupture and avulsion at C5- C7. Despite nerve grafting, the child has a significant disability to his left arm and shoulder. PARENT'S CLAIM: The ObGyn negli- gently applied excessive lateral trac- tion, improperly used lateral traction as a maneuver, and instructed the mother to continuously push. PHYSICIAN'S DEFENSE: Shoulder dys- tocia was properly diagnosed and resolved using standard maneuvers. Traction and pushing are needed dur - ing shoulder dystocia management to determine whether the maneuvers are successful. Brachial plexus inju - ries can occur because of the normal forces of labor and delivery. VERDICT: An Illinois defense verdict was returned.

Three years postsurgery, after trying to conceive, the patient under - went exploratory laparoscopy to evaluate her fallopian tubes. A surgeon found significant pelvic adhesions occluding the left fallopian tube. He lysed resected the left fallopian tube. PATIENT'S The patient sued the ObGyn and both radiologists, alleg- ing that the unnecessary surgeries resulted in reduced fertility. Postoperatively, the ObGyn told the patient that the surgery, per - formed for \"nothing, \" was the radiologists' fault, and that she would have no trouble conceiving. He later blamed her fallopian tube damage on a diagnosis of chlamydia that was successfully treated years earlier with no evidence of reinfection. The ObGyn disregarded Dr. A's recommendation for a CT scan with rectal contrast; instead he ordered oral contrast. The ObGyn also ignored Dr. B's recommendation for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The mass misidentified by the radiologists was described in 2 differ - ent places on the anterior wall of the bowel, both outside the purview of a gynecologist. Given the uncertain diagnosis, referral to a general surgeon was mandated; exploratory laparotomy was not indicated. The ObGyn never referred the patient to a general surgeon for evaluation or sent records or films to the surgeon whom he claimed to have consulted before surgery. The general surgeon denied that any such discussion occurred. The surgeon's first contact with the patient occurred when he was called into the operating room because the ObGyn could not find a mass; the patient was under anesthesia and her abdomen was open. DEFENDANTS' DEFENSE: The ObGyn claimed that he had developed a plan with the general surgeon before surgery: if the mass was a uterine fibroid, he would remove it, but if the mass was mesenteric, the surgeon would operate. The ObGyn was justified in performing surgery based on the patient's complaints and the radiologists' findings. The radiologists contended that, since neither of them expressed certainty, both requested further studies, and neither suggested surgery, their treatment was consistent with the standard of care. VERDICT: A $625,000 Pennsylvania verdict was returned, finding the ObGyn 100% liable.

The patient had limited urine output immediately after surgery, no urinary output overnight, and abdominal pain. The gynecologist ordered a urology con - sultation. A CT bilateral ureteral an interven - tional radiology study confirmed a blockage due to severance of both ureters. A nephrostomy was per - formed and, 6 weeks later, the ure- ters were reimplanted. PATIENT'S CLAIM: The severing of both ureters was a negligent surgical error. While the risk of injuring a single ureter is a recognized complication of TAH, it is unacceptable that both ureters were severed. DEFENDANTS' CLAIM: Standard of care was met: bilateral ureteral injury is a known risk of TAH. Before surgery, the patient was fully informed of the risks and signed a consent agree - ment. There was no intraoperative evidence that the ureters had been damaged. The injuries were detected as soon as medically possible and timely and successfully treated. VERDICT: An Illinois defense verdict was returned. Failure to detect breast cancer: $21.9M verdict against radiologist A WOMAN WENT to a diagnostic imag- ing service for ultrasonography (US) after an earlier US was suspicious for a breast mass. She had a history of left breast pain and swelling that had been treated with antibiotics. The radiologist interpreted the second ultrasound as showing no masses; he noted skin thickening and a lymph node abnormality. Nine months after initial US, the patient had a breast biopsy performed in another state. She was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. PATIENT'S CLAIM: The radiologist failed to properly interpret the find - ings of the second ultrasound. PHYSICIAN'S DEFENSE: The radiolo- gist contended that he was not liable because the technologist failed to place the transducer over the breast lump. The first US films were not pro - vided for comparison. VERDICT: A $21.9 million Florida ver- dict was returned. Mother claims PTSD after twin's stillbirth EXPECTING TWINS, a 23-year-old woman at 33.5 weeks' gestation reported pain. The ObGyn noted that her cervix was 4-cm dilated, 1 twin was in breech position, and that labor had begun. He recommended that the patient go to the hospital for cesarean delivery but told her that she could go home, shower, and gather her belong - ings first. When the mother arrived at the hospital 2.5 hours later, the fetal heart-rate (FHR) monitor indicated that one twin's heart was not active. An emergency cesarean delivery was performed. One twin was safely born, but the other died. PARENT'S CLAIM: The ObGyn failed to properly address the onset of labor. The twin died because of compres - sion of the umbilical cord. If the mother had gone directly to the hos - pital, FHR abnormalities would have been apparent and timely interven - tion could have been taken. The stillbirth caused the onset of severe emotional distress in the mother leading to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). She had extensive counseling. Her psycholo - gist reported that the patient also suffered from complex grief disorder. PHYSICIAN'S DEFENSE: The ObGyn's actions did not cause the injury. The twins' hearts were monitored at the last prenatal examination and were normal. It was appropriate for the ObGyn to allow the patient to return home before going to the hospi - tal; the situation was urgent but not emergent. The stillbirth resulted from chorioamnionitis, a microscopic condition that is difficult to detect. A pathologist confirmed the diagnosis after examining the placenta. The extent of the patient's grief was contested. An expert psychiatrist reported that complex grief disorder is not a recognized medical condi - tion, and that, upon his examination, the patient did not exhibit PTSD symptoms. VERDICT: A New York defense verdict was returned. Vesicovaginal fistula after hysterectomy A 39-YEAR-OLD WOMAN with a his- tory of 4 cesarean deliveries and an enlarged fibroid uterus underwent TAH. She subsequently developed urinary incontinence. PATIENT'S CLAIM: The ObGyn used an inappropriate dissection technique to remove the uterus, causing a blad - der injury. He also sutured the vagi- nal cuff to the bladder, causing the formation of a vesicovaginal fistula. Repair surgeries were unsuccessful and the patient now is permanently incontinent. PHYSICIAN'S DEFENSE: The standard of care was met. The patient had a pre- existing bladder weakness due to the size of her uterus and prior surgeries. The bladder injury is a known compli - cation of the surgery. The vaginal cuff adhered to the bladder due to post - surgical scarring or fibrosis. VERDICT: A Michigan defense verdict was returned.

NAVIGATION TECHNOLOGY FOR EPIDURAL ANESTHESIA The image-guided spinal navigation technol- a handheld, lightweight, unte- thered ultrasound-based sys- to help apply epidural anes- thesia. Ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice for epidurals in expectant mothers who must avoid the radiation involved in other imaging procedures, according to Rivanna Medical. In a recent trial, Accuro identifi ed the appropriate epidural injection sites along the lower spine and calcu- lated the depth to the epidural space. Actual epidural depth was confi rmed by measuring needle penetration during successful epidural delivery by anesthesia provid- ers. Accuro predicted this depth within an average of 0.61 cm, reports Rivanna Medical. In addition, Accuro identifi ed the appropriate spinal interspace for needle insertion in 94% of patients and enabled 87% success in fi rst-attempt epidural administration.

Doyle, MD; Erin E. Duecy, MD; and Ronald W. Wood, PhD From the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons Farewell to indigo carmine Robert L. Barbieri, MDThere was no difference across the 4 groups in the timing to surgeon confi dence of ureteral patency, or normal saline disten- tion. (range) visual analog scores ureteral patency were phenazopyridine, (P<.001). Th ere was no diff erence across the 4 groups in the timing to surgeon confi dence of ureteral patency, length of cystoscopy (on average, 3 minutes), and development of postoperative urinary tract infections (UTIs). Most dissatisfaction related to phenazopyridine is the fact that the resulting orange-stained urine can obscure the blad- der mucosa. One signifi cant adverse event was a protocol deviation in which 1 patient received an incorrect dose of IV sodium fl uorescein (500 mg) instead of the recom- mended 25-mg dose. Study strengths and weaknesses Th e strength of this study is in its randomized design and power. Its major weakness is sur- geon bias, since the surgeons could not pos- sibly be blinded to the method used. Th e study confi rms the problem that phenazopyridine makes the urine so orange that bladder mucosal lesions and de novo hematuria could be di cult to detect. Recommending mannitol as a hyper- tonic distending medium (as it is used in hysteroscopy procedures), however, may be premature. Prior studies have shown increased postoperative UTIs when 50% and 10% dextrose was used versus normal saline for cystoscopy.1,2 Since the Grimes study pro- tocol did not include postoperative urine col- lection for cultures, more research on UTIs after mannitol use would be needed before surgeons confi dently could use it routinely. In our practice, surgeons prefer that intravenous sodium fl uorescein be admin- istered just prior to cystoscopy and oral phenazopyridine en route to the operating room. I agree that a major disadvantage to phenazopyridine is the heavy orange stain- ing that obscures visualization. Finally, this study did not account for cost of the various methods; standard nor- mal saline would be cheapest, followed by phenazopyridine. WHAT THIS EVIDENCE MEANS FOR PRACTICE This study showed that surgeon satisfac- tion was greatest with the use of mannitol as a distending medium for intraoperative evaluation of compared phenazopyridine, intravenous sodium fl uorescein, normal saline to surgeon confi dence of ureteral patency was similar with all 4 methods. More data are needed related to UTIs and the cost of mannitol compared with the other 3 methods. CHERYL B. IGLESIA, MD References 1.

Maybe, but we need more data. There was a significant difference in surgeon satisfaction with the use of mannitol as a bladder distention medium during intraoperative cystoscopy compared with normal saline infusion, oral phenazopyridine, or intravenous sodium fluorescein in an unblinded randomized trial of 130 women who underwent gynecologic surgery at a single institution.

Iglesia, MD, is Director, Section of Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery, MedStar Washington Hospital Center, and Professor, Departments of ObGyn and Urology, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, DC. Dr. Iglesia is a member of the OBG ManageM ent Board of Editors. Although the incidence of lower uri- nary tract and ureteral injury fol- lowing gynecologic surgery is low, intraoperative identification of ureteral patency can prevent serious long-term sequelae. Since the indigo carmine shortage in 2014, US surgeons have searched for mul - tiple alternative agents. Intravenous methy- lene blue is suboptimal due to its systemic adverse effects and the length of time for dye excretion in the urine. Grimes and colleagues conducted a study to determine if there was any signifi - cant difference in surgeon satisfaction among 4 different alternatives to indigo carmine for intraoperative ureteral patency evaluation. Details of the study The investigators conducted a random- ized clinical trial of 130 women undergoing benign gynecologic or pelvic reconstructive surgery. Four different regimens were used for intraoperative ureteral evaluation: 1) oral phenazopyridine 200 mg, 2) intravenous sodium fluorescein 25 mg, 3) mannitol blad - der distention, and 4) normal saline bladder distention. Study outcomes. The primary outcome was surgeon satisfaction based on a 0 to 100 point visual analog scale rating (with 0 indicating strong agreement, 100 indicating disagree - ment). Secondary outcomes included ease of ureteral jet visualization, time to surgeon confidence of ureteral patency, and occur - rence of adverse events over 6 weeks. Surgeon satisfaction rating. The investi- gators found statistically significant physi- cian satisfaction with the use of mannitol as a bladder distention medium over oral phenazopyridine, and slightly better satisfac - tion compared with the use of intravenous The author reports no financial relationships relevant to this article.
