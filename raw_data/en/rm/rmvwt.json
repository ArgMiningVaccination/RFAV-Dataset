The reports and assessments provide organizations with comprehensive, science-based informati on on common, costly medical conditions and new health care technologies. The EPCs systematically review the relevant scientific literature on topics assigned to them by AHRQ and conduct additional analyses when appropriate prior to developing their reports and assessments. To bring the broadest range of experts into the developm ent of evidence reports and health technology assessments, AHRQ encourages the EPCs to form partnerships and enter into collaborations with other medical and research or ganizations. The EPCs work with these partner organizations to ensure that the evidence reports and technology assessments they produce will become building blocks for health care quality improvement projects throughout the Nation. The reports undergo peer review prio r to their release. AHRQ expects that the EPC evidence report s an d technology assessments will inform individual health plans, providers, and purchasers as well as the healthca re system as a whole by providing important information to help improve health care quality.

Data Sources: MEDLINE\u00ae, EMBASE\u00ae, CINAHL\u00ae and Cochrane Central\u00ae and a variety of CAM specific databases were searched from 199 0 to November 2007. A grey literature search was also undertaken, particularly for clini cal practice guidelines (CPG) related to CAM. Review Methods: Standard system atic review methodol ogy was employed. Eligibility criteria included English studies of adults with back pa in, and a predefined list of CAM therapies. Results: A total of 103 publications were evaluate d; of these 29 did not present CAM therapy use stratified for back pain. There w ere a tota l of 65 utilization studi es, 43 of which were American. Four publications evaluated the concur rent use of four or more CAM therapies and these suggest that chiropractic/m anipulation is the most frequently used modality followed by massage and acupuncture. A limited number of publications evaluated utilization rates within multiple regions of the back and show that CAM was used least for treating the thoracic spine and most for the low back. However, rates of us e of massage were similar for neck and lower back regions. Concurrent use of different CAM or conventional therapies was not well reported. From 11 eligible CPG, only one (for elec tro-acupuncture) provide d recommendations for frequency of use for low back pain of all acuity levels. Eighteen cost publications were reviewed and all but one publica tion (cost-effectiveness) were cost identification studies. There is limited information on the im pact of insurance coverage on costs and utilization sp ecific to back pain. Conclusions: There are few studies evaluating the relativ e utilization of va rious CAM therapies for back pain. For those studies evaluating u tilization of individual CAM therapies, the specific characteristics of the therapy, the providers, a nd the clinical presenta tion of the back pain patients were not adequately detailed; nor was the overlap with othe r CAM or conventional treatments. v Contents Executive Summary........................................................................................................................ 1 Chapter 1.

B ack related pain has a high morbidity and cost burden in the United States (U.S.) and other industri alized countries.1-4 Treatment for this pain can be multidimensional and include conventional care, complementary and alternative medicines (CAM), or both. CAM is comprised of a group of therapies that are considered to be outside the scope of treatment of most conventional practitioners or therapies. The large constellation of treatment modaliti es that constitute CAM are used widely throughout the U.S. and internationally, both by indi viduals who are healthy and t hose who have specific health concerns such as back pain.5,6 Use of CAM therapies can include visits to specific practitioners, as well as self-treatment (for ex ample, when using herbal products, or relaxation techniques). Scope and Purposes of This Systematic Review What CAM therapies are being used for treatmen t of persons with back pain in the United States? (overarching question) 1) What is the relative utilization for the different CAM therapies? i. Does the utilization differ by where the back pain is anatom ically located (i.e., neck, mid-back, low back)? ii. Which therapies are used as com plementar y to conventional care and which are used as alternative? iii. When m ore than one therapy is used for back pain, how are these combined? 2) What is the utilization that is recomme nded by different types of healthcare providers? i. How do these recomm endations compare to th e actual utilization reported in studies from question one? ii. How do the recomm ended and actual utiliz ation reported differ by CAM practitioner type? 3) What are usual costs for these therapies pe r treatm ent and for the prescribed course of treatments? i. How m uch of this cost is covered by insurance or included in health plans? Methods Analytic Framework When considering the use of health services, the traditional understanding of utilization is a visit to a CAM provider or serv ice. However, CAM includes the use of products and practices that m ay not be directed by a CAM provider. As such we adopted the model by Foubadbakhsh and Stommel7 as our analytic framework. This model, adapted specifically for CAM from 1Andersen's behavioral model of healthcare utilization,8 goes beyond provider directed service provision and incorporates CAM resources such as nutritional supplements and self-directed CAM practices such as meditation. Searching and Eligibility Criteria Standard systematic review methodology was em ployed. Traditional bibliographic databases, CAM specific databases and grey literature sour ces were searched from 1990 to November 2007. The traditional medical and allied health databases searched therapy bibliographic databases included: AMED ; Index to Chiropractic Literature (ILC); National Library of Health: Complementary a nd Alternative Micromedex; Eligible studies were limited to those publishe d in English and from 1990 forward. National U.S. population based surveys that probed CA M utilization were searched from 1970 to November 2007. Although our focus was on U.S. utilization of CAM, studies undertaken in Canada, the United Kingdom, Eu rope, Australia, and New Zeal and were also eligible and compared to American patterns of use. Studies were included if they presented info rm ation on the utilization of CAM therapies, CAM practitioners, or costs associated with CAM se rvice use in adults with back pain in the neck, thorax, or lumbar regions. Self-administered home remedies were also included. The use of medical injections, prescription drugs, and back surgery were excluded as were mechanical traction, a variety of exercise techniques, patient education, cognitive behavioral therapy, deep brain therapy and orthoses. There were no rest rictions for primary study designs. Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) were eligible if they focused on back pain and CAM use within the U.S.. Similarly, studies evaluating costs for CAM use in the United States for back pain were included. Results From an initial 8,323 unique citations, 6,667 were excluded during title and abstract screening. T he full text publica tions of 239 citations were retr ieved and 95 of these were excluded as they did not addre ss utilization or costs associat ed with the use of CAM; 103 publications were eligible for da ta extraction. We identified 19 CPG and 8 were excluded as there were no recommendations for optimal util ization. There were 22 pub lications on providers views about CAM and of these 16 were excluded as they did not focus on use. There were 18 studies evaluating the use of CA M therapies and cost outcomes relating to the use of CAM for back pain. Question 1: What is the Relative Utilization for the Different CAM Therapies? From 103 citations, 85 were unique to utilization and nine overlapp ed (total 94) with the cost papers; of these, 29 publications had limited information on utilization as the data were not stratified for persons with back pain. Of the remaining 65 publications, 43 were from the U.S. 2and 22 from other eligible countries. For the purpo ses of this executive summary we have limited our presentation to U.S utilization patterns and trends. Relative Use of CAM Therapies in Persons With Back Pain We identified those publications that presented the re lative use of CAM therapies in order to rank them from the most to least frequently utiliz ed by persons with back pain. We did not select studies where subjects were recruited from the practices of CAM providers, as this would not reflect relative utilization but w ould reflect practice patterns with respect to combining differing CAM therapies. Four U.S. studies9-12 reported utilization data for a minimum of four different CAM therapies or practitioners. All but one9 measured lifetime use of CAM and all subjects had chronic or recurrent back pain. Chiropractor or \"chiropractic\" was the CAM therapy that was most frequently used by patients with chronic low back or combined neck and back pain in three publications.10-12 In one publication9 massage was the most frequently used CAM therapy; massage also ranked as the second mostly freque ntly used therapy in the other publications. Acupuncture was the third most frequently used therapy. When reported, other frequently used modalities were prayer and spirituality and glucosamine. Given the limited number of studies that ev aluated relativ e CAM utilization, we explored patterns for those individual therapies shown to be frequently used by persons with back pain. Chiropractic/Spinal Manipulation Thirty-six publications9-44 on chiropractic/spinal manipulatio n, were undertaken in the U.S. The majority (n = 24) reported on low back pain (LBP) and the fewest on neck (n = 3) and thoracic spine (n = 1). Our review suggests that chiropractic care/sp inal manipulation is commonly sought by patients with back pa in. In the 10 cross-sectional studies9,12-14,18,19,26,29,31,35 based predominately on random or systematic sa mples, rates of utilization varied from 1614 to 45 percent.18 Eligible U.S. trials on LBP populations found that rates of attending for chiropractic/spinal manipulative th erapy range from 10 to 47 percent.9,11,18,19,28,30,32,35,41 The number of visits for chiropractic care or other providers of spinal manipulative therapy varied from a mean of 4.3 to 15.7. 9,19,22-24,28,33 Between 79 and 94 percent of treatment by chiropractors included spinal manipulative therapy.9,11,22,23,28,33,37 Three studies provided some evidence for a gradient of use based on anatomical regi ons; thoracic pain was treated least often,40 followed by the neck, with the low back being the most co mmonly treated.25,40,44 Chiropractors were the providers of spinal manipulative therapy in most publications (n = 34), and physiotherapists in two publications.30,35 Details on the type of spinal manipulation was provided in three only publications.15,24,33 The available information suggests that roughly equal proportions of LBP patients use ch iropractic as complementary to conventional care and as an alternate. Current literature pr ovides little insight into the manner in which chiropractic/spinal manipulation is combined with other therapies for back pa in. Despite the common use of chiropractic/spinal manipulation by patients with back pain the current literature provides limited data on utilization. 3Massage Twelve U.S. publications9,11,12,15,16,18,20,22,23,30,33,44 evaluated the use of massage in persons with back pain. The majority of populations were from specialized clinical practices or from the practices of licensed CAM providers. Two publications16,20 using data from large health claims databases showed low rates of massage utilizatio n for LBP, varying from 4 to 5 percent of the total sample. One study recruiti ng from a population based sample12 reported a massage utilization rate of 14.1 (95 per cent CI, 10.8-17.4) for patients with combined neck and back pain. Publications that evaluated use of massage in smaller samples, s howed rates of use varying from 17 to 52 percent. The timeframe of reported use was one year, with the exception of two studies evaluating lifetime use.11,18 The majority of studies reported on LBP (n = 9) and mostly for chronic pain; one study44 reported on utilization of massa ge for neck pain. Only one publication15 provided any detail as to the type of massage administered, the provider, and use with other CAM therapies, or with conventional care. Acupuncture Eight publications10-12,15,16,18,44,45 evaluated the use of acupuncture in persons with back pain and all but one used self-report methods.16 Two of these studies12,45 were based on randomly selected general population samples and, as expe cted, these showed mark edly lower rates of utilization for both neck and unspecified back (1 to 4 percent) and combined neck and back pain (1 percent). Similar rates of utilization were observed (1 percent) in a study evaluating a large administrative database.16 All other studies based primarily on subjects from clinical practices or with back pain showed higher rates of utilization (7 to 36 percent). Rates of use also varied by the timeframe for recall (12 months to lifet ime prevalence), interval of analysis for administrative databases, and recruitment of subjects from clinical practices. The majority of publications evaluated LBP or unspecified pain, with utilization for neck or com bined neck and back problems being less co mmonly assessed. No clear pattern emerges for utilization rates as a f unction of the anatomical back region. One publication44 reported no difference in the relative frequency of CAM use for neck and back but another45 showed lower rates of use for persons with neck (14 percent) relative to back pain (34 percent). In part this may be due to the limited number of studies, but it ma y also be related to the lower prevalence of neck pain relative to LBP. Only one publication,15 provided any detail as to the specific type of acupuncture, the provider, the overl ap with other CAM therapies, or with conventional care. Question 2: What is the Utilization Recommended by Different Types of Healthcare Providers? From 11 eligible CPG only one46 made specific utilization recommendations for acute, subacute, chronic and recurrent back patient groups. The r ecommended frequency from this CPG46 for electro-acupuncture was for 2 to 3 times weekly for a duration of 4 weeks (acute and subacute) and 6 to 8 weeks (c hronic and recurren t/flare-up). The recommendations were not specific to neck or back problems, and theref ore applied to both of these locations. Although very similar in its recommendations, this guideline distinguishes between u tilization with respect 4to an initial and a c ontinuing course of treatment. The CP G recommends re-evaluation after 12 weeks of treatment irrespective of the acuity of the condition. Six studies47-52 presented information on provider views on utilization, but none specified details with regards to the frequency or duration of treatment. These publications suggest that the frequency of utilization may be influenced by pr ovider organization policies, insurance coverage, access or availability of CAM serv ices, attitudes of the practitioner, and a public versus private practice setting.52 Question 3: What are the Usual Costs for These Therapies per Treatment and for the Prescribed Course of Treatments? Our review identified 18 public ations that were associat ed with costs or econom ic evaluations related to th e use of CAM for back pain in the US. The majority of publications (n = 13) focused on costs associated with CAM services for LBP;16,20,32,37,39,53-60 the remaining studies evaluated unspecified34,36 and combined neck and back pain.61 Fifteen of the publications were not true economic analyses, but rather cost identification studies. A single study57 undertook a complete cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) from the perspec tive of the payer. The majority of publications (n = 13 ) evalu ated chiropractors as the CAM provider.20,32,34,36,37,39,53-55,57-59,61 The conventional providers to which they were compared included medical doctors (M.D.s) (n = 11)16,20,32,34,36,37,53,54,56,59,60 or orthopedic surgeons or internists.53,54 The source of payment for the CAM ther apies in these studies included private health insurance (n = 5),16,32,34,59,61 workers' compensation insurance (n = 4),36,37,39,60 and mixed sources including out of pocket (n = 4).20,53,54,57 The three randomized controlled trials55,56,58 had the study or the participants insurance pay for treatments. All studies included costs of visits to practitioners, but varied w ith respe ct to: a) inclusion of imaging or diagnostic tests, b) visits to specia lists, c) back surgery costs, and d) the use of medications. For studies with workers' compen sation insurance as the payer, some included costs for lost days36,60 while the others excluded these.37,39 There was no clear trend of relative increase or decrease in costs associated with CAM versus conventional services; interpretation across studies is problematic given the differences in items included within the total costs, and the timeframe for which these were estimated. The only study providing a CEA suggested that chiropractic care was cost-effectiv e for chronic pain patients, but variable for acute pain. Three publications20,53,57 were based on samples entirely covered by insurance from private health organizations or workers' compensation. These studies sugge st that a greater portion of patients seeking chiropractic care had no insurance coverage than those s eeking care from an M.D. Discussion In this systematic review we a ddressed a series of broad questions relate d to the utilization of CAM therapies in persons with b ack pain. Unlike previous reviews,62 we found that the majority of studies did differentiate the various type s of CAM with respect to use. However, approximately one-third of the literature on patter ns of use did not report outcomes stratified for those with back pain. Our systematic review identifies the need fo r m ore research to evaluate the relative utilization and trends over time of CAM use specific to persons with back pain. Differentiating 5patterns of relative use for acute versus chroni c/recurrent back pain and the degree to which different CAM therapies are sought would assist in understanding patterns of use within these populations. In general, our findings on utilization of CAM in persons with back pain, highlight the need f or high quality prospective observational studies to establish utilization data by location of complaint, the specific type of CAM therapy linked to specific providers, the degree to which the care is used as complementary or alternative to conventional care, and the degree to which different CAM therapies are combined for an epis ode of care. The widely varying rates of use are related to number of factor s including: the type of sample recruited (i.e., large national sample or smaller practice based sample), the timeframe for recall (i.e., four weeks versus lifetime use), the anatomical region, and the method used to measure utilization. The majority of studies reported on contact utiliz ation (ever using the service or provider) rather than volume utilization (the frequency and duration of visits). The majority of studies also reported on use for the low back and did not evaluate the effects of the duration of the back pain (acute versus chronic) in regards to the reported use of CAM. Our evaluation of U.S. CPG showed very li m ited information on the recommended use of CAM therapies with only a singl e guideline providing utilizati on recommendations. A significant gap with regards to recommended utilization for persons with back pain of differing duration and anatomical region has been identified. In part, this lack of recommenda tions on CAM utilization for back pain may reflect the lack of high qua lity evidence from randomized trials focusing on the optimal dosage for treatment benefit. The majority of studies reporting cost outcome s for the use o f CAM therapies were cost identification analyses and not true economic an alyses; the single study th at undertook a formal CEA showed benefit of chiropractic for chronic LBP alone. More research is required to link costs of CAM therapies to out comes of benefit and harm. As more \"conventional practitioners\" choose to use CAM therapies in their \"conventional\" practices, th e distinction between alternative and traditional is becoming blurred. Future studies should endeavor to specify operational definitions for alternative and c onventional therapies and providers. Conclusions Although we evaluated a large num ber of studies (74 that stra tified data) on u tilization and costs in persons with back pain using CAM therapies, there were significant limitations in understanding the patterns of use across studies. In part the vari ation and incons istencies across studies may be attributable to lack of consen sus on reporting in utilization and other health services studies; future research to establish th ese criteria will contribute to evaluation of use. Our systematic review demonstrates that CAM th erapies are frequently used by persons with back pain. Our findings would support the fo llowing conclusions and recommendations for future research in this area: Population 1) Many studies provided m inimal information a bout the characteristics of the sample. In particular, most reports on utilization of CAM therapies do not specify an operational definition for back pain with respect to the anatomical loca tion, or the duration of pain. We recommend that future studies ade quately detail the st udy subjects under 6investigation and explicitly detail the location of the back pain and its duration (acute or chronic). 2) Low back was the m ost frequently evaluated anatomical region. Fewer studies evaluated the use of CAM for neck and thorax. Alt hough, we recognize that the prevalence of back problems is lower in these regions, our review did not find sufficient evidence to support the differential use of CAM therapies as a functi on of location. We recommend that future utilization studies of CAM use for back pain address any potential differential use of therapies as a function of anatomical location. We also recommend capture of use of CAM therapies for multiple back regions being treated within or across episodes of care, since some CAM therapies treat regions distant from the low back as part of their theoretical m odel of back pain care. Intervention 3) CAM therap ies were frequently identified as br oad categories, with little specification of the type of modality used. Similarly, the providers of the therapies were very poorly detailed or were not linked to the therapies received. We re commend that future studies adequately detail the specific type of CAM therapy, and link this to the providers of the therapy. 4) There were f ew studies that evaluated the use of CAM therapies relative to each other for back pain. The available studies would suggest that chiropractic/manipulation is the most frequently used modality followed by massage and acupuncture. We recommend that future studies evaluating relative use of CAM include a comprehensive list of CAM therapies and provide details in this regard. We recommend th at this use be linked to all providers of the therapy. We also recommend that use with other CAM therapies is differentiated with respect to current and past episodes of back pain. Comparator 5) Concurrent use of different CAM or conve ntional therapies was not well reported. A signif icant gap in the literature has been id entified. We recommend that future studies detail the level of concurrent use of other CAM or conventional therapies with respect to current or past episodes of care, location of back pain, and the pr ovider of the therapy. 6) Our review would suggest that there was in consistency with regards to the types of therapies and providers consid ered conventional or altern ative. W e recommend that future studies explicitly detail the nature of the therapies linked to specific providers rather than relying on labels of conventi onal or alternative th erapies or providers. Outcomes 7) Utilization o f CAM services is generally presented as a dichotomous outcome (use or non-use); less information is available with regards to frequency, duration and type of service provision for an episode of care. We would recommend that future research probe frequency and duration of use (prefe rably in more than one time interval), associated with both the CAM therapy a nd the provider of the therapy. We also recommend that the \"episode of care\" being evaluated be explicitly defined. 8) The prim ary source of information on utiliza tion of CAM therapies for back pain comes from self-report within questionnaires and from retrospective administrative healthcare analyses. We recommend that explicit details of the survey or interview questions are provided including the operational definitions of the CAM therapies and the categories of providers. Similarly, we recommend that explicit definiti ons for the type of back 7pain, the provider types, and the therapy received are provided for studies using administrative databases. 9) The studies reporting cost outcom es are primarily cost identification in nature rather than true economic analyses. The perspectiv e was primarily that of the payer and as such, only direct costs were evaluated. We recommend that future evaluation of costs include details about indirect costs, consider the costs from a societal perspective, and use formal economic analyses that consider the benefits and ha rms associated with intensity of use. Other 10) A single CPG reported on frequency of use as a function of LBP duration. The m ajority of U.S. CPG guidelines on CAM therapie s did not report utilization or recommend parameters for optimal use. A significant gap in the literature has been identified. We recommend that future guideline developm ent attempt to address this gap for CAM therapies as a function of back region and duration; guidelin e developers should indicate when these recommendations are based on evid ence and when they reflect best practice. 11) Few studies were found that reported provider views on recomm endations for the optimal utilization of CAM therapies for b ack pain. Providers' philosophies of care and healthcare setting constraints may affect patt erns of use. We recommend that future studies explore issues in pr ovider and possibly patient views about the frequency and duration of utilization. We r ecommend that these views be explored in th e context of specific subgroups of back patients based on location and duration, different providers of the same CAM therapy, and conventional providers' views of their own interventions and those of CAM providers. 8 Evidence Report 1Chapter 1. Introduction Background The high prevalence rates for neck, thoracic, and low back pain (LBP), indicate the importance of this type of musculoskeletal pain as a public health concer n. Back pain can occur at any age, and is usually recurrent, with subsequent episodes tending to increase in severity;2,3,63,64 this speaks to back pain as an importa nt source of chroni c illness in adults. Although, the majority of back pain episodes resolve within a 6 w eek period, there is a portion of persons with back pain that have significant di sability, resulting in loss of working abilities, restriction of daily activities, and a decline in quality of life.2,3,65,66 Back pain, although most frequently evaluated in adults, is not limited to this population. Even in adolescents suffering from back pain, a significant proportion (up to 40 percent) will have recurrent episodes of sufficient severity to limit usual activ ities, including participation in sports. 67 In general, prevalence rates for back pain ar e lower in younger adults relati ve to middle aged adults, and have not been well evalua ted in elderly subjects.68 Back related pain has a high morbidity burden in adults in the United States (U.S.) and other industrialized countries.1-3 The 3 month prevalence of neck and back pain within the U.S. adult population is 31 percent;64 34 million with LBP, 9 million with neck pain, and 19 million with both. A recent review4 of the costs associated with back pain indicates that it ranked 6th in U.S. national health costs, and as the 4th most expensive health cost for U.S. employers. Additionally, a study using the human capital approach to evaluate indirect costs for back pain, estimated these to be $19.8 billion; higher than those of head ache ($19.6 billion), arthritis ($10.3 billion), and other pain conditions ($11.6 billion) considered in the survey. 66 In 1995 and 1996 the estimated cost of chronic pain (includi ng lost work days, therapy and disability) was $150 billion to $215 billion USD each year.69 This trend of high costs has been observed in other industrialized countries. One cost evaluation undertaken in Sweden demonstrated that th e annual total cost for back and neck problems is equivalent to one percent of the gross na tional product, with the majority of costs due to indir ect care and longterm disability.70 Treatment approaches for back related pain can be multidimensional and include conventional care, com plementary and alternative medicines (CAM), or both. The combined use of conventional and CAM therapie s is known as \"complementary\" th erapy; when this combined care is based on high quality evidence of efficacy and safety is known as \"integrative care\". The large constellation of treatmen t modalities that constitute CAM are used widely throughout the U.S. and internationally both by individuals who are healthy and t hose who have specific health concerns such as back pain.5,6 The use of CAM therapies can include visits to specific practitioners, as well as self -treatment (i.e., when using herbal products, or relaxation techniques). In the literature, CAM therapies ar e inconsistently defined and this may be an important factor in variation in reported prevalence rates.62 In the U.S., there is some evidence to suggest that those suffering from chronic pain are more likely to use CAM therapies or CAM practitioners services, than those without chronic pain.5,71 One of the main reasons that patients seek CAM therapies is for back and neck pain.6,12,71 One Appendixes and evidence tables cited in this report are provided electronically at: http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/ev id ence/pdf/backpaincam/backcam.pdf 11estimate indicates that the adjusted odds ratio predicting use of CAM services is equal to 2.30 (95% CI 1.66 - 3.20) for those with back pain; th e only other condition to exceed this value was anxiety.71 Moreover, Americans who reported having back pain were more likely to see a CAM practitioner (or self-use CAM) compared to th e entire population sampled.5,71 What is CAM? Given the preference of many persons with back pain to use CA M therap ies or CAM practitioner services in the management of their problem, a better understanding of what constitutes CAM therapie s is important. CAM is comprised of a group of therapies that are considered to be outside the scope of treatment of most conventional pract itioners or therapies. The number of therapies and prac titioners classified as CAM, can vary depending on the country, but a recent classification scheme ha s been established within the U.S.72,73 These CAM therapies represent diverse health system approaches, health practices, and products that are not presently considered to be conventional.73 Conventional medicine in the U.S. is practiced by medical doctors, osteopathic doctors, physical therapists, psychologists and registered nurses.73 However, osteopathic physicians do pract ice osteopathic manipulative therapy which can also be considered CAM in nature. This raises the i ssue that an increasing number of conventional practitioners are including what have been traditionally categori zed as CAM therapies in their current clinical practice. There is some confusi on as to whether the practitioner or the therapy should be the basis upon which the treatment is cl assified as alternative or complementary or conventional. This confusion presents some ch allenges to understanding utilization of these therapies. As some of these CAM therapies develop an evidence base and are adopted into the conventional healthcare system as treatment options, the distinction of being CAM may change.73 This may present some ambiguity when c onsidering comparisons between alternative and conventional care; consider the case where 100 percent of th e population uses the \"alternative\" therapy, and as such th e therapy then becomes conventional.74 The World Health Organization has defined CAM as \"a broad set of health practices th at are not part of a country's own tradition, or not in tegrated into its domin ant health care system\".75 As such the definition of what is alternative or complementary may vary by country. The National Center for Complementar y and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)73 classifies most CAM therapies into five domains as follows: 1) manual or mobilization therapies including manipulation and body movement therapies; 2) mind body medicines that include behavioral, psychosocial, and spiritual approaches; 3) chemical or biological based therapies that include the use of natural and biologically based products; 4) energy therapies that us e differing methods to alter energy fields around the body; 5) holistic approach es that have an u nderlying theoretical framework for evaluating and promoting health such as Traditional Chinese Medicine, Homeopathy, and Chiropractic; and finally 6) \"home remedies\" that can include variants of all the therapies listed previously. From a health services perspective, this latter category is often not clearly identified as CAM therapy. 62 There is no consensus regardi ng the classification of these various CAM therapies within the larger domains . However, from a health services research perspective, there is a need to specify the ther apies used rather than identify broadly the CAM domains.62 There may also be a need to distingu ish the \"therapist\" from the \"therapy\". Establishing that a \"naturopath\" provided a sp ecific type of care such as acupuncture is 12important; the dose or subtype of therapy may differ between practitione rs. Whether the public distinguishes between the therapist and the therapy is not always clear. Who Uses CAM? Historically CAM approaches to h ealth care were marginaliz ed by the medical profession in the U.S. A review of population surveys within industrialized countries suggested that CAM users were predominately female, with higher ed ucation and socio-economic status, and of white race.62 This is consistent with patterns of use within the U.S.71,76 A bimodal distribution with regards to use of CAM related to low socio-economic status and et hnicity has also been shown; ethnic minorities, who are gene rally underrepresented in surv eys, typically use CAM on a regular basis.77 In the early 1990's survey data suggested that respondents did not use CAM for serious m edical conditions (denoted as \"principle medica l conditions\"); rather they used it primarily for health promotion and disease prevention.5,78 Amongst the aging American baby boomers, there is increasing awareness that health is not only th e \"absence of disease\", but incorporates the concepts of wellness and lifestyle.79 This is creating a trend towa rds the increased use of CAM which is anticipated to continue, as these ther apies are used to promote health and prevent disease in those who are well. In those who are ill, CAM is used to manage and treat specific health problems. American attitudes towards CAM therapies have changed in part due to g reater media coverage and access to web-based information about specific therapies. Interestingly, chronic back pain patients from urban settings were show n to be willing to try CAM therapies, despite indicating that they kn ew little about the therapy (with the exception of chiropractic and massage); moreover, no relationship was shown be tween high expectations for a particular therapy and previous use or knowledge of the therapy. 18 In the case of chronic back pain, where conventional or allopathic treatments have had limited success, patients are more open to trying CAM therapies. The appeal of many CAM ther apies may be due to dissatisfaction with traditional conventional medical th erapies that may be perceived as more invasive or less effective such as back surgery versus mani pulation. For some, the appeal of some CAM therapies is that they are pe rceived as emphasizing personal au tonomy over one's own health. All of these factors have genera ted greater interest in using CAM therapies, which in turn has resulted in greater CAM availability within c onventional heath care f acilities and places of employment, availability of CA M courses in conventional health professional training centers, and changes in reimbursement in health insurance coverage. What is CAM use and What are the Behavioral Models Explaining This use? Health service utilization is a br oad term that generally refers to the use of a health provider or health service and is gene rally understood to indi cate a visit to a provider or a health service.8,80 This concept of use has been expanded to include the use of CAM therapies that may or may not be directed by a practitioner, such as the use of supplements or other CAM therapies within the home.7 A number of outcomes have been used, predominately from survey-based data, to explore the use of CAM including prevalence rates, costs, patterns of use, changes in use over time, reasons for CAM use, attitudes associated with CAM use, and comparisons of users 13with non-users.81 However, a distinction should be made between outcomes that indicate obtaining a CAM therapy or serv ice and factors that explain why someone chooses to use a CAM therapy or to access a CAM practitioner. The use of health care services has often b een explained by the physical, psychological and social characteristics of the us ers, th e healthcare system, and th e providers within the system. The Andersen model of health service utilization (a nd adapted versions) de scribes patterns and identifies predictors of use.8,82 This behavioral model for the use of health services, is a multi- disciplinary attempt to integrate economic, healthcare-related, socio-cultural, and psychological factors. The model assumes that there is a se quential relationship between three sets of determinants of use: 1) the predisposition to use services (predisposing); 2) the ability to obtain services (enabling); and, 3) perceived (patient) or evaluated (medical) need. The predisposing component relates to demographic, socio-structural, a nd attitudinal-belief vari ables, irrespective of the underlying condition. The enabling component includes both family and community resource variables that are required to seek a nd obtain care. The need component involves an individual's perception of illness and the limita tions that it imposes on daily activity. Health beliefs are attitudes, values and knowledge that peopl e have about health and health services that might influence subsequent perceptions of need and use. Health beliefs in particular can influence use of services in relation to preventati ve health behaviors. Pe rceived need by the user may explain care seeking behaviors and adherence to care. Evalua ted need as determined by the provider can assist in un derstanding the type and amount of treatment used. The Andersen model of health care utilization has been expa nded to include environm ental variables.8 This would include characteristics of the healthcare delivery system such as policies, resources, organization and financial arrangemen ts influencing accessibility, availability, and acceptability of the health services. External e nvironmental factors include the economic climate, relative wealth, politics, level of stress and violence, and prevai ling norms of the society. Finally, the community level environmental variables can include attributes of the community where one lives that enable them to obtain serv ice (availability of practitioners). While the Andersen model of healthcare utilization assumes that use necessarily entails a visit to a healthcare provider or he alth service, Fouladbakhsh and Stomm el7 have proposed an alternative categorization of CAM therapies and activities and in turn a new model for conceptualizing health service use. Their mode l not only includes the CAM provider, but also \"use\" with regards to \"products and resources\" (i.e., the use of herbs, supplements, self-help manuals, etc.) and CAM practices (individual or communal direction of th erapy). The developers of this new model argue that these expanded cat egories can be integrated with the Andersen model and serve to enhance the framework to im prove prediction of CAM use. The new model, adapted specifically for CAM s till includes predisposing, enabling, and need factors to explain healthcare use. It also allows for evaluation of th e concurrent use of conven tional health services. Evaluating the Methodological Quality of Studies Addressing Utilization of CAM Much of the literature evaluating utilization of CAM services is collected from patient or practitioner recall surveys, chart review, or analysis of administ rative health claim databases.83 Moreover, many studies evaluating utilization employ observational designs without a true control or concurrent group. These study de signs and methods of data collection, lend 14themselves to consistent biases, in particular, recall bias and the limitations of using records from charts or databases that were not designed for research purposes. Many utilization studies are base d on data from questionnaire s which rely on self-reported CAM use which results in a number of important biases, including bias related to the selection of participants, recall bias , and reporting biases.80 Factors that may affect accuracy of reporting include: 1) recall time-frame, 2) type of utiliza tion, 3) utilization frequency (number of visits, and event repetition), 4) questionnai re design, 5) mode of data coll ection, and 6) memory aids or probes used to evaluate the quality of survey studies.84 Similarly, for studies reporting utilization base d on health claim admini strative databases or health record review studies, there are a number of limitations to using this retrospective data. For studies within the U.S., it is likely that pa tients who are not covered or with insufficient medical coverage will be less likely to seek servi ces; as such there is the potential for selection biases despite large claimant samples.85 Potential sources of bias in clude incomplete or miscoded health diagnosis, the type of health treatment, and patient characteristics; this in turn may lead to misclassification and errors with any subsequent linkages.85,86 An alternative approach to evaluating ge neral service use is based on the National Am bulatory Medical Care Survey. This methodology collects service visit characteristics close to the time of each patient encounter.87 This allows for standardized collection of visit data immediately after individual patient encounter s, minimizes problems of long term provider recall, limits the artifacts of chart documentation focuse d on insurance reimbursement requirements, and avoids the pitfalls of re trospective administrative data analysis. The biases identified thus far are related primar ily to the m ethods used to collect outcomes, but there are additional sources related to the design of the studies. Many studies evaluating health service utiliza tion are based on cross- sectional and other observational study designs. These designs are prone to selection, information and reporting biases. Also problematic is the prevalent use of observational st udy designs that do not have a control group and do not have standardized criteria for assessment. In the context of evaluating the literature wi th respect to CA M use and back pain, it is important to consider all of th ese potential sources of bias. As we expected, there were some challenges when evaluating methodological quality given the differing designs and outcomes. Research Questions The research questions for this systematic review were developed in conjunction with NCCAM, the stakeho lder partner for this research . The focus is to evaluate the utilization of CAM therapies, irrespective of th e provider (conventional or alternative) for persons with back pain (BP). The efficacy and safety of the vari ous CAM therapies are not evaluated within this study; rather the focus is on patterns of use and cost s. Although, the main interest of this review was utilization within the U.S., patterns from Canada, United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand were also evaluated and compared to those in the U.S. The findings of this evidence review will assist in identifying research priorities for CAM utiliza tion within the U.S. The questions a ddressed in this review are as follows: 15What complementary and alternative medi cine (CAM) therapies are being used for treatment of persons with back pain in the United States? (overarching question) 1) What is the relative utilization for the different CAM therapies? i. Does the utilization differ by where the BP is anatom ically located (i.e., neck, mid- back, low back)? ii. Which therapies are used as com plementary to conventional care and which are used as alternative? iii. When m ore than one therapy is used for back pain, how are these combined? 2) What is the utilization that is recomme nded by different types of healthcare providers? i. How do these recomm endations compare to th e actual utilization reported in studies from question one? ii. How do the recomm ended and actual utilization reported differ by CAM practitioner type? 3) What are usual costs for these therapies pe r treatm ent and for the prescribed course of treatments? i. How much of this cost is covered by insurance or included in the insurance health plan? 161Chapter 2. Methods Analytic Framework The traditional understanding of util ization of health s ervices is a visit to a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) provider or a CAM service. However, CAM includes the use of products and practices that may not be directed by a CAM provider. As such, we adopted the model by Foubadbakhsh and Stommel7 (Figure 1). The model is based on Andersen's8 behavioral model of healthcare utilization but has been adapted for CAM therapies in that healthcare utilization goes beyond provider directed serv ice provision to incorporate CAM resources such as nutritional supplements and se lf-directed CAM practices like meditation. This model, like the Andersen model, attempts to account for factors that explain or predict utilization; however, the focus of this re view is limited to reporting utilization.

For the purposes of this review, the adap ted m odel of health service utilization by Foubadkhsh and Stommel, permits inclusion of studies that describe self-administered resources and self-directed practices as le gitimate use of CAM therapy. Scope of the Literature Search Traditional bibliographic databases, CAM specifi c databases and grey literature sources were search ed from 1990 to November 2007. Utilizati on studies were limited from 1990 forward to reflect relatively current patterns of utilization within the U.S. The search terms used for CAM therapies were broad and comprehensive as we did not want to pre-judge which therapies are Appendixes and evidence tables cited in this report are provided electronically at http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/ev id ence/pdf/backpaincam/backcam.pdf 17used for back pain. The traditional medical databases searched included; MEDLINE\u00ae; Alternative therapy bibliographic database s included: AMED; Index to Chiropractic Literature (ILC); National Library of Health: Complementary and Alternative Mantis; Micromedex; Agricola; and addition, a grey literature search was unde rtaken using general and specialty search engines (Google, Scirus, Dogpile, Complete Planet ) as well as targeting particular health-related websites such as the National Clearinghouse for Guid elines. A complete list of websites searched and detailed search strategies can be found in Appendix A. The reference list s of eligible studies were also evaluated for relevant articles. Eligibility Criteria Publication details Inclusion Language: Limited to English language Publica tion Date: 1990 forward - We also searched from 1970 forward for population-based national surveys that m ay have probed CAM and back pain Exclusion Publica tions that are editorials, lette rs, comments, opinions, abstracts only. Country Inclusion For all research questions: Studies or C linical Practice Guidelines (C PG) undertaken within the United States For the research que stion on utilization Studies undertaken within Canada, the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia and New Zealand . We selected this subset of countri es as they are representative of industrialized countries with a public and private mix of he althcare funding and similar healthcare models of conventional care. Exclusion Studies undertaken in countries other th an those listed in the inclusion list Intervention (CAM Therapies) We consulted the list developed by the Co mm ittee on the use of CAM by the American Public to develop our search terms.88 Note that these therapies can be applied by practitioners or through self-directed practice. Also note that we did not restrict the CAM therapy by the type of provider (see population below), rath er we categorized these as c onventional or alternative. The main categories of CAM therapies are listed below: Chemical orientation (with arom atherapy and phytotherapy) Inclusion botanicals foods 18 supplements diet therap ies We grouped these CAM interventions to reflect their intended biological actions (for exam ple anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxants, etc.) and by the entry route (oral/ dermal/ percutaneous/, injection, suppository, inhalant, infusion) Exclusion There were two primary exclusions related to chemical orientation, and these included drug therapies and m edical in jections. Although commonly used in th e management of back pain, the use of this particular conventional therapy with CAM was not of interest in this review.

However, we are including CAM therapies such as \"home remedies\" or \"self-administered' CAM therapies such as prayer, or supplements (Figure 1). Inclusion Research Q1: Utilization of CAM therapies can encompass Prevalen ce rates of CAM therapy use or prov ider visit for a specified time interval (this includes reported proportion of the tota l number of patients seeking care from a CAM practitioner for back pain). Frequency of visits or use of CAM therapies or provider Tim ing of visits (if possible in relation to the pain inception) Duration of use of CAM therapy for period surveyed Duration of each vis it Research Q2: Recommended use of CAM therapies for back pain Recommendations regarding use of CAM focusing on the frequency or duration of trea tment Research Q3: Costs associated with CAM th era pies specific to the United States Direct costs for patient in cluding C AM practitioner fees, diagnostic costs, therapy costs (needles, remedies, etc.) Direct non-therapy related costs for pa tient (transportation costs, costs of accom panying patients, etc.) 22 Direct costs for provider (space and equi pment provisions, ancillary staff, office costs, etc.) Indirect costs for patient (tim e off work to attend therapy, etc.) Induced costs for patient (adverse reactions due to CAM therapy) Exclusion Non-utilization or cost outcom es such as measures of clinical efficacy or effectiveness Data Collection and Reliab ility of Study Selection A team of study assistants traine d in the eligibility criteria for title and abstract screening were assem bled. Standardized forms (Appendix B) and a guide manual explaining the criteria were developed from previous templates used in reviews for the Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ) reviews; these forms were constructed within Systematic Review Software (SRS 3.0 (TrialStat Corporation, Ottawa, Ontari o Canada). Two reviewer s were required to achieve consensus on the identi fication, selection, validity an d abstraction of articles and information. Disagreements that could not be resolved by consensus were resolved by a member of the investigative team. The level of agreement on inclusion of reports (full text) between observers was measured using a kappa statistic. Quality Criteria We anticipated that most of the eligible stud ies w ould be observational designs without a true control or concurrent group. More over, we anticipated that much of the utilization data would be collected by patient and practitione r recall surveys, and chart review or analysis of administrative health claim databases. In general, these methods suffer from recall bias and limitations inherent in records or databases not desi gned for research purposes. Given the nature of the study designs, and the means used to collect utilization data, a standardized quality crite ria checklist specific to observational designs with control groups c ould not be applied to this literature. For studies evaluating utilization, we focused on the means used to collect utilization outcom es as the basis of determining the potential fo r bias. We identified st udies that used self- report via questionnaire or interv iew and evaluated these with respect to the following: 1) the selection of participants, 2) re sponse rate, 3) recall time-frame, 4) questionnaire design (pre- testing), and 5) mode of questionnaire data collection. For studies using chart review or administrativ e databases we considered the following: 1) m anner in which patients or visi ts were identified, and 2) desc ription of data linkages between use and patient identifiers. For clinical practice guidelines that provided utilization data , we selected the use of the AGREE instrum ent for quality assessment.89 Studies that were true economic evaluations (only those classified as cost-utility analyses, cost-effectiveness analyses, cost-minimization analyses, cost-benefit analyses, and cost-consequences ) were evaluated for quality. Standardized methodological criteria for economic analyses are available and th e Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) was selected to evaluate quality.90 23 Summarizing the Findings Descripti ve and Analytic Approaches Data were collected on the sample size, characteristics of the populati on(s) studied, type of back pain evaluated, the definition of an episode of care, type of CAM intervention and utilization outcom es assessed. St andard evidence tables were developed. We used a qualitative synthesis to evaluate the quality of the studies elig ible for this review. Subgroup s ynthesis. We divided the eligible citations into U.S. versus non-U.S. studies. Furthermore, we evaluated eligible studies di vided into subgroups base d on: a) anatomical location of the back pain and utilization, and b) the types of therapies used concurrently and which of these are used as complementar y versus those used as alternative. We ask the reader to note the di stin ction between public ations and studies. Some of the eligible publications are related to each other and are of ten termed companion studies. These companion publications may be based entirely or in part on patient cohort data. In general, these companion studies present subgroup analyses, re-analyses, or secondary analys es (linking previous data with new utilization data). In some cases the citatio ns were related because of subsequent follow-up collection. Consensus on a convent ion to show the relationships between such publications (differing analyses on the same patient cohort) does not exist; so me consider these analyses in and of themselves to be \"new studies\". For th is reason, we have selected to use the term publications to specify the number of eligible studies. We attempt to alert the reader when publications are companion in nature and to specify the nature of the relationship. 24 Chapter 3. Results From an initial inclusion of 8,347 unique citations, 8,108 were excluded as they were not on topic, not English language publicat ions, or not undertaken within the countries of interest (see Figure 2). T he remaining 239 were identified as potentially being a bout complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) a nd about utilization, costs, pa tient or provider views, recommendations about optimal frequency and dura tion of visits, or clin ical practice guidelines (CPG). The full text publications for these 239 citati ons were retrieved and from these 95 were excluded as not addressing utiliz ation, costs, or recommendati ons for use of CAM. Following full text screening, we further excluded non-U.S. publications for cost-related outcomes (n = 19), as comparability with American costs for CAM use would be limited. Our complete eligibility criteria were met by 103 publicati ons for utilization, recommendations, and costs related to CAM use. We partitioned CPG reports or publications rela ted to recomm ended use of CAM (Figure 2). From these, eight CPG were excluded as not providing any specifi c recommendations on CAM use for back pain. Additionally we separated prim ary publications (n = 22) of provider or patient views about CAM utilization. Eighteen of these publications on provider or patient views were excluded as these did not provide informati on on \"recommended\" use of CAM therapies. We grouped eligible publica tions according to their pr im ary focus on utilization, recommendations for frequency of use, or costs a ssociated with use of CAM; these publications were further divided into those undertaken within the U.S. and those from the other countries eligible for this systematic re view. Figure 2 shows the overlap. 1 Appendixes and evidence tables cited in this report are provided electronically at http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/ev id ence/pdf/backpaincam/backcam.pdf 25 26 Figure 2.

What is the Relative Utilization for the Different CAM Therapies? A total of 94 publications provided some info r mation on utilization specifying either the prevalence of visits to CAM practitioners or more detailed service use based on specific therapies. These include publications based both within the U.S. and within other eligible countries including: Canada , United Kingdom, Europe, Au stralia, and New Zealand. Approximately one-third of the publications presented utilization of CAM but did not stratify these results specifically for persons with back pain. The remaining publications were partitioned to address: 1) relative utilization of CAM therap ies evaluated concurrently , 2) trends over time, and 3) individual CAM therapy utilization for the most prevalent provider-based CAM therapies. There was significant overlap of publications am ong the research questions addressed in this review. The majority of publica tions (52 of 65) reported some aspect of use related to chiropractors, or chiropractic, or manipulati on, or mobilization. Despite the overlap we summarize findings and quality assessment for each section and for the utilization publications as a whole. Utilization of CAM, Data not Stratified by Back Pain or Therapy Twenty-nine publications did not stratify CAM utilization data with resp ect to use by persons with back pain. Rather than ex clude these publications, we chose to identify and detail som e aspects of these studies; many of these publications are recognized as contributing significantly to our current understanding of CAM utilization. Ou r intention was to highlig ht that these studies were lacking in utilization results specific to pe rsons with back pain, despite being the sources that originally identif ied back pain patients as a key popul ation that utilize CAM services. Similarly, we wished to highlight that several of the non-stratified studies evaluated different subgroups of persons that experience significant back pain related to spinal co rd injuries, cancer, or pregnancy. Nineteen publications6,47,71,76,91-105 were based on utilization data from the U.S. and 10 publications106-115 were from other eligible countries. Utilization not Stratified by Back Pain Within the United States Several American studies are seminal works based on large national sam ples6,71,76,98,99,102,105 that surveyed CAM utilization and established that back and neck pain were important reasons for seeking CAM treatments. However, the utiliz ation data presented di d not link the specific type of CAM therapy to persons with back pain; rather the prev alence of back pain within the samples was reported. Four publications101-104 were based on the same study cohort, representing survey results from a national sample. Three publications focused on persons with sp inal cord injuries. Two of the publications92,93 on spinal cord injury patients showed that back and neck pain wa s frequently a major source of their chronic pain (varying from 46 to 75 percent) , but did not present stra tified CAM utilization information. One study92 reported utilization of CAM combin ed with medical injections to manage pain. One study91 evaluated the use of CAM for cancer and other chronic pain in American Veterans. Other publications identified CAM use within patients presenting to the emergency 27 department,95 a specialized CAM clinic within a university hospital,100 or concurrent use of CAM in patients attending outpa tient physiotherapy departments.96 Another study97 indicated the use of mind body therapies among patients with musculoskeletal pain. One study47 assessed the use of CAM by pregnant women; although rates of back pain are very high within this population, the publication did not specify the trimes ter or whether or not the whole sample was experiencing back pain at the time of the study. Summary of U.S. publications on utiliz ation no t stratified by back pain. Nineteen publications were based on utiliz ation data from the U.S. A lthough, these establish that back pain was an important symptom for which patients sought services, they do not present results on utilization of CAM therapies stratified for pers ons with back pain. Several studies evaluated subgroups of patients with non-musculoskeletal re lated back pain and w ould suggest that CAM therapies are commonly used by these populations. Utilization not Stratified by Back Pain Within Other Countries There were 10 publications from other eligible c ountries that did not present utilization data stratified for persons with back pain. One study106 evaluated neck and shoulder pain in newspaper workers, another th e general population in Canada.115 Three publications108,110,111 evaluated physiotherapy outpatients and another107 patients at osteopathic clinics. One study109 evaluated the use of a chiropractic activator and another, general popu lation with back pain in the United Kingdom.114 Another study evaluated persons with spinal cord inju ries in Sweden.112 Finally, one study evaluated the general population in Spain.113 Summary of non-U.S. publications on utilization not stratified by back pain. Ten publications were based on utiliza tion data outside the U.S. No clear pattern em erges from these studies; there are differences in populations, pr oviders, and CAM therapies evaluated that contribute to this heterogeneity. Relative use of CAM Therapies We identified publications that presented the re lative frequency of CAM utilization in order to rank the most to least frequently used therap ies by persons with back pain. We identified four U.S.9-12 and four non-U.S. publications116-119 that reported utilization da ta for a minimum of four different CAM therapies or practitioners. An additional study30 reporting more than four CAM therapies provided solely by a physical ther apist, was not incl uded in this grouping. Electrotherapies provided by conventional providers (such as physical therapists) were defined as non-CAM therapy; however, this publication provi ded utilization data fo r spinal manipulation and is detailed in the specific CAM therapy section below. We did not select publications where subjects were recruite d from the practices of CAM providers. The utilization patterns described within thes e studies would reflect practice patterns of concurrent CAM therapies and not that of re lative utilization of CAM services. For example, utilization of differing CAM th erapies reported from subjects cu rrently receiving care by a chiropractor would reflect the manner in whic h this particular CAM practitioner combines various CAM modalities rather than the frequenc y with which persons with back pain would choose to use one CAM therapy over another. The manner in which CAM therapies are concurrently combined for treatment is describe d within the specific CAM therapy sections that follow. 28 Table 1 compares reports of the use of four or more different CAM therapies for back pain. Note that the proportion of use was not exclusiv e to a single category; most subjects reported using more than one CAM therapy for lifetime us e. What was generally not specified within these publications was the order in which CAM th erapies were selected for single or multiple episodes of care. Relative Utilization of CAM Therapies Within the United States Of the four U.S. publications for which rela tiv e utilization could be evaluated, all but one9 measured lifetime use of CAM (Table 1). All su bjects within these publications had chronic or recurrent back pain. The sample sizes for those seeking care varied from 186 to 2,374 subjects. A single study9 reported the use of CAM th erapies for a subgroup of th e chronic back patients (69 percent seeking care within the last 6 months); the other publications reported on CAM use for the entire study sample with back pain. One publication12 reported on combined neck and back pain and the remaining ones on LBP. A single publication12 was based on a randomly selected population sample and another on North Carolina residents.9 The remaining publications were based on patients with chronic pain.10,11 All publications evaluated util ization with respect to the proportion of patients who used any of several CAM therapies and all but one study10 reported on the percent accessing at least one CAM provider. Table 1 shows the relative utilization ra tes acro ss the four U.S. publications. Chiropractor/chiropractic was the CAM therapy that was most frequently used by patients with chronic LBP or combined neck and back pain.10-12 In one study9 massage was the most frequently used CAM therapy; massage was also highly utilized in the other publications ranking second most frequent (Table 1). Although the us e of ultrasonography, electrotherapy, and heat and cold modalities was high (18 to 68 percent), the provider of these therapies was not specified and treatment may have been provided by non- CAM practitioners. Other frequently used modalities were prayer and spirituality (27 to 42 percent) and glucosamine (26 to 46 percent); but these were reported in only two of the four publications. Bo th prayer and glucosamine were likely to be self-administered. It is probable that the empty cells within Table 1 can be accounted for by differences in study protocols with rega rds to which, of many potential CAM therapies, were probed. Three publications9-11 specified that there was overlap in use of the various CAM therapies, but type of therapy overlap was not detailed. One study12 indicated that more than one CAM practitioner may have provided the therapy in the estimates of utilization. Similarly, overlap with conventional providers was not st ratified for specific CAM ther apies; a single study specified overlap with chiropractors alone but not other CAM practitioners.9 Summary of relative utilization of CAM therapies in pers ons with back pain in the U.S. There are a lim ited number of publications (n = 4) based on population-based samples that show the relative use of CAM therapie s in persons with back pain. Tw o of these publications recruited subjects from large general population-based samp les, and two recruited samples with chronic LBP. In general, these public ations show that ch iropractic/spinal manipulation is the most frequently utilized provider based CAM ther apy followed by massage and acupuncture. Prayer and herbals and food supplements were also fr equently used (self-practiced) CAM therapies although they were only evaluated in half the publications. Differences in study protocols for probing the type of CAM therapie s used likely account for missing utilization data from the range of CAM services available in Table 1. Ra tes of utilization may also vary because of 29 differences in populations and in location of back pain. The methodological quality of these four studies is generally good with mini mal biases and valid results. Relative Utilization of CAM Therapies Outside the United States Three publications116-118 evaluating CAM use in Canadians and one119 in Australians provided information on at least f our different therapies (Table1). These publications evaluated a combination of neck and back pain,116,117 unspecified back pain,118 or LBP.119 Two companion publications116,117 reported utilization with resp ect to the proportion of back pain patients using specific CAM therapies rather than the proportion relati ve to all persons with back pain. Three publications116-118 found chiropractic to be the most frequently used modality/practitioner, with massage in second place (Table 1). In another study119 massage was the most frequently used CAM therapy. Acupunc ture was the third most frequently used modality in two studies.116-118 The use of prayer and spiritua lity was reported in three of the publications but varied significan tly. The use of herbals and food supplements was reported in a single study.116,117 These resources were excluded from th e operational definition of CAM within another study.118 Two related publications116,117 did not specify complementary or combined CAM therapy use. Two publications118,119 evaluated patients with back pain alone and presented the degree of overlap with other CAM therapies. One of these publications118 showed a degree of overlap with conventional providers that va ried from 6 percent with any physician to 1 percent with specialists; similarly, overlap wi th other conventional providers varied from 2 percent with physiotherapists to 0.3 percent with psychologists. Summary of relative utilization of CAM th erapies in pers ons with back pain. There are four publications based on population-based sa m ples that show the relative use of CAM therapies in persons with back pain outside th e U.S. These publications reported predominately on combined or unspecified back pain of variable duration. All publica tions undertaken outside the U.S. were based on larger, randomly select ed, population-based samples. Three of these publications show that chiropractic/spinal manipul ation is the most freque ntly utilized provider- based CAM therapy followed by massage and acupuncture. Prayer and herbals and food supplements were also frequently utilized CAM therapies although the rates of use were highly variable. Differences in study prot ocols with regards to probing the type of CAM therapies used likely account for missing utilization data from th e range of CAM services available in Table 1. Rates of utilization may also vary because of the differing populations, as duration and location of back pain were combined or not specified in these studies. In genera l, these cross-sectional studies are rated as high quality w ith few biases and valid results. Trends in CAM Utilization We identified 10 publications within the U.S. 5,19 and other countries112,117,120-125 containing data on the trends across time in the utilizati on of CAM interventions for back and neck pain. These papers were published between 1996 and 2007 and examined trends between 1962 and 2006. They had various designs and included patients with neck and/or back pain. Specifics regarding these publicati ons are located in summary Tables 2 and 3. 30 Trends in Utilization With in the United States For those with LBP only, study19 showed that in 1987, 41 percen t used chiropractic medicine and in 1997, 31 percent. Anothe r study found that in 1990, 36 pe rcent of individuals with unspecified back pain used a CAM therapy wh ile 20 percent saw a CAM practitioner; in 1997, 48 percent used CAM for back pain wh ile 30 percent saw a CAM practitioner.5 This same study found that in 1997, 57 percent of in dividuals with neck pain used a CAM therapy and 37 percent saw a CAM practitioner.5 Summary of trends in CAM utilization within the U.S. The limited literature on trends over tim e would suggest that utilization of chir opractic/spinal manipulatio n for LBP in the U.S. has decreased, while the use of CAM generally has increased, although data on specific CAM therapies was not reported. More research is required to highli ght trends in the utilization of CAM therapies for back pain in the U.S. Trends in Utilization Outside the United States One study of LBP patients in the United Kingdom found that osteopathy was used by 49 percent of patients over an 18 m onth period.122 Note that osteopathy practices outside of the U.S. may differ in the types of CAM therapies admi nistered. Another study found that over a 4-year period acupuncture was used for LBP by 9 percen t of patients from teaching hospitals and 32 percent of patients from general hospitals.125 One study from the Netherlands found that between 1989 and 1992, physical therapists (PT) administering massage and passive mobilizations were used by 12 percent of those suffering from LBP. This increased to 15 percent in 2002 to 2003. 121 A Canadian study found that between 1996 and 2002 glucosamine was used by 5 percent of men and 10 percent of women with back pain. 120 A study from Norway found that in 1992, 59 percent of non-referred and 62 percent of refe rred chiropractic patients had LBP.124 For those suffering from neck and back pai n, in C anada, \"in the past 12 months\" the following utilization rates of CA M therapies were reported: chiropractic care 61 percent; massage 39 percent; acupuncture 30 percent; energy healing 16 percent; yoga 14 percent; relaxation techniques 10 percent; and prayer/spiritual practice 5 percent.117 In Denmark, between 1962 and 1999 patients visiting chiroprac tors increased by over 7 percent for the primary complaint of LBP alone, decreased by almo st 9 percent for LBP with sciatica; increased by over 3 percent for neck pain, and remained essentially the same for neck and arm pain.123 Summary of trends in CAM utilization outside the U.S. The limited literature on trends in countries outside the U.S. woul d suggest that utilization rate s differ between countries and between specific CAM interventions. More research is required to determine the extent of these differences. No data were reported on the usual co sts for these therapies per treatment or for the prescribed course of treatments. Specific CAM Therapy Utilization: Acupuncture Eighteen publications provided data on utilization of acupuncture by back pain patients. Of these, e ight were specific to the U.S.;10-12,15,16,18,44,45 two of these publications were based on the same sample.15,44 Ten publications provided utilizati on outcomes from other eligible countries;51,116-119,125-129 one publication117 was a companion to a previous study116 as it 31 incorporated the findings of the in itial survey and utilization from a resampling of new subjects 6 years later. The variation in the samples recru ited for these studies is noteworthy and includes subjects from large population-based surveys or administrative databases and subjects from sm all clinical practices, or populations limited only to patients with back pain. As expected, the estimates of utilization varied substantially ba sed on the type of denomi nator used to estimate prevalence. Acupuncture Utilization Within the United States There were eight U.S. publicati ons that provided data on acu puncture utilization in persons with back pain. Three of these were of cross-sectional design using interviews.12,18,45 Three publications from two study cohorts used a sing le group prospective cohort study design based on interviews15,44 and self-administered questionnaires.11 One study was a retrospective design using data from a health claims database16 and another was a random ized controlled trial10 that used a self-administered questionn aire to evaluate use of CAM. Two publications12,45 reported CAM utilization based on samples from the general population. Two publications recrui ted subjects from health claims databases in Washington state.16,18 Two publications15,44 randomly sampled licensed acupunc turists and patients in their practices from seven states, including Wash ington and Massachusetts. One study recruited subjects from large urban specialty clinics for orthopedic or neurosurgery consultation11 and another recruited a small sample of back pain subjects who had access to the internet.10 Utilization was primarily defined as a visit to an acupunctu rist or having received or \"ever tried\" acupuncture based on self-report with or without information from health records. Three publications queried use \"w ithin the last 12 months\",10,12,45 three11,18,45 reported \"lifetime\" use, two15,44 reviewed visits to practi tioner over a 1-year interval. Only one of the publications15 provided any detail as to the type of acupuncture administered. This same study was the sole publication to prov ide information about the mean duration of the visits (60 minutes) but it did not specify the frequency of visits ove r the course of treatment. The training or type of acupunc turist was specified as \"licensed acupuncturist\"15,18,44 in three publications; the remaining elig ible publications provided no further details about the practitioner. Acupuncture utilization based on anatomical region. Tables 4A to 7A show utilization of acupuncture in the U.S. specific to neck pain (n = 2), unspecified b ack pain (n = 4), LBP (n = 3) and com bined back and neck pain (n = 1). Neck pain utilization was reported in two publications from general population samples and the use of acupuncture varied from 7 to 14 percent of persons with neck pain of unspecified severity and duration. Four publications reported utilization for unspecified b ack pain (Table 5A) and found widely varying rates for the use of acupuncture, from 2 pe rcent (recurrent but no t disabling back pain from small sample) to 34 percent (s everity and location not specified). 44,45 10,15,44,45 Similarly, the three publications evaluating the use of ac upuncture for LBP patients (Table 6A) showed rates ranging from 3 to 11 per cent of the total sample of subjects; two of these publications indicate the back pain was chronic in nature. One study (Table 7A) reported acupuncture use for patients with combined neck and back pain an d showed a utilization rate of 0.9 percent (95 percent CI, 0-1.9), and an estimated total of 1.6 million visits (mean of 2.6 visits); this study also reported no difference in the relative frequency of CAM use by location of the back pain. However, a single study that segregated rates for persons with neck and back 11,16,18 11,18 12 45 32 pain found that acupuncture was used more freque ntly for back pain than for neck pain (34 versus 14 percent). It is important to note whether the denominator used to estimate utilization was based on the entire sample enrolled or just a specific subset of patients with back pain . Two studies12,45 were based on general population samples and, not surprisingly, showed markedly lower rates of acupuncture utilization for both neck and unspecified back (1 to 4 percent) and combined neck and back pain (1 percent) than studies that recruited smaller samples of persons all of whom had back pain. Acupuncture use as complementary care or combined with other CAM. The majority of publications did not collect or report sufficient information to determine concurrent use of conventional with CAM therapies for back pai n. Two publications provid ed information on use with conventional care but were not specifi c to those responde nts with back pain44 or specific to those receiving acupuncture12 (Table A2 and A4). Although not st ratified for persons with back pain, up to 53 percent of acupuncture patients sa w a medical or osteopath ic physician, but only 10 percent of persons with back pain reported speaking to their doctor about using acupuncture.44 Another study12 suggested that CAM alone had been used by 29 percent of persons with back and neck pain; however, this was not specific to those receiving acupuncture. Most studies did not report concurrent or combined use of different CAM therapies in a detailed m anner. Overall, when conventional or combined therapy details were reported, the results were not stratified with respect to using acupuncture or specifically for those with back pain (Tables 4B to 7B). There was one exception15 and this publica tion indicated that acupuncture was used predominately with other CAM therapies such as east Asian massage, cupping, heat, and herbs. Quality assessment of U.S. acupuncture publications. Only one10 of the eight U.S. publications on the utilization of acupuncture for back pain used a study design with a true comparator group; as such the focus of our quality assessment is on the potential for selection and reporting biases. All but a single publication 16 are based on self-repo rted utilization and therefore subject to reca ll bias; heterogeneity with respect to survey versus interview and the types of CAM services queried are also important sources of reporting bias. Two12,45 of three cross-sectional publications were of high quality, repo rting CAM utilization based on random sampling of the general populati on with adequate response rates (74 and 63 percent respectivel y). The third study18 recruited subjects from a health database and then subsequently interviewed them. This study had a low response rate (36 percent) and had the potential for selection bias as the eligible sa mple had to have back pain (44 percent were ineligible due to no longer having back pain ). One study, based on a la rge health insurance claims database, would also be considered high quality as it us ed standardized coding for back pain classification, provide r visits, and treatments.16 There is greater potential for selection bias in studies using samples obtained from provider clinics. Two publications15,44 randomly sampled licensed acupuncturists using a recruitment strategy based on the National Ambulatory Me dical Care Survey. This methodology collects service visit characteristics cl ose to the time of each patient encounter thereby minimizing longterm provider recall, errors from chart ex traction, and retrospectiv e administrative data analysis. The two remaining studies recruited chronic back pain subjects who had been referred for orthopedic or neurosurgery consu ltation or from urban specialty clinics11 and a small sample of back pain subjects w ho had access to the internet.10 As noted previously, the rates of use for patients already seeking treatment differ from thos e in the general populati on; additionally, those already seeking CAM therapy services may possess inherent differences in defining characteristics that are not easily determined in the absence of comparison groups. 33 Across all eight U.S. publications , the methodological quality is rated as fair, indicating that they are susceptible to some biases but these, being somewhat endemic to self-report, are not sufficient to negate the results. Summary of utiliz ation for back pain for U.S. acupuncture publications. Eight publications evaluated the use of acupuncture in pers ons with back pain and all but one used self- report m ethods.16 Two of these studies12,45 were based on randomly selected general population samples and, as expected, these showed markedly lower rates of utilization for both neck and unspecified back (1 to 4 percent) and combined n eck and back pain (1 percent). Similar rates of utilization were observed (1 percent) in a study evaluating a large administrative database. All other studies based primarily on subjects from clin ical practices or with back pain showed higher rates of utilization (7 to 36 pe rcent). Rates of use also varied by the timeframe for recall (12 months to lifetime prevalence), the interval of analysis for administrative databases, and recruitment of subjects from clinical practices. The majority of publications evaluated LBP or unspecified pain, with utilization for neck or com bined neck and back problems being less co mmonly assessed. No clear pattern emerges for acupuncture utilization rates as a f unction of region of the back; in part this is due to the limited number of studies, but it may also be related to the lower prevalence of neck pain relative to LBP. Only one of the publications15 provided any detail as to the specific type of acupuncture provided. A single publication44 presented information on concurrent conventional care with acupuncture. When reported, conv entional care overlap was generally not stratified for acupuncture. Similarly, a single publication15 sufficiently detailed combin ing of other alternative therapies with acupuncture. Over all these studies were rated as having fair methodological quality, indicating that they are susceptible to some biases. These threats to validity are somewhat endemic to the use of self-report of ut ilization but are not su fficient to negate the results. Acupuncture Utilization Outside the U.S. Of the 10 publications on utiliza tion outside of the U.S., three116-118 were based in Canada, three125,128,129 in the United Kingdom, three119,126,127 in Australia, and one51 in Germany. Six of the 10 publications were of cross-sectional design with utilization outcom es derived equally from interviews116-118 or self-administered questi onnaires (Tables 4A to 7A).119,127,128 Three publications used medical chart data and a cohort study design with non-concurrent (historical) control,129 a single group pros pective study design,126 and a before after study design.125 Another study used a single group prospective cohort design51 based on all subjects enrolled in a randomized controlled tr ial (RCT) and using interview data. Half the studies recruited pa rticipants from the general population, including a national sample within Canada,116-118 one within Australia,119 and one of Australian women.127 The remaining studies recruited subjects from specialized outpatient or pain clinics,125,126,128 and general medical practices.51,129 Utilization was primarily defined as a visit with an acupuncturist o r having received or \"ever tried\" acupuncture. In addition to a visit to a CAM practitioner, one study118 included \"discussed CAM with, a non-mainstream practitioner\" and \"looked for a support group when faced with a health problem\" as utiliza tion. Half the publications51,116-118,127 queried use within the last 12 34 months, and two publications119,125 reported use within 6 months or less. One study128 did not report a timeframe and another126 reviewed visits over a 6-year interval. None of the publications provided details as to the type of acupuncture provided. Only two publications indicated that the provi der was either a medical acupuncturist129 or was likely a conventional practitioner.125 Acupuncture utilization based on anatomical region. None of the non-U.S. publications provided utilization specific to the neck and the use of acupuncture . In the three publications that did not specify the location of the back pain (Tab le 5A), rates of acupuncture use varied from 3 percent127 to 29 percent of those with back pain.126 Table 6A shows the five publications that evaluated acupuncture use in persons with LBP, and rates varied from 2 percent119 to 19 percent.129 Two related publications116,117 (Table A4) that combined neck and back pain reported that 28 to 30 percent of back pain patients used acupuncture. No clear trend emerges for the utilization of acupuncture as a function of back re gion; neck pain specific ally was not evaluated in these eligible studies and the other back regions showed a sim ilar range of rates of use. In general, as one would expect, rates of use of acupuncture were lowe r in population-based samples than those publications with samples from specialty clinics whic h tended to be smaller in number. It is this factor, rather than the back region that a ccounts for the majority of observed variability; the timeframe interval and methods used to collect rates of use are also important factors in explaining variability. Acupuncture use as complementary care or combined with other CAM therapies. Seven publications did report som e information regarding use of conventional care with CAM. Three of these116-118 did not stratify the proportions specifi c to persons reporting back pain and one did not stratify by practitioner type119 (Table 4A and 7A). Three publications51,125,128 reported use of acupuncture with conventional ca re and found rates of ove rlap varying from 90 percent128 to 63 percent.51 Three publications indicated that patients used medications and injection therapies128 (16 to 75 percent), and mixed therapies (medications, nerve blocks, electrotherapy, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation).51,125 The majority of publications did not provide detail regarding concurre nt or additional use with other CAM therapies. Two publications51,119 indicated use of acupuncture with other CAM therapies including chiropractic (46 percent) and massage (37 percent).51 Quality assessment for non-U.S. acupuncture publications. Seven51,116-119,126,127 of 10 non-U.S. publications used self-r eported utilization data and were subject to some degree of recall bias. The remaining three publications125,126,129 used medical health record information. Six of the 10 publications were of cross-sectional design with utilization outcomes derived equally from interviews or self-administere d questionnaires; of these, five publications116-119,127 were derived from random population samples, with one127 being limited to older Australian women. However, the response ra te was low (19 to 26 percent)116,117 or not reported118,127 in four of these publications. Three publications using non-comparative study designs recruited patients from general practices129 or specialized pain clinics.125,126 For these 10 non-U.S. studies the overall methodological quality is fair, suggesting some susceptibility to bias, but not sufficient to negate all the results. Summary of utilization for back pain for non-U.S. acupuncture publications. Ten publications undertaken in Canada,116-118 the United Kingdom,125,128,129 Australia,119,126,127 and Germany51 evaluated the use of acupuncture in pe rsons with back pain. Three of these125,126,129 retrieved utilization data from h ealth records rath er than using self-report methods; the quality of utilization data retrieved was limited by lack of standardized extracti on methods. Six of the 35 publications51,116-119,127 using interview or survey methods we re cross-sectional studies. Five of these selected random population samples and found utilization rates va rying from 2 percent119 to 30 percent.116,117 Differences in timeframes queried may account for this variation. Of the 10 non-U.S. publications, five51,116-118,127 probed use within the last 12 months, and two119,125 reported use within 6 months or less. One publication128 did not report a timeframe and another126 reviewed visits over a 6-year interval. The majority of publications evaluated LBP (n = 5) or unspecified pain (n = 3) and none evaluated or reported specifically on neck pain. No clear trend fo r utiliz ation rates as a function of region of the back was observed in the non-U. S. studies. None of the publications provided details as to the type of ac upuncture provided and only two public ations specified the type of practitioner.125,129 Although seven publications did report some information regarding use of conventional care with acupuncture, f our of these did not either st ratify results by persons with back pain116-118 or specify the CAM practitioner;119 the remaining three publications51,125,128 showed overlap varying from 63 to 90 percent. The majority of publications did not provide sufficient detail regarding concurrent or a dditional use with other CAM therapies. Two publications51,119 indicated use of acupuncture with othe r CAM therapies incl uding chiropractic (46 percent) and massage (37 percent).51 For these 10 non-U.S. studies the overall methodological quality is fair, suggesting some suscep tibility to bias, but not sufficient to negate all the results Specific CAM Therapy Utilization: Massage Nineteen publications provided information on the utiliza tion of massa ge in persons with back pain. Of these, 12 were specific to the U.S.9,11,12,15,16,18,20,22,23,30,33,44 Seven of these publications are based on three patient study coho rts from Oregon State medical and chiropractic practices,20,22,23 the practices of licensed CAM practitioners in Connecticut and Washington,15,44 and North Carolina.9,30 Eight publications provided utiliza tion outcomes from eligible non-U.S. countries;51,116-119,121,130,131 one publication117 was a companion to a previous study116 as it incorporated the findings of the in itial survey and utilization from a resampling of new subjects 6 years later. Massage Utilization Within the U.S. Three of the 12 eligible U.S. publications used cross-sectional study designs based on inte rviews.9,12,18 Two studies were based on retrospective health claims database review16 or chart review.33 Another study9 was designed as a single group prospective study but presented only baseline data for the subgroup of chronic pain patients and as such the results are cross- sectional. The remaining seven publications es tablished CAM utilization using a single group prospective design based on telephone interviews,15,30,44 self-administered questionnaires,11 and health record audit with ad ministrative billing records.20,22,23 The majority of populations were from specialized clinical practices or from the practices of licensed CAM providers. Three publications reported CAM utilization based on subjects from either a national sample,12 or regional samples from North Carolina.9,30 Two publications recruited subjects from health claims databases in Washington state,16,18 and three from family medical and chiropractic pr actices in Oregon state.20,22,23 Similarly, two publications15,44 randomly sampled licensed massage therapists and patients within their practices from the states 36 of Washington and Connecticut. One study33 recruited patient charts from chiropractic practices within California and another study recruited su bjects from large urban specialty clinics for orthopedic or neurosurgery consultation.11 Utilization was primarily define d as a visit with a CAM prac titioner, h aving received or \"ever tried\" massage, or use fr om a health claims database or health record from a CAM practitioner. Persons with back pain were asked about use of CAM within the last 12 months,9,10,12,20,22,23 lifetime use,11,18 or visits to practitioner over a 1-year interval.15,16,33,44 Two publications16,20 using data from large health clai ms databases showed low rates of massage utilization for LBP, varying from 4 to 5 percent of the total sample. One study12 reported massage use for patients with combined neck and back pain and showed a utilization rate of 14.1 (95 percent CI, 10.8-17.4), an estimate d 32.8 million visits (mean of 5.4 visits). In contrast, publications that evalua ted use of massage within smalle r samples, showed rates of use varying from 16 to 52 percent. Only one publication15 provided any detail as to the type of massage administered to back pain patients. This publication also reported the mean duration of the visits as 60 minutes. The training or type of massage therapist was sp ecified as a \"licensed massage therapist\",15,18,44 provided within a chiropractor practice and thus likely provide by a chiropractor,20,22,23,33 or provided within a physical therapy practice thus possibly from a physical therapist.30 The remaining four publications9,11,12,16 provided no details regarding the massage practitioner. Massage utilization based on anatomical region. Tables 8A to 11B indicate the number of publications specific to regions of the back and these include: one study evaluating massage utiliza tion for neck pain,44 two for unspecified back pain,15,44 nine for LBP,9,11,16,18,20,22,23,30,33 and one study12 that combined back and neck pain. A single study44 evaluating patients in licensed massage therapist practices found ra tes of use of massage for neck pain to vary between 13 and 20 percent for the states of Connecticut and Washington (combined 17 percent). This same study found slightly higher rates of massage use for unspeci fied back pain at 20 percent for both states. The majority of publications9,11,16,18,20,22,23,30 reported on massage use in persons with LBP and all of these publications ev aluated chronic LBP, except two20,30 which had combined acute and chronic groups. Two publications16,20 using data from large health claims databases showed low rates of utilization, varying from 4 to 5 percen t of the total sample. In contrast, publications that evaluated use of massage within smaller samples with chronic back pain, showed rates of use varying from 24 to 52 percent. One study12 reported massage use for patients with combined neck and back pain also reported no difference in the relative freque ncy of massage use by location of the back pain. Massage use as complementary care or comb ined with other CAM therapies. The m ajority of publications did not collect or report sufficient in formation to determine use of complementary or other CAM therapies specific to patients receiving massage. There was one exception15 and this study indicated that massage was used predominately with movement re- education and less frequently with energetic work, and reflexology. Two publications reported use with other CAM therapies but were not spe cific to those respondents with back pain44 or specific to those receiving massage.12 Although not stratified by back pain, up to 29 percent of subjects re ceiving massage saw a me dical or osteopathic physician.44 Another study12 suggested that CAM alone had been used by 25 percent of persons with back and neck pain; however, this wa s not specific to those receiving massage. 37 Quality assessment for U.S. massage publications. Three of the 12 eligible U.S. publications used cross-sectional study designs based on interviews.9,12,18 One publication12 was based on a randomly sampled population cohort w ith adequate response rate while another18 obtained a low response rate (36 percent) creating the potential for selection bias. Another study recruited subjects from North Caro lina, and reported baseline data for subjects with chronic back pain9 or acute back pain.30 Four publications used retros pective administrative database information and employed methods to standardiz e coding for back pain classification, provider visits, and treatments; one was base d on a large health plan database16 and the others from chiropractic practi ces across a state.20,22,23 There is greater potential for selection bias in studies stemming from samples obtained from pr ovider clinics. Two related publications15,44 randomly sampled licensed massage therapists and patients within their practices but was essentially a single group prospective design. The remaini ng studies employed single group prospective designs from specialized settings.11,33 There is significant overlap with the studies included for acupuncture. These studies evaluatin g the use of massage within the U.S. are prone to some biases but these do not negate the validity of the results; the overall quality is rated as fair for these studies. Summary of use for back pain in U.S. massage publications. Twelve U.S. publications evaluated the use of m assage in persons with back pain. The majo rity of populations were from specialized clinical practices of back pain patients or CAM providers. Two publications16,20 using data from large health claims databases sh owed low rates of utilization, varying from 4 to 5 percent of the total sample. One study with a population based sample12 reported massage use for patients with combined neck and back pain as 14.1 percent (95 percent CI, 10.8-17.4). Publications that evaluated use of massage in smaller samples, s howed rates of use varying from 17 to 52 percent. The timeframe of reported use was 1 year, with the exception of two studies evaluating lifetime use.11,18 Only one of the publications,15 provided any detail as to the type of massage administered to back pain patients. From 11 publications, the majo rity reported on low back problem s (n = 9) and mostly for chronic pain; only one study44 reported on utilization of mass age in neck pain. A single publication12 reported no difference in the relative frequency of ma ssage use by location of the back pain. Most publications did not coll ect or report sufficient inform a tion to determine use of complementary or other CAM therapies by patients receiving massage. There was one exception15 and this study indicated that massage was used predominately with movement re- education and less frequently with energetic work, and refl exology. Although several studies indicated that massage was used in combination with other CAM therapie s, none indicated which other therapies were combined with massage. Massage Utilization Outsi de the United States From the eight publications undertaken outside of the U.S., four were from Canada,116-118,131 two from the Netherlands,121,130 one from Germany,51 and one from Australia.119 All the publications undertaken within Canada were cross-sectional design from randomly selected samples, predominately at a na tional level; all but one study131 was undertaken by telephone interview. The Australian study119 was also a population-based cross-sectional study using self- administered questionnaire. The two Dutch publications were both based on a single group prospective questionnaire completed by subjec ts selected from general medical practices130 and 38 from a retrospective analysis of an administrative database for physical therapy.121 Similarly, the study from Germany51 interviewed a single group prosp ective cohort from general practices. Utilization of massage therapy was primarily defi ned as a vis it with a CAM practitioner, or use as indicated in a health claims database. All subjects were asked about use of CAM within the last 12 months with the exception of three pub lications, which evaluated use within the last 6 months,119 past 4 weeks,131 or lifetime use.130 Five publications116-119,131 were cross-sectional in desi gn recruiting rando mly selected national or provincial samples. In these stud ies utilization rates varied from 7 percent131 within the past 4 weeks to 42 percent lifetime use.116 Generally, studies of single group prospective design showed higher rates of utilization from 56 percent from an administrative database121 to 30 percent.51 The exception to this was a single study th at evaluated massage use in persons with neck pain reporting a 7 percen t rate of use at baseline.130 None of the publications provided detail as to the specific type of m assage received by persons with back pain. The pr oviders of massage were physical therapists in one publication,121 massage therapist in another,119 and were not specified in the remaining publications. Massage utilization based on anatomical region . A single non-U.S. study130 found that utilization specific to the neck and the us e of massage was 7 percent. A single study118 evaluating unspecified back pain reported a rate of 55.5 percent (95 percen t CI< 54.1-57.0) for massage use. Similarly, the three publications51,119,121 evaluating LBP reported high rates of use that varied from 15 to 56 percent. Three publications116,117,131 evaluated rates of massage use reported for neck and back pain combined; in one study131 7 percent of respondents sa w massage therapist. In the other two publications 39 to 42 percent received massage.116,117 Massage use as complementary care or comb ined with other CAM therapies. Of the five publications providing som e information regarding conventional care with CAM, three116-118 had not stratified the proportions specific to persons reporting back pain a nd one did not stratify by practitioner type.119 A single study131 indicated that 4 percent of combined neck and back patients saw a medical doctor and a massage therap ist; similarly, 3 percent saw a medical doctor, a chiropractor, a physiotherap ist and a massage therapist.131 The majority of publications did not provide de tail regarding concurrent or additional use of other CAM therapies with m assage, specific to pers ons with back pain and stratified by therapy. In one study51 37 percent of patients receiving massage, also received acupuncture concurrently. Similarly, one study131 reported concurrent use of massage a nd chiropractic in 5 percent of the sample. Another study130 of persons with neck pain indicated that up to 12 pe rcent of patients used other CAM therapies, including Reiki, energy healing, and acupuncture. Quality assessment for non-U.S. massage publications. Fiv e publications116-119,131 were cross-sectional in desi gn recruiting randomly selected national or provincial samples; although derived from large samples, the response rates were relatively low varying from 19 to 69 percent. The survey methodology employed within these st udies was of high quality, using pre-tested questionnaires. Three studies employed single gr oup prospective design with subjects recruited from general medical practices51,130 or from an administrative database for physical therapy;121 one of these130 recruited a small sample relative to th e other studies. The overall quality of these studies would be rated as fair. Summary of use for back pain fo r non-U.S. massage publications. Of the eight publications undertaken out side of the U.S., four were from Canada,116-118,131 two from the Netherlands,121,130 one from Germany,51 and one from Australia.119 Five publications116-119,131 were cross-sectional in design recruiting random ly selected national or provincial samples. 39 Within these studies utilizati on rates varied from 7 percent131 for seeing a massage therapist within the past 4 weeks to 42 percent for lifetime use.116 Generally, studies of single group prospective design showed higher rates from 56 percent from an administrative database121 to 30 percent.51 The exception to this was a single study th at evaluated massage use in persons with neck pain which reported a 7 pe rcent rate of use at baseline.130 All but one publication130 queried the use of massa ge within 12 months or less (as recent as 4 weeks). None of the publications provided detail as to the specific type of massage received by persons with back pain, or the type of provider. The sole study evaluating neck pain130 reported a rate of 7 percen t utilization. Rates of use for LBP or combined neck and back pain were generally higher, varying from 15 (6-month use) to 42 percent (lifetime use). Base d on this single study for neck pa in, it is difficult to establish whether or not the rate of massage us e varies based on anatomical location. While five publications provided some informat ion regarding conventio nal care with CAM, four of these did not present re sults stratified by back pain or practitioner. A single study131 indicated that 4 percent of combined neck and ba ck patients receiving massage also saw an M.D. concurrently; similarly, 3 percent saw an M.D., a chiropractor, and a physio therapist in addition to a massage therapist.131 Only three studies reported on conc urrent use of massage with other CAM therapies such as acupuncture51 (37 percent), chiropractic131 (5 percent), or mixed therapies130 (12 percent receiving either Reiki, energy healing, and acupuncture). Specific CAM Therapy Utilization: Chiropractic/Spinal Manipulation We retrieved the full text of 52 articles that potentially provided inform ation on utilization of chiropractic/spinal manipulative therapy for back pain. One publication83 is not summarized below, as this study included comparison data fr om three other publications already included. Of the 51 remaining publications, 31 were undertaken so lely within the U.S., 15 in other eligible countries, and five included both U.S. and Canadian data. Although, one of the publications25 with U.S. and Canadian data did not stratify results by country, we classified this as U.S. as the majority of data was not Canadian. Chiropractic/Spinal manipulation utilization within the U.S. Thirty-six publications on chiropractic and spinal manipula tion, were undertaken in the U. S. The study design varied and included 15 single group prospect ive cohort study publications,11,15,17,20,22-25,27,30,34,38,41,43,44 10 retrospective reviews of patie nt records or claims data,16,21,28,32,33,36,37,39,40,42 and 10 cross- sectional publications.9,12-14,18,19,26,29,31,35 One study was a randomized controlled trial.10 The majority (n = 24) focused on LBP.9,11,16-24,27,28,30-33,35,37-42 Three publications presented information on neck pain,25,40,44 one the thoracic spine,40 six on combined spinal sites12-14,26,36,39 and seven unspecified back region.10,15,25,29,34,38,44 Sixteen of 24 publications on LBP and the one study of neck pain provided details on the duration of patients' comp laints. Twelve of the publications reported on chronic complaints,9,11,18,21,22,24,27,28,31,37,41,42 three on acute pain,19,20,30 and two on a range of duration.20,33 Chiropractors were the providers of spinal manipulative therapy in 34 of the publications,9- 29,31-34,36-44 and physiotherapists in the remaining two.30,35 Details on the type of spinal manipula tion was provided in three publications;15,24,33 one clarified that 75 percen t of manual therapy prov ided was \"manual, high-velocity, low-amplitude manipulation\",24 and manual therapy provi ded as \"specific, short-lever dynamic 40 thrusts (or spinal adjustments) or non-specific, long-lever manipulation\".33 The study by Sherman et al.,15 noted that the predominant manipulati on provided was of the diversified type. Eligible U.S. trials on LBP populations found th at rates of attending for chiropractic/spinal manipulative therapy ranged from 10 to 47 percent.9,11,18,19,28,30,32,35,41 Between 79 and 94 percent of treatments provided by chiropractors included spinal manipulative therapy.9,11,22,23,28,33,37 In two studies in which physiotherapists were the tr eatment providers, 21 to 34 percent of patients with LBP were treated with spinal manipulativ e therapy either in isolation or with other modalities.30,35 The number of visits for chiropractic care or other prov iders of spinal manipulative therapy ranged from a mean of 4.3 to 15.79,19,22-24,28,33 with the exception of one study of disability claimants who atte nded for an average of 41 visits,37 and a median of 4 to 716,28 (Tables 12A to16B). In one study in which the mean and median number of visits was provided, the mean was appr oximately double the median.28 In one study in which two similar cohorts of adults with LBP were surveyed 10 ye ars apart, the rates of chiropractic utilization declined by 10 percent be tween 1987 (40 percent) and 1997 (31 percent).19 Chiropractic/spinal manipulation utiliz ation based on anatomica l region. A single study40 provided rates per 1,000 members episodes of care for all three spinal regions and showed a gradient with the thoracic spine being the region for which there was lowest use (10 to 20 percent), the neck, the second most common re gion (31 to 45 percent), and the low back, the most frequent region receiving chiropract ic care (58 to 64 percent). A second study44 reported rates of use for two spinal regions and showed lower rates for the neck (23 to 25 percent) relative to unspecified back (41 to 44 percent). A third study25 showed a similar gradient for neck pain (17 percent for all subjects and 9 percent for those aged over 55 years) and unspecified back pain (38 percent for all subjects and 33 pe rcent for those aged over 55 years) . Chiropractic/spinal manipulation use as co mp lementary care or combined with other CAM therapies. Only two of the 36 eligible U.S. trials provided detailed information on patterns of care seeking; the majority of publications did not present complementary use stratified by persons with back pa in. Use of chiropractic care as an alternative to conventional care ranged from 4 to 33 percent and use of chir opractic as complementary therapy ranged from 13 to 16 percent. 16,17 One study16 explored the care seeking patterns of 104,358 Washington State residents who made a claim for LBP and found that 45 percent sought conventional care only (M.D. or PT), 33 percent sought chiropractic care only, 13 percent sought other CAM providers only (aside from chiropractors) , and 12 percent pursued both c onventional and CAM providers. Another study 34,43 found that one-third of patients with unspecified back pain chose to attend a chiropractor, that chiropractors were the primary provider (defined as the provider who delivered the majority of care) for 40 percent of epis odes of back pain, and that 92 percent of chiropractors' patients chose their services again for future episodes of ba ck pain (Table 13A). Although many authors described tr eatm ents provided to patients with back pain, only one study35 provided details on how spinal manipulative therapy is combined with other modalities (Table 14A). Of 2,328 American patients discharg ed from physiotherapy outpatient services 34 percent received spinal manipulativ e therapy either in isolation or with other therapy, 10 percent received spinal manipulative therapy with exer cises and physiotherapy modalities, and 8 percent received spinal manipulative therapy and exercises. Quality assessment for U.S. chiropractic/spinal manipulation publications. From 36 publications, 10 cross-sectional studies are based predominately on random samples,9,12,14,26,31 systematic samples,13,18,29 national probability samples,19 or not reported.35 Response rates varied from 36 to 95 percent; the methods of the surveys and interviews were generally of high quality. 41 There are 15 single-group prospective cohort study publications;11,15,17,20,22-25,27,30,34,38,41,43,44 two of these15,44 employed a random sampling of chiropract ors. The majority of these papers recruited samples from chiropractic or other professional clinical practices, and as such represent selective groups of patients. From 10 retros pective publicatio ns, four were based on patient health records,21,28,33,42 two were from large administrative health databases,16,40 and four from workers' compensation databases;32,36,37,39 the latter using standardized coding for back injury diagnosis and utilization. Overall, the quality of these studie s would be evaluated as fair, noting that biases are present but not sufficien t to negate the validity of results. Summary of utilization in U.S. chiropractic/spinal manipulation publications. Thirty-s ix publications9-44 on chiropractic and spinal manipulation, were undertaken in the U.S. The majority (n = 24) reported on LBP and the fewest on neck (n = 3) and thoracic spine (n = 1). Our review suggests that chiropractic care/spinal manipulation is commonly sought by patients with back pain. From 10 cross-sectional studies9,12-14,18,19,26,29,31,35 based predominately on random or systematic samples, rates of utilization varied from 16 percent14 to 45 percent.18 Eligible U.S. trials on LBP populations found that rates of attending for chiropractic/spinal manipulative therapy range from 10 to 47 percent.9,11,18,19,28,30,32,35,41 The number of visits for chiropractic care or other providers of spinal manipulativ e therapy ranged from a mean of 4.3 to 15.79,19,22-24,28,33 Between 79 percent and 94 percen t of treatment by chiropractors included spinal manipulative therapy.9,11,22,23,28,33,37 Two studies provided some evidence for a gradient of use based on anatomical regions; LBP was treated most often,25,40,44 followed by neck, and then thoracic pain.40 Chiropractors were the providers of spinal manipulative therapy in most publications (n = 34), and physiotherapists in two publications.30,35 Details on the type of spinal manipulation provided was provided in three only publications.15,24,33 The available information suggests that rough ly equal proportions of LBP patients use chiropractic as com plementary to conventional care and as an alternate. Current literature provides little insight into the manner in which chiropractic/spinal manipulation is combined with other therapies for back pain. Despite the common use of chiropractic/spinal manipulation by patients with back pain th e current literature provides limited data on utilization. Chiropractic/spinal manipulation utilization in non-U.S. publications. Nineteen publications14,21,28,42,116-119,122,124,126,128,129,131-136 on the utilization of chiropractic and spinal manipulation, were undertaken within other eligible countries. The majority of these publications (n = 11) focused on LBP.21,28,42,119,122,124,128,129,132-134 Three publications presented information on neck pain,124,134,135 one on the thoracic spine,134 three on combined spinal sites,116,117,131 and three on unspecified back regions.118,126,136 Study designs varied and included two single-group prospective cohort study publications,122,126 five retrospective reviews of patient records or claims data,21,28,42,132,135 one study that used both patient records a nd single-group prospective cohort data,129 and 11 cross- sectional publications.14,116-119,124,128,131,133,134,136 Four publications did not provide information on duration of pain.14,118,122,136 Ten studies evaluated chronic pain (greater than 3 months) in the back,126 combined back and neck,116,117,131 and the low back.21,28,42,119,128,133 Three studies evaluated acute pain in acute whiplash (less than 30 days),135 in the LB for pain greater than 24 hours,132 and less than 6 weeks.129 Two studies evaluated mixed duration populations.124,134 Chiropractors were the providers of spinal manipulative therapy in 14 of the publications,14,21,28,42,116-119,124,126,131,133-135 physiotherapists in one study,132 osteopathic doctors in osteopaths and chiropractors and physioth erapists in one study.129 Details on the type of spinal manipulation was provided in one study;122 this study noted provision of osteopathic manipulation defined as \"passive articulation of the lumbar spin e and high-velocity thrust techniques\".122 The study that reported on neck pain (specifi cally, acute whiplash) found that 18 percent of respondents sought chiropractic care.135 Eligible trials on LBP populations found that rates of attending for chiropractic/spinal manipula tive therapy ranged from 11 to 40 percent.119,128,133 One publication reported that 81 per cent of treatment by chiropractors included spinal manipulative therapy.28 In the single study in which physiotherapists were the treatment providers, 3 percent of patients with LBP were treated with spinal manipulative therapy.132 A single study reported the average number of visits for chiropractic care was 10.5 and the median was six.28 A national survey found that overall use of chiropractic services among Canadians increased from 36 percent in 1997 to 40 percent in 2006.116,117 Chiropractic/spinal manipulation use based on anatomical region. A single study134 evaluated back pain in three re gions and showed a gradient from the least utilization for the thorax (7 percent), to the neck (9 percen t) and the low back (40 percent). One study124 showed lower rates of use for neck pain (24 to 25 per cent) than for unspecifie d back pain (71 to 74 percent). Chiropractic/spinal manipulation used as co mplementary care or combined with other CAM therapies. Of the 19 eligible non-U.S. publications, the five th at provided information on patterns of care-seeking all show ed that chiropractic care is used both as a complementary therapy and an alternative to conventi onal care, often in similar proportions.119,128,131,135,136 The proportion of patients with back pain that attended a chiropractor in isolation ranged from 6 to 29 percent, and use of chiropractic as a comple mentary therapy ranged from 2 to 36 percent. Quality assessment for chiropratic/spinal manipulation. O f 19 publications, 11 were cross-sectional publications.14,116-119,124,128,131,133,134,136 Two studies did not report response rates118,134 while the remaining studies reported rates from 19 to 100 percent. All but two studies124,134 recruited random samples from the ge neral population. In addition, these two studies did not report the method of questionn aire development. For the remaining eight publications, study design varied and included two single-group prospective cohort study publications,122,126 one study that used both patient records and single-group prospective cohort data,129 and five retrospective reviews of patient records or claims data.21,28,42,132,135 All of the retrospective database studies obtained da ta from practitioner sources, and one study135 also used insurance claim source from persons following a mo tor vehicle accident. These studies recruited from select back pain patient groups. Overall, the quality of these stud ies was rated as fair. Summary of utilization in non-U.S. chiropractic/spinal publications. Nineteen publications14,21,28,42,116-119,122,124,126,128,129,131-136 on the utilization of chiropractic and spinal manipulation, were undertaken in ot her eligible countries. The majo rity of these publications (n = 11) focused on LBP.21,28,42,119,122,124,128,129,132-134 Chiropractors were the providers of spinal manipulative therapy in mo st publications (14 of 19), with other providers included phys iotherapists or osteopathic doctors. Only one study provided details on the type of spinal manipulation used.122 One study reported use for acute whiplash neck pain at 18 percent.135 Eligible trials on LBP populations found that rates of attending for chiropractic/spi nal manipulative therapy ranged from 11 to 40 percent.119,128,133 A single trial reported that 81 percent of treatment by chiropractors included spinal manipulative therapy.28 A national survey found that overall use of chiropractic services among Canadians increase d from 36 percent in 1997 to 40 percent in 43 2006.116,117 Two studies showed some evidence of lo wer rates of use for neck/thoracic pain relative to the LBP.124,134 Only 5 publications provided information on use as complementary or combined care. The proportion of patients with back pain that attended a chiropractor in isolation ranged from 6 to 29 percent, and use of chiroprac tic as a complementary therapy ranged from 2 to 36 percent. Specific CAM Therapy Utilization: Natu ropathic Medicine and Related Interventions We identified eight publications examining the u tilization of naturopath ic m edicine and other related CAM therapies. Five of these10,12,16,44,137 were undertaken in the U.S. and three118-120 in other eligible countries. These papers we re published between 2002 and 2007 and included 184,907 participants aged 15 to over 90. Naturopathic medicine utilization within the U.S. There were three publications f rom the U.S that clearly examined naturopathic medicine utilization. Of thes e, two were single group prospective study designs44,137 where data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire,44 or a telephone interview.137 One study was a retrospective review16 of an administrative database. Two publications sampled practitioners44,137 and one study extracted data from a health insurance plan database.16 All publications defined the utilization of CAM (of which naturopathic medicine was a subs et) as 'a visit to a practitioner'. One study44 found that approximately 5 percent of patients with LBP saw a naturopathic doctor (ND) in Connecticut and Washington stat es in 1998 and 1999. A reanalysis of this study undertaken for back and neck pain,137 found that licensed NDs pr ovided a wide variety of interventions for patients with th ese conditions. However, the fr equency of use of the differing ND treatment modalities was not reported specifically for patients with back or neck pain. In the reanalysis, it was reported that 4 to 7 percent of visits to NDs were primarily due to symptoms diagnosed as back problems (Table 17A). Similarl y, 2 to 3 percent of patients who visited NDs presented with neck problems as the primary complaint or symptom. A third study,16 unrelated to the previous two, indicated that 2 percent of patients visited an ND at least once in the previous year (2002) for back pain (mean visits = 2). Only 1 percent of people with back pain visited only an ND.16 Naturopathic medicine utilization outside of the U.S. One study with a cross-sectional design was conducted on the genera l Australian population in 2001119 and found that for those with LBP, approximately 3 percent had visite d an ND in the past 6 months. No specifics regarding naturopathic treatment s were reported in the study. It should be noted that the educational and licensing requirements for NDs in North America and Aust ralia are drastically different, the former mimicking M.D. tr aining in primary care very closely. No data were reported on the usual costs fo r thes e therapies per treatment or for the prescribed course of treatments suggested. These data are insufficient to make any conclusions regarding the utilizati on of NDs for those with back pain. More research is needed. Dietary Supplements and Homeopath y Utilization Within the United States This section focuses on those publications that assessed the utilization of CAM related to the use of dietary supplem ents and homeopathy fo r back pain. These in terventions are often 44 suggested and delivered by NDs but not all of thes e papers specifically mentioned that that was the case. One study was cross-sectional12 and used a telephone interview and one study was an RCT10 that collected data with a self -administered questionnaire. Both publications sampled the general population in the U.S. and defined utilization of dietary supplements and homeopathy as 'ever having tried' (Tables 18A and 18B). The RCT10 compared an email discussion group beha vioral intervention for LBP with usual care over a one year period. At baseline, 46 pe rcent of the intervention group reported having 'ever tried' glucosamine compared to 26 percent in the control group. Thirteen percent of the intervention group and 8 percent of the control group reported trying glucosamine during the last 6 months of the study. Wolsko12 in a national survey of back and neck pain from 1997 to 1998, found that those suffering from any back and or neck pain us ed the following CAM therapies over the preceding 12 months: 3 percent used homeopathy; 2 perc ent used vitamins, 1 percent used herbal medicines, and 1 percent used a special diet. Dietary Supplements and Homeopath y Utilization Outside the United States Two Canadian publications sampling the general population, used cross-sectional designs to collect inform ation on CAM use via telephone interview118 and face-to-face interview (Tables 19A and 19B).120 One study found that of the patients w ith chronic back pain (n = 3259), 39 percent had used a CAM therapy (massa ge, acupuncture, homeopathy, relaxation, reflexotherapy, or spiritual therapy) in the last year, 18 perc ent had used homeopathy and 6 percent had used herbal medicine.118 Another Canadian study120 looking at glucosamine use over a 5 year period (1997 to 2002) found that 5 percent of men and 10 percent of women had used glucosamine at some point for back pain. No data were reported on the usual costs for these therapies per treatment or the prescribed course of treatments suggested. Other CAM Therapies Based on Self-Care Three publications focused on the use of singl e C AM therapies that are generally self- administered, including yoga,138 prayer,139 and mind body therapies.140 All three of these publications were subgroup analyses from a la rger population-based su rvey undertaken in 1998.5 All evaluated both lifetime use and use within the last 12 months. Utiliz ation reported in these studies was limited to the propor tion of the sample who used these therapies and had neck or back pain. Forty-two percent (standard deviation (SD) 4.5 pe rcent) of those partic ipating in yoga had back or neck pain; the concurre nt or lifetim e use of other CAM therapies for persons using yoga was not stratified by back pain. Prayer was used by 18 percent of pe rsons with back or neck pain and 59 percent of these found it to be very help ful; 40 percent of these patients also saw a physician for their condition.139 Approximately 18 percent (standa rd error (SE) 2.6) of persons with back or neck pain also used mind body th erapy within the last 12 months and 40 percent (SE 8.2) found this to be very helpful for their condition; mind body therapy can include relaxation techniques such as meditation, stre ss response, guided imagery, and biofeedback.140 45 The specific types of mind-body therapies used by persons with back or neck pain were not identified. Assessment of Quality of Utilization Publications Given the degree of overlap of studies am ong the differing CAM therapies, we thought it useful to summarize quality for all the studies reporting utili zation of any CAM therapy. As noted previously, single group c ohort study designs are prone to a variety of biases and do not have specified criteria to assess methodological quality. Quality of Utilization Publications Undertaken Within the United States A total of 46 publications on CAM utilization we re from the U.S. Of these, 10 were based on retrospective patient records or claims data16,21,28,32,33,36,37,39,40,42 and 15 were cross-sectional publications.5,9,12-14,18,19,26,29,31,35,45,138-140 A single publication was based on an RCT.10 The remaining publications were single group cohor t publications, for which quality was not assessed. Of the publications based on retros pective health databa se or chart records, three were from large workers' compensation claims databases36,37,39 where the primary interest was in chiropractic visits. Three publications16,32,40 were from large health insurance claims or managed care network databases. All of th ese publications have standardized coding for classifying back pain (predominately ICD 9 codes), provider visi ts, and enrollee characteristics and treatments; given the pre-specified coding systems, linkages between elements within the database were likely limited in errors. Four publications used health reco rd extraction from chiropractic charts;21,28,33,42 and standardized data collection forms were used. All the U.S. cross-sectional publications used self-report methods of ascertaining utilization of CAM. Ta ble 20 details these publications w ith respect to sampling strategy, response rate, mode of administration of the survey, questionnaire design (whi ch we operationalized as pre- testing of questions) and the time frame for recall. Several publications were related to a single national survey,5,12,138-140 and two to residents of North Carolina.9,31 Response rates varied from 95 to 60 percent and all but one5 would be considered acceptable; an acceptable response rate is from 65 to 75 percent.84 Recall periods were 6 or 12 mont hs, with the exception of two papers29,35 that collected current episode or the past 2 weeks. The majority of publications used telephone or in person in terviews suggesting less potential fo r bias. Limited information about questionnaire design was provided. Quality of Utilization Publications Undertaken in Other Countries A total of 22 publications were undertaken within eligible countries outside the U.S. with an additional four overlapping with U.S. data.14,21,28,42 Of these, eight21,28,42,121,125,129,132,135 were based on retrospective patient record or claims data and 14 were cross-sectional publications.14,116-120,123,124,127,128,131,133,134,136 The remaining four publications were single group cohort publications, for which quality was not assessed.51,122,126,130 46 Among the publications from retr ospective health database or chart records, one study135 used claims from a provincial insurance database for persons with whiplash. Others used, patient health records from physiotherapy practices,121,132 a pain clinic125 and chiropractic practices.21,28,42,129 It was not clear in all of these publications if standardized forms were used to collect utiliza tion information. The 14 cross-sectional publications all used self-report m ethods of ascertaining utilization of CAM. Table 21 shows these publications and th eir quality characteris tics. Four of these publications116-118,133 were based in Canada and were undertaken at a national level using random sampling; similarly, two in Australia were nationally-based random sample surveys.119,127 Three publications recruited patients from practitioner clinics.124,128,134 Response rates varied from 19 to 100 percent when reported . Recall periods included lifetime use,120 12 months,116-118,127,133 3 to 6 months,119,131,136 4 weeks,131 and current episode.124,128,134 Three publications127,128,133 did not report the mode of data collection for utilization data. The remaining publications all used mailed questionnaires or telephone interviews with the exception of one study that used face-to-face interviews.120 Limited information about questionnaire design was provided. Question 2. What is the Utilization Recommended by Different Types of Healthcare Providers? To address this question we searched primarily for relevant U.S. based Clinical P ractice Guidelines (CPG), and also publications that specified provider views on the recommended use of CAM therapies for patients with back pain. U.S. Clinical Practice Guidelines We reviewed 19 U.S. CPG on neck or back pain. Of these, three were excluded as their target population was adults with spinal pain related to neuro logical conditions.141-143 Four were excluded as they did not provide any recommenda tions for the use of CAM therapies for back pain.144-147 A single publication148 compared CPG from 11 different countries; this study was excluded as the U.S. guide line was developed in 1994. Eleven guidelines related to the management of back pain included th e use of CAM and the characteristics of these CPGs are detailed in Appendix C Table 1. Of these guidelines, three were published by professional organizations (acupuncture46 and chiropractic organizations149,150), and three from payer organizations.151-153 Only one CPG46 made specific utilization recommendations for acute, subacu te, chronic and recurr ent flare-up patient conditions. The remaining 10 made general reco mmendations for using specific CAM therapies either by treatment type (n = 10), practitioner type (n = 2), or back region (n = 9) as follows: By treatment type including. 1) Manipulation/Mobilization,149-152,154-158 2) Heat or Cold,154,155,157 3) Relaxation,155,156 4) Acupuncture/electro-acupuncture,46,153,156 5) Massage,151,156 6) Manual Therapy,152,158 and 7) Yoga.156 By practitioner. 1) Chiropractor,151,152 2) Massage Therapist,151,152 and 3) Manual Therapist.152 By spinal region. 1) Neck (none), 2) Neck/thorax,152,154 3) Thorax,151 4) Low back,149,151,155- 157 5) Mixed back regions,46,150,158 and 6) Back region not specified.153 47 For the single CPG46 with utilization recommendations , the recommended frequency for electro-acupuncture was for two to three times weekly for a duration of 4 weeks for acute and subacute back pain and 6 to 8 weeks for chr onic back pain and recu rrent/flare-up, Appendix C Table 1. Although, these recommendations were not specific to either neck or back problems, the CPG was developed to apply to all these conditions. Although very similar in its recommendations, this guideline distinguishes betw een utilization with respect to initial course of treatment and a continuing course of treat ment. The CPG recommends re-evaluation after 12 weeks of treatment irrespective of the duration of the condition. Two independent raters scored this CPG using the AGREE scoring instrument.(s ee Appendix C Table 2) For this guideline, stakeholder involvement scored 6 out of 12, appl icability 8 out of 12, and rigor and development 25 out of 32. Based on the AGREE89 score, this CPG would be acceptable with greater clarification and specifically a st ronger link to the evidence for recommendations for utilization. Summary of recommended use of CAM therapies. A single CPG, for e lectro-acupuncture, provided recommendations for the frequency of treatment that was stratified by duration, and recurrence. The guideline was developed from a provider organization and was acceptable based on the AGREE quality score. Provider Views About Recommended Use of CAM Of the 22 publications that focused primarily on patient or provider views on CAM, 16 were excluded because they had no direct or indi rect infor mation on recommendations for CAM specific to back pain and in the context of optimal frequency and duration of utilization. Two publications47,48 were U.S. and four49-52 were from other eligible countries. Of the two U.S. publications prov iding direct recomm endations, one48 did not provide information stratified for back pain. The other publication47 recommended the type of CAM treatment for LBP in pregnancy and included heat/cold, yoga, and massage; no information on the utilization was provided. This recommendation was based on the views of American health care providers (physicians, nurses, midwives, prenatal educators). Four non-U.S. publications provided some recomm endations for the treatm ent of back pain; three of these were from the United Kingdom49,50,52 and one from Germany.51 Two of these publications51,52 made recommendations primarily with re gard to the type of CAM appropriate for managing back pain. CAM practitioners in the United Ki ngdom recommended the Bowen technique, chiropractic, magnet therapy, massage , reflexology and yoga for LBP and the Bowen technique, chiropractic and massage for neck pain.52 The German publication51 cautioned that receiving acupuncture for acute, recu rrent or chronic LBP seemed to be a function of availability and did not offset the use of other health care resources. In fact, th ere were both increased consultation rates and use of other health ca re services after adjusting for key patient characteristics. Two related publications undert aken in the United Kingdom based on a cross-sectional questionnaire49 and a mixed methods design that included a qualitative component,50 captured attitudes toward LBP and included opinions about recommended utilization. These publications helped to explain the practice patterns observed in three provider groups (chiropractors, osteopaths, and physiotherapists). Based on provid er survey views, these publications found that osteopaths and physiotherapists endorsed limiting the number of treatment sessions more than chiropractors did. Additionally, those working in private practice did not endorse limiting the number of treatment sessions as frequently as those working in a nationa l health service setting. 48 Those in private practice also endorsed a biomedi cal treatment oriented attitude advising their patient to be more vigilant and restrict activity versus a reactiva tion treatment orientation (items that concern return to work, daily activity a nd increasing mobility). These two publications would suggest that there may be moderating f actors that influence the recommended use of CAM. These include availability of the CAM serv ice, attitude of the practitioner (reactivation versus biomedical orientation) and a national he alth service versus private practice setting. Summary of provider views on utilization. Six studies reported views on recomm ended use of CAM therapies. The two studies published in the U.S. did not stratify recommendations specifically for patients with back pain. Four publications from st udies outside the U.S. provided some recommendations on use of CAM therapies speci fic to persons with b ack pain. None of the publications encompassing provider or patient view s addressed recommendations with regards to the frequency or duration of treatment. These limited publications would suggest that the frequency of utilization may be influenced by the availability of the CAM service, attitudes of differing providers, the practice sett ings, and the type of CAM therapy. Question 3. What are the Usual Costs for These Therapies per Treatment and for the Prescribed Course of Treatment? Our review identified 18 public ations that were associat ed with costs or econom ic evaluations related to back pain and th e use of CAM within the U.S. One study5 provided information on costs and coverage for CAM therapies but did not present results stratified for back pain. Another study35 evaluated the use of manual therap y applied by physical therapists but did not present costs in relation to the specific therapies applied. Of the remaining publications, two were based on th e same patient population cohort53,54 and two on the same health claims database.32,59 Another study57 incorporated data from th ree different publications and undertook an economic analysis of this comb ined data. Study characteristics and results are detailed in Appendix C Tables 3 and 4. A variety of study designs were employed to collect cost related data in cluding: retrospective analyses from administrative databases (n = 7),16,32,36,39,59-61 single group prospective design (n = 5),20,34,53,54,57 RCTs (n = 3),55,56,58 and a case-control design.37 The majority of publications (n = 13) focused on costs associated with CAM services in persons with LBP.16,20,32,37,39,53-60 From these LBP studies, four53-56 included acute pain varying from greater than 7 days 56 to less than 10 weeks.53,54 Four studies16,32,39,58 did not specify the duration. Three studies evaluated chroni c back pain described as recurrent,59 chronic60 or disabling.37 Two studies combined chronic and acute back pain.20,57 For the three studies that did not evaluate costs of CAM services in persons with LBP, two evalua ted back pain location unspecified34,36 and one combined neck and back pain;61 none of these three studies identified the duration of the pain. The source of payment for the CAM therapies used in these s tudies included private health insurance (n = 5),16,32,34,59,61 workers' compensation insurance (n = 4),36,37,39,60 and mixed sources including out of pocket (n = 4).20,53,54,57 Three studies,55,56,58 that were randomized trials, had the study or the participants in surance pay for treatments. 49 Characteristics of Cost Evaluations for CAM Services Fifteen of the 18 studies were not true economic analyses, but rather cost identification studies. A single study57 undertook a complete cost-effectiven ess analysis (CEA) for patients with LBP. The perspective of this analysis was from that of the payer. This CEA had some limitations, as data for complete cost estimates we re only available for 38 percent of chronic and 50 percent of acute patients. In addition, this study did not assess actual use of services for referred patients, rather they imputed some costs. This approach was based on previously used methods for charges based on per claimant data and adjusted for proportion of provider charges that were actually reimbursed. It was not clear if this study 57 included the costs of adverse events related to visiting a chiropractor or M.D.. Although three studies53,55,56 did provide health outcome change scores and costs, they did not estimate cost-effectiveness ratios; one of these studies56 attempted to evaluate adverse events. Comparators to CAM provider costs. Although selection of a com parator is not necessary in cost identification studies, all but two39,61 undertook comparison of back treatment costs for CAM and non-CAM providers (Table 22). The ov erwhelming majority of studies (n = 13) evaluated chiropractors as the exclusive CAM provider.20,32,34,36,37,39,53-55,57-59,61 One study56 evaluated choice of a single alternative provi der that may have in cluded a chiropractor, acupuncturist, or massage therapist; another study16 included any of four CAM providers (chiropractors, massage therapists, acupuncturists, or NDs) and another60 may have included acupuncturists or massage therapis ts within the \"other\" categor y. Similarly, CAM provider costs were compared to a number of conventiona l practitioners including: M.D.s (n = orthopedic or therapists,55,60 combined M.D.s and physical therapists,58 and \"mixers\" of both CAM and conventional providers.16 Direct costs for CAM services. The cost perspectives evaluated were predom inately from that of the payer, and as such direct costs were collected. All studies included costs of visits to practitioners, but varied with resp ect to: a) inclusion of imaging or diagnostic tests, b) visits to specialists, c) back surgery costs and d) the use of medications. For studies with the workers' compensation insurance as the payer, some included costs for lost days36,60 and others excluded these.37,39 Studies from other payers such as private in surance could have attr ibuted lost days as indirect costs, but none evaluated these. The studies using health administration databases were prone to including costs associated with other i llnesses, due to the ma nner of establishing an episode of care. 32 The years for which costs were estimated varied s ignificantly; these included cost estimates from a single study in 1982,34 two from 1985,36,37 five from 1995,20,53-55,57 one from 2002,16 and one from 2003.56 Other studies used a range of years for cost estimates including: a) a two year interval from 1988-199032,59, b) a four year interval from 1988-199260, c) another from 1997- 2001,61 and d) from 1998 to 2002.60 One study did not specify any year but estimated costs over an 18 month interval.58 One study specified costs for each of the years between 1999 to 2002.39 In general, half of the cost estimates were based on data over 12 to 25 years and only three studies reported costs within th e last 5 years (Table 23). A variety of cost measures were used includ ing: a) total costs of care per episode per patien t,20,34,36,39,53,56,60 b) mean costs for index provider,54 c) costs per unit visit,16,55 mean costs over an interval of time,55,58,61 percentage of total costs,37 first episode versus multiple episodes costs,32 and first and subsequent episode provider costs.59 A single study estimated the 50 incremental cost effectiveness ratio for health outcomes of pa in and disability reduction.57 Appendix C Table 3 details the dollar values for each of these cost out comes. Although costs do vary with differing providers, in terpretation of these cost diffe rences is problematic in the absence of links to health bene fits or harms. There are also problems with the, often implicit, assumption that the effects of the provid ers and their treatments are equivalent. Indirect costs for CAM services. T he cost perspective for all st udies was that of the payer, and as such direct costs were collected and indir ect costs were either co nsidered to be of less importance or were in tentionally excluded.55 No studies evaluated indire ct costs with respect to time off work to attend therapy, or the costs a ssociated with any adverse reactions from CAM therapy. The two studies in which the pa yer was workers' compensation insurance36,60 included time off due to back pain as direct costs to the payer. Sick days taken for back pain in studies that estimated costs from other payers would not have captured these indirect costs to the patient or their employers. Quality of studies evaluating costs. (Appendix C Table 4) A single study57 undertook a formal CEA and methodological quality was eval uated using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES).90 This study scored low on criteria re lated to selection of perspective, specification of economic analyses, justification for these, and disclosing the source of funding for the study. The QHES could not be applied to the remaining studies as they were cost- identification evaluations and not true economic an alyses. The limitations in the accuracy of cost estimates for publications using administrative databases 16,32,36,39,59-61 have been detailed previously. However, we noted that even t hose studies that employe d RCT design, relied upon administrative health data for their cost estimate s; as such these high le vel designs were also prone to the same potential confounding that resu lts from using this source of cost data.56 Impact of insurance coverage on costs for CAM services. Three pub lications20,53,57 were not based on samples entirely covered by insura nce from private hea lth organizations or workers' compensation. One study53 indicated the proportion of pe rsons with coverage for urban versus rural chiropractors and primary care providers, and orthopedic surgeons. Another study57 reported the proportion of those cove red by differing insurance carriers (or lack of coverage) as a function of provider type (chiropr actor versus M.D.) and the durat ion of the LBP (acute versus chronic). The findings of this study would suggest that the duration does not affect the relative proportions of coverage for either chiropractor or M.D.. However, there was a greater proportion of patients who had no coverage se eking chiropractor relative to M. D. services (42 to 47 percent versus 6 to 8 percent). Similarly, a smaller pr oportion of patients with private or Medicaid insurance had coverage for chirop ractic relative to M.D. services for back pain. The third study20 reporting the impact of coverage suggested that up to 42 percent of persons with LBP pay out of pocket for chiropractic services. In contrast, those who seek medical services that include referral to a surgeon or physical therapist pay only 3 percent out-o f-pocket; those seeking medical services and who are not referred to either a surgeon or physical therapist have slightly higher (7 percent) out of pocket costs. 51 Table 1.

Discussion Summary of the Evidence In this systematic review we evaluated a series of broad questions relate d to the utilization of CAM therap ies in persons with b ack pain. Unlike previous reviews,62 we found that the majority of studies did differentiate the various types of CAM with respect to use. However, we found that approximately one-third of the literature on patterns of use did not re port outcomes stratified for those with back pain. Although, several of th e U.S. and non-U.S. studies were based on well conducted national sample cross-sectional surveys, CAM utilization for persons with back pain was not well detailed, despite having been identified as a high user group. Utilization of CAM Therapies A limited number of publications (n = 8) for bot h the U.S. and non-U.S. countries evaluated the re lative utilization of CAM therapies for persons with back pain. Our criteria for selection of studies included the evaluation of a minimum of four different CA M modalities. In both U.S. and non-U.S. studies, chiropractic/spinal manipula tion, followed by massage, and then acupuncture were reported as the most frequently used CAM therapies by persons with back pain. In many of the studies most subjects reported using more than one CAM therapy which would seem consistent with reporting lifetime use. These st udies focused primarily on chronic low back or unspecified back pain, with none evaluating acu te back pain. The timeframe for use and the manner in which the CAM therapies were probed are important factors accounting for the range of utilization rates observed. Future research shou ld evaluate the degree of overlap in the use of different CAM therapies to better evaluate relative utilization. This may be particularly important for persons with chronic back pain that is characterized by recurrent episodes of disabling symptoms. Differentiating patterns of relative use for acute versus chronic/recurrent back pain populations is important in fu ture evaluation of relative use of these CAM therapies. The number of studies evaluating trends over time in the us e of CAM therapies in back pain patients is limited, particularly for U.S. studies (n = 2). These studies would suggest that both CAM use in general and CAM practi tioner visits for back pain have not shifted dramatically over time. More research is required to establish the nature of trends in us e as a function of the anatomical back region, the duration of the b ack pain, and the specifi city of both the CAM therapy and the practitioner. Because so few studies evaluated relative CAM utilization, we explored patterns of use for individual C AM therapies and stratified these by U.S. versus non-U.S. studies. We focused on the four most frequently used provider-based therapies including: spinal manipulation/ chiropractic, massage, acupuncture, and naturopathic medicine. In general, the patterns of utilization and the flaws within the literature were similar for U.S. and non-U.S. publications, with minor variations in the pr ovider types for the later. 1Our review indicates that chiropractic care/spinal manipul ation is the most commonly reported and sought CAM therapy by persons with back pain in the U.S. and other western countries. It is also the most commonly evaluated modality within the U.S. Mean number of Appendixes and evidence tables cited in this report are provided electronically at http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/ev id ence/pdf/backpaincam/backcam.pdf 133patient visits tended to be double the median number of visits suggesting that a subpopulation of patients pursuing chiropractic care an d/or spinal manipulation are fr equent or long term users of these services. The majority of studies focused on low back pain (LBP) relative to other back regions, predominately in persons with chronic pain. The available information suggests that roughly equal proportions of LBP patients use ch iropractic as complementary to conventional care and as alternative to conven tional care. Current li terature provides litt le insight into the manner in which chiropractic care/spinal manipulati on is combined with other therapies for LBP. Despite the common use of chiropr actic care/spinal m anipulation by patients with back pain the current literature provides limited data on utilization. This relative dearth of information challenges the design of meaningful pragmatic tria ls by researchers, conf uses expectations of clinicians considering referral to such services, and impedes the ability of policymakers and healthcare payers to establish if provision of chiropractic care/s pinal manipulation is in keeping with clinical guidelines. High quality pros pective observational st udies on chiropractic care/spinal manipulation are needed to establish utilization data by location of complaint, the specific type of spinal manipulative therapy applied, if chiropractic care is used as complementary or alternative to conventional care, and how spinal manipulative therapy is combined with other therapies in the management of axial pain. This systematic review also shows that persons with back pain frequently use massage and acupuncture for treating thei r back pain in both the U.S. and in other eligible countries. The rates of use were widely varying and were related to a num ber of factors, including: the type of sample recruited (i.e., large national sample or smaller practice based sample), the timeframe for recall, the anatomical region, and the method used to meas ure utilization. Few studies evaluated rates of use as a function of the anatomical location of th e back pain. The attributes of the CAM provider and the specifics of the therapy administered, su ch as treatment location, duration and frequency, were poorly detailed. Given the variety of modalities within acupuncture and massage, it would be important to establish differences in pattern s of use, if any, for the differing location and duration of back pain. Future research should also adequately link the speci fic provider types to the specific subcategories of CA M therapies and contrast these with patterns of use in differing back pain populations. There were a few studies evaluating the use of naturopathic m edicine and other related therapies in the management of back or neck pa in. These suggest that naturopathic medicine and related therapies are utilized in a limited manner by persons with back pain. However, the use of dietary supplements is generally not well captured in ut ilization studies, since they may be self- administered, and the lack of st udies in this review on this ty pe of CAM may reflect a limitation in our search strategy. More research is required to gain an accurate estimate of the use of dietary supplements for back pain. There were some challenges when evaluati ng methodological quality of the utilization studies given the differing designs and outcom es. The outcomes establishing patterns of use specific to persons with back pain were collected from patient or practitioner recall surveys/ interview, health record review, or analysis of administrative h ealth claim databases. Similarly, the majority of studies on util ization employed observational desi gns without a true control or concurrent group. Approximately one- quarter of the U.S. studies a nd half of the non-U.S. studies were cross-sectional in design. Many of these studies recruited random, population-based samples with acceptable response rates; standardized and pre-tested methods for data collection were likely used in these studi es. One-third of studies were based on medical records or administrative database utilization data. The majo rity of the U.S. studies used standardized 134coding for classifying back pain (predominate ly ICD 9 codes), provider visits, and enrollee characteristics and treatments; given the pr e-specified coding systems, linkages between elements within the database were likely limited in errors. The majority of non-U.S. studies were based on health record extraction for which the use of standardized forms was not specified. Approximately half the U.S. studies were si ngle group prospective de sign and one-quarter used retrospective database inform ation. Thes e study designs and methods of data collection, lend themselves to consistent biases, in particul ar, selection and recall bi as. Many of the samples for these studies were recruite d from practitioner settings and may reflect provider practice patterns rather than health syst em utilization. However, they do provide some information that may benefit research undertaken using large sa mples and comparative designs. From a quality perspective, observational study de signs that lack comparator gr oups are problematic to assess, as there is currently no consensu s on the criteria to judge validity. Future research in this area may benefit from potential consensus on the most important validity crit eria for these designs, which will ultimately assist in comparison across di fferent studies. The rest of the publications were cross-sectional in design al ong and a few were randomized trials; relatively fewer of these studies were undertaken within the U.S. than in other eligib le countries. These comparative design studies were generally well conduc ted using large population samples. However, irrespective of the design type, the m ajority of studies re viewed were based on patient or practitioner se lf-report that has inherent limitations that may not be addressed by the study design. For example, there is the trade- off between increased accuracy by asking patients to report \"lifetime use\" rather than more detailed utilization information which is highly prone to inaccuracy. Similarly, interpreting the differing oper ational definitions of the CAM therapies and providers, and the definition of back pain acro ss studies, even when using comparative designs, is problematic. Overall, we judged the literature on utilization of CAM and back pain as fair in methodological quality; studies as a whole are sus ceptible to some biases, and do not meet all criteria for excellent validity. However, the flaw s are not sufficient to completely negate all the results. Recommendations for Use of CAM Our evaluation of U.S. clinical practice guidelines (CPG) showed extrem ely limited information on the recommended use of CAM servic es for persons with back pain. Only one CPG, for electro-acupuncture use, provided recommendations for the frequency of treatment that was stratified by pain duration, a nd recurrence. All other eligible CPG recommended the use of a particular therapy based on efficacy or effec tiveness, but did not provide guidelines for frequency and duration of treatment intervals. A significant gap with regards to recommended utilization for persons with back pain of diffe ring durations and anatom ical regions has been identified. In part, the lack of utilization recommendations may reflect limitations in high quality evidence from randomized trials focusing on the optimal dosage for treatment benefit. This precludes some consensus amongst clinicians and methodologists with regards to the specifics of \"dosage\" as a function of therapy. Descriptions of both the frequency and the duration of each treatment session would provide the minimum leve l of dosage for utilization for a course of treatment. However, there are other factors to cons ider such as the intensity of treatment or the speed of application. 159 Although, these finer aspects of dos age will likely vary with the CAM therapy, they may ultimately impact use and efficacy. 135Reluctance on the part of provider organizati ons to prescribe recommended frequency and duration of treatment in the absence of credible efficacy evidence may be another consideration. A number of other factors that may also in fluence recommended use include: provider organization policies, moderating factors such as access to, or availability of the CAM service, attitudes or philosophies of the practitioner (reactivat ion treatment versus biomedical activity restriction approaches), and th e practice setting, particularly national health service versus private practice.52 A mixed method approach including qualitative components50 may hold some promise for future investigation of provider attitudes and concerns about establishing and adhering to utilization guidelines. Costs Associated With CAM Therapies and Back Pain We also evaluated studies that measured cost-related outcomes associated with CAM use for back pain pa tients in the United States. The ma jority of studies reporting cost outcomes were cost identification analyses and not true ec onomic analyses; a single study undertook a formal cost effectiveness analysis (CEA). The studies with cost outcomes were primarily from a payer perspective and as such evaluate d direct costs; indirect costs were not captured or reported. A variety of cost estimates were reported spanning from 1982 to 2003 U.S. dollars. Although most studies showed that costs vary with the provider type, the interpretation of these differences is problematic in the absence of links to benefits or harms. Also problematic is the often implicit assumption that the effects of the providers and th eir treatments are equivalent. The majority of studies evaluated chiropractors as the exclusiv e CAM provider and medical doctors (M.D.s) as the conventional practitioners; comparison of cost s between these two providers is dominant in the studies evaluated. In genera l, these studies suggest that treatments by chiropractors and physical therapist were characterized by more visits relative to M. D.s; visits to M.D.'s, although less frequent were more costly, particularly for specialists. Challenges of Evaluating Utilization Variation in Measuring and Reporting Utilization Our systematic review found that studies us ed definitions ran ging from a maximum of lifetime use, to a minimum of one visit to a CAM practitioner to dete rmine use. The proportion of patients with back pain w ithin a practice of a CAM provide r was also a commonly reported outcome for utilization. Although this would provide some insight into practice patterns for specific providers, it limits interp retation at the population or syst em level. Overall, there was limited information with regards to the frequency of visits for specified in tervals, the duration of each visit, the details of the CAM therapies administered, and the provider attributes. A variety of methods and outcomes has been used to m easure utilization of health services in the CAM studies evaluated in th is review. Primarily these include self-report in surveys, administration databases using health claims, a nd physician record. A review of literature on the accuracy of self-report of health care utilization,80 identified six key factors affecting the accuracy of self-report and th e potential for response bias: 1) recall time-frame, with under reporting increasing with longer time intervals, 2) type of utilizat ion data requested (for example emergency room, or clinic visit), 3) utilizati on frequency, 4) questionnai re design, 5) mode of data collection, and 6) the use of memory aids or probes. Additional factors that affect accuracy 136of self-reported healthca re utilization include stress, motiva tion, and interview dynamics. In this particular review,80 and indeed in many of the studies in cluded in our review, utilization was defined as a visit to a clinical provider or clinical entity. Th is definition may present some limitations when reporting utilization of supplem ents or home remedies. Additionally, there is some indication that characteristics of the res pondents may impact recall and response bias. For example, elderly respondents were found to over report contact with general practitioners, physiotherapists, and chiropractors and under report contact with other me dical specialists; in addition, the elderly respondents were more accura te at reporting no use of a practitioner or service than use.86 Whether or not persons with back pain have an increased propensity to err in accuracy of self-reported utilization is not known. The type of utilization that is being reported may also impact accuracy. Some errors in self- reported utilization of services m ay be related to aspects of reporting on contact utilization or volume utilization. Respondents reporting ever having seen a practitioner or used a service (contact utilization) may be more accurate than reporting details of the frequency and duration of visits (volume utilization).86 Studies evaluating self-report of utilization consistently show an association between increased vi sit frequency and under reporting.80 Errors when using data from administrative da tabases for health claim s can include problems created by reliance on the database administrator to input claims data accurately and in a timely manner. Typically there may be problems with linking patient demographic information and patient use information, as well as incomplete data on some enrolled members. For studies in the U.S., it is likely that patients who are not covere d or who have insufficient medical coverage will be less likely to seek services; as such there is the potential for select ion biases despite large claimant samples. 85 In addition, differences in codes to de fine back pain, episodes of care, the provider types, and method of cost estimates ma y present some limitations in comparison across studies. It is not clear to what degree these factors can be standa rdized for future research, but reporting of these key characte ristics would be helpful. Distinguishing the CAM Practitioner From the CAM Intervention Our systematic review consistently found t hat the use of the CAM therapy and the provider of the therapy were poorly detailed. Many of the eligible st udies on CAM use were based on populations derived from CAM provider practices; as such one could assume that 100 percent of the sample used CAM but no clarity as to which of many potential therapies the patient received. Ther e is also the problem of describing CAM therapies using broad categorie s that in reality encompass a variety of different therapies. For example, Traditional Chinese Medicine employs a variety of treatments some of which, such as use of herbals and needling, are considered CAM while others such as exercise therapy or t he use of heat and cold are not. The lack of specificity of the provider type is also problematic. C onsider again Traditional Chinese Medicine, where based on most of the lite rature we would likely assume that the provider was an acupuncturist, but this is not necessarily the case. There is also the possibility that the same provider types located in different countries, display markedly different patterns of use. For example, osteopathic practices within the U.S. have broader philosophies of care relative to their counterparts within the Un ited Kingdom who focus more on traditional spinal adjustments. The degree to which the provider type contributes to differences in patterns of use is generally not known in the litera ture specific to CAM use for back pain. As well, the degree to 137which regional, rather than natio nal differences, are factors contri buting to varying rates of use, could not be assessed within the current literature. Provider attributes such as professional designation, years of experience, and area of specialty, w ere also detailed poo rly, limiting evaluation of the leve l of influence these factors have on frequency and duration of CAM use. The lack of detail about the provider is further confounded when some CAM therapies can be ad ministered by non-profe ssionals or are self- administered. If the goal of utilization research is to evaluate provider-based use, then care should be taken in the phrasing of survey or interview questions query ing CAM therapies that can be self-administere d. Clearly, to understand the patterns of use the provider details are critical. The lack of specificity about both the CAM th erapy and the provider, present challenges in interpreting utilization patterns across studies. Future rese arch should provide greater clarity about the type of provider and the CAM therapy. More im portant ly, future research endeavors should link the detailed CAM ther apies utilization da ta to specific provider types. Distinguishing Complementary Versus Alternative Lack of specificity regarding both the pr ovider and the details of the CAM therapy adm inistered are also important limitations with regards to evaluating the degree to which CAM services overlap with each other or with services or care fr om conventional providers. The degree of overlap was not reported in the majority of studies. This lack of specificity was also evident in descriptions of therapies provide d by \"conventional\" providers which can include CAM therapies. Future research in this area should endeavor to document these aspects of overlap in order to better understand patterns of use. As more \"conventional practitioners\" choos e to use CAM therapies within their \"convention al\" practices, the distinction between alternative and traditiona l is becoming blurred. When evaluating studies, it was not clear what \"CAM use only\" or \"conventional care only\" implied with respect to alternative versus complementary treatments. There is also the problem of shifting classification of what is labeled CAM. As noted previously, the operational definition of \"alternative\" implies that the therapy is used in place of conventional medicine. 73 Our review would suggest that chiropractic treatment is used frequently and in many instances is \"conventional care\" in the U.S. Similarly in studies undertaken in the United Kingdom, acupuncture provided by a physioth erapist was labeled as conventional therapy; acupuncture provided by a \"conventional\" provider is the primary modality used to manage chronic back pain in the U.K. 110 Classification is further complicated by the designation of some treatments as \"integrative\" medicine, implying that care combines alternative and conventiona l care. It is likely that patterns of use of a particular therapy, irrespective of the label of al ternative or conventional will be affected by the provider and their care philosophy. Future studies should endeavor to specify operational definitions for alternative and conventional therapies and providers. This will assist not only in understanding patterns of use within a study, but al so interpretation of variations across utilization studies. Potential Limitations of the Systematic Review Process The eligible studies within this systematic review were limited to primary studies in the English language; although this m ay not be an im portant factor for U.S. studies, it may be a 138source of bias for studies in the other eligible countries. Our focus was on summarizing literature from the U.S. Evaluating literature on CAM use in Canada, the United Kingdom, Europe, New Zealand, and Australia was a secondary focus. We undertook a comprehensive search and used over 150 CAM related search term s; however we recognize that we used a relatively small number of terms specific to supplements and herbals. There are over 10,000 types of thes e products and searching for each specifically was not within the scope of this review. Although we recognize that there is inconsistenc y in these term s, we did not exclude studies based on their definition of back pain, and its du ration (i.e., chronic or acute). When operational definitions for neck or back pain were provided, considerable variability was observed across studies. The majority of studies in this review focused on querying subjects with regard to their back complaint(s) and use of CAM; most studi es did not distinguish the potential for CAM therapies received to include management of other secondary health complaints which are a potential source of contamination. We did not rest rict the source of the back pain allowing for both musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal causes . Nor did we restrict studies because of the potential for associated co-morbidities such as depression in chronic LBP patients. Many of the studies depended on self-report of CAM and back pain, and as such, are dependent on the respondents' know ledge of both the CAM therapy and their understanding of back pain either of which may differ from that of the researchers. Additionally, we accepted any definition of the CAM therapies specified with in each study and this w ould naturally introduce variability in our summaries of the use of these therapies. So me studies defined CAM as \"any treatment or remedy, other than standard over the counter medications, which you are using or have used\" and others provided great level of detail with regard to different CAM therapies. We did restrict some types of therap ies that we were considered pr edominately conventional such the use of medications and spinal injections. No attempt was made to distinguish those CAM therapies that are safe or effective, but ra ther the focus was on reporting all use of CAM therapies. Finally, we did not restrict st ud ies by the manner in which the utilization was collected or reported. Variability in reporting and means of collecting utilization of CAM therapies was substantial. We evaluated both contact and volume utilization outcomes. Conclusions Although we evaluated 74 studies on utilization and costs in persons with back pain using CAM therapies, there were sign ificant lim itations in understandi ng the patterns of use across studies. In part the variation a nd inconsistencies across studies ma y be attributable to lack of consensus on reporting in utilization and other health services studies. Consensus on reporting standards such as the CONSORT Statement fo r randomized control trial studies provide guidance as to the level of detail required in specifying the characterist ics of the population, the intervention, and the outcomes. Activities in this regard will assist future evaluation of utilization studies in general. Our systematic review demonstrates that CAM th erapies are frequently used by persons with back pain. Understanding the patterns of CAM ther apy utilization would assist in setting research priorities for evaluation of specific CAM therapies or providers . Our findings would support the following conclusions and recommendations for future research in this area: 139Population 1) Many studies provided m inimal information a bout the characteristics of the sample. In particular, most reports on utilization of CAM therapies do not specify an operational definition for back pain with respect to the anatomical loca tion, or the duration of pain. We recommend that future studies ade quately detail the st udy subjects under investigation and explicitly detail the location of the back pain and whether it is acute or chronic. 2) Low back was the m ost frequently evaluated anatomical region. Fewer studies evaluated the use of CAM for neck and thorax. Although, we recognize that the prevalence of back problems is lower in these regions, our revi ew did not find sufficient evidence to support the differential use of CAM therapies as a function of location. We recommend that future utilization studies of CAM use for back pain address any poten tial differential use of therapies as a function of anatomical lo cation. We also recomme nd capture of use of CAM therapies for multiple back regions being treated within or across episodes of care, since some CAM therapies treat regions dist ant from the low back as part of their theoretical model of back pain care. Intervention 3) CAM therap ies were frequently identified as br oad categories, with little specification of the type of modality used. Similarly, the providers of the therapies were very poorly detailed or were not linked to the therapies received. We re commend that future studies adequately detail the specific type of CAM therapy, and link this to the providers of the therapy. 4) There were f ew studies that evaluated the us e of CAM therapies rela tive to each other for back pain. The available studies would suggest that chiropractic/manipulation is the most frequently used modality followed by massa ge and acupuncture. We recommend that future studies evaluating relative use of CAM include a comprehensive list of CAM therapies and provide details in this regard. We recommend th at this use be linked to all providers of the therapy. We also recommend that use with other CAM therapies is differentiated with respect to current and past episodes of back pain. Comparator 5) Concurrent use of different CAM or conve ntional therapies was not well reported. A signif icant gap in the literature has been id entified. We recommend that future studies detail the level of concurrent use of other CAM or conventional therapies with respect to current or past episodes of care, location of back pain, and the pr ovider of the therapy. 6) Our review would suggest that there was in consistency with regards to the types of therapies and providers consid ered conventional or altern ative. W e recommend that future studies explicitly detail the nature of the therapies linked to specific providers rather than relying on labels of conventi onal or alternative th erapies or providers. Outcomes 7) Utilization o f CAM services is generally presented as a dichotomous outcome (use or non-use); less information is available with regards to frequency, duration and type of service provision for an episode of care. We would recommend that future research probe frequency and duration of use (pre ferably in more than one time interval), associated with both the CAM therapy and the provider of the therapy. We also recommend that the \"episode of care\" being evalua ted be explicitly defined. 1408) The primary source of information on utiliza tion of CAM therapies for back pain comes from self-report within questionnaires and from retrospective administrative healthcare analyses. We recommend that explicit details of the survey or interview questions are provided including the operational definitions of the CAM therapies and the categories of providers. Similarly, we recommend that exp licit definitions for the type of back pain, the provider types, and the therapy received are provided for studies using administrative databases. 9) The studies reporting cost outcom es are primarily cost identification in nature rather than true economic analyses. The perspective was pr imarily that of the payer and as such, only direct costs were evaluated. We recommend that future evaluation of costs include details about indirect costs, consider the costs fr om a societal perspec tive, and use formal economic analyses that consider the benefits and harms associated with intensity of use. Other 10) A single CPG reported on frequency of use as a function of low back pain duration. The m ajority of U.S. CPG guidelines on CAM therapies did not report utilization or recommend parameters for optimal use. A si gnificant gap in the literature has been identified. We recommend that future guidelin e development attempt to address this gap for CAM therapies as a function of back re gion and duration; guide line developers should indicate when these recommendations are based on evidence and when they reflect best practice. 11) Few studies were found that re ported provider views on reco mmendations for the optimal utilization of CAM therapies for back pa in. Providers' philosophies of care and healthcare setting constraints may affect patt erns of use. We recommend that future studies explore issues in pr ovider and possibly patient views about the frequency and duration of utilization. We r ecommend that these views be explored in th e context of specific subgroups of back patients based on location and duration, different providers of the same CAM therapy, and conventional provi ders' views of their own interventions and those of CAM providers. 141 142References 1.
