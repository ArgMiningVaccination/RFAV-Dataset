The ob jectiv e is to deriv e conclusions ab out protection duration of v accination. TBE is a serious infection a\u001becting the cen tral nerv ous system and Austria is a high risk region of TBE. A ctiv e imm unization b y v accination en TBE w of Austria's p opulation is v accinated. The statistical analysis is based on observ ational data collected from p ersons who delib erately w en t for a test of their TBE an tib o dy lev el at the Institut f\u00fcr Hygiene, Mikrobiologie und T rop en- an tib dy concen tration in blo o d serum (titer) obtained from an ELISA-test, the data set con- tains information on sex, n um b er of b o oster v accinations, age and time since last v accination (co v ariates). V arious parametric regression t yp e mo dels are t to in v estigate the decrease of titer after v acci- nation.

TBEV is a Fla vivirus and is distinguished b y the follo wing subt yp es due Cen tral Europ e, Eastern Europ e, eden, Southern Finland - F ar-Eastern subt yp e: Asian part of Russia, Northern China, Northern Japan - Sib erian subt yp e The term tick-b orne enc ephalitis already indicates that the TBEV is mainly transmitted b y tic ks. Rarely infection o ccurs after consumption of unpasteurized dairy pro ducts (Rendi-W agner, 2004a, p.307). Humans b ecome most lik ely infected with TBEV b y the sting1of infected tic ks, whic h migh t b e wip ed o\u001b from grass or bushes during outdo or activities. Tic ks liv e in v egetation at ground lev el up to one meter. Children are often stung b y tic ks in to the head, arms and the upp er part of the b o dy , whereas gro wn-ups are rather stung in to the legs and the lo w er part of the b o dy (Stanek & Hofmann, 1994). In Cen tral Europ e tic ks are activ e b et w een April and No v em b er. Main activit y tak es place in Ma y/June and Septem b er/Octob er. Three to four w eeks after those p erio ds more o ccurrences of TBE cases can b e observ ed. The rst description of an unkno wn seasonal p eak of serious meningitis cases in an eastern district of Austria w as done b y Sc hneider (1931). The incidence of tic ks is highest in h umid areas with ann ual a v erage temp erature ab o v e sev en degrees Celsius (Kunz, 1992). Mild win ters and h umid summers supp ort the repro duction of tic ks and the activit y of tic ks increases. Tic ks prefer meado ws and w o o dlands where a lot of little mammals liv e whic h migh t serv e as alternate hosts. Detailed explanations of dev elopmen t cycle of tic ks and TBEV go b ey ond the scop e of this in tro ductiv e part and can b e found in Dumpis et al. (1999), Charrel (2004) and Heinz (2006). The prev alence of TBEV in tic ks di\u001bers from y ear to y ear and v aries b et w een regions. An in v estigation on TBEV prev alence in tic ks w as for example done in St yria (Upp er-Austria) 1992 1The term of sting instead of bite shall b e used in this thesis on the accoun t of L\u00f6ser et al. (2002).2.2 P athology 3 and the rate of infected tic ks w as 0.44% (Labuda, 1993). Areas in Austria with high risk to b e infected b y TBE are situated along the Dan ub e, in St yria, Carin thia and in Burgenland, see gure 2.1. Figure TBE risk areas in Austria, AR GE Gesundheitsv orsorge (Do wnload: 2006-11-13) 2.2 P athology The incubation time for TBE normally lies b et w een 4 and 14 da ys. The course of TBE can often b e distinguished in t w o phases. In the rst phase, whic h lasts three to v e da ys, patien ts su\u001ber from illness similar to in uenza (Binder, 1996, p.52). After a symptom free in terv al of ab out one w eek, appro ximately t w o third of infected p ersons pass in to the second phase of the disease with encephalitic symptoms in v olving the CNS (Kaiser, 2002). Dep ending on the a\u001bection of the CNS, time to reco v ery is extended to sev eral mon ths. The course of TBE disease is strongly related to the age of the victim. Esp ecially p ersons ab o v e 40 y ears su\u001ber sev ere discomfort. The risk of p ostencephalitic syndromes including spinal nerv dysphasia, ataxia and paresis as w ell as the risk of p ermanen t sequelae rises with increasing age (Charrel, 2004, p.1043). Mortalit y rate for TBE in Europ e is less than 1%. More information on symptoms, di\u001beren t manifestations and prognosis of TBE is a v ailable in Kaiser (2006). Some examples for clinical studies in v estigating the sev erit y of TBE diseases are Jezyna (1984) in P oland, K \u00f6 c k (1992) in Austria, Haglund (1996) in Sw eden, Kaiser (1999) in German y and Mic kiene (2002) in Lith uania. 2.3 V accination So far no e cien t drug against TBEV has b een found and treatmen t of TBE is only supp ortiv e (Dumpis et al. , 1999, p.887). Besides a v oiding to get stung b y an infected tic k, accurately timed activ e imm unization against TBEV app ears the most e\u001bectiv e w a y to prev en t TBE. The rst v accine w as dev elop ed in the early 1970s in Austria. The full v accine dosage (0.5 ml) con tains 2.02.4 Lab oratory diagnosis 4 to 2.75 \u00b5 tigen. F or c hildren and adolescen ts up to 16 y ears only half of the dosage (0.25 ml) is used. (Gesellsc haft f\u00fcr Virologie 2003; Barrett, 2004) The basic imm unization proto col consists of three v accinations. The rst t w o v accinations should b e 2 - 12 w eeks apart. The third v accination follo ws 9 - 12 mon ths later. The protection rate after three basic v accinations is 96 - 98.7% (Kunz, 2003). F ormerly it w as recommended to do b o oster v accinations ev ery three y ears after the basic imm unization. Sev eral studies lik e Rendi- W agner (2004b) and Kind (2004) evinced a longer protectiv e imm unit y . The curren t prop osal in Austria is to do the rst b o oster v accination after three y ears and the follo wing v accinations ev ery v e y ears. With increasing age the e\u001bect of v accination and its protection time decrease (Hainz, 2002). The Austrian National Board for Imm unization recommends p eople older than 60 y ears to do b o oster imm unization ev ery three y ears. In urgen t cases an accelerated basic imm unization sc hedule can b e applied (0, 7, 21 da ys). This is esp ecially in teresting for tra v ellers (AR GE Gesundheitsv orsorge, Do wnload: 2007-03-31b). Problems with unprotected p eople tra v elling to TBE risk areas are discussed in Rendi-W agner (2004a). 2.3.1 Mass v accination campaign in Austria In the 1970s Austria, former Czec hoslo v akia, Hungary , Slo v enia and Croatia had the highest n um b er of TBE inciden ts. In Austria a wide-spread TBE v accination campaign w as in tro duced in 1981. No w ada ys around 88% of Austrians are v accinated against TBE. ertheless there w ere 100 inciden ts of TBE in 2005 and 84 in 2006 (AR GE Gesundheitsv orsorge, Do wnload: 2007-03- 31a). Among the coun tries where TBE is endemic, Austria is the only one where TBE incidence has decreased since 1974. In all other coun tries the n um b er of TBE cases has increased (S\u00fcss, 2006, p.19). TBE v accination in Austria w as esp ecially promoted in sc ho ols and the prop ortion of TBE cases among older p eople increased. F or this reason the age pattern of TBE cases in Austria is di\u001beren t than in other Europ ean coun tries. (Kunz, 2003, p.52) 2.4 Lab oratory diagnosis As so on the h uman imm une system detects TBE agen ts in the blo o d circulation it reacts b y pro ducing sp eci c defensiv e an tib o dies, so-called immuno globulin (Ig) . T esting for imm unit y after a TBEV infection and imm une resp onse after TBE v accination is based on ELISA (enzyme link ed imm uno sorb en t assa y) systems. These are metho ds to detect substances lik e hormones or proteins, e.g. Ig. The existence of those substances is pro v ed if they react with so-called detection-an tib o dies, whic h are mark ed with an enzyme. This enzyme enables the con v ersion of a substrate and an an tigen-an tib o dy reaction can b e pro v ed. TBE sp eci c an tib o dies can b e detected for sev eral mon ths after infection or basic imm unization. In cases of former incidences with other Fla viviruses lik e v accination against y ello w fev er or Japan encephalitis or a previous Dengue virus infection it is necessary to use the more costly but more sp eci c neutralization test (Holzmann, 2003, p.39), b ecause cross-reactions with other Fla viviruses are p ossible b y using ELISA (Zo ehrer et al. , 2003, p.1167). After a natural infection the victim is imm une against TBEV and also against other subt yp es for the whole life (Mic kiene, 2006). In terested medical readers are recommended to study Holzmann (2003).3 Data 5 Chapter 3 Data In the follo wing c hapter observ ed data on TBE v accination are explored. First, the pro cess of data collection and features of the data are describ ed. Second, a p opulation of in terest is de ned up on whic h statistical mo dels for titer are applied in the subsequen t c hapters. Finally , simple frequency analysis on the constricted data is executed. Similar studies on the protection of TBE v accination with similar data situation ha v e b een done b y Kind (2004), Kind (2005) in Switzerland and a clinical trial w as done b y Rendi-W agner (2004b) in Austria. 3.1 Data collection and de nition of the p opulation of in terest F rom 1995 to 2004 data for 4031 measuremen ts w ere recorded of p ersons who w en t to the mi- crobiologic am bulance of Elisa- bethinen Linz for testing their TBE an tib o dy lev el. The underlying questionnaire w as designed b y deput y Dr. Lothar Binder. The attending ph ysician lled in the questionnaire in co op eration with the tested p ersons who are referred to as pr ob and or p articip ants in the follo wing. Imp ortan t items of the questionnaire w ere: - Ho w old is the proband at the momen t? - Whic h sex? - Is the basic imm unization proto col consisting of three v accinations completed? - When did those rst three basic v accinations tak e place? - Ho w man y TBE b o oster v accinations has the proband had so far? - When did the last TBE-v accination tak e place? - Has the proband had an y former inciden ts concerning y ello w fev er, fev brough t her/his p ersonal v accination card the ph ysician could use this \"ex- act\" data. Otherwise the answ ers w ere referred to the more or less v ague statemen ts of the participan ts from their memory . A few p ersons w en t to the am bulance for testing their titer t w o or more times and sev eral data records of them are a v ailable. Unfortunately t w o di\u001beren t tests, EnzygnostT MAn ti-TBE Virus ELISA and VIE-ELISA, where used to determine the TBE an tib o dy concen tration. Both metho ds b elong to ELISA systems, whic h ha v e already b een explained in the previous c hapter, section 2.4. F or simpli cation En- zygnost ELISA and VIE-ELISA are annotated d A and metho d B, resp ectiv ely .3.2 Restricting the analysis to the rst measuremen ts 6 The analysis of the measured titers is not so simple, b ecause in 383 cases titers measured b y metho d A w ere only noted do wn as \" <7U/ml \". This v alues w ere co ded with 6.99 to b e able to use them as n umerical v alues. F urthermore, titers measured b y metho d B w ere often recorded as \"< \" or \" > \" some v alue, that mak es an accurate analysis of titer di cult. Ho w ev er, these mea- sures ha v e b een co ded and are included in the analyzes. So far no functional relation b et w een the results of these t w o ELISA metho ds ha v e b een found and there is no p ossibilit y to analyze the measured results of metho d A and metho d B together. Another option is to classify the results of b oth metho ds. A ccording to the ph ysicians at the Institut f or Hygiene, Mikr obiologie und Tr openmedizin titers ab o v e 25U/ml measured b y metho d A and titers ab o v e 126V IEU measured b y metho d B can b e referred to as ser op ositive and a b o oster v accination is not nec- essary at the momen t. In table 3.1 the categories for the measured titers in b oth metho ds are summarized. T able 3.1: Used categories for titers measured b y metho d A and metho d B category metho d A in U/ml metho d B in >25 >126 As the data do not origin from a planned clinical trial, it is necessary to de ne prop erly a p opulation on whic h the statistical analysis will b e based. Bac kground kno wledge ab out TBE is tak en in to consideration. First all 35 cases, where former con tact with other Fla viviruses w as stated, are excluded to a v oid biased results due to cross-reactivit y of Fla viviruses in ELISA tests. The main in terest in this study is the ev olution of TBE titer after basic imm unization. Therefore only those few data records are used, where the basic imm unization is de nitely completed. After this exclusions a data collection consisting of 430 data records is obtained where 250 records are measured b y metho d A and 180 are measured b y metho d B. This is going to b e the sample of in terest on whic h the follo wing analyzes are based. 3.2 Restricting the analysis to the rst measuremen ts In this section data is split in a part with only measuremen ts b y metho d A and another part with only measuremen ts b y metho d B. T o guaran that observ ations are indep enden t from eac h other only the rst measuremen t of eac h participan t is used. This results in 213 rst measuremen ts b y metho d A (sample A1) and 159 rst measuremen ts b y metho d B (sample B1). In sample A1 66.20% and in B1 61.78% of the observ ations are from female participan ts. The sligh t di\u001berence b et w een the groups is not signi can t ( 2-, Fisher's exact test). In table 3.2 age at time of the titer test, time since last v accination and n um b er of b o oster v accinations are compared for the samples A1 and B1. F or none of these v ariables a signi can t di\u001berence b et w een the samples A1 and B1 can b e pro v ed (Mann-Whitney-U-, 2- test). T able 3.3 sho ws the frequency for the categorized v ariable. The relativ e frequency for serop ositiv e titer is almost equal for b oth samples. A Fisher's Exact test did not detect a signi can t di\u001berence b et w een sample A1 and sample B1. As there are only 9 cases in the negativ e category it is b etter for further analyzes to com bine the classes b orderline and negativ e in one category .

Comparativ e b o xplots w ere created in gure 3.1 and gure 3.2 to compare the distribution of measured titers b y sex and n um b er of b o oster v accinations. A ccording to Vittingho\u001b et al. (2005, p.12) a b o xplot pro vides information on lo cation, spread, range of observ ations, presence of outliers and some information ab out the shap e of the distribution. The b o x sizes are prop ortional to the n um b er of observ ations in the group. In gure 3.3 and gure 3.4 scatterplots for logarithm of titers dep ending on age at the time of titer test and time since last v accination are prin ted. The logarithmic scale w as c hosen to get b etter comparabilit y of titers measured b y metho d A and titers measured b y metho d B. The t w o horizon tal lines represen t the b orders for the categories seronegativ e and b orderline, according to table 3.1. A non-parametric scatterplot smo other is added to get a b etter impression on the trend of the logarithm of titer dep ending on age at the time of titer test and time since last v accination. F or b oth metho ds logarithm of titer decreases with increasing age and time since last v accination. After in v estigating the dep endency of the outcome v ariable titer on eac h of the co v ariates sex, n um b er of b o oster v accinations, age and time since last v accinations follo wing tendencies can b e summarized: - W omen ha v e lo w er titers than men (at least for metho d A) - Titers increase with increasing n um b er of b o oster v accinations - Titers decrease with increasing age - Titers decrease with increasing time since last v accination3.2 Restricting the analysis to the rst measuremen ts 8 Figure 3.1: Bo xplots of titers measured b y metho d A (left) and metho d B (righ t) for female and male participan ts Figure 3.2: Bo xplots of titers measured b y metho d A (left) and metho d B (righ t) for di\u001beren t n um b ers of b o oster v accinations3.2 Restricting the analysis to the rst measuremen ts 9 log(titer), method A log(titer), method B Figure 3.3: Scatterplots of logarithm of titers measured b y metho d A (left) and metho d B (righ t) against age at the time of titer test log(titer), method A log(titer), method B Figure 3.4: Scatterplots of logarithm of titers measured b y metho d A (left) and metho d B (righ t) against time since last v accination4 Linear regression 10 Chapter 4 Linear regression In the follo wing c hapter linear regression analysis is applied to in v estigate the relation b et w een titer and the co v ariates sex, n um b er of b o oster v accinations, age and time since last v accination in the sample A1. 4.1 The mo del The outcome v ariable titer as w ell as the predictors age and time since last v accination can b e considered as con tin uous. F rom no w on the v ariable age represen ts the age of the participan t at her/his last v accination. Sex is a nominal v ariable with t w o v alues ( 0 = male and 1 = female). The v ariable n um b er of b o oster v accinations is divided in to three categories ( 0 = zero b o oster v accinations, 1 = one b o oster v accination, 2 = t w o or more b o oster v accinations) and dummy variables ha v e to b e used. Figure 4.1 sho ws a scatterplot matrix of these v ariables. Figure 4.1: Scatterplot matrix of titer, sex, n um b er of b o oster v accinations, age and time since last v accination Supp osing that the Gauss-Mark o v conditions hold, the follo wing linear regression mo del is as-4.2 Estimation of parameters 11 i+i (4.1) iN(0, 2)i.i.d. 4.2 Estimation of parameters The estimated parameters for mo del (4.1) are giv en in table 4.1.

The exp ected titer increases with the n um b er of b o oster v accinations. These results are not signi can t (signi cance-lev el = 0.05) but b oth parameters for the con tin uous predictors age and time since last v accination are signi can t. The estimated error v ariance is v ery high, 2= 36906 . 4.3 Mo del v alidation The co e cien t of determination R2= 0.1210 is v ery lo w and indicates that the v ariabilit y of titer is p o orly explained b y the v ariables sex, n um b er of b o osters, age and time since last v accinations. Although accoun ting for the observ ed co v ariates a high degree of heterogeneit y in the data , so- called unobserve d heter o geneity , is left. Sev eral in teractions w ere tested if their inclusion w ould impro v e the mo del, but t -tests did not sho w an y signi cance. Hence, the mo del with only main e\u001bects of the predictors is analyzed in the next steps. In the next step the mo del is c hec k ed for v alidit y b y analyzing the residuals. Normalit y assumption Histogram and normal quan tile plot in gure 4.2 sho w a strong departure from normalit y and transformations are applied to the outcome v ariable titer.

Linearit y assumption F or c hec king the linearit y assumption in mo del (4.2) residuals ha v e b een plotted against eac h con tin uous predictor. The linearit y assumption for age seems adequate. The plot of residuals against time since last v accination sho ws a sligh tly quadratic trend, that migh t b e due to only a few observ ations with less than 3 y ears since last v accination. A regression mo del including the quadratic term lastV acc2w as tted, but t -test for this new parameter w as not signi can t.

This observ ation w as obtained on a man with t w o or more b o oster v accinations who had his last v accination 4 y ears ago at the age of 28. 4.4 Conclusion on regression mo dels It seems that the mo del for cubic ro ot transformed titers measured b y metho d A ful lls the requiremen ts for a linear regression mo del b est. But for this mo del it is theoretically p ossible that a negativ e v alue for titer1/3is predicted. This is not reasonable b ecause titer can only b e p ositiv e and therefore the cubic ro ot of titer has also to b e p ositiv e. F or a w oman with no b o oster v accination who had her last v accination 30 y ears ago at the age of 50 the exp ected v alue for cubic ro ot of titer is E(titer1/3) = 7 .240.621 + 0 .120 + 0 .8500.03500.1930 =0.49 Although this case is v ery unlik ely to observ e it w ould b e b etter to create a mo del whic h tak es in to accoun t that the outcome v ariable can only b e p ositiv e. F urthermore cubic ro ot of titer is hard to in terpret and linear regression w as also applied to the logarithm of titer.

As already men tioned in earlier sections a v ery exible kind of mo delling is pro vided b y general linear mo dels (GLMs). This mo del family is presen ted in the next c hapter.5 Generalized linear mo dels 15 Chapter 5 Generalized linear models Ob viously the un transformed outcome v ariable titer in U/ml do not ful ll the requiremen ts for a linear regression. Titer can only ha v e a p ositiv e v alue and the distribution is strongly righ t-sk ew ed. Cubic ro ot of titer app eared to b e an appropriate transformation, but is hard to in terpret. An analysis for the outcome v ariable on the original measured scale is desirable and is pro vided b y the family of generalized linear mo dels (GLM), whic h co v ers linear and nonlinear mo dels for normal or non-normal, discrete or con tin uous outcome v ariables (Mon tgomery, 2001, p.594). A further relaxing feature of GLMs in comparison with linear regression is, that the v ariance of the outcome v ariable do es not ha v e to b e constan t. Instead, the v ariance can b e mo delled as a function of the mean. In this c hapter essen tial ideas of GLMs for con tin uous and discrete outcomes are presen ted. F or further reading McCullagh & Nelder (1989), one of the standard b o oks on GLMs, is recom- mended. An in tro duction to theory and concepts of GLMs is presen ted b y Dobson (2002) and an applied approac h is giv en in Olsson (2002). 5.1 The mo del In linear regression mo dels the exp ected v alue of an individual observ E(yi) is mo delled as a linear com bination of the predictors. In GLMs an y of exp ected v alue can b e mo delled as a linear com bination of the predictor v ariables. This function is called link-function b ecause it \"links\" the exp ected v alue data. g(E(yi)) =g(\u00b5i) =0+1xi1+. . .+pxip (5.1) The distribution of the outcome v ariable Y in GLMs is assumed to b elong to the exp onen tial family binomial, exp onen tial and gamma distribution.

First and second momen t for this distribution are giv en b y E(Y) = b/prime() (5.3) V(Y) = \u00b7b/prime/prime() (5.4) and com bination of b oth leads to follo wing relationship b et w een mean and v ariance: V(Y) =b/prime/prime() =b/prime/prime/parenleftbig b/prime1(E(Y))/parenrightbig function , see for example Molen b erghs & V erb ek e (2005, p.27f ). It is assumed that eac h outcome Yi is from the same distribution with densit y f(yi|i, ) . Eac h observ v e a di\u001beren t natural parameter i but the scale parameter has to b e the same for all observ ations.

The normal distribution w ould clearly not b e an appropriate assumption for the distribution of titer. The densit y of the logarithmic normal dis- tribution has a v ery high p eak for lo w titers. Exp onen tial, W eibull and gamma distribution seem to b e more appropriate. The W eibull distribution can not b e brough t in to the canonical form of the exp onen tial family and exp onen tial distribution is just a sp ecial case of gamma distribution. It is reasonable to c ho ose the gamma distribution whic h is appropriate for non-negativ e v ariables with long righ t-tailed distributions.

ML estimation is a widely used estimation metho d where the lik eliho o d function of the observ ed data is maximized. The lik eliho o d function re ects ho w probable it is to observ e the actual data under the assumed mo del. Therefore the roles of parameters and random v ariables in the densit y function are simply switc hed. The random v ariable is held x (using the observ ed data) and the parameters are v aried. F or estimating GLMs the log-lik rst order deriv ativ e with resp ect to the parameter-v ector to zero. Asi are functions of i\u00b7(yi\u00b5i) = 0 (5.11) The last equation in (5.11) is obtained b y considering vi=v(\u00b5i) =b/prime/prime(i) =2b(i) 2 iand\u00b5i = vi\u00b7i . The obtained in (5.11) are called sc or e e quations and can b e solv ed iterativ ely b y e.g. Newton-Raphson algorithm or Fisher scoring.

In con trary to an additiv e mo del, where the absolute c hange of the outcome v ariable is measured, m ultiplicativ e mo dels measure the relativ e c hange. F or example it is estimated that a w oman in a v erage has only 71% of a man's titer giv en the other predictor v ariables are held constan t. If age is increased b y one y ear titer reduces b y 1%. All parameters except the n um b er of b o oster v accinations are signi can t (signi cance-lev el = 0.05). The estimated con dence in terv al for the scale parameter in table 5.1 do es not co v er 1 . The h yp othesis that an exp onen tial distribution w ould b e adequate is rejected. 5.3 Mo del v alidation (Scaled) deviance and P earson- 2can b e used for assessing go o dness of t in GLMs. The deviance (=121.89) is roughly equal to the degrees of freedom (=134) and indicates a quite fair mo del t. Ho w ev er, for v alidation of the mo del a residual analysis has to b e carried out. The plot of standardized deviance residuals against time sho ws again a sligh tly departure from the linearit y assumption on time since last v accination. All other residual plots do not sho w w orrying departures from the mo del assumptions and the sp eci ed mo del seems to b e adequate. Metho ds for c hec king the c hoice of link and v ariance function are explained in McCullagh & Nelder (1989). 5.4 Conclusion on GLMs Fitting a GLM based on gamma distribution with log-link-function seems to b e quite a go o d mo del for the data. This coincides with the linear regression mo del on titer1/3in section (4.1), b ecause it is kno wn that an accurate normalizing transformation for a gamma distributed v ariable Y is 3/parenleftBigg/parenleftbiggY /parenrightbigg1/3 1/parenrightBigg , where is the used in (5.7), see McCullagh & Nelder (1989, p.289). Also discrete outcome v ariables can b e mo delled with GLMs and w ere applied to the binary v ariables indicating serop ositiv e titer for b oth, titers measured b y metho d A and titers measured b y metho d B. Dic hotomizing the v ariable titer induces a loss of information. The idea b ehind mo delling the less informativ e binary v ariable w as to nd a p ossibilit y for mo delling the outcome v ariables of metho d A and metho d B together, but the results of GLMs on the binary v ariable for metho d B w ere quite di\u001beren t from GLMs on the binary v ariable for metho d A and a common analysis w ould not b e reasonable. Metho d A is more commonly used in the lab oratories and further analyzes are concen trated on mo delling titers measured b y metho d A.6 Rep eated measures analysis 20 Chapter 6 Repeated measures analysis In the previous c hapters mo dels for indep enden t observ ations w ere presen ted and only the rst measuremen t of eac h p erson w as used in analyzes to guaran tee indep endence b et w een obser- v ations. No w, all a v ailable measuremen ts should b e included and mo dels are required whic h tak e a p ossible dep endence b et w een rep eated measuremen ts on the same observ ational unit in to consideration. The um brella term for mo delling rep eatedly measured data is r ep e ate d me asur es analysis . Analysis of rep eated measures in general is describ ed in Cro wder & Hand (1990). More sp eci c b o oks on analysis of longitudinal data esp ecially in health sciences are pro vided b y Diggle (2002) and Fitzmaurice et al. (2004). V ery extensiv e b o oks on linear mixed mo dels and mo dels for dis- crete longitudinal data are giv en b y V erb ek e & Molen b erghs (2000) and Molen b erghs & V erb ek e (2005), resp ectiv ely . In the last three b o oks SAS program co de is prin ted as w ell as in Bro wn & Prescott (1999). A lot of b o oks on longitudinal analysis exist and only some of them ha v e b een pic k ed out. 6.1 F eatures of longitudinal data Longitudinal data are obtained b y taking sev eral measuremen ts on a sub ject at di\u001beren t p oin ts of time. Observ ations are no longer indep enden t. In Fitzmaurice et al. (2004, p.36\u001b.) three sources of correlation in longitudinal data are men tioned: Bet w een-individual heterogeneit y: Esp ecially in health sciences there is a lot of natural het- erogeneit y among individuals due to genetic, en vironmen tal, so cial and b eha vioral factors. It is exp ected that rep eated measuremen ts on the same ject are more similar than observ ations across di\u001beren t individuals. Within-individual biological v ariation: Most health-related v ariables v ary considerably o v er time. Circadian rh ythms, temp erature, ligh t, season, diet, infections etc. migh t ha v e an in uence. It is assumed that random departures from the underlying biological pro cess are more similar for measuremen ts close together in time. Serial correlation is assumed to decrease o v er time b et w een rep eated measures on an individual. Measuremen t error: Random measuremen t errors o ccur in almost all studies. The precision of measuremen ts can b e expressed b y terms of the v ariance of the measuremen t errors. If6.2 Explorativ e analysis of rep eatedly measured data 21 this v ariance is large the correlation among rep eated measuremen ts app ears lo w er than it w ould b e in a study where more reliable measuremen ts w ere obtained. Ignoring the correlation in longitudinal data results in misleading inference on regression co e - cien ts, less e cien t estimates and less protection against bias caused b y missing data. (Diggle, 2002, p.19). If the n um b er of rep eated observ ations is the same for all individuals tak en at a common set of o ccasions, longitudinal data are called b alanc e d (Fitzmaurice et al. , 2004, p.23). In retrosp ectiv e studies un balanced data are common. Incomplete data require some care and a lot of literature exists on the topic of missing data. In health sciences longitudinal data are rarely complete and balanced o v er time and metho ds for longitudinal analysis should b e able to handle those sp eci cs. Once more the goal of longitudinal analysis should b e emphasized: \"In summary , the fundamen tal ob jectiv e of a longitudinal analysis is the assessmen t of within-individual c hanges in the resp onse and the explanation of systematic dif- ferences among individuals in their c hanges.\" (Fitzmaurice et al. , 2004, p.21) 6.2 Explorativ e analysis of rep eatedly measured data Figure 6.1: Distribution of all 162 a v ailable titers at eac h o ccasion (left) and against time since last v accination (righ t). Rep eated measuremen ts on the same p erson are connected. The rep eated measures in the TBE data at hand b elong to the class of longitudinal data, b ecause sev eral p ersons w en t to the hospital t w o or more times for testing their titer. Unfortunately , di\u001beren t tests (metho d A or metho d B) w ere sometimes used on the same p erson. It has already b een men tioned that no form ula is kno wn to recalculate results of one test in to a measuremen t of the other test. One idea to deal with this problem w as using only categories serop ositiv e and seronegativ e for titer measuremen ts. But the application of GLMs for discrete v ariables ga v e v ery di\u001beren t results for observ ations measured b y metho d A and observ ations measured b y metho d B. The analysis of a p o oled sample w ould not at all b e reliable. Hence, only all a v ailable measuremen ts b y metho d A are analyzed. There are 3 p ersons with 3 measuremen ts b y metho d6.2 Explorativ e analysis of rep eatedly measured data 22 T able 6.1: Descriptiv e statistics of titer (in U/ml ), age (in y ears) at the time of titer test and time (in y ears) since last v accination at rst, second, third measuremen t titer (in U/ml ) min Q0.25 (100%) age (in ears) M1 5 17.5 36 43.5 85 35.18 18.53 140 (100%) M2 11 19 45 66 86 45.58 23.97 19 (100%) M3 20 20 46 57 57 41.00 19.00 3 (100%) T otal 5 18 37 45 86 36.51 19.41 162 (100%) time since last v acc.

Data are highly un balanced b ecause the n um b er of observ ations p er measuremen t is quite di\u001beren t. F urthermore the distances b et w een successiv e measuremen ts v ary individually . Although none of the participan ts got a b o oster v accination after their titer tests, titer increases in 7 cases of successiv e measuremen ts.

T able 6.1 summarizes descriptiv e statistics of the con tin uous v ariables titer, age at the time of titer test and time since last v accination. A v erage titer and median titer reduces from rst to the third measuremen t. Time since last v accination increases in a v erage b ecause none of the p ersons with more than one observ ation got a v accination in-b et w een. A v erage age at the time of titer test w ould also b e exp ected to increase. The decrease of a v erage age from second to third measuremen t is due to the little n um b er of observ ations. A t least the median of age increases.6.2 Explorativ e analysis of rep eatedly measured data 23 T able 6.3: F requency analysis of n um b er of b o oster v accinations at rst, second, third mea- suremen t n um b er of b o osters 0 1 2 n M1 40 (28.57%) 24 (17.14%) 76 (54.29%) 140 (100%) 162 (100%) T ables 6.2 and 6.3 presen t the prop ortions of sex and n um b er of b o oster v accinations at rst, second and third measuremen t.

Half of all observ ations are made on participan ts with t w o or more b o oster v accinations. F or exploring the degree of asso ciation b et w een successiv e measuremen ts a scatterplot matrix is prin ted in gure 6.2 and correlations are calculated. F or computation of correlations all a v ailable pairs of rep eatedly measured titers are used. The correlation b et w een rst and second measure- men t 0.86 is calculated on 19 pairs and the other t w o correlations are based on 3 pairs. It seems that the correlation b et w een successiv e measuremen ts is equal and decreases with titers at at rst, sec- ond, third measuremen t F or the TBE data a selection e\u001bect on rep eated measuremen ts can b e observ ed. P ersons who had a v ery lo w titer at their rst measuremen t go rather for a b o oster v accination than to do another blo o d test. Rep eated measuremen ts are only a v ailable of p eople who exp ect ha ving a high titer. One reason for this phenomenon is that the costs for v accination and blo o d test are almost the same. F or instance the v accine in Austria costs 22.50 e for adults (AR GE Gesundheitsv orsorge, Do wnload: 2007-03-31b) and the titer test costs 25 e .7 Mo dels for longitudinal data in the Gaussian case 24 Chapter 7 Models for longitudinal data in the Gaussian case Only a few rep eated measures are a v ailable and the follo wing c hapters are rather an outlo ok o v er p ossible mo dels for longitudinal data and a guideline ho w analysis on rep eated data could b e p erformed. Reliable statistical inference for the TBE data is not really p ossible due to the scarcit y of rep eated measuremen ts. F or further reading on analysis of Gaussian longitudinal data Diggle (2002) and V erb ek e & Molen b erghs (2000) are recommended. Applied approac hes are giv en in Bro wn & Prescott (1999) andFitzmaurice et al. (2004). F ollo wing notation for longitudinal data is used: On i= 1, . . . , N sub jects an outcome v ari- able Y is measured ni times p er sub ject i .yij denotes the of co v ariate jects and X is the onding (N\u00d7p) -matrix of co v ariate v this c hapter regression mo dels for Gaussian data discussed in c hapter 4 are extended b y including rep eated measures. Titers ha v e turned out not to b e normally distributed, but the cubic ro ot app eared to b e a normalizing transformation and mo dels for Gaussian longitudinal data are applied to the outcome v ariable titer1/3. 7.1 Marginal mo dels for longitudinal data in the Gaussian case Marginal or p opulation-a v eraged mo dels do not accoun t explicitly for b et w een-individual hetero- geneit y and are mainly used in p opulation studies lik e epidemiology . The in terest is on di\u001berences b et w een groups in the p opulation with di\u001beren t risk factors (Zeger et al. , 1988, p.1051). 7.1.1 The mo del Most parametric mo dels for con tin uous longitudinal data are based on normalit y assumptions. The univ ariate linear regression mo del is simply extended to longitudinal data b y assuming that eac h resp onse v ector yi of sub ject i can b e mo delled as the m ultiv ariate v ersion of a normal7.1 Marginal mo dels for longitudinal data in the Gaussian case 25 linear regression mo del. yi=Xi+i YiN(Xi, Vi) Vi is the co v ariance matrix for measuremen ts of sub ject o\u001b-diagonal-elemen ts denote the co v ariances for t w eated measuremen ts on sub ject i . mo del is giv en b y: y=X+ (7.1) YN(X,V), (7.2) where V is aN\u00d7N -blo c k diagonal matrix with the individual co v ariance matrices Vi on the diagonal and zero elsewhere. This structure assumes that outcomes for di\u001beren t sub jects are indep enden t. If all sub jects ha v e an equal n um b er of measuremen ts ) tak en at xed p oin ts of time then the c hoice of the same general n\u00d7n p ositiv e de nite co v ariance matrix for all sub jects ( Vi=V ) w ould b e appropriate. In this case the co v ariance structure is called homogenous. But also heterogeneous v ersion for co v ariance structures are p ossible. (Molen b erghs & V erb ek e, 2005, p.36) F or the TBE data the outcome v ector yi with comp onen ts yij=titer1/3 ij for eac h sub ject i is mo delled as a regression mo del dep ending on the co v ariates sex, n um b er of b o oster v accinations, age at last b o oster v accination and time since last v accination. Sex is of course constan t o v er time and lastV acc represen ts the time v ariable. Num b er of b o osters and age at last b o oster v accination do not c hange o v er time b ecause none of the participan ts with rep eated observ a- tions had a b o oster v accination b et w een the measuremen ts. Di\u001beren t co v ariance T o eplitz, AR(1), comp ound symmetry) for Vi w ere applied and compared b y lik e- liho o d ratio tests and Ak aik e information criterion (AIC). It turned out that an auto-regressiv e co v ariance structure (AR(1)) is most appropriate. 7.1.2 of parameters Estimation of parameters in marginal mo dels for Gaussian longitudinal data is based on ML- principles. Dep ending on the c hoices for the blo c k matrices Vi there migh t b e some additionally unkno parameters = (1, 2, e asp ects of the co v ariance or correlation. Usually v ariance comp onen ts are not kno wn and m ust b e estimated from the data at hand. Primary in terest is on the estimation of the regression parameters and v ariance comp onen ts are referred to as nuisanc e p ar ameters . Their estimation is of secondary7.2 Linear mixed mo dels for longitudinal data 26 in terest for the researc h question but they ha v e to b e tak en in to accoun t to assure an appropriate metho d of analysis (Fitzmaurice et al. , 2004, p.72). If the co v ariance matrix Vi has b een wrongly sp eci ed the p oin t estimators for the parameters are still un biased but the standard errors b ecome incorrect. V alid standard errors for can b e obtained b y the so-called information sandwich estimator or Hub er estimator (Dobson, 2002, p.200), whic h is robust to sp eci cation of the structure of the co v ariance matrices and is a consisten t estimator for the v ariance of the estimated parameter v ector V() as long as the mean is correctly sp eci ed (Molen b erghs & V erb ek e, 2005, p.61). In nite samples ML- estimates of Vi ha v e w ell-kno wn bias b ecause the ML-estimates do not tak e in to consideration that the parameter v ector w as also estimated from the data. Therefore the metho d of restricted maxim um lik eliho o d (REML) estimation w as in tro duced b y P atterson & Thompson (1971) for estimating v ariance comp onen ts. REML-estimated parameters are giv en in table 7.1 for the marginal mo del of titer1/3assuming an AR(1) co v ariance structure. F or the standard errors the robust Hub er estimator w as used.

Residual c hec ks do not sho w an y sev ere departures from the mo del assumptions. Marginal mo dels do not tak e the di\u001beren t sources of v ariabilit y in to accoun t.

Mo dels including xed and random e\u001bects are called mixe d mo dels . In practice some predictors are assumed to b e xed across all individuals and only a subset of co v ariates is assumed to v ary randomly across sub jects.

If the researc h in terest is prediction of sub ject-sp eci c ev olutions, estimates for the random e\u001bects bi are needed and the conditional mo del sp eci cation in (7.5) m ust b e considered.

The parameter estimates for the xed e\u001bects in table 7.2 are almost the same as the parameter estimates in the marginal mo del, see table 7.1. Although a marginal mo del form ulation can b e obtained from a random-e\u001bects mo del they are not the same. Di\u001beren t random-e\u001bects mo d- els can pro duce the same marginal mo del and there are also some marginal mo dels whic h are not implied b y a mixed mo del. In con trast to the co v ariance patterns men tioned in section 7.1 random e\u001bects co v ariance structures do not require balanced data and the structure can b e de- scrib ed with few parameters. Linear mixed e\u001bects mo dels are particularly useful for the analysis of un balanced longitudinal data. (Fitzmaurice et al. , 2004, p.198f.) The assumed co v ariance structure could b e c hec k ed b y so-called empiric al semi-vario gr ams , but for the data at hand to o few rep eated measuremen ts are a v ailable. Residual c hec ks for the linear mixed mo del of cubic ro ot titer do not displa y an y w orrying departures from the mo del assumptions. 7.3 Conclusion on mo dels for Gaussian longitudinal data In gure 7.1 estimated titers are compared to the actually observ ed titer for the participan t with ID= 766 .

The increase of titer after the second measuremen t migh t b e due to within-individual biological v ariation or measuremen t error.

Estimates for titer w ere obtained b y applying mo dels for Gaussian longitudinal data to the transformed v ariable cubic ro ot of titer.

In marginal mo dels estimation is done for the a v erage of subgroups of a p opulation. In the left panel of gure 7.1 estimates are quite far apart from the observ ed titer b ecause the estimation is not done on the individual lev el but for an a v erage p erson in the group of men with t w o or more b o oster v accinations who had their last v accination at the age of 36. By assuming the un- structured co v ariance pattern the estimated titers are lo w er than for other c hoices of co v ariance structure. The sub ject-sp eci c estimated titers in the righ t panel of gure 7.1 are m uc h closer to the observ ed titers b ecause individual random e\u001bects w ere included. In the case of normally distributed outcome v ariables, marginal mo dels and sub ject-sp eci c mo d- els ha v e a close relationship. F or other distributions there is no suc h close connection (Molen- b erghs & V erb ek e, 2005, p.47). In the follo wing c hapter mo dels are presen ted whic h extend on the one hand marginal mo dels and on the other hand sub ject-sp eci c mo dels to distributions other than normal distribution.8 Mo dels for longitudinal data in the non-Gaussian case 31 Chapter 8 Models for longitudinal data in the non-Gaussian case So far only mo dels for longitudinal data on the cubic ro ot transformation of titer ha v e b een applied. This transformation \"normalizes\" the strongly righ t-sk ew ed outcome v ariable titer, but there is no illustrativ e in terpretation of cubic ro ot of titer and migh t b e di cult to comm unicate. Application of GLMs to the 140 rst measuremen ts has sho wn that a gamma distribution migh t b e a go o d c hoice for the distribution of titer measured b y metho d A and b ecause of that mo dels are tted b y using gener alize d estimating e quations (GEE) and gener alize d line ar mixe d mo d- els . Due to the elegan t prop erties of m ultiv ariate normal distribution the connection b et w een marginal and sub ject-sp eci c mo del form ulation is straigh tforw ard. Suc h close relations are not pro vided for other distributions. Dep ending on the researc h question either a marginal mo del form ulation is used to mo del p opulation-a v eraged means or a sub ject-sp eci c mo del is form ulated for inference on an individual lev el.

If the mo del for the marginal mean g(\u00b5i) =Xi is correctly sp eci ed the parameter v ector can b e estimated ev en if the correlation matrix Ri() is not correct. F or a start only a so-called working c orr elation structure has to b e assumed. In order to t a marginal mo del to the original outcome v ariable titer , gamma distribution is assumed and log-link-function and the same predictor v ariables are used as for the tted acc ij (8.2) F or the marginal mo del in the Gaussian case the AR(1) co v ariance pattern mo del seemed to b e satisfying.

Ai is a diagonal matrix and con tains the v ariance function of the sp eci ed distribution. Ri is assumed to b e Ini . Hence, the conditional v ariance P arameters in generalized linear mixed mo dels are based on maximizing the lik eliho o d for the xed parameters , the co v ariance matrix D for the random e\u001bects and the scale parameter : maximizing this lik eliho o d are the N in tegrals o v er the q -dimensional v ector bi . Only in some sp ecial cases, lik e for the normal assumption, an analytical solution exists. A ccording to Molen b erghs & V erb ek e (2005, p.268\u001b.) there are three p ossibilities for n umerical appro ximations of the lik eliho o d: appro ximation of the in tegrand, the data or the in tegral. Detailed explanations of these n umerical metho ds go b ey ond the scop e of this thesis. The in terested reader is recommended to study Molen b erghs & V erb ek e (2005). F or the follo wing it is assumed that pro cedures exist whic h pro vide estimates for the parameters based on ML- principles. Usually estimation of the parameters , D, is of primary in terest.

In SAS so-called r esidual pseudo likeliho o d estimation is used b y PROC GLIMMIX and computed estimates for xed parameters and v ariance comp onen ts are displa y ed in table 8.2. These estimates are quite di\u001beren t from those obtained from GEE for the marginal mo del, see table 8.1. Once more it should b e emphasized that there is no close relation b et w een marginal mo dels and sub ject-sp eci c mo dels in non-Gaussian case.

The next c hapter completes this thesis with comparison of estimates for all in v estigated mo dels and forecasts of titers.9 Mo del comparison, prediction and review 36 Chapter 9 Model comparison, prediction and review In this last c hapter all mo dels are compared and titers are predicted. A short review on mo dels, results and predictions closes this thesis. 9.1 Mo del comparison models for first measurements marginal models for l ongitudinal data mixed models for longitudinal data Figure 9.1: Comparison of estimated titers in di\u001beren t mo dels b y means of a ctitious man with t w o or more b o oster v accinations who had his last v accination at the age of 55 In gure 9.1 predictions are compared for mo dels for the indep enden t rst measuremen ts and for marginal and mixed mo dels for longitudinal data. The predicted titers are illustrated b y means of a ctitious man with t w o or more b o oster v accinations who had his last v accination at the age of 55. All mo dels w ere t b y using the same predictors sex, n um b er of b o oster v accinations in categories 0, 1 or 2 , age at last b o oster v accination and time since last v accination.9.1 Mo del comparison 37 F or the rst observ ations measured b y metho d A, classical regression analysis w as p erformed on the original outcome v ariable titer . Because titer did not ful ll the required normalit y as- sumption, transformations titer1/3andlogtiter w ere used instead. The cubic ro ot transformed v ariable cop ed b est with the underlying mo del assumptions in linear regression but is hard to in- terpret. Therefore the more common logarithmic transformation w as also applied. The distribu- tion of the residuals in linear regression analysis of log(titer ) sho w ed some left-sk ewness, but other mo del assumptions w ere adequate. Predictions for titer1/3andlog(titer ) w ere bac k-transformed to the original scale of titer and follo wing estimates are compared for ) exp/parenleftBig v ariable titer seemed to t a gamma distribution quite w ell, a generalized linear mo del w as applied using the log -link-function. The di\u001berence b et w een p er- forming a regression analysis on a logarithmic transformed v ariable E(logyi) =x/prime i and link-function in a GLM log (E(yi)) =x/prime i is emphasized. The resulting estimates of the sp eci ed GLM E(titer ) are compared to the predictions of linear regression mo dels. The estimated titers obtained from regression analysis of titer1/3are higher than those obtained from analysis of log(titer ) . The predicted v alues of the GLM are higher than the predictions of regression mo dels on the transformed v ariables. The curv ature is similar to the curv ature of predicted v alues for the mo del onlog(titer ) . Only around 13% of v ariabilit y in the rst measured titers is explained b y the co v ariates sex, age, n um b er of b o oster v accinations and time since last v accination b y tting linear regression mo dels. F or accoun ting on this unobserv ed heterogeneit y , mo dels for longitudinal data are ap- plied including the few a v ailable rep eatedly measured titers. There are t w o t yp es of mo dels for longitudinal data: marginal or so-called p opulation-a v eraged mo dels and sub ject-sp eci c mo dels. In marginal mo dels the correlations b et w een rep eated measuremen ts are considered b y sp ecifying a co v ariance structure. As long as the mean is correctly sp eci ed v alid p oin t estimates for the regression parameters are obtained ev en if these co v ariance pattern is not correct. F or computing v alid standard errors robust estimation tec hniques are used. Marginal mo dels w ere applied to the transformed v ariables titer1/3andlog(titer ) supp osing a normal distribution. F or of a rst-order autoregressiv e and for log(titer ) the assumption of an unstructured co v ariance pattern seemed most satisfying. Predicted v alues obtained from these mo dels w ere bac k-transformed as explained ab o v e. A marginal mo del under the assumption of a gamma distribution for the v ariable titer and using the log -link-function w as estimated b y applying the metho d of generalized estimating equations . The predicted v alues for marginal mo dels ha v e almost the same range as estimates for mo dels on the rst measuremen ts, see gure 9.1. The curv es are a bit atter than in the rst panel.9.2 Prediction of titer 38 In v accination studies large b et w een-individual heterogeneit y is exp ected b ecause ing of h umans to v accinations.

Generalized linear mixed mo to non-Gaussian distributed resp onse v ariables b y including random e\u001bects in GLMs. A generalized linear mixed mo del w as applied to the un- transformed outcome titer , using log -link-function and assuming a gamma distribution. In the case of TBE data only a randomly v arying in tercept is included in the mixed mo dels b ecause estimation of a random slop e for these few rep eated measuremen ts w ould b e o v erstated. The bac k-transformed predictions of linear mixed mo dels for titer1/3andlog(titer ) are almost the same as for mo dels on the rst measuremen ts. The curv e of estimated titers of the generalized linear mixed mo del is m uc h lo w er than for predictions of GLM in the rst panel and predictions of GEE in the second panel. The generalized linear mixed mo del is no w used to forecast titers for di\u001beren t ctitious p ersons. 9.2 Prediction of titer male female age (in years) at last vaccination, number of boosters category: Figure 9.2: Prediction of titer In gure 9.2 forecasts titers for sev eral ctitious p ersons are displa y ed from 1 to 10 y ears after9.3 Review and outlo ok 39 their last v accination. Titers are predicted for men (left panel) and w omen (righ t panel) who had their last v accination at the age of 20 or 55 and had 0, 1 or 2 b o oster v accinations b efore. Estimated titers for w omen are lo w er than for men. Titer decreases with increasing age and the more b o oster v accinations the higher the estimated titer. F or instance the titer of a 56-y ear-old w oman who had her last v accination 1 y ear ago is estimated to b e as high as the titer of a 27-y ear-old w oman who had her last v accination 7 y ears ago. In all cases the predicted titers are serop ositiv e ( >25U/ml ). 9.3 Review and outlo ok The goal of this thesis w as to in v estigate the TBE an tib o dy decrease after completion of the basic imm unization proto col. Data w ere presen ted on whic h the further analyzes w ould b e based after kno wledge on TBE, v accination and metho ds for measuring an tib o dy concen tration had b een acquired. Because lots of data records w ere not complete and di\u001beren t test metho ds for as- sessing an tib o dy concen trations w ere used, only a small amoun t of data w as a v ailable for further statistical analyzes. On these data sev eral statistical mo dels w ere p erformed lik e linear regres- sion, GLM, linear mixed mo dels and generalized linear mixed mo dels. Titers w ere estimated for all these mo dels and sho w ed that w omen ha v e lo w er titer than men and the more b o oster v accinations the higher the an tib o dy concen trations. Titer is decreasing with increasing age and time since last v accination. In Austria it is curren tly recommended to do a b o oster v accination ev ery 5 y ears, but in all ap- plied mo dels estimated titers w ere serop ositiv e longer than v e y ears after the last v accination. T o pro v e this h yp othesis a planned clinical trial w ould b e necessary where at least 3 measure- men ts p er p erson w ould b e a v ailable.
