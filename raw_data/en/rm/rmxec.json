Core skills like cooking and cleaning allow you to be self-sufficient. Meanwhile, knowing how antibiotics work, why cat bites can be dangerous, and what chemicals to never ever mix together can actually end up saving your life. Reddit users had a very [informative discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/15jnm9z/what_is_some_basic_knowledge_that_a_scary_amount/) on r/NoStupidQuestions in a thread that went viral. They shared the pieces of 'basic' knowledge that everyone should know, but that a scary number of people may be oblivious about. Check out what they feel is vital to know in the 21st century as you keep scrolling. Bored Panda got in touch with [Glenn Geher, Ph.D.](https://hawksites.newpaltz.edu/glenngeher/), who was kind enough to shed some light on the evolutionary reasons why people might get embarrassed about not knowing something that others do. He also shared his thoughts on how to fill those knowledge gaps and whether it's easier to survive in the modern world than in the far past. Geher is a professor of psychology at the State University of New York at New Paltz and a [published author](https://hawksites.newpaltz.edu/glenngeher/publications/), and you'll find our full interview with him as you read on.

According to Dr. Geher, from the State University of New York at New Paltz, it's not as clear-cut as someone might think. \"In some ways, living is easier these days relative to our ancestral, nomadic past. For instance, searching for food nowadays often involves opening one's refrigerator as opposed to going out for a 6-hour hunt,\" he explained to Bored Panda. \"That said, many features of the modern world are sorely mismatched from ancestral conditions and for this reason, the modern 'conveniences' often come back to harm us. So we might be able to eat lots of cheap processed foods easily and cheaply, but this fact may come back to haunt us later in life in the form of a number of health problems such as Type-II diabetes.\" The vagina doesnt become loose after sex with multiple partners.

Understanding that humans evolved to live in small groups of familiar others under nomadic conditions can help us go a long way toward understanding the broader human experience,\" [Professor Geher](https://hawksites.newpaltz.edu/glenngeher/publications/) said. \"I often say that to succeed in the modern day, it is often best to try to simulate ancestral conditions as much as possible. So, for instance, if you live in a large city of hundreds of thousands of people, it would be wise to form some smaller social groups that better resemble the small nomadic groups that characterized human social organization for the lion's share of human evolutionary history.\" You can try to be as \"green\" as you want, companies are responsible for the highest amount of damage when it comes to the environment and you can do almost nothing against it.

The oils slowly release heat as they oxidize, and for example in a pile at the bottom of a garbage can, that heat can build enough to start smoldering and eventually ignite.

[View More Replies...](javascript: void(0);) [View more comments](javascript:void(0);) It's completely natural to have some knowledge gaps, even when it comes to 'basic' knowledge. Some people specialize in certain areas and can be completely ignorant in others. Meanwhile, other individuals might simply lack the education\u2014or the time, money, and opportunities to plug those gaps. Whatever the case, many people tend to create the illusion that they're very knowledgeable. However, if something happens where they're forced to admit to others and themselves that they may not be as smart as they thought they were, the person might get incredibly embarrassed. After all, it's not a great feeling to realize that you were ignorant about something that seemingly 'everyone' around you already knew. What's important to understand here is that you're not alone in this. Sooner or later, everyone's faced with facts they either didn't know or had misinterpreted.

You can't take random antibiotics you've stocked up on at home and assume they will work for an infection. Doctors make an educated guess on what antibiotic to give for an infection. This is based on the probability of the infection being caused by a specific bacteria; this knowledge comes from research on what organisms most frequently cause certain infections in certain individuals.

As we've covered on Bored Panda before, the [healthy way](https://www.boredpanda.com/people-share-embarrassing-things-they-just-learned/) to react is to show mild embarrassment because it makes you seem more down to earth. Meanwhile pretending you didn't make a mistake or getting angry about the whole situation is unhealthy and can turn your embarrassment about your (lack of) knowledge into deep-rooted shame. The best way to deal with serious knowledge gaps is to carve out even a little bit of time every day to learn more about the topic. If it's something that affects your career, schoolwork, or daily life, it only makes sense to make it a priority. However, it can be hard to do this if you're working full time, have a family to take care of, and have a bunch of other responsibilities. That England and the UK are not the same thing.
