'My favourite unit in biomed is definitely physiology: it covers so many different topics from neuroscience to clinical physiology, to pathophysiology - studying how and why we get disease. I think it's one of the best units to broaden your understanding of the body. Every unit is different, we do hands-on learning in practicals, and learn important skills like professional communication and presenting.' Hands-on learning 'One reason I chose QUT was the emphasis on flexible and practical, hands-on learning. QUT's biomedical science course offers weekly practicals for all units. So we could be in the laboratory for up to 10-12 hours a week, which is not commonly offered in other biomedical science degrees. Practical classes provide us with invaluable laboratory experience, preparing us with the skills we'll need in our field.' Learn from the best 'Most of my lecturers are leading researchers, so we are given the most up-to-date research, and insights into projects being undertaken across the Brisbane region. The highlight of my studies so far is the opportunity to undertake a work integrated learning unit. I worked alongside a team of leading researchers. This experience gave me valuable industry connections and a chance to develop my skills within an industry setting.'
