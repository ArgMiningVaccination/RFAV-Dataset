In many cases, such pain is chronic, lasting more than three months.If there is no evidence of injury, disease, orbone problems, such as a slipped disk,vitamin D may provide relief. New clinical research in a report from Pain Treatment Topics found that vitamin D might provide relief for up to 95% of patients undergoing therapeutic vitamin D supplementation. According to the report, patients with pain, especially chronic back pain, almost always have inadequate levels of vitamin D. \"When sufcient vitamin D supplementation was provided, their pain either vanished or wasreduced to a signicant extent.\" Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption and bone health. After taking vitamin D supplements for three months, symptoms were improved in 95% of the patients. All patients with the most severe vitamin D deciencies experienced back-pain relief. Expect that vitamin D therapy may take three to nine months to affect skeletal composition enough to reduce pain. Consistency with therapeutic dosing is key; a continued maintenance dose of vital vitamin D micronutrients is necessary to maintain good health.

B ARNABAS HEALTH AMBULATORY CARE CENTER 2GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic condition which arises from the failure of the lower sphincter of the esophagus to close fully after eating or drinking. GERD is a spectrum of disease usually producing symptoms of heartburn and acid regurgitation. Most patients have no visible tissue injury at the time of endoscopicexamination (nonerosive GERD), whereassome have esophagitis, peptic strictures, Barrett esophagus, evidence of extra- esophageal diseases such as chest pain,pulmonary symptoms, or ear, nose, and throat symptoms. GERD is a multifactorial process, one of the most common humandiseases, and of economic importance,contributing to the expenditure in the United States of US $ 4-5 billion per year for antacid medications. The prevalence of GERD differs depending on whether the analysis is based on symptoms (primarily heartburn) or signs(i.e., esophagitis) of disease. When based on symptoms, GERD is common in Western countries. For example, in a nationwidepopulation-based study by the GallupOrganization in the United States, 44% of the population reported having heartburn at least once a month. Conversely, the true prevalence of esophagitis is very difcult to dene because healthy persons rarely undergoendoscopic procedures. Studies suggest that 7% of persons in the United States have erosive esophagitis, whereas Europeanstudies identify prevalence rates rangingfrom 2% to 10% The pathophysiology of GERD is complex and results from an imbalance betweendefensive factors protecting the esophagus (antireflux barriers, such as lower esophageal sphincter, esophageal acidclearance, tissue resistance) and aggressive factors from the stomach contents (gastric acidity and volume and duodenalcontents). Clinical manifestations Classical reflux symptoms Heartburn is the classic symptom ofGERD, with patients generally reporting a burning feeling, rising from the stomach or lower chest and radiating toward the neck,throat, and occasionally the back. Usually itoccurs after large meals or the consumption of spicy foods, citrus products, fats,chocolates, and alcohol. Recumbence and bending over may exacerbate heartburn.Nighttime heartburn interferes with restfulsleeping and may impair next-day work performance. Heartburn can also be a manifestation of cardiac disease. Extraesophageal manifestations It has been suggested that GERD may bethe cause of a wide spectrum of conditions including noncardiac chest pain, asthma, posterior laryngitis, chronic cough,recurrent pneumonia, and even dentalerosion. Some of these patients have classical reflux symptoms, but many are \"silent refluxers,\" contributing to problems in making the diagnosis. Furthermore, it may be difcult to establish a causalrelationship even if GERD can bedocumented by testing (e.g., pH studies), because patients may simply have two common diseases without a cause-and-effectrelationship. Such as: Chest pain Asthma and other pulmonary diseases Ear, nose, and throat diseases Treatment The simplest and most denitive methodfor diagnosing GERD and assessing its relationship to symptoms is the trial of acid suppression. Unlike other tests that onlysuggest an association (e.g., esophagitis at endoscopy or positive symptom index on pH testing), the response to antirefluxtherapy ensures a cause-and-effect relationship between GERD and symptoms. Therefore, it has become therst test used in patients with classical oratypical reflux symptoms without \"alarm\" complaints. Endoscopy Upper endoscopy is the current standard for documenting the presence of esophageal damage, as well as presence of precancerous condition such as Barrett's esophagus and its ability to excluding other conditions.However, only 40% of patients with abnormal esophageal reflux by pH testing have endoscopic evidence of esophagitis.Some authors feel that early endoscopy and even use of pH manometry can differentiatepatients who will require long term use of medications vs those who may need medication on demand basis or do not need them at all. Lifestyle modifications Sensible changes in lifestyle can be madeincluding: head of the bed elevation avoidance of tight-tting clothes weight loss restriction of alcohol consumption elimination of smoking dietary therapy refraining from lying down after meals avoidance of evening snacks beforebedtime. Nonprescription therapy Although GERD is common in the UnitedStates, very few persons seek medical care for their complaints, instead choosing to change their lifestyles and self-medicate with over-the-counter (OTC) antacids and low doses ofH2RAs. Most heartburn sufferers are invisible because they self-medicate and do not seek professional help; only those at thetip of the iceberg, typically patients with severe symptoms or reflux complications, are seen by physicians. There are also several natural preparations such as licorice, aloe that can temporarily relieve symptoms which could be sufcient inpatients who do not have severe disease. Barrett's esophagus Esophagitis in the presence of (potentiallyprecancerous) Barrett's esophagus be easily healed with Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) therapy; however, regression of Barrett'sepithelium, except for small squamousislands, is rarely reported, even with high- dose PPI therapy. Recent studies have suggested that intermittent \"pulses\" of poorlycontrolled acid reflux enhance Barrett epithelial cell proliferation, possibly increasing the risk of dysplasia and cancer. Surgical treatment Antireflux surgery reduces GERD byincreasing basal Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) pressure, decreasing episodes of transient transient LES Reflux, andinhibiting complete LESR. This isSince 1964 and the Surgeon General's report establishing the dangers of smoking most people have made the healthy choice to quit smoking. Tobacco is the leadingcause of preventive and premature death,killing an estimated 443,000 Americans each year. Although at the present time there are more former smokers than current smokers, the trend with young people is very disturbing. Each day in the UnitedStates over 3,800 young people under 18 years of age smoke their rst cigarette and over 1,000 youth under age 18 becomedaily cigarette smokers. The vast majority of Americans that begin daily smoking during adolescence are addicted to nicotineby young adulthood. Nicotine dependence is the most common form of chemical dependence in theUnited States. Smoking cessation is difcult and may require multiple attempts. Users often relapse because ofstress, weight gain, and withdrawalsymptoms. Educating patients and engaging them regarding the dangers of smoking is aprimary concern no matter what their age or background. Although patients may have attempted to stop and wereunsuccessful it is important to continue toeducate and engage patients rather than make them feel as if it is a personal failure. Effective treatment options may include: formal counseling services either in the private medical ofce, group or online cessation program. behavior therapies where patients areenrolled in a training program, with a1:1 personal contact. cessation medications which includenicotine replacement products or non-nicotine agents for example (Bupropionand Varenicline). If you are a smoker, talk to your physician. Your doctor can help you quit and stay away from cigarettes. Even if you havetried quitting in the past, cutting down theamount you smoke is a partial victory. I am often asked about the cigarette alternatives that some patients have used tosuccessfully quit smoking : electronic cigarettes along with smokeless tobacco and water pipes to help smokers reducetheir nicotine consumption. Although there is a great deal of interest about the potential of E- cigarettes as a smokingcessation aid there is not enough data yet regarding the actual effects on lung function. Clearly other forms of smokeless tobacco products: water pipes or (hookahs), cigars should denitely be avoided as they can be continued on back cover MEN'SWELLNESS . W INTER 2014 . B ARNABAS HEALTH AMBULATORY CARE CENTER3MAKE ITYOURNEWYEAR'SRESOLUTION TO QUITSMOKING accomplished by reducing the hiatal herniaback into the abdomen and thereby restoring an adequate length of intraabdominal sphincter, reconstructingthe diaphragmatic hiatus, and reinforcingthe LES. Since the advent of minimally invasive surgery, the two most popular operations are the Nissen fundoplicationand the Toupet partial fundoplication. In the majority of cases, surgery is not advised. New treatments The future medical treatment of GERD involves drugs that interfere with transient LESRs but which do not causedysphagia. Baclofen, a GABA-B agonist,has been shown to decrease refluxsymptoms and to improve pH studies in healthy persons and in patients with GERD. Newer endoscopic treatments of GERDhave been approved by the FDA. Thesetechniques include an endoscopicsuturing system, radiofrequency energy delivery to the gastroesophageal junction, and the injection ofnonabsorbable polymers into thesubmucosa surrounding the LES. These procedures decrease the frequency of transient LESRs, but LES pressure isunchanged and less than 40% ofpatients have normal pH tests. To date, these techniques have been applied only to patients with small (< 2 cm) or no hernias and mild esophagitis. The results are encouraging, with improvement of symptoms anddecreased medication requirements, butthe cost-effectiveness and durability of the procedures is suspect (usually > 50% failure by 1-2 years) and reportedcomplications include perforation,hemorrhage, pain, and death. Controlled studies using theradiofrequency energy delivery andinjectable polymer techniques showconsistent symptom improvement , inconsistent reduction in the use of PPIs, and no signicant improvement in LESpressure or pH proles.

The currently recommended dailyallowance of vitamin D - 200 to 600IU per day - is too low. According to the new research, most children and adults need at least 1000 IU per day. People with chronic back pain would benet from 5000 IU or more per day of supplemental vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 supplements have a highly favorable safety prole. They interactwith very few drugs or other agents,and are usually not harmful unless extremely high doses - such as 50,000 IU or more - are taken daily for anextended period of time. Vitamin D3 supplements are easy forpatients to self-administer, are welltolerated, and cost as little as 7 centsper day for 1000 IU and 20 cents per day for 5,000 IU. While vitamin D3 therapy does not provide instant symptomatic relief, its effect is to slowly strengthen themusculoskeletal structure, thus reducingthe underlying source of pain, while providing numerous other benets.The Barnabas Health Ambulatory Surgery Center and GI Endoscopy Suite provide outreach and education about the importance of colonoscopy andother GI disorders.

In fact, water pipe smoking which is very popular among young people is potentially more dangerous than cigarette smoking. The problem is that it is easy to tolerate the smoking experience which leads to deeper and longer smoke inhalation delivering more noxious particles to the lower parts of the lung. Despite the difculty in stopping smoking, it remains one of the most important changes you can make in avoiding major health problems for your entire life.
