The Lab's main imaging modality is optical coherence tomography (OCT), which can provide 3D label-free imaging of tissue structure and function in vivo. OCT can be thought of as the optical analogue of ultrasound, but with the advantage that 'optical echo' measurements support much higher resolution. [Antaki Lab](http://antakilab.bme.cornell.edu/) The Antaki Lab focuses on the development of blood-wetted medical devices. Equally important as the devices themselves, the lab's research focuses on the methodology by which they are designed, and used clinically. The Lab's current research emphasis involves five application areas: circulatory support systems for children, decision-support tools for severe heart failure, diagnostic technology for the home and point-of-care to improve patient engagement, multi-scale modeling of thrombosis in artificial circulation, and development of medical devices for global health. A nascent, overarching project aims to accelerate medical innovation by professional networking between physicians, medical product designers, and patients. Although these interests are diverse, they share a common theme of improving healthcare though biomedical engineering.

[Doerschuk Lab](http://doerschuklab.bme.cornell.edu/) The Doerschuk Research Group develops, validates, and uses mathematical models of primarily biological and medical systems, mostly with the goal of understanding experimental data. The range of problems has been broad, e.g., ethanol pharmacokinetics in human subjects based on breath-analyzer data to the 4-D spatial-temporal dynamics of virus particles based on single-particle cryo electron microscopy images. Most of the work is in collaboration with a domain expert whose research group performs the experiments. Most of the work is of a statistical character. The most successful work often involves systems where something is understood about the physical - chemical basis of the system and/or the measurement process. Some of the problems are \"big data\" problems, e.g., 100,000 images in single-particle cryo electron microscopy. The group's two goals are to develop new interesting ideas in modeling and inference and to solve our collaborators' problems! [Fischbach Lab](http://www.fischbachlab.org/) The Fischbach Lab applies multidisciplinary strategies to gain a better qualitative and quantitative understanding of the microenvironmental conditions fundamental to the pathogenesis and therapy of cancer. The Lab's research areas include: Tumor-stroma interactions in cancer pathogenesis, Tumor metastasis in engineered bone microenvironments, 3-D in vitro models of vascularized tumors and tumor angiogenesis, and Engineered Microenvironments to Study Brain Cancer Tumorigenesis.
