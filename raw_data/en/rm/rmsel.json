Later, as dancing ensues, excited guests and the Newlyweds can participate in crafting the couple's Kintsugi Bowl. Using the gold pens and journal included in the Kit, guests can write little love letters to the Newlyweds. By the end of the night, the couple will receive an elegant-gold-bowl-Kintsugi Keepsake filled with their guest's best wishes. Truly a keepsake to cherish forever...
