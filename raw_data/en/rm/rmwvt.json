CMS is issuing this List of Measures Under Consideration (MUC) to comply with the statutory requirement,1 which require s the Secretary o f the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make publicly available a list of certain quality and efficiency measures that the Secretary is considering for adoption through rulemaking under Medicare. Among the measures, the list includes measure s CMS is considering that were originally suggested by the public. When organizations, such as physician specialty societies, request that CMS consider measures, CMS evaluates the suggested measures to determine whether CMS would consider them for use in o ne or more Medicare programs. If CMS determines that it would consider the measures and the pre - rulemaking process applies to those measures, CMS adds them to the MUC List as part of the pre - rulemaking process so the Measure Applications Partnership (MAP) can provide input . Inclusion of a measure on this list does not require CMS to propose to adopt or finalize the adoption of the measure for the identified program. Therefore, this list may include a larger number of measures than the number of measures CMS will decide to propose for adoption through rulemaking. 1 See section 1890A(a)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395aaa -1(a)(2)). List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 4 of 156 CMS will continue its goal of aligning measures across programs. Measure alignment includes looking first to existing program measures for use in new programs , as well as looking across programs to see if the measure is used in other CMS programs . Further, CMS programs must balance competing goals of establishing parsimonious measure sets, while including sufficient measures to facilitate multi -specialty provider and supplier participation. Statutory Requirement HHS is statutorily required2 to establish a pre -rulemaking process for the selection of certain quality and efficiency measures3 for use by HHS. One of the steps in the pre -rulemaking process requires that HHS make publicly available, not later than December 1 annually, a list of qu ality and efficiency measures HHS is considering adopting, through the rulemaking process, for use in certain Medicare quality programs. The pre -rulemaking process includes the following additional steps: 1. Providing the opportunity for multi -stakeholder gr oups to provide input to HHS not later than February 1 annually on the selection of quality and effic iency measures; 2. Requiring the Secretary to consider the multi -stakeholder groups' input in selecting quality and efficiency measures; 2 See section 1890A(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395aaa -1(a)). 3 As listed in section 1890(b)(7)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395aaa(b)(7)(B)).

Publishing in the Fed eral Register the rationale for the use of any quality and efficiency measures that are not endorsed by the entity with a contract under Section 1890 of the Act, which is currently the National Quality Forum (NQF)4; and 4. Assessing the quality and efficienc y impact of the use of endorsed measures and making that assessment available to the public at least every three years. (The 2012, 2015, 2018 , and 2021 editions of that report and related documents are available at the website of the CMS National Impact A ssessment .) Fulfilling HHS's Requirement to Make Its Measures Under Consideration Publicly Available The attached MUC List, which is compiled by CMS, will be posted on the NQF website and the CMS Pre -Rulemaking site . This posting will satisfy an important requirement of the pre -rulemaking process by making public the quality and efficiency measures that the Secretary is considering for use under certain Medicare quality programs. Included Measures This MUC List identifies the quality and efficiency measures under consideration by CMS for use in certain Medicare quality programs. Measures that appear on this list that are not selected for use under the Medicare program for the current rulemaking cycl e will remain under consideration for future rulemaking cycles. They remain under consideration only for purposes of the particular 4 The rationale for adopting measures not endorsed by the consensus -based entity will be published in rulemaking where such measures are proposed and finalized.

Measures List Highlights By publishing this list, CMS will make publicly available and seek the multi -stakeholder groups' input on 29 measures under consideration for use in Medicare programs. These 29 unique measures may b e considered for more than one CMS program resulting in 44 total individual measures (See Table 1) . Of these 29 unique measures, four (4) measures are currently fully 5 A single measure may be under consideration for more than one program. List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 10 of 156 implemented in CMS programs and are on the MUC List due to substantive changes made to the specifications. The 29 measures proposed in the 2021 MUC List include 10 process measures, 9 outcome measures, 4 patient reported outcome measures, 2 structure measures, 1 intermediate outcome measure, 1 cost/resource use measure, 1 efficiency measure, and 1 patient engagement/experience measure. CMS notes several important points to consider and highlight: CMS will continue to balance the alignment of measures across programs whenever possible with the goals of moving payment toward value and reducing regulatory burden for clinicians and providers through focusing everyone's efforts on the same quality areas with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for patients . Measures contained on this list fulfill a quality and efficiency measurement need and w ere assessed for alignment across CMS programs when applicable. CMS Goals and Priorities CMS launched the comprehensive Meaningful Measures Framework in 2017, which identifies high priority areas for quality measurement and improvement. The purpose of this initiative was to improve outcomes for patients, their families, and measured entities while balancing the reduction of burden by moving payment tow ard value through focusing everyone's efforts on the same quality areas. The Meaningful Measures Framework also helped to identify and close important gap areas of measures, align measures across the continuum of care and across payors, and spur innovation in new types of measures such as patient -reported measures and digital measures. As CMS moves forward and evolves Meaningful Measures, the Agency builds on the strengths of the initiative while working to create broader, agency -wide actions to modernize and expand quality List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 11 of 156 work. CMS uses five interrelated goals to ensure the use of impactful quality measures to improve health outcomes and to support the delivery of value: using the Meaningful Measures Framework to streamline and align quality measurement leveraging measures to drive outcom e improvement through public reporting and payment programs improving quality measures efficiency by a transition to digital measures and use of advanced data analytics empowering consumers to make the best healthcare choices through person -centered qua lity measures and public transparency leveraging quality measures to promote equity and close gaps in care By working on these goals across the various components, CMS can work to : Align measures across CMS, federal programs, and private payers to reduce t he number of unique measures, thereby improving measure efficiency for CMS and measured entities associated with those measures. Accelerate ongoing efforts to streamline and modernize programs, reducing burden, and promoting strategically important focus a reas. Use data and information as essential aspects of a healthy, robust healthcare infrastructure to allow for payment and management of accountable, value -based care and development of learning health organizations. List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 12 of 156 Empower patients through transparency of data and public reporting, so patients can make the best -informed decisions about their healthcare. Commit to a person -centered approach in quality measure and value -based incentives programs to ensure that quality and safety measures address patient g oals of care and identify and close gaps in healthcare equity. Through these goals and objectives , CMS will use impactful quality measures to improve health outcomes and deliver value by empowering patients to make informed care decisions while reducing burden to measured entities, which starts with how the measures in CMS programs are developed, implemented, and evaluated. The measures reviewed for inclusion on the 2021 MUC List take all these goals and priorities into consideration.

From 2001 -2013, concurrent presc ribing (overlap of at least one day) increased by nearly 80% (from 9% to 17%) among privately insured patients.(3) In one study, approximately half of the patients receiving opioids and benzodiazepines concomitantly received both prescriptions from the sam e prescriber on the same day.(4) In a 2015 analysis of Medicare Part D non -cancer and/or non -hospice patients on opioid therapy, the prevalence of benzodiazepine concurrent use was 24%.(5) A study on opioid and benzodiazepine prescribing in 9 states using the 2015 Prescription Behavioral Surveillance System, which includes de -identified prescription drug management (PDMP) data, found that 21.6% of patients prescribed an opioid were also prescribed a benzodiazepine, of which 54.9% had concurrent prescription s.(6) Several studies indicate that concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines puts List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 93 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 053 (cont 'd) (cont 'd) patients at greater risk for a fatal overdose. Three studies of opioid overdose deaths conducted in 2011, 2015, and 2016 found evidence of concurrent benzodiazepine use in 31% -61% of cases. (7 -9) In the United States, the number of opioid overdose deaths i nvolving benzodiazepines increased 14% on average for each year from 2006 through 2011. However, the number of opioid overdose deaths not involving benzodiazepines did not change significantly. (10) A 2015 case -cohort study found that concurrent use of ben zodiazepines among US veterans raised the risk of drug overdose deaths four -fold (hazard ratio, 3.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.49 -4.26) compared with patients not using benzodiazepines.(11) In a large sample of privately insured patients from 2001 -2013, opioid users who also used benzodiazepines were at substantially higher risk of an emergency department (ED) visit or hospital admission for opioid overdose (adjusted odds ratio 2.14; 95% CI, 2.05 -2.24). If this association is causal, elimination of th e concurrent use could reduce the population risk of an ED visit or hospitalization for opioid overdose by 15%.

PMID: 25228059. Saitz R, Ganoczy D, et al. Benzodiazepine prescribing patterns and deaths from drug overdose among US Anticholinergic Medications in Older Adults (Poly -ACH) CMS Program(s): Part C & D Rating [Medicare] A systematic review of the literature, evaluating 27 studies from 1966 to 2008, determined that a high burden of anticholinergic use consistently shows a negative association with cognitive performance in older adults. ( 1) Several more recent studies have shown an association between concurrent use of anticholinergic medications and an increased risk of dementia and cognitive impairment. In 2015, Gray et al conducted a cohort study of 3434 individuals over age 65 who were followed up with every two years to examine the relationship between anticholinergics and cognitive decline.(2) Hazard ratios for dementia associated with cumulative anticholinergic use were 0.92 (95% CI, 0.74 -1.16) for total standardized daily doses (TSDDs) of 1 to 90; 1.19 (95% CI, 0.94 -1.51) for TSDDs of 91 to 365; 1.23 (95% CI, 0.94 -1.62) for TSDDs of 366 1095; and 1.54 (95% CI, 1.21 -1.96) for TSDDs greater than 1095; findings were similar for Alzheimer's, suggesting a strong relationship between cumulative anticholinergic use and cog nitive decline. In 2013, Cai et al conducted a retrospective cohort study of 3,690 individuals over age 65 to examine the association between cognitive impairment and anticholinergic exposure within the prior year.(3) In comparison to older adults with no anticholinergic exposure and after adjusting for age, race, gender, and underlying comorbidity, the odds ratio (OR) for having a diagnosis of mild chronic impairment was 2.73 (95% CI; 1.27 -5.87) among lder adults who were exposed to at least three possible anticholinergic for at least 90 days. Clinical research from Risacher et al published by JAMA in 2016 found that among older adults, use of anticholinergics was associated with increased brain atrophy and dysfunction and cognitive decline based on perform ance on several cognitive scores at initiation of anticholinergic use and follow -up (mean follow -up 32 months).(4) In 2017, Campbell et al conducted an observational cohort study of 350 adults 65 and older to examine the effects of anticholinergic use on t ransition to mild cognitive impairment.(5) Compared with stable cognition, increasing use of strong anticholinergics calculated by total standard daily dose increased the odds of transition from normal cognition to MCI (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.01 -1.31). In addit ion to cognitive decline, anticholinergic use in older adults is also associated with increased hospitalizations, with a study by Kalisch et. al., finding that older persons taking two or more anticholinergic medications had a significantly greater risk of hospitalization for confusion or dementia (adjusted incident rate ratio [IRR] 2.58; 95% CI 1.91 -3.48); risk was further increased taking three or more anticholine rgics (IRR 3.87; 95% CI 1.83 -8.21).(6) Evidence also suggests anticholinergics may increase risk for falls, with a 2016 case control study (n case [falls] = 263; n control [no falls] List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 95 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 056 (cont 'd) Older Adults (Poly -ACH) =165) finding a significant association between anticholinergic burden and fall risk (OR, 1.8; 95% CI; 1.1 -3.0).(7) References 1.Campbell N, Boustani M, Limbil T, et al.

Specifically, the newly developed pre - and post - surgical patient -reported outcome measures (PROMs) assess the patient's main goals and expectations (i.e., pain, physic al function and quality of life) before surgery (i.e., THA or TKA) and the degree to which the expectations were met or exceeded after surgery. Consistent with this notion, the measure enables clinician -groups to identify patient's goals and expectations f or their surgery, incorporate the information into their conversation with patients which allows shared -decision making and management of unrealistic expectations; all of which have the potential to enhance patient satisfaction, improve clinical outcomes ( both as reported by patients and by more traditional measures), increase health service efficiency, and improve health -related business metrics. Patient -centered care is part of a shift in focus which has drawn increasing interest in recent years, highligh ting the importance of incorporating patients' perspectives, expectations and goals into care delivery (IOM 2001; Berwick DM 2002). Consistently, patient expectations have been proven to impact patient outcomes (Dyche 2005). Literature suggests that provid ers' responsiveness to patient expectations is one of the main determinants of patient experience and satisfaction (Needleman et al., 2002; Schoenfelder et al., 2011; McKinley et al., 2002). Unfulfilled patient expectations are associated with poor satisfa ction (McKinley et al., 2002) and poor overall health outcomes (Barry et al. 2000). Consequently, a growing body of evidence supports the importance of identifying and addressing patients' expectations (McKinley et al., 2002; Dyche 2005; Main et al. 2010; Snell et al. 2010). Nonetheless, previous studies have emphasized that clinicians frequently neglect to solicit information about patients' expectations, tending to underestimate or not recognize them, resulting in unmet expectations and lower satisfaction (Rozenblum et al. 2011; Topaz et al. 2016; Rozenblum et al. 2015). As such, clinician -groups must begin to develop and implement practical and effective measurements (e.g., PROMs and PRO -PMs) and interventions that create a culture where clinician groups actively assess and respond to patient expectations. The PRO -PM addresses a gap in orthopedic measure development, as currently there are no PRO -PMs related to care goal achievement. This gap impacts both patient outcomes, health service efficiency and hea lthcare cost. The demand for THA and TKA procedures are expected to continue to rise substantially in the coming decades (Singh et al. 2019). With this increased demand for total joint arthroplasty (TJA) and a consistent need for outcome improvement, it is important to maintain care goal achievement. National goals emphasize the importance of engaging patients in the care process and measuring their goals, experience and perspectives. More specifically, there is increased emphasis on List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 97 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 063 (cont 'd) (cont 'd) evaluating patient reported outcomes especially in the area of joint replacement. Consistent with this notion, both the American Joint Replacement Registry and the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, established guide lines related to the use of PROMs in TJA (AJRR 2018; AAHKS 2016). PROMs have become increasingly emphasized in the transition from volume -based to value -based orthopedic care (Makhni et al, 2019). Studies showed the importance of measuring PROMs following THA and TKA (SooHoo et al. 2009; Makhni 2019). For example, a study conducted by SooHoo and colleagues identified that 81 percent of patients achieved a minimally clinically important difference of three PROMs three months following THA and TKA (SooHoo et al. 2009; Makhni et al 2019). Consistent with this notion, PROMs and PRO -PMs are currently one of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service's (CMS) priorities (CMS 2021). Therefore, we have developed two PROMs and a PRO -PM related to care goal achieveme nt following a THA or TKA, which assess and manage patient goals and expectations. The importance of the measure was assessed with stakeholders in qualitative assessment (i.e., interviews and focus groups) throughout the measure development process. Patien ts and providers saw great value in the new PRO -PM. They indicated that completing PROMs before and after surgery to measure patient's expectations and perceived outcomes were a good approach for assessing goal achievement and that the measure is important in improving quality of care. The stakeholders also thought that the measure would improve communication among patients and providers and consequently, enhance patient satisfaction and health outcomes. Payers' interviews also supported these findings and added that this PRO -PM will enable new national benchmark related to care goal achievement and possibly incentivize efforts to implement the necessary improvements to practice quality.

MUC2021 066 Polypharmacy: Use of Multiple Central Nervous System (CNS) - Active Medications in Older Adults (Poly -CNS) CMS Program(s): Part C & D Rating [Medicare] A recent analysis published in JAMA in 2017 showed that CNS polypharmacy in older adults has been trending upward.(1) The frequency of three or more C NS-active medications being initiated or continued in older adults during a physician office visit more than doubled from 2004 to 2013. In particular, nearly half (46%) of CNS polypharmacy visits for older adults in 2013 were for individuals without pain, insomnia, or other mental health diagnoses. This is consistent with other findings suggesting frequent CNS use in older adults: among a sample of 18,752 nursing home residents across two states in 2013, 66.8% received at least one CNS -active drug.(2) Multi ple studies of older adults have reported that the use of CNS -active medications is linked to an increased risk of fractures, falls, and recurrent falls.(3 -7) Specifically, a cohort study published in 1998 found that older adults taking one or more CNS -active medications were at a 1.5 -fold increased risk (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.07 -2.22) and those taking two or more CNS -active medications were at a 2.5 -fold increased risk (OR 2.37; 95% CI 1.14 -4.94) of falling compared to a reference group of no CNS -active medica tions, suggesting that a dose -response relationship exists between CNS -active medications and falls.(3) A nested case -control study of adults 65 and over using data from 1994 to 2005 (including 17,198 cases and 85,990 controls) found that the risk ratio fo r concomitant use of benzodiazepines and interacting drugs, and hip fracture, ranged from 1.5 (95% CI 1.3, 1.7) to 2.1 (95% CI 1.5, 2.8).(4) A 2009 longitudinal cohort study following 3,055 older adults annually for five years found that as many as 24.1% o f CNS-users took multiple agents annually.(5) Those taking multiple CNS medications had an increased risk of recurrent falls (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.35 -2.81) compared to non -users, and patients taking higher doses of CNS -active medications had a threefold incre ased 95% CI 1.96 -4.25) of falls.(6) Additionally, a nested case -control study of 5,556 nursing home residents using 2010 data found that patients taking 3 or more CNS -active standardized daily doses were more likely to have a serio us fall than those who did not take any CNS medications (adjusted OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.35 -2.48).(7) References: 1 Maust DT, Gerlach LB, Gibson A, et al.

PMID: Hospital IQR Program; (EH-CAH) Opioids are often the foundation for sedation and pain relief. However, use of opioids can also lead to serious adverse events, including constipation, oversedation, delirium, and respiratory depression. Opioid -related adverse events have both patient -level and financial implications. Patients who experience this event have been noted to have 55% longer lengths of stay, 47% higher costs, 36% higher risk of 30 -day readmission, and 3.4 times higher payments than patients without these adverse events (Kessler et al., 2013). Most opioid -related adverse events are preventable. Of the adverse drug events reported to the Joint Commission\u00b4s Sentinel Event database, 47% were due to a wrong medication dose, 29% to improper monitoring, and 11% to other causes (e. g., m edication interactions, drug reactions) (Joint Commission, 2012; Overdyk, 2009). Additionally, in a closed -claims analysis, 97% of adverse events were judged preventable with better monitoring and response (Lee et al., 2015). Naloxone administration is often used as an indicator of a severe opioid -related adverse event, and implementation of this measure can advance safe use of opioids in hospitals and prevent these serious and potentially lethal adverse drug events. Naloxone is an opioid reversal agent typ ically used for severe opioid -related adverse events. Naloxone administration has been used in a number of studies as an indicator of opioid -related adverse events (Nwulu et al., 2013; Eckstrand et al., 2009). From Part 10 of the 2015 American Heart Associ ation Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care (Lavonas et al., 2015), the following recommendation is listed for use of Naloxone: Naloxone is a potent opioid receptor antagonist in the brain, spinal cord, and g astrointestinal system.

CKD is diagnosed by the chronic presence of elevated albumin exc retion, measured by the urinary albumin or low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The following evidence statements are quoted from the referenced clinical guidelines: 1) At least once a year, assess urinary albumin (e.g. , spot urinary albumin -to-creatinine ratio) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with type 1 diabetes with duration of =5 years and in all patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of treatment. (Evidence Grade = B) (American Diabetes Association, 2020) 2) Patients with diabetes should be screened annually for chronic kidney disease. Initial screening should commence: 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes; (Evidence Grade = A) or From diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. (Evidence Gr ade = B) Screening should include: Measurements of urinary albumin -creatinine ratio (ACR) in a spot urine sample; (Evidence Grade = B) Measurement of serum creatinine and estimation of GFR.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) envisions that use of this measure will improve concordance with recommendations for the use of HER2 -targeted therapy with chemotherapy for patients with stage I (T1c) - III, HER2 positive breast cancer. We recognize the importance of ensuring that the appropriate patient population receives guideline concordant treatment as studies have shown that the admin istration of HER2 -targeted therapies significantly improves overall survival in patients with high -risk HER2 positive breast cancer.

MUC2021 - 098 National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Healthcare - associated Clostridioides difficile Infection Outcome Measure C. difficile caused 159,463 infections among hospitalized US patients in 2019. (1) Robust surveillance combined with incentives from value -based purchasing resulted in a reduction of 42% between 2015 and 2019 in acute -care hospitals. (1) Further improvements are possible, but aspects of the existing surveillance definition complicate the external reception of the measure and create unintended consequences regarding testing and treatment practices. (2, 3) These issues also challenge the ability to track trends in true infections as organizations alter their practices. Validation studies performed from 2013 -2106 by 6 different states, suggest that the negative predictive value of the metric is low at ~59% indicating that, in addition to potential manipulation of testing practices, many cases are being missed in the reporting process. (4) To address these concerns, CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) proposes a new measure that promotes further improvements in care for patients and reduces unintended consequences. Creating an improved surveil lance definition that more closely approximates the disease -state List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 105 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - requires incorporating use of therapy as a proxy for clinical decision -making into the measure. To that end, this new NHSN measure includes not only the lab test for C. difficile but also the use of a specific antimicrobial agent or other therapy as part o f the definition. In this approach, use of therapy acts as a proxy for a clinically significant infection - and is especially possible because of the specific therapies used for infections due to C. difficile.

List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 106 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 100 (cont dialysis facilities CMS Program(s): ESRD QIP Several studies and commentaries strongly suggest pre - and post -discharge interventions within the purview of dialysis providers may reduce the risk of unplanned readmissions within the end -stage renal disease (ESRD) chronic dialysis population (Assimon, Wang, and al Jaar 2017). Plantinga et al (2018) found that interventions in the immediate post -discharge period were associated with reduced readmission risk among hemodialysis patients. They also suggest that post -discharge processes of care may help identify certain patients at higher risk for readmission, creating opportunities for dialysis providers to initiate interventions to reduce readmissions. A number of 'patient - at-discharge' characteristics were found by Flythe et al (2017) to be associated with greater readmission risk. These included 10 or more outpatient medications at time of admission; catheter vascular access; three or more hospital admissions in the prior year; and intradialytic hypotension. The authors suggest that modifiable processes of care such as care transitions and targeted medication education may reduce the risk of readmissions among dialysis patients recently discharged. Chan and colleagues (2009) found that certain post -discharge assessments and changes in treatment at the dialysis facil ity may be associated with a reduced risk of readmission. Assessments included hemoglobin testing and modification of erythropoietin (EPO) dose; mineral and bone disease testing and modification of vitamin D; and, importantly, modification of dry weight af ter discharge. The risk of unplanned hospital readmission was reduced when these assessments were completed within the first seven days post - hospital discharge. In a commentary (Wish 2014) the Chan 2009 study and several others are cited as examples of the potential for care coordination to reduce readmissions among ESRD dialysis patients. The findings from Chan 2009 are further supported by results from a recent study (Lin et. al. CJASN, 2019) comparing principal diagnosis of index hospitalizations and the ir associated readmissions. Tables included in the paper's supplementary materials clearly demonstrate that a significant portion of readmission principal discharge diagnoses are for dialysis -related conditions. For example, regardless of the index hospita lization cause (i.e. infectious, endocrine, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, renal, etc), the top principal discharge diagnosis lists for related readmissions prominently included diagnoses typically associated with fluid overload and failur e of fluid management in dialysis patients (fluid overload, hypertension, congestive heart failure, etc). These results support the early findings from Chan 2009, nearly a decade earlier, showing that adjustment of patient target weight in the early List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 107 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 101* (cont 'd) (cont 'd) post -hospitalization discharge period (to adjust for the frequent weight loss and/or in -hospital re -assignment of a lower post -dialysis target weight) is a likely mechanism for a substantial minority of unplanned readmissions in th e US chronic dialysis population. Facility structures of care may also impact risk of readmission. One study reported that lower nurses -to-total staff and higher patient -to-nurse ratios were associated with significantly worse 30 -day readmission performan ce (Chen et al 2019). Finally, findings from the first two performance years of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation's Comprehensive ESRD Care Initiative suggest care coordination may reduce readmission risk (Marrufo et al, 2019). The findings o f this controlled study showed an overall decrease in the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries with at least one readmission, among those aligned to an ESRD Seamless Care Organization, relative to a matched comparison group of facilities. Studies in the no n-dialysis setting have cited post -interventions or a combination of pre -and post -discharge interventions as drivers for Parry 2009). However, a recent study and related commentary challenge the reported magnitude of reductions in hospital -wide readmissions since 2010, as part of the publicly reported Hospital Wide Readmission (HWR) measure for the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) (Wadhera, Yeh, and Joynt -Maddox 2019; Ody et al 2019). They suggest the potential driver of these reductions is in part attributed to a cha nge in diagnosis coding policy for inpatient claims that took effect in October 2012. While it is not yet settled whether the reductions were primarily or only nominally driven by the ability of hospitals to report more condition diagnoses, resulting in mo re robust comorbidity risk adjustment in the measure, the concern has generated attention about whether reported improvements in readmission rates is a result of the HWR and by extension better care delivery by hospitals. These concerns are not considered germane to drivers of readmission reduction based on the dialysis facility readmission measure. The SRR was implemented by CMS in 2015, after the 2012 coding changes took effect. Therefore, trends in dialysis patient 30 -day readmissions only reflect the pe riod since the claims -based diagnoses coding changes and observed reductions since that time are not considered an artifact of the 2012 inpatient diagnosis coding changes. Collectively this body of evidence provides support on interventions that may reduce the risk of unplanned readmissions among ESRD dialysis patients. Effective interventions include enhanced care coordination and interventions performed prior to and immediately following the post -discharge period. MUC2021 - 104 Severe Obstetric Complications eCQM Although the United States (US) is one of the most developed countries, there continues to be a staggering increase in the number of pregnant women who suffer from complications associated with Severe Maternal Morbidity (SMM). It has bee n found that rates of SMM are steadily increasing in the US [1]. Fourteen in every 1,000 perinatal List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 108 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 104 (cont 'd) Program(s): exper ienced hemorrhage, embolism, hypertension, stroke, and other serious complications. Racial and ethnic disparities for women who identify as minority are significant; they are at considerably higher risk for developing these complications than are Non -Hispa nic White women [2,3]. Additionally, recent maternal mortality data from 2018 reveal that 658 women died from maternal causes, resulting in a rate of 17.4 deaths per 100,000 live births, with 77% of the deaths attributed to direct obstetric causes like hem orrhage, preeclampsia, obstetric embolism, and other complications [4]. Per report from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the overall rate of SMM increased almost 200%, from 49.5 per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations in 1993 to 144.0 per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations in 2014 [1]. This increase has been mostly driven by blood transfusions, which increased by almost 400% in that period. Excluding blood transfusions, there has been a 22.4% increase in SMM, from 28.6 in 1993 to 35.0 in 2014 [5]. Increasing rates of SMM are resulting in increased healthcare costs, longer hospitalization stays and short - and long -term negative outcomes on a woman's health [6 -9]. National evaluation of hospitals' performance on maternal morbidity and mortality is limited because there are currently no maternal morbidity or obstetric complications outcome measures in national reporting programs. Current quality measures related to pregnancy and maternal health proposed for or in public reporting programs are lar gely process measures (e.g., Maternity Care: Post -partum Follow Up and Care Coordination) and outcome measures related to delivery type (e.g., PC -01 Elective Delivery). The high maternal mortality and morbidity rates in the United States present unique opp ortunities for large -scale quality measurement and improvement activities. Statistics on preventability vary but suggest that a considerable proportion of maternal morbidity and mortality events could be prevented [10,11]. This measure will therefore assis t in the discovery and understanding of SMM outcomes and disparities in maternal outcomes, which can lead to improvements in the safety and quality of maternal care necessary to reduce SMM and mortality rates. 1.

MUC2021 - 105 Mismatch Repair (MMR) or Microsatellite (MSI) Biomarker Testing Status in Colorectal Carcinoma, Endometrial, Gastroesophageal, or Small Bowel Carcinoma CMS Program(s): MIPS This measure has been created to work in conjunction with the new \"MMR and MSI Testing in Pat ients Being Considered for Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy\" Guideline. Rather than waiting for the Guideline to be published then creating a measure based on recommendations, which would result in a lag of several years between the Guideline and the measure, we have developed the measure to become available at the same time as the Guideline. Due to an unforeseen delay, the Guideline was not published at the original target date of April but will be published later in the summer. We feel that the timing of the measure and the Guideline is ideal for this measure to drive quality improvement and uptake of the Guideline. MUC2021 - 106 Hospital Commitment to Health Equity CMS Program(s): Hospital IQR Program Significant and persistent inequities in health care outcomes exist in the United States. Belonging to a racial or ethnic minority group, living with a disability, being a member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) community, living in a rural area, or being near or below the poverty level, is often associated with worse health outcomes (Joynt, 2011; Lindenauer, Minority Health, 2020; Heslin, 2021; Poteat, 2020).Numerous studies have shown that among List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 110 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 106 (cont 'd) (cont 'd) Medicare beneficiaries, racial and ethnic minority individuals often receive lower quality of hospital care, report lower experiences of care, and experience more frequent hospital readmissions and procedural complications . (Martino, 2020; CMS Office -Hernandez, 2019; Joynt, 2011; Tsai, 2014). Readmission rates for the most common conditions in the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program are higher for black Medicare beneficiaries and higher for Hispanic Medicare beneficiaries with Congestive Heart Failure and Acute Myocardial Infarction (Rodriguez, 2011; CMS, 2014; 2018; Prieto -Centurion, 2013; Joynt, 2011). To ensure tha t all patients receive excellent care when hospitalized regardless of their individual characteristics, strong and committed leadership from hospital executives and board members is essential. Publications from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Qualit y and The Joint Commission identify the important role of hospital leadership in promoting a culture of quality and safety (AHRQ, 2019; Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, 2009).Studies have shown that interventions taken by hosp ital leadership can positively influence culture (Bradley, 2018) and that health care organizational culture can translate into better quality outcomes and experience of care (Bradley, 2018; Smith, 2017; Keroack, 2007). A 2013 systematic review of 122 publ ished studies found an association between hospital board composition and processes and high -performance (Millar, 2013). Health disparities are evidence that high quality care has not been delivered equally to all patients. Studies from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement identified five core features of health care organizations that make health equity a core strategy, including making health equity a leader -driven priority and developing structures and processes that support equity (Mate, 2017).Thi s measure aligns with the National Quality Forum strategic goal of advancing health equity and addressing disparities (National Quality Forum, 2021). The five questions of the structural measures are adapted from the CMS Office of Minority Health, Building an Organizational Response to Health Disparities (CMS Office of Minority Health, 2021) framework for helping health care organizations build a response to health disparities through focus on data collection, data analysis, culture of equity, and quality i mprovement.

Unlike procedures that are intended to promote survival, these procedures are specifically intended to improve function and reduce pain, outcomes best reported by patients, making PROs a meaningful outcome metric to assess for this population. THA/TKAs are important, effective procedures performed on a broad population. Patient -reported outcomes for these procedures (pain, mobility, and quality of life) can be measured in a scientif ically sound way (3 - 15) and are influenced by a range of improvements across the full spectrum of care pre -, peri -, and postoperatively (16-23). The goal of the clinician -level THA/TKA PRO -PM is to incentivize patient -centered care and promote clinician -level accountability for improving patients' health and reducing the burden of their recovery.

Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) \u2014development of a self -administered risk - standardized complication rate (RSCR) following elective primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and/or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) In 2010, there were 168,000 THAs and 385,000 TKAs performed on Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older (National Center for Health Statistics, 2010). There is an increasing trend in both of these procedures, with some projecting that annual TKA and THA volume will reach more than 3 million and 500,000 by 2030 respectively (Kurtz et al., 2007; Kurtz et al., 2014). Although these procedures dramatically improve quality of life, they are costly. In 2005, annual hospital charges totaled $3.95 billion and $7.42 billion for primary THA and TKA, respectively ( Kurtz et al., 2007). These costs are projected to increase significantly for both THAs and TKAs by 2020 (Kurtz et al., 2014). Medicare is the single largest payer for these procedures, covering approximately two -thirds of all THAs and TKAs performed in the US (Ong et al., 2006). Combined, THA and TKA procedures account for the largest procedural cost in the Medicare budget (Bozic et al., 2008). Since THAs and TKAs are commonly performed and costly procedures, it is imperative to address quality of care. Com plications increase costs associated with THA and TKA and affect the quality, and potentially quantity, of life for patients. Although complications following elective THA and TKA are rare, the results can be devastating. Rates for periprosthetic joint inf ection following THA and TKA range from 1.6% to 2.3%, depending upon the population (Bongartz et al., 2008; Kurtz et al., 2010). Reported 90 -day death rates following THA range from 0.7% (Soohoo et al., 2010) to 2.7% (Cram et al., 2007). Rates for pulmonary embolism following TKA range from 0.5% to 0.9% (Cram et al., 2007; Mahomed et al., Khatod et al., 2008; Solomon et al., 2006; Bozic et al., 2014). Rates for wound infection in Medicare population -based studies vary be tween 0.3% and 1.0% (Cram et al., 2007; Mahomed et al., 2003; Solomon et al., 2006; Bozic et al., 2014). Rates for septicemia range from 0.1%, during the index admission (Browne et al., 2010) to 0.3%, 90 days following discharge for List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 115 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 118* (cont 'd) (cont 'd) primary TKA (Cram et al., 2007; Bozic et al., 2014). Rates for bleeding and hematoma following TKA range from 0.9% (Browne et al., 2010; Bozic et al., 2014) to 1.7% (Huddleston et al., 2009). The variation in complication rates across hospitals indicates there is room for quality improvement and targeted efforts to reduce these complications could result in better patient care and potential cost savings (Navathe et al, 2017; Cyriac et al., 2016; Borza et al., 2019). Measurement of patient outcomes allows for a comprehensive view of quality of care that reflects complex aspects of care such as communication between providers and coordinated transitions to the outpatient environment. These aspects are critical to patient outcomes, and are broader than what can be captured by individual process of care measures. The THA/TKA hospital -specific risk -standardized complication rate (RSCR) measure is thus intended to inform quality -of-care improvement efforts, as individual process -based p erformance measures cannot encompass all the complex and critical aspects of care within a hospital that contribute to patient outcomes.

More than one third of the US population 65 years and older suffers from osteoarthritis [1]. Between 2009 and 2012, there were 337,419 THA procedures and 750,569 TKA procedures for Medicare fee -for-service patients 65 years and older [2]. Estimates place the annual insurer cost of osteoarthritis in the US at $149 billion, with Medicare direct payments to hospitals for THA/TKA excee ding $15 billion annually [3]. Further, there are conflicting data regarding costs after total joint arthroplasty, with evidence to support both increased [4] and decreased costs [5] following arthroplasty, suggesting there is great variation in the costs of a full episode of care for THA and TKA. The goal of hospital -level resource use measurement is to capture the full spectrum of care in order to incentivize collaboration and shared responsibility for improving patients' health and reducing the burden of their disease. Variation in the cost of a THA or TKA episode of care is often related to the quality of care, where complications and readmissions increase the total payment for post -surgical care. Given the well -documented variation in readmission and co mplication rates following THA and TKA, there is expected variation in total episode of care costs for the procedures [6]. Birkmeyer et al. found that the average 30 -day cost increased by $2,436 among hospitals with the highest quintile of List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 117 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 120* (cont 'd) (cont 'd) complication rates, compared to the lowest quintile following THA [7]. The same study also found that rehabilitation costs accounted for 50% of \"excess\" payments among those undergoing THA. Miller et al. found that a major driv er of differences in episode payments for THA was that hospitals within Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) had smaller payments for post -discharge care compared to non -ACO hospitals [8]. Taken together, these studies suggest that much of the variation in total episode costs arises in the post -acute setting. Health systems have taken notice of opportunities to improve value by encouraging collaboration of care between hospitals and post -acute providers. [10]. Transparency regarding the variation of episode of care payments triggered by THA and TKA helps to guide health systems and providers towards improvement in the value of care. 1.

MUC2021 - 122* Exces s days in acute care (EDAC) after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) AMI is among the most common principal hospital discharge diagnoses among Medicare beneficiaries, and, in 2013, it was the fifth most expensive condition treated in US hospitals, accounting for 3.5% of national healthcare costs (Torio et al., 2016). Readmission rates following discharge for AMI are high and variable across hospitals in the United States (Krumholz et al., 2009; Bernheim et al., 2010). For example, for the time period of July 2015 -June 2018, publicly reported 30 -day risk -standardized readmission rates ranged from 12.0% to 21.9% for patients admitted with AMI (Wallace et al., 2019). Interventions during and after a hospitalization can be effective in reducing utilization rates in geriatric populations (Benbassat et al., 2000; Naylor et al., 1999; Coleman et al., 2006; List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 118 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 122* (cont 'd) CMS Program(s): Hospital IQR Program Courtney et al., 2009; Koehler et al., 2009) and, particularly, for older patients with AMI (Carroll et al., 2007; Young et al., 2003; Bondestam et al., 1995; Ades et al, 1992; Carlhed et al., 2009). Several randomized trials have reduced 30-day readmission rates by 20 -40% (Jack et al., 2009; Coleman et al., 2004; Courtne y et al., et al., 1999; et al., et al., 2010; Krumholz et al., 2012; Balaban et al., 2008; Patel et al., 2018). These types of interventions have also been demonstrated to be cost -saving (Naylor et al., 1999; Naylor et al., 2004; Koelling et al., 2005; Krumholz et al., 2002; Stauffer et al., 2011). Outside the randomized controlled trial setting, there is also increasing evidence that hospitals and healt h plans have been able to reduce readmission rates through more generalizable quality improvement initiatives (Gerhardt et al., 2012; Stauffer et al., 2011; Graham et al., 2012; Harrison et al., 2011; Hernandez et al., 2010; Radhakrishnan et al., 2018). In the case of AMI, specifically, studies suggest that appropriate care for AMI during and after the index hospitalization may reduce the risk of subsequent readmission (Carroll et al., 2007; Young et al., 2003; Bondestam et al., 1995; Ades et al, 1992; Carl hed et al., 2009). Studies have also reported reductions in emergency department (ED) visit rates for patients with other conditions after implementation of interventions that focused on the inpatient and outpatient settings (Bondestam et al., 1995). The c urrent process -based performance measures cannot capture all the ways that care within the hospital might influence outcomes. As a result, many stakeholders, including patient organizations, are interested in outcomes measures that allow patients and provi ders to assess relative outcomes performance among hospitals (Bratzler et al., 2007). In the context of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS's) publicly reported readmission measures, the increasing use of ED visits and observation stays ha s raised concerns that current readmission measures do not capture the full range of unplanned acute care in the post -discharge period (Vashi et al., 2013; Rising et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2012). Observation stays can occur in many different parts of the hospital, including dedicated treatment rooms, the ED, or inpatient units. In particular, there is concern that high use of observation stays could in some cases replace readmissions, and that hospitals with high rates of observation stays in the post -discharge period may therefore have low readmission rates that do not accurately reflect the quality of care (Vashi et al., 2013; Nuckols et al., 2018).

MUC2021 - 124 Skilled Nursing Facility Healthcare - Associated Infections Requiring Hospitalization CMS Program(s): SNF VBP Healthcare associated infection (HAI) is defined as an infection acquired while receiving care at a health care facility that was not present or incubating at the time of admission. [1] If the prevention and treatment of HAIs are poorly managed, they can c ause poor health care outcomes for patients and lead to wasteful resource use. Most HAIs are considered potentially preventable because they are outcomes of care related to processes or structures of care. In other words, these infections typically result from inadequate management of patients following a medical intervention, such as surgery or device implantation, or poor adherence to hygiene protocol and antibiotic stewardship guidelines. Measuring HAIs among SNF residents can therefore provide valuable information about SNFs' quality of care. HAIs are associated with longer lengths of stay, use of higher -intensity care (e.g., critical care services and hospital readmissions), and increased mortality. [2, 3, 4] HAIs also lead to increased health care cost s and present an economic burden. [2,5] Addressing HAIs in SNFs is particularly important because several factors place SNF residents at high risk for infection, including increased age, cognitive and functional decline, use of indwelling devices, frequent care transitions, and close contact with other residents and health care workers. [6,7] A recent report from the Office of Inspector General (OIG, 2014) estimated that 1 in 4 adverse events among SNF residents are due to HAIs and that more than half of al l HAIs are potentially preventable. [2] Infection prevention and control programs with core components in education, monitoring, and feedback on infection rates from surveillance programs or feedback on infection control practices from audits have been fou nd to be successful interventions for reducing HAIs. [8] Preventing and reducing HAIs is crucial to delivering safe and high -quality care across the health care system and has been a priority objective at the federal, state, and local levels. For example, the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion has created a National Action Plan to Prevent Health Care - Associated Infections, with specific attention to HAIs in long -term care facilities (LTCFs). [6] In 2017, CMS launched the Meaningful Measures f ramework. \"Making Care Safer by Reducing Harm Caused in the Delivery of Care\" is one of the six meaningful measure domains and is a companion priority for quality assurance and improvement work and improvement work at CMS. The meaningful measure area of HAIs is under this domain. References: 1. World Health Organization. (n.d.). The burden of health care -associated infection worldwide.

Approximately 7.4 million people in the United States have psoriasis. Direct costs of the disease are estimated between $51.7 and $63.2 billion, with the total economic bu rden estimated to be between $112 and $135 billion. Chronic inflammatory skin diseases, such as psoriasis, are pruritic and tremendously burdensome; with more than 70% of psoriasis patients suffering from itch. Itch has profound effects on patients, especi ally in geriatric populations, where there is increased incidence of pruritus. For those over 65 years old, itch is the most common skin complaint. The number of patients with pruritus is expected to increase as the elderly population grows - becoming 25% of the US population by 2025. Pruritus is a frequent and onerous symptom of psoriasis and, on its own, has significant effects on patients' quality of life. In a study, investigators quantified pruritic burden in a cross -sectional analysis investigating ch ronic pruritus and pain. They demonstrated that the quality of life impact was due to the severity of the symptom, rather than whether the symptom was pain or pruritus. Moreover, they elucidated a mean health utility score of 0.87 from chronic pruritus (CP ) patients, meaning that on average, a patient would give up 13% of their life expectancy to live without pruritus. An additional study showed the effects of CP on a population -based level. Researchers found that the point pre valence of pruritus was 13.5%. When looking at 12 -months the prevalence rose to 16.4% and rose again to 22% when looking at lifetime prevalence. List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 124 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 125 (cont 'd) (cont 'd) When studied again in 2013, the lifetime prevalence rose to 25.5%. Moreover, data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1999 -2009) found that a total of 77 million patient visits for itch were made during the 11 -year time period. This was an average of 7 million visits per year, which represented approximately 1% of all outpatient visits. Also, further analysis showed that although the majority of visits (58.6%) were for new instances of itch, almost a third (32%) were for chronic pruritus. Pruritus is a subjective and multifaceted symptom that manifests in patients in various ways that affect quality -of-life by contributing to the development of depression, global distress, and sleep impairment. Additionally, studies of CP have shown patients to have a 17% higher mortality risk as well as being strongly associated with poorer general health. This measure aims to improve pruritus in patients who carry a large burden with this disease; by assessing itch and aiming to make the symptom more manageable. Furthermore, the use of itch will be a measure of overall disease improvement/response.

Measuring Quality in Kidney Care: An Eva luation of Existing Quality Metrics and Approach to Facilitating Improvements in Care Delivery. J Am Soc Nephrol. 2020 Mar;31(3):602 - 130 Discharge to Community -Post Acute Care Measure for Skilled The empirical evidence provided below comes from SNF -specific literature, as well as literature from other inpatient PAC and hospital settings, as evidence related to healthcare structures and processes for improving discharge to community outcomes is largely applicable across inpatient PAC and hospital settings . There is consistent evidence in the literature across inpatient settings that rehabilitation interventions, discharge planning, and care coordination List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 125 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 130 (cont 'd) Nursing Facilities (SNF) can improve discharge to community rates. Thus, evidence from other inpatient PAC and hospital settings can be used to support the DTC -PAC SNF measure. Discharge to community is an actionable health care outcome, as targeted interventions have been shown t o successfully increase discharge to community rates in a variety of post - acute settings and hospital settings. T hese interventions frequently involve specific rehabilitation strategies such as addressing discharge barriers and improving medical and functional status , discharge planning , communication and care coordination , or community -based transitional care services and supports . In a retrospective observational study, O'Brien and Zhang [2] examined the relationship of therapy intensity with discha rge destination and time to community discharge (i.e., LOS) among 311,338 Medicare fee -for-service (FFS) residents in 3,605 SNFs across five states in 2008. The authors used data from Minimum Data Set (MDS), Online Survey Certification and Reporting (OSCAR ) dataset, and Rural Urban Commuting Area Codes. Therapy intensity was calculated as the total minutes of physical, occupational, and speech therapy in a day, and categorized as high ( 60min/day), medium -high (45 to <60 min/day), medium -low (30 to <45min/ day), and low (0 to <30min/day). The authors found a dose -response relationship between therapy intensity and discharge destination, with the proportion of residents discharged to community decreasing with decreasing therapy intensity: 63% (high intensity) , 52.9% (medium -high), 45.1% (medium -low), and 27.4% (low). The proportion of residents discharged to long -term care increased as therapy intensity decreased: 8.4% (high), 13.3% (medium -high), Risk -adjusted random -effec ts competing risks regression modeling controlling for patient demographic/clinical characteristics and facility/regional characteristics, showed that compared with the high intensity group, the medium -high, medium - low, and low intensity groups, respective ly, had a 15% (hazard ratio (HR) = .85, 95% confidence interval (CI) = .83 - .85), 32% (HR = .68, 95% CI = .67 -.69), and 57% (HR = .43, 95% CI = .42 -.45) lower likelihood of community discharge than of becoming permanently placed in a nursing home. The hazar d of hospital readmission increased with decreased therapy intensity. Compared with the high intensity group, the medium -high, medium -low, and low intensity groups, respectively, had an 8% (HR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.06 -1.12), 25% (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.19 -1.27 ), and 29% (HR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.19 -1.27) higher risk for hospital discharge than for permanent nursing home placement. The risk of death also increased significantly as therapy intensity decreased (HR = 1.407, 95% CI = 1.32 -1.45; HR = 2.299, 95% CI = 2.1 5-2.46; and HR = 4.198, CI = 3.89 -4.52 for medium -high, medium -low, and low intensity groups, respectively). For residents discharged home (n = 162,792) , the mean SNF LOS increased as therapy intensity decreased from 35.6 \u00b1 24.2 days for the high inten sity group to 45.3 \u00b1 31.7 days for the low intensity group. Further, Poisson regression modeling controlling for covariates and compared with the low intensity group, List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 126 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 130 (cont 'd) (cont 'd) showed that SNF LOS was 5% shorter for the high intensity group ( p<.001), with an i ncident rate ratio of 0.95 (95% CI = 0.92 -0.97). The high intensity group averaged 2 days less in the SNF compared with other intensity groups . The authors concluded that high intensity therapy was associated with desirable dischar ge outcomes and may shorten PAC length of stay. [2] In another retrospective cohort study, Jung et al. [3] examined the relationship between therapy intensity and likelihood of discharge to home in 481,908 Medicare FFS residents admitted to 15,496 SNFs after hip fracture. Therapy intensity included total physical, occupational, and speech and language therapy minutes, and was calculated as the average quantity of therapy per week . Patient -level data were taken from MDS and Medicare inpatient claims and faci lity-level data from OSCAR, for years 2000 through 2009. Multivariable linear regression adjusting for patient characteristics and time -varying facility characteristics indicated that each additional hour of therapy per week was associated with a 3.1 percentage -point (95% CI = 3.0, 3.1) increase in the likelihood of discharge to home. A n additional hour of occupational therapy was associated with a 5.3 percentage -point ( 95% CI = 5.2, 5.4) increase in the likelihood of discharge to community, while an additional hour of physical therapy was associated with a 5.9 percentage -point (95% CI = 5.8, 6.1) increase in the likelihood of discharge to community. When examined by SNF LOS, an additional hour of therapy per week was associated with increases in the likelihood of discharge to home of 2.9 percentage points (95% CI = 2.8, 2.9), 3.0 percentage points (95% CI = 2.9, 3.1), and 3.0 percentage points (95% CI = 3.0, 3.1) for stay s of up to 30, 60, and 90 days, respectively. The effect of additional therapy decreased as the Resource Utilization Group (RUG) category increased, with additional therapy not benefiting patients in the highest RUG category, who had the highest impairment levels. The authors concluded that increased therapy intensity was associated with a larger proportion of patients being discharged to home, suggesting better post -acute outcomes, except for patients with the highest impairment levels. [3] Schweickert et al. [4] conducted a randomized controlled trial of physical and occupational therapy in 104 patients receiving mechanical ventilation in medical intensive care in two Midwest medical centers. Intervention group patients (n = 49) received early exercise and mobilization (physical and occupational therapy) during periods of daily interruption of sedation, while control group patients (n = 55) received daily interruption of sedation and standard care with physical and occupational therapy as ordered by the pri mary care team. Blinded therapists functionally assessed patients at discharge based on the ability to perform six activities of daily living and walk independently. Using intention -to-treat analysis, the authors reported higher discharge to home rates in intervention patients (43%) compared with controls (24%) for comparison of home discharge to all other possible locations for group comparison ( p=0.06). Return to independent functional status at hospital discharge occurred in 59% of intervention List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 127 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 130 (cont 'd) (cont 'd) patients compared with 35% of controls ( p=0.02; odds ratio (OR) = 2.7 [95% CI = 1.2 -6.1]). Other important outcomes included shorter median duration of delirium (2 vs. 4 days; p=0.02), and more median ventilator -free days (23.5 vs. 21.1; p=0.05) during the 28 -day f ollow -up period in intervention patients than controls. The authors concluded that a strategy for whole -body rehabilitation -consisting of interruption of sedation, protocol -driven spontaneous breathing trials, and physical and occupational therapy in the e arliest days of critical illness was safe and well -tolerated, and resulted in better functional outcomes at hospital discharge, a shorter duration of delirium, and more ventilator -free days compared with standard care. [4] Length of stay (LOS) is another i mportant variable that can impact discharge to community rates. Camicia et al. [5] examined the relationship between IRF LOS and discharge to community outcomes in a retrospective cohort analysis of 4,781 IRF patients with stroke between 2009 and 2011, bas ed on random sampling of 2% of all stroke patients during the time period, using Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation (UDSMR) data. After adjusting for admission functional status and other patient factors, IRF LOS was positively associated with functional gains and likelihood of discharge to community among severely impaired patients (OR = 1.010, 95% CI = 0.999 -1.021), but negatively associated with the likelihood of discharge to community for mildly (OR = 0.905, 95% CI = 0.839 -0.976) and 95% 0.924 -0.962) impaired patients. [5] Thus, optimizing IRF LOS based on patient severity and needs is important to improve discharge to community outcomes. Functional status has been observed to be associated with discharge destinat ion, including discharge to home. For example, Thrush et al. [6] examined the relationship between functional status and discharge outcomes based on data collected from 101 LTCH patients in a 38 -bed LTCH over 8 months, beginning in September 2010. F unction al status was measured based upon the Functional Status Score for the Intensive Care Unit (FSS -ICU), which contains five functional activities scored using a seven -point system, resulting in a score range from 0 to 35; FSS -ICU has been used in both the ICU and LTCH setting. FSS -ICU scores were significantly higher for those discharged home (score = 28) compared to those discharged to a long -term care/hospice/expired (score = 5) or transferred to a short -stay hospital (score = 4) ( p<0.001). [6] These finding s suggest that interventions aimed at improving functional status could help improve discharge to community outcomes. Using an observational study design, Kushner et al. [7,8,9] assessed the impact of the Siebens Domain Management Model (SDMM) on several discharge outcomes in IRF geriatric, stroke, and geriatric -stroke patients at a single facility, and compared outcomes to national IRF outcomes using UDSMR data. The SDMM intervention focused on effective interdisciplinary communication and col laboration providing a standard format for weekly interdisciplinary team conferences. The intervention also involved weekly adjustmentsof care focusing on potential List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 128 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 130 (cont 'd) (cont 'd) barriers to home or community discharge including medical/surgical issues, mental status/em otions/coping, physical function, and living environment/community re -entry needs. In all three patient groups, the authors reported significantly higher discharges to community in the post - intervention period (year 2012) compared with pre- intervention ( year 2010) ( p < 0.05). Pre -intervention versus post -intervention discharge to community rates were 58.5% (of 429) vs. 74.4% (of 524) in geriatric patients [7], 57.8% (of 154) vs. 81.2% (of 151) in stroke patients [8], and 56.9% (of 60) vs. 79.3% (of 58) in geriatric -stroke patients [9]. The authors also reported other outcome improvements following SDMM implementation including fewer discharges to long -term care (24.0% pre - intervention vs. 10.4% post -intervention) [7], fewer acute care transfers (27.3% pre -intervention vs. 9.4% post - intervention) [8], reduced length of IRF stay [2,8,9], and improved Functional Independence Measure (FIM) efficiency [7,8]. While the authors did not adjust for patient characteristics when comparing outcomes, the magnitude of di fferences strongly suggests that discharge planning processes can improve discharge to community rates. The authors also reported that unlike the pre -intervention group, the post -intervention group had significantly higher (3 -4 times higher) discharge to c ommunity rates [7,8,9], fewer acute care transfers [7,9], fewer long -term care discharges [9], and higher FIM efficiency [7,8,9] compared with case -mix group adjusted national UDSMR data, using a 0.05 significance level. Berkowitz et al. [10] examined the impact of a three -component intervention on discharge disposition outcomes of residents admitted to a single SNF between June 2008 and May 2010. The intervention included standardized physician admission procedures with a goals -of-care discussion; palliati ve care consultation for patients with three or more hospital admissions over the prior 6 months; and bimonthly multidisciplinary root - cause analysis conferences for rehospitalized patients to identify problems and improve processes of care. 862 patients were included in the pre -intervention period (June 2008 -May 2009) and 863 during the post -intervention period (June 2009 -May 2010). Discharge dispositions differed significantly ( p =.03) between the pre - and post -intervention periods, with discharges to ho me increasing from 68.6% to 73.0%. The rate of rehospitalization declined 19.4% from 16.5% to 13.3%, and discharges to long -term care fell from 13.8% to 11.5%. [10] Buttke et al. [11] described outcomes of Minnesota's Return to Community Initiative (RTCI), a novel, statewide initiative introduced in 2010 to assist private paying nursing home residents to return to and remain in the community without converting to Medicaid. RTCI is a multi -component intervention, consisting of in -person SNF visits to ensure consumers receive information regarding options for residing in the community and make consumers aware of the right to live in the List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 129 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 130 (cont 'd) (cont 'd) least restrictive environment; interviews to fill the Community Planning Tool; development of Community Living Support Plans; post -discharge in -person and phone follow -up visits to help the consumer transition back to the community; ongoing follow -up up to 90 days post -discharge; and follow -up up to five years if desired by the consumer. The authors reported that under RTCI, the number of resident transitions to the community increased from 38 per month in 2013 to 69 per month in 2014, and 90 to 100 per month during 2015 and 2016. Seventy -six percent of transitioned residents were alive and living in the comm unity at one year after initial transition. The authors concluded that the relatively low nursing home readmission rates and mortality among transitioned residents may be attributable to effective follow -up. [11] In a retrospective analysis, Logue and Drag o [12] described the impact of a modified community -based care transitions program on 30 -day all -cause readmissions in 149 Medicare FFS patients in two hospital catchment areas in Arizona. The care transitions program included home - based in -person and phon e visits by licensed practical nurses and registered nurses. The program focused on medication self -management, use of a personal health record by the patient or caregiver to facilitate communication and ensure continuity of the care plan across providers and settings, timely follow -up visits with care teams, educating patients on red flags indicating worsening condition, and depression and mobility screening. The 30 -day all -cause readmission rate was 4% for patients who completed the program; compared with a baseline readmission rate of 15%, the program resulted in a 73% reduction in all -cause readmissions. Compared with the national average 30 -day readmission rate, the program resulted in an 80% reduction in readmissions. The authors also reported other po sitive outcomes, including high levels of patient satisfaction with the care transitions program, significant improvement in participants' confidence with self -care, and actual Medicare cost savings during the 9 -month study period of $214,192, excluding th e cost to administer the program. The authors concluded that a customized care transitions approach is desirable and often required as the most cost -effective way to manage care transitions and employ evidence -based policy -making. [12] In a secondary data analysis, Carnahan et al. [13] used the Older Adults Transition Study (OATS) database to identify whether early post -SNF discharge care reduces likelihood of 30 -day hospital readmissions in 1,543 patients discharged from a safety -net hospital in Central In diana to SNF then to home between January 1, 2007 and October 1, 2010 . The OATS database combines MDS, Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS), Medicare and Medicaid claims, and electronic medical records. Using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for patient demographic, clinical and utilization variables, the authors found that a home health visit within a week of SNF discha rge reduced the hazard of 30 -day hospital readmissions [adjusted HR = 0.61, p <.001]. Kaplan -Meier survival function estimates found that a home care visit List of Measures Under Consideration for December 1 , 2021 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Page 130 of 155 MUC ID Measure Title Rationale MUC2021 - 130 (cont 'd) (cont 'd) was also significantly associated ( p < 0.05) with reduced likelihood of readmission at one, two, and three weeks. The authors concluded that early home health services could be a potential intervention to reduce readmissions and improve outcomes for this patient population. [13] A 2017 systematic review and meta -analysis of 11 randomized controlled trial s by Rodakowski et al. [14] examined the effect of integrating informal caregivers (i.e., unpaid individuals who provide support for medical tasks and daily activities once home) into discharge planning from a hospital or SNF on post -discharge readmissions in a combined total sample of 4,361 older adul ts. The authors reported that integrating caregivers in to discharge planning for patients 65 years and older resulted in a 25% l ower risk of 90 -day hospital readmission s and 24% fewer readmissions at 180 days . These findings pr ovid e evidence that community support services can help ensure that patients successfully stay in the community following discharge . [14] The empirical evidence provided above demonstrates that improvement in successful discharge to community rates among PAC patients is possible through modifying provider -led processes and interventions in the PAC setting and community.

MUC2021 131* CMS Program(s): Hospital IQR Program; HVBP In the United States, healthcare costs consume an ever -increasing amount of our nation's resources. One source of these rising healthcare costs is payment systems that reward medical inputs rather than outcomes. Medicare is transforming from a system that rewards volume of service to one that rewards efficient, effective care and reduces delivery system fragmentation. To advance this transformation, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) provides financial incentives to hospitals based on their performance on selected quality measures. These measures include evaluations of hospitals' clinical process of care, patient perspective of care, outcomes, and efficiency. By measuring Medicare spending through the MSPB Hospital measure, CMS aims to reward hospitals that can provide efficient care at a lower cost to Medicare. The MSPB Hospital measure evaluates hospitals' risk - adjusted episode costs relative to the risk -adjusted episode costs of the national median hospital. Thi s scoring allows hospitals to improve their score by spending less than the episode -weighted risk -adjusted median cost during a given performance period through improved care coordination and provision of efficient care. For instance, hospitals can decreas e (i.e., improve) their risk -adjusted episode costs through actions such as: 1) improving coordination with post -acute providers to reduce the likelihood post -discharge of adverse events, 2) identifying unnecessary or low -value post -acute services and redu cing or eliminating these services, or 3) shifting post -acute care from more expensive services (e.g., skilled nursing facilities) to less expensive services (e.g., home health) in cases that would not affect patient outcomes. Care coordination helps ensur e a patient's needs and preferences for care are understood, and that those needs and preferences are shared between providers, patients, and families as a patient moves from one healthcare setting to another. People with chronic conditions, such as diabet es and hypertension, often receive care in multiple settings from numerous providers. As a result, care coordination among different providers is required to avoid waste, over -, under -, or misuse of prescribed medications and conflicting plans of care.

MUC2021 - 135 Dermatitis - Improvement in Patient -Reported Itch Severity CMS Program(s): MIPS Various types of dermatitis are chronically pruritic and are tremendously burdensome. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin disease in which pruritus is responsible for much of the disease burden and morbidity borne by patients. It is estimated that in the U.S. alone, 31.6 million people have sym ptoms of AD, with 17.8 million meeting the criteria for AD. The effects of this disease are substantial; with direct costs estimated to be between $1 and $4 billion. Other types of dermatitis, such as contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis (SD) are also chronic, pruritic conditions which greatly affect patients. Approximately 6 million people in the U.S. have SD with direct and indirect costs estimated t o be $230 million. These various forms of dermatitis also greatly impact the quality -of-life patients have. In one study looking at the patient burden in adults with moderate to severe AD, 85% reported problems with the frequency of their itch and 41.5% re ported itching for 18 hours or more a day. With this persistence of itching, 55% of patients showed AD -related sleep disturbance 5 days a week or more and 21.8% showed clinically relevant anxiety or depression. In another study, investigators quantified pr uritic burden in a cross -sectional analysis investigating chronic pruritus and pain. They demonstrated that the quality -of-life impact was due to the severity of the symptom, rather than whether the symptom was pain or pruritus. Moreover, they elucidated a mean health utility score of 0.87 from CP patients, meaning that on average, a patient would give up 13% of their life expectancy to live without pruritus. Additionally, studies of CP have shown patients to have a 17% higher mortality risk as well as bein g strongly associated with poorer general health. Moreover, data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (1999 -2009) found that a total of 77 million patient visits for itch were made during the 11 -year time period. This was an average of 7 millio n visits per year, which represented approximately 1% of all outpatient visits. Also, further analysis showed that although the majority visits (58.6%) were for new instances of itch, almost a third (32%) were for chronic pruritus. This measure aims to imp rove pruritus in patients who carry a large burden with this disease; by assessing itch and aiming to make the symptom more manageable.

Numerous studies have examined the relationship between nursing home staffing levels and quality of care. The findings of these studies have been mixed, although most studies have found a positi ve relationship [1 -5]. Previous studies have varied considerably with respect to how they measured both staffing and quality. While not all studies have found a consistent relationship, associations have been found between higher staffing levels in nursi ng homes and fewer hospitalizations [6,7], fewer pressure ulcers [8, 9], less weight loss [6, 9], fractures [10], decreased resistance to care [6], improved functional status [6, 11], improved pain management [12] and fewer su rvev deficiencies [13,14]. The strongest relationships have been identified for RN staffing [1, 2]. Major methodological and theoretical limitations in some studies, including poor quality staffing data, small sample size, and the quality measures used, l imit the interpretation of results [2 -3]. One of the most comprehensive studies to date [6] used Medicaid Cost Report data from 10 states with over 5,000 facilities to examine the relationship between staffing and hospitalizations of nursing home residents . The study found evidence of a relationship between higher staffing and better outcomes for total nurse staffing levels up to 4.08 hours per resident day and RN staffing levels up to 0.75 RN hours per resident day. Minimum staffing levels at any level up to these thresholds were associated with incremental quality improvements, and no significant quality improvements were observed for staffing levels above these thresholds.
