Quite the opposite, when someone has this pattern, as many of my patients do, they will often share some sentiment along the lines of feeling \"like a zombie,\" \"like death,\" \"run-down,\" \"exhausted,\" or in low-spirits even without an instigating issue as one person said to me: \"I'm depressed and I don't even know why, there's nothing bothering me.\" Each person might have a different combination or number of symptoms associated with a Blood Deficiency, but despite the nuances, they typically share one thing in common: they feel depleted. Their vitality is diminished which shows in their appearance, emotional affect, how they carry themselves, and of course, their health. But before I describe exactly what a Blood Deficiency is, let's compare how blood is viewed in different medical paradigms: In Western (allopathic) Medicine, blood is composed of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, plasma, nutrients, other proteins, electrolytes and water. Its functions are based on the quality/quantity of these individual components. Some of these functions include distributing hormones, carrying oxygen and energy (glucose) and supporting the immune system. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), rather than focusing on the makeup of blood on a cellular level, the functions of blood are looked at holistically. In that sense, TCM sees blood more broadly as the red fluid inside the vessels that provides nutrition for the body. The components transported by blood\u2014and the quality of the blood itself\u2014 are not restricted to physical materials or quantifiable amounts. Its abundance or depletion is measured by observation (looking at the skin, muscle tone, hair, nails, plus the color of the tongue), palpation (does the skin feel cold or warm; is the pulse weak, empty, or thin; or is it more broad and replete?) as well as listening for the quality of the voice plus the presence of related symptoms. Blood (Xue) - Vital Substance In Traditional Chinese Medicine, it is said that... Blood is a denser form of Qi Blood is inseparable from Qi Blood nourishes the organs and produces Qi, but Qi gives movement to Blood As you can see, the relationship between Blood & Qi is like that between Yin & Yang. Blood is a Yin Substance: it is the darker, fluid, nutritive, and condensed form of qi. Qi is Yang in nature: it is the activating and dynamic energy that allows our body's systems to function properly. It moves the blood to where it is needs to be. You can think of Qi like electricity: you can't always see it, but you know it's running in the background to keep everything humming. The Functions of Blood In Chinese Medicine, Blood is in charge of: Nourishing the body by flowing throughout the vessels, organs, and channels. Providing flexibility and moisture to the body's tissues. As a Yin-substance, blood is dense, fluid, and lubricating: it prevents tissues/joints from drying out. With a blood deficiency, there is dryness: stiff joints/muscles, joint cracking/popping, chronically sore muscles that does not go away with rest or hydration (think of a dried-out river: when there is not enough blood to clear away debris at the bottom, metabolites and adhesions accumulate creating more pain/soreness); there can also be dry or brittle skin/hair/nails. Supports & anchors the Shen, our consciousness. The Shen is the \"Spirit\" or \"Mind\" of the Heart; it shapes how we perceive ourselves, others, and engage with the world around us. The Blood nourishes the Shen by supporting authentic and balanced emotional/mental activity. With deficient blood, the Shen can become disturbed showing as symptoms of vague anxiety, poor memory, cloudy thinking, slight irritability, unease, and difficulty sleeping (especially falling asleep or going back to sleep if you wake up). What does it mean if my Acupuncturist says I have a Blood Deficiency? It means you do not have enough blood (low volume) in circulation and/or the quality of your blood indicates a lack of nourishment (such as low iron) so it cannot carry out these functions. It also means that you and your Acupuncturist need to discuss why the Blood Deficiency is present in the first place in order to properly support the body in creating/renewing this vital substance. But before we get into the myriad of reasons why a Blood Deficiency might occur, here are the key symptoms to watch for: Symptoms: Headaches (usually a dull or empty quality, worse behind the eyes) Menstrual-Related Migraines (worse once/after the period begins) Always Cold Numbness/Tingling in hands/feet (Restless Leg Syndrome) Dizziness, Fainting Brain Fog, Poor Memory Chronic Fatigue Depression, Mood Swings Anxiety, Heart Palpitations Difficulty Falling (or Falling Back) Asleep Missing Period or Light/Short Period Hair Loss (Excessive) or Thinning Hair Dry/ Scaly/Flaky Skin Constipation (Dry Stools) Nails that are brittle, ridged, or have blue/purple lunae Bruise Easily Pale Complexion Pale Tongue; can be swollen with or without teeth marks Chronic Muscle Soreness or Weakness What causes a Blood Deficiency? It can develop for a variety of reasons, but here are the most common ones based on my experience (this is not an exhaustive list): 1. Physical overwork, especially strenuous cardiovascular/endurance activities. In TCM there is a saying that running consumes the blood while lifting heavy taxes the Kidneys (however strength sports are not an exception). A blood deficiency from physical overwork is most common (but not *normal or ideal*) in menstruating female athletes who notice their period disappears from the frequency or high-intensity of their workouts. From a western perspective, this can happen from a Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) or H-P-Ovarian (HPO) Axis dysregulation (in basic terms, your nervous system is too taxed, and for women, this can be the case for Hypothalamic Amenorrhea where your period stops arriving for months), a Thyroid disorder, or primary blood deficiency (such as Iron-Deficiency anemia). 2. Acute blood loss: childbirth, donating blood, injury All of the above can lead to an acute blood deficiency that, if left unchecked and un-replenished over time, can lead to more chronic symptoms. 3. Ongoing blood loss Unless you are donating blood often (which, is not recommended in Chinese Medicine, especially if this is part of your constitution), menstruating women are more susceptible\u2014especially if heavy periods and/or periods that last more than 7-10 days. 4. Nutrient Deficiency This is one of the most common underlying causes I see in clinic from habitually (even if unintentionally) just not eating enough, disordered eating, malnutrition from a poor diet or low appetite, intentional fasting, dietary restrictions, post-bariatric surgeries (which are designed to decrease appetite), and (here's a big one) **inadequately supplemented** vegetarian and vegan diets. When relying on mostly processed carbs with little-to-no protein, actual vegetables, or supplementation of vitamins/minerals that are inherently more abundant & absorbable from animal protein, these diets can be inherently depleting to the system. Even when earnestly pursued with a variety of vegetables and whole-food non-animal protein sources, vegetarian (and especially vegan) diets do require extra diligence to ensure you are getting the most *bioavailable* nutrients you can without meat like Vitamin B12 (which you need for red blood cell production, converting food into fuel, brain health, and nerve myelination) and Iron. There are many vegetables that contain iron, but not in the heme form, which is more recognized and efficiently assimilated in the body. All in all: you do not need to give up a plant-based lifestyle, make sure you are getting what your body needs to thrive.

Drug-Induced Nutrient Depletions Did you know certain drugs interfere with your body's ability to absorb nutrients from what you eat? Frustrating but true. This means that even if your diet is nutrient-dense, your medications can be blocking them and back-firing on your health. Here are just some examples... Hormonal Birth Control depletes Folic Acid/B9, B2, B6, B12, Vitamins Magnesium [PMID: 23852908](https://www.europeanreview.org/article/4579) Proton-Pump-Inhibitors depletes Vitamins B12 & C, Iron, Calcium, and Magnesium while decreasing gut flora biodiversity [PMID:25083257](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25083257/) Statins for High Cholesterol depletes Antioxidant CoQ10 [PMID: 29558445](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5874849/) Anti-Hypertensives for high blood pressure can block different nutrients depending on the mechanism: ACE Inhibitors deplete Zince while Calcium Channel Blockers deplete Potassium [PMID: 29558445](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5874849/) Antidepressants depletes Calcium as Adderral, Vyvanse, Ritalin, Vitamin D, Zinc, Magnesium Do not adjust/discontinue any medications without talking to your prescribing physician first 6. Genetic Predisposition: [MTHFR ](https://www.healthline.com/health/mthfr-gene)variation prevents absorption of B9, B12, Folic Acid (synthetic = folate) and requires testing from a MD, NP, FNP, or FMD to confirm . There can also be other types of anemias present such as (Sickle-Cell or Thalassemia aka \"Mediterranean\" anemia) that can be hereditary. Is Anemia Different? Because TCM looks at the function and quality of blood more broadly, you can have a Blood Deficiency but not be anemic. However, if you have been diagnosed with anemia or blood test levels are on the \"low end of normal,\" in TCM this still qualifies as a Blood Deficiency; if there is anemia in your medical history, we want to pay close attention to make sure that is not currently an issue. Related Western Medical Conditions: When patients seek care through Acupuncture for symptoms associated with a Blood Deficiency, oftentimes they have been previously diagnosed with or treated for the following conditions: Menorrhagia Endometriosis Primary Amenorrhea Hypothalamic Amenorrhea Chronic Fatigue Anxiety + Depression + Bipolar Postpartum Anxiety + Depression Heart Palpitations + Arrhythmia Iron Deficiency Anemia Anemia (all other types) Anorexia/Bulimia Due to the prevalence of anemia (especially undiagnosed) and [ psychiatric conditions linked to it](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-020-02621-0), bringing awareness to this insidious underlying cause to mental and emotional distress is important to me & the community of patients I care for. Spiritual Effects: Spiritual well-being is a less-discussed but just as vital part of health in Chinese Medicine. In general, a blood deficiency will show up in the psyche as: Low self-esteem ~ Feeling lost, or like one does not have a purpose or direction in life ~ A lack of inspiration & creativity ~ Trouble initiating plans or following-through on ideas ~ A vague sense of fear, restlessness, or unease...
