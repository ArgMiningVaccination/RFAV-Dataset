Boelsterli ISBN 9781032387659 April 18, 2023 242 Pages 25 Color & 5 B/W Illustrations Subject: Toxicology Urs A. Boelsterli, Ph.D., FAASLD is an Emeritus Professor of Toxicology at the University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy, where he also held the first Boehringer-Ingelheim Endowed Chair in Mechanistic Toxicology. Prior to this, he was head of the Toxicology Program at the National University of Singapore, and ran a research lab at Roche, Basel, Switzerland and the ETH in Zurich. He is retired and currently lives in Switzerland with his family. IN CONVERSATION WITH Urs A. Boelsterli author of Why the Dose Matter, on what we know and what we don't know about toxicants. What is this book about? Each day we encounter thousands of foreign chemicals in our food, water, and ambient air\u2014pesticides, food additives, natural toxins, or environmental contaminants\u2014but how can we tell which ones are safe and which ones might pose a human health risk? A chemical is not harmful just because it happens to be there. The key is the dose\u2014how much, how often, and for how long we are being exposed to it. Without such a quantitative approach, we might grossly overestimate the risk of certain notorious toxic chemicals that make the daily headlines while at the same time miss out on the real threats posed by other, less known but potentially harmful compounds. What triggered the idea to write such a book? In 2021, the Swiss people had to vote on whether to accept or dismiss a referendum initiated by a group of environment-conscious citizens. The initiative's theme was (paraphrased): should there be a total ban on the use of all synthetic pesticides across the country? The heated debates on TV, in the media, at the cracker-barrel, and across garden fences are long over (the initiative was rejected), but what made me ransack my brains over, even long after that political decision was made, were two nagging questions. First, why do a lot of people believe that everything synthetic is bad and everything natural is good? And second, why do a lot of people merely focus on the hazard of a chemical while blinding out the actual exposure? It was on one of those days that the seed for this book project was planted in my mind. Why do you think this book will be appealing to readers? For two major reasons: first, because people are confused by the unsettling daily news about \"bad\" chemicals around us, and second, because the book is written in an easily understandable manner. Oftentimes, the arguments about the safety of pharmaceutical drugs, pesticides, household products, or other chemicals, are acrimonious, fueled by emotions, bold assumptions, beliefs, and knowledge from hearsay rather than being based on rational facts and sound knowledge. If you let yourself become entangled in a discussion, you are either reviled as an idealistic green activist, or stigmatized as a lobbyist for the pesticide industry or big pharma. Where is the science? Fallen by the wayside?3The science of toxicology is dauntingly complex. It must therefore be quite confusing for a non-scientist to keep track of the facts and assemble them into the big picture. You can't blame the laypeople when a discussion gets emotionally charged while the scientific, rational arguments are few and far between. This book is targeted at interested people who have no special training in the field but who would like to see through the mist of this complex area without having to whack through the thick jungle of scientific jargon (you won't find any chemical equations or molecular structures). What are the most common myths about toxicants? One of the most popular misconceptions is that human-made chemicals are much more harmful than naturally occurring compounds. For example, many people believe that the world would be a safer place without synthetic chemicals, which is far from the truth. Another common myth is that the mere presence of a hazardous toxicant identified in our food or water will invariably cause cancer or trigger another disease, ignoring the fact that the exposure to that chemical might be so small that the human health risk is negligible. Along the same line, many consumers are scared witless when they hear that the tolerance limit for a certain toxicant in our food, water, or air, as set by the regulatory agencies, has been overstepped. They are unaware of the fact that these values are somewhat arbitrary and that there usually is a large built-in margin of safety. Finally, another widespread opinion is that it is not possible to predict the toxicity of chemicals and that testing in laboratory animals has proved futile, citing as evidence some examples of drugs (e.g., thalidomide) or pesticides (e.g., DDT) introduced decades ago that has led to human tragedies and environmental disasters. In fact, it is the other way around; back then the rigorous safety assessment and sophisticated testing procedures currently required by the regulatory agencies were not yet in place. These and many other examples are discussed throughout the book, and the most common myths are busted.You seem to somewhat downplay the human health risk posed by many chemicals\u2014can you give us some specific everyday examples about chemicals in our environment that are of real concern? While a lot of the anxiety about a perceived acute human health risk caused by certain chemicals is indeed unfounded (even though often blown out of proportion in the popular press), there are real risks that we shouldn't ignore. A valid concern is the long-term, chronic exposure to potentially harmful chemicals including metals (e.g., cadmium, lead, or mercury), arsenic, or specific agricultural or industrial products (e.g., hazardous pesticides) that are persistent and widespread, accumulating in ecosystems or being magnified in the food chain. Also, the emission of combustion products (e.g., dioxins, benzene, and other volatile or particulate matter) contributes to air pollution and human disease on a global scale. This book covers these and many other examples and provides an outlook on emerging topics (e.g., microplastics or nanoparticles) about which we simply don't know enough yet. Numerous books on Toxicology are on the market\u2014why another one? What is unique about it? The book is timely and topical, written in clear language and without the scientific lingo. It aims at a general readership. It develops concepts and illustrates with current examples that we shouldn't lose sleep over sensational, flashy headlines that foster chemophobia and incriminate a chemical without putting it into a quantitative perspective. Instead, we should focus on the significant, but often neglected, environmental and human health risks.4 IN CONVERSATION WITH Michael Castellini and Jo-Ann Mellish the editors of Physiology of Marine Mammals, about their new book. Physiology of Marine Mammals Adaptations to the Ocean Edited by Michael Castellini and Jo-Ann Mellish ISBN 9781032285603 May 25, 2023 432 Pages 104 Color Illustrations Subject: Marine & Aquatic ScienceMichael Castellini was a faculty member at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) from 1989-2021. Now an Emeritus Professor, he was the founding Science Director for the Alaska SeaLife Center, the Director of the Institute of Marine Science at UAF, Dean for the School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences and Dean for the UAF Graduate School, senior faculty in the Center for Arctic Policy Studies and director of the Center for Global change. Jo-Ann Mellish, PhD earned her PhD from Dalhousie University in Canada and was jointly-appointed research faculty at UAF and scientist at the Alaska SeaLife Center from 2001-2016. She now facilitates funding opportunities for other scientists in her role of Program Manager and Chief Grants and Operations Officer at the North Pacific Research Board. In Alaska, she focused on innovative approaches to studying physiology, survival and predation in endangered species, working to raise the bar on thoughtful assessments of the research procedures themselves. What motivated you to edit Physiology of Marine Mammals in the first instance? What did (and do!) you hope to achieve with the book and specifically the new updated version? Over the course of decades of teaching marine mammal physiology, students have reminded us that many of the most engaging questions about this group of animals are also some of the most basic, such as: How can marine mammals dive for such a long time? How can they swim so efficiently? Where do they find fresh water to drink? or How do they stay warm in a cold ocean? The unifying, single-line syllabus of this book is: How would you design a marine mammal? The simplicity of this question was in part inspired by the ancient mariner map illustrations on our textbook cover. The wild interpretations of these sea creatures spark the imagination and provide a contrast to what we know of these animals in today's age. When we first published Marine Mammal Physiology: Requisites for Ocean Living in 2015, our goal was to provide a consolidated set of deep literature reviews for graduate students, postdocs, and colleagues that covered the incredible range of adaptations that allow this group of mammals to succeed in the ocean. With this new version, Physiology of Marine Mammals: Adaptations to the Ocean, our focus is to serve the undergraduate classroom with accessible content, consistent organization, and a variety of learning tools. This includes study questions, critical thinking concepts, fields for future studies, and downloadable \u00a9 and permission courtesy of Dolphin Quest Hawaii5files that can be used by teachers and students alike. There are also several new topics, expanded glossaries, and further reading sections for those that are ready for a deeper dive. We kept the sea creatures cover for the continued entertainment value. What did you find most rewarding and/or most challenging about the book editing and writing process? The idea of a common-themed textbook on marine mammal physiology was simultaneously exciting and daunting. We had both been teaching and giving talks on these topics to increasingly wide ranges of audiences. Students asked challenging questions not only on the details of a specific marine mammal adaptation but are now including topics such as climate change and pollution impacts on the health of marine mammals. The diversity of topics demanded that a large international team of authors be assembled. In this new version we had two major challenges: would the original authors be ready to repackage and update their chapters, and what new topics should be included? Logistically, this entire book was written under COVID 19 conditions, over 99% online, with dozens of video remote conference calls and across multiple worldwide time zones. Is there a particular chapter or section you would recommend, if readers picked just one? Our suggestion is for a reader to move through the book and read the single line \"Driving Question\" for each chapter. The collection of these 16 single line questions provides an overview that helps the reader ask themselves the basic question of \"How would I design a marine mammal\"? We collected a range of common questions from hundreds of students to provide the overall organization of the book. Chapters are organized in groups of related topics: How do they get around under water? (Spoiler alert: They can withstand literally tons of underwater pressure) How do they stay warm, communicate, find food and fresh water? (Spoiler alert: Most do not drink) What impacts their health, and how do human interactions including pollution and climate change influence their health? (Spoiler alert: Some tissues safely sequester contaminants) For the committed reader, we close out with what new and exciting fields are opening up. (Spoiler alert: So many). Why is the book relevant outside of the US? Is there any country/region where you think it could have a particular impact? Marine mammals have a world-wide distribution and are very popular with the public and students across the globe. The basic principles of physiological, biochemical and anatomical adaptation examined in the book are core scientific concepts, and the adaptations of marine mammals for living in the ocean are relevant for any marine biology class, regardless of location. The book covers species from pole to pole, has a suite of international authors, and deals with global topics from climate change and pollution, to ship noise and conservation.

He is a previous recipient of BEVA's Richard Hartley Clinical Award and in 2018 was awarded Fellowship of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) for Meritorious Contributions to Clinical Practice. The Racehorse A Veterinary Manual Pieter H.L. Ramzan ISBN 9780367428310 June 2, 2023 392 Pages 355 Color Illustrations Subject: Veterinary Pieter H.L. Ramzan the author of The Racehorse: A Veterinary Manual 2e, explores the importance of his new book in the veterinary filed. Throughout my time in racehorse practice, it became an increasing source of frustration that there was no 'go-to' veterinary resource available for vets and others involved in caring for racehorses. The assessment and management of orthopaedic conditions were frequently more a function of the individual experience and expertise of the treating clinician rather than 'best-practice' guidelines and, in consequence, career outcomes of Thoroughbred athletes could vary markedly depending on local advice. Given the importance of Thoroughbred racing across the world and the great depth of collective knowledge relating to this fine animal, it was clear that racehorse sports medicine deserved a decent veterinary textbook of its own. While racehorse conditions have always been given (frequently marginal) space in heavy veterinary tomes, nowhere could one find a single, concise resource for this very particular equine athlete in the style of the many excellent textbooks available to human sports clinicians. Since the publication of the first edition, there have been profound changes in the public perception of horseracing, with racing regulators responding to this challenge by putting the health and wellbeing of racehorses at the top of their priority lists. Early detection of injury through the development and application of new diagnostic imaging modalities (such as PET and CT) and the introduction of injury risk screening programmes have led both to a greater understanding of some important conditions, and to advances in veterinary care. Likewise, there have been important developments in key areas such as the management of upper airway dysfunction, and a deepening of expertise (and interest) in the sphere of pre-purchase risk assessment of juvenile and mature racehorses. A second edition of The Racehorse has provided the opportunity to expand on these developments as well as to update and enhance both the textual and image-based offering of the publication, with many new figures and diagnostic images being introduced. The most challenging part of writing The Racehorse has been reviewing all the available scientific literature (both equine and human) relating to each condition, synthesising this with empirical knowledge (shared by colleagues from across the globe) and condensing all this information into a concise format that can be easily accessed by the reader. The finished result, particularly some of the point-form summaries and charts relating to musculoskeletal injuries, belies the huge effort that has gone into whittling a large body of information down to the pertinent (and accurate) facts. The background literature review encompassed a diverse range of resources including research papers, textbooks, industry publications, and conference proceedings, and has taken many months for each edition. 7While time-consuming, the process has brought its own rewards and I certainly now have a deeper understanding of the evidence base which underlies much of what we do as equine clinicians and the aspects of veterinary medicine which have the greatest scope for advancement and improvement. As the textbook covers all aspects of racehorse sports medicine it is difficult to single out any one section! However, Chapters 6 and 7 comprehensively cover pretty much all the musculoskeletal conditions that anyone might ever expect to encounter in racehorses and will naturally be the part of the book most consulted by readers. The format of these chapters is intended to impart an understanding of why different injuries occur, and to be a ready reference for the best routes to diagnosis (including relevant images) and treatment as well as guidelines on prognosis. Improving the way injuries are diagnosed and treated, such that individual racehorses achieve the best possible outcome to their careers, was the driving motivation behind this section in particular. Horseracing has been intertwined with human culture for centuries and, in consequence, it is a global and thriving sport that can be found across North and South America, the Middle East, Asia, Oceania and southern Africa in addition to Ireland, continental Europe and the UK. In the 21st century, there is interdependence between Thoroughbred racing jurisdictions at many levels (competition, breeding, ownership). Indeed, it is commonplace for horses to start life on one continent, be reared and trained in another, and compete across international borders as a mature racehorses. While training techniques and racing conditions vary in different regions, the genetic uniformity of the Thoroughbred athlete and the tasks demanded of it mean that the challenges confronted by veterinary clinicians caring for them are in many respects universal across borders. Many racehorse vets also conduct their professional duties across borders. The Racehorse was written very much with this universality in mind, as a resource for people working with Thoroughbred racehorses wherever they may be in the world. While some jurisdictions have long-established centres of veterinary excellence serving as hubs of specialist expertise for their respective racing industries, others are still on a path in which frontline clinicians and racehorse trainers could benefit greatly from the readily accessible veterinary information provided in The Racehorse. Regions such as the Middle East and some parts of Asia (such as China, South Korea and India) are good examples, and guidance on appropriate management of veterinary conditions is regularly sought by clinicians and training staff from these countries. Although clearly intended to be a racehorse-specific textbook, it should be noted that many of the conditions covered in The Racehorse are also encountered in other athletic horses, and that the format of the book (and the information that it presents-both textual and image-based) is distinctive enough within the veterinary publishing sector that vets and horse- owners outside of horseracing may find it a valuable resource. 8Robert Fried co-author of The Omega-Factor, explains how a high Omega-3 fatty acids diet could save your life. The Omega-Factor Promoting Health, Preventing Premature Aging and Reducing the Risk of Sudden Cardiac Death ISBN 9781032409412 March 21, 2023 202 Pages 11 Color & 3 B/W Illustrations Subject: Nutrition and Health Robert Fried, PhD is a cardiovascular physiologist and NY State Licensed Clinical Psychologist. He is Emeritus Professor, doctoral faculty in Behavioral Neurosciences, City University of New York (CUNY). Richard M. Carlton, MD is an integrative physician who includes complementary and alternative approaches in the treatment of numerous medical problems, including migraines, inflammatory bowel disease, and diabetes.If you subscribe to the high omega-3 fatty acids (FA) nutrition plan and the heart-health advice detailed in our book, it could significantly lower your risk of heart disease, keep you generally healthier, slow your aging, and prolong your life. Medical authorities reporting this are cited in the book. In Spain, for instance, where a high omega-3 FA diet prevails, people eat more fish and less red meat than we do in the US, and they live an average of four years longer. In Okinawa with a similar high omega-3 FA diet, there are more centenarians per capita than in the US. Yet they have the same cardiovascular and heart risks as we do. Fish are the primary source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (FA) mainly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). There is another important omega-3 FA, alpha linolenic acid (ALA), found in flaxseeds. I caught this arctic charr\u2014chock full of omega-3s\u2014some years ago in Lake Hazen, Canadian Northwest Territory (CNWT), the northernmost landmass in the world and the stepping-off point to the North Pole. But, you don't actually have to go that far. Our book will teach you all about how to harvest the life saving and health preserving benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, and the equally important omega-6s that are found in meats, nuts and some vegetable oils, at your local grocery store or supermarket. Source Alan SL Wong. httpswww.pinterest.comjeniferholly ocean-food-web]9Omega-Nothing, the Diet of Our Paleolithic Hunter/Scrounger Ancestors Contrary to common belief, our Paleolithic ancestors had actually a very poor, low-omega-3 FA diet of seeds, berries and occasional red meat. One of their few sources of omega-3s was crickets! Evidence of dietary omega-3 FA is first found in Neanderthals who lived along the coast of Spain about 30,000 years ago. The first ancestors to be most like us, they ate fish and especially shellfish and mollusks, high in omega-3s. From there on, we evolved rapidly because, for one thing, omega-3s are essential to brain development: About 30% of our brain is comprised of omega-3 fatty acids. If chimpanzees ate shellfish instead of bananas, they'd be as smart as we are by now. Crickets, anyone? Fish don't actually make EPA and DHA omega-3 FA. They are produced by mini marine plant life\u2014diverse free-floating planktons. Crustaceans eat planktons; small fish eat crustaceans; larger fish eat small fish and so on up the food chain all the way to seals and whales. The latter two are, however, unlikely to appear on our dinner plate. The American Medical Association (AMA) underscores the importance of regular consumption of fish to prevent heart disease and heart attack recurrence\u2014a likely event\u2014and also omega-6 fatty acids found in soybeans, safflower and sunflower oil, nuts and seed and red meats, poultry and eggs, likewise essential to heart health. The Omega-6/Omega-3 Ratio Just as most health-conscious people will have read about the Paleolithic Diet by now, so also will they have heard about the Omega-6/Omega-3 ratio. It is said that a healthy diet consists of foods that result in a near 4:1 ratio. But this ratio is an epiphenomenon of anthropology describing the diet of various populations over time and it has little relevance to what's on your dinner plate because you can't actually calculate it on a meal by meal basis. What it is most important for you to remember is that you need both omega-6 and omega-3 FA and that you need more 3s than 6s. The book shows you how to do that and how to find out if you are on target. Our new book, The Omega-Factor, explains why a Mediterranean Diet Plan enriched with omega-3 FA is health and youth protective and we supply a six-day meal plan with recipes that will substantially improve body levels of omega-3s. Here, we help readers to understand the differences between various sources of omega-3 FA namely fish vs flaxseed vs algae-derived oils, and why these maintain health and flexibility of blood vessels and improve heart function. The book also details a number of simple to do \"at-home tests\": Where to purchase the \"Omega-3 Index\" (Omegaquant\u00ae) test to assess body levels of omega-3s, that can give you many years of early warning so that you can take preventive steps and decrease the odds of a heart attack, stroke or kidney disease. We described a do-it-at-home version of the Ankle/Brachial Index test using the ratio of measures of blood pressure at the arm and lower leg to detect early signs of atherosclerosis. Omega-3 FA prevent atherosclerosis. We detail the use of a popular finger pulse oximeter with pulse waveform to determine the \"compliance\" (flexibility) of your blood vessels. Omega-3s preserve and enhance \"compliance\" thus lowering blood pressure. You can do all these, and more, at home, at little cost. At the Root of the Main Benefits of a High Omega-3 FA Diet\u2014Antioxidants An omega-3 FA rich-diet is the ultimate antioxidant. We know now that all chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, blood vessel diseased including stroke, Type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease start with chronic inflammation caused by unopposed \"free radicals\" produced in our body by our own metabolism. Our metabolism distorts oxygen molecules into a toxic damaging form, free radicals, that mix with fats, sugars and proteins in the body to form, what science calls, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS).\" ROS chew through our tissues and organs causing our immune system to retaliate with inflammation. And then, we increase those ROS with exposure to sun rays, air pollution, cigarette smoke, and countless other sources of \"exogenous\" free radicals. Both Omega-3 and to some extent omega-6 FA\u2014but mostly omega-3s\u2014can limit the inflammation due to free radicals that underlies these severe chronic and often fatal diseases. Learning and implementing the information in this book could save your life. I consume a large portion of raw (sushi-safe) salmon, three times a week, and so far, I am doing pretty well.... 10 IN CONVERSATION WITH Catherine A. Gorini the author of Geometry for the Artist, about her new book. Catherine A. Gorini is a professor of mathematics at Maharishi International University (MIU) in Fairfield, Iowa, where she has taught for over forty years and served as dean of the faculty and dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. Geometry for the Artist ISBN 9780367628253 May 26, 2023 256 Pages 244 Color Illustrations Subject: Geometry Do artists really use geometry? Frank Stella declared there is no art without geometry. Every branch of visual expression relies on shape and form. So whether an artist is schooled in geometry or uses their own geometric intuition, they are using geometry all the time. In fact, artists were developing and using many areas of geometry, including symmetry, perspective, and fractals, well before mathematicians understood them. And artists use every aspect of geometry, often in unique and unexpected ways, ways that a geometer would hardly imagine. What does this book cover? And how do artists use the concepts that you present? The main topics are symmetry, perspective, Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry, fractals, and topology. Symmetry. All over the world, one can find symmetric designs and patterns of every kind. Artists use symmetry when they want to convey a feeling of balance and orderliness and even, in the case of symmetric bands or tilings, a feeling of infinity. The mathematics of symmetry explains the structure of designs and patterns and gives artists ways to create new designs and patterns. Interestingly, artists found and used all possible two-dimensional patterns well before mathematicians proved those patterns were all that could exist. Perspective. Perspective is the most common area of geometry that people associate with art. Artists use geometric techniques to ensure that a two- dimensional representation of a three-dimensional scene looks exactly like what the artist saw. Viewers use geometric techniques to determine where the artist was located when they created the painting. M.C. Escher, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, and others who thoroughly comprehend the rules of perspective find ways to go outside the rules to create deceptive pictures that confound and delight the viewer. Euclidean geometry. The lines, circles, triangles, and squares of Euclidean geometry appear everywhere in art. Conic sections and other curves are indispensable for artists. In addition, the rules of ratio and proportion are essential for drawing a well-proportioned human figure. Non-Euclidean geometry. Geometry on a curved surface, such as a sphere or a saddle, is called non-Euclidean to contrast with Euclidean geometry, the geometry of a flat plane. The human face shows different geometries\u2014the flatness of the brow, the roundness of the tip of the nose, and the saddle of the bridge of the nose\u2014so no one can paint even a portrait without encountering non-Euclidean geometry. 11Fractals. Fractals are intricate self-similar shapes like a fern, lightning, the branches of trees, or clouds. They have been called the \"geometry of nature.\" To paint nature, one must paint fractals. And to create natural shapes with computers, one must use fractals. Topology. Properties of shapes that do not depend on measurements of length or angle\u2014like the number of holes in a donut or pretzel\u2014are the subject of topology. These properties don't change even when the shapes are bent, stretched, or twisted as if they were made of infinitely stretchy rubber, which is why topology is called \"rubber-sheet geometry.\" If a donut were stretched, its size and measurements would change, but the existence of the hole through the donut would not change. Think about the work of El Greco, Modigliani, and Dal\u00ed, and you see applications of topology. What inspired you to write this book? I have always had a special interest in geometry, and I have always enjoyed seeing how artists use geometry. When I discovered that art teachers wanted their students to learn geometry, I started teaching a course designed specifically for art majors, Geometry for the Artist, but other students have enrolled as well. This course has developed and evolved over many years, and the need for a textbook became clear. But the real inspiration for the book has been students getting excited about seeing geometry in art and using geometry in their own work. I am continually amazed and delighted by the ways geometry appears in art and how students use it themselves. Who would be interested in this book? Anyone interested in mathematics or in art will find something engaging in this book. No formal background is required for this book. Examples of how geometry is used in art will help everyone see art in a fresh and new way. Artists can learn new ways to look at art and will discover new ideas that they can incorporate in their art. Students of mathematics will see the diversity of ways that artists have used geometrical ideas and will, I think, gain a deeper understanding of geometry. What courses is this a suitable textbook for? I use this book for a liberal arts general education course that is taken by students of every major, not just art majors. This textbook is suitable for a general education mathematics course, writing-intensive courses, or a geometry course for teacher education students. The book assumes no specific background, so a course using this as a textbook would not need prerequisites. What does the cover show? A student in my course created the pattern on the cover using ideas from symmetry and fractals. An illustration from the book, Venice: The Doge's Palace the Riva degli Schiavoni by Canaletto, with transversals, orthogonals, horizon line, and central vanishing point marked. The central vanishing point is low, giving a wide expanse of sky above that balances the activity on the plaza, and is located far to the right, allowing the viewer to see the fa\u00e7ades of the buildings facing the river. Knowing the location of these details of the painting reinforces our perception of a peaceful cityscape. 12 Christoph Scheuch is the Director of Product at the social trading platform wikifolio.com.

Patrick Weiss is a postdoctoral researcher at the Vienna University of Economics and Business and an external lecturer at Reykjav\u00edk University.Christoph Scheuch, Stefan Voigt and Patrick Weiss the authors of Tidy Finance with R, on the importance of using R in financial analysis. Empirical finance can be tedious. Many standard tasks, such as cleaning data or forming factor portfolios, require a lot of effort. The code to produce even seminal results is typically opaque. Why should researchers have to reinvent the wheel over and over again? Tidy Finance with R is our take on how to conduct empirical research in financial economics from scratch. Whether you are an industry professional looking to expand your quant skills, a graduate student diving into the finance world, or an academic researcher, this book shows you how to use R to master applications in asset pricing, portfolio optimization, risk management, and option pricing. We wrote this book to provide a comprehensive guide to using R for financial analysis. Our book collects all the tools we wish we would have had at hand at the beginning of our graduate studies in finance. Without transparent code for standard procedures, numerous replication efforts (and their failures) feel like a waste of resources. We have been there, as probably everybody working with data has. Since we kicked off our careers, we have constantly updated our methods, coding styles, and workflows. Our book reflects our lessons learned. By sharing them, we aim to help others avoid dead ends. Working on problems that countless others have already solved in secrecy is not just tedious, it even may have detrimental effects. In a recent study1 together with hundreds of research teams from across the globe, Albert J. Menkveld, the best-publishing Dutch economist according to Economentop 40, shows that without a standard path to do empirical analysis, results may vary substantially. Even if teams set out to analyze the same research question based on the same data, implementation details are important and deserve more than treatment as subtleties. There will always be multiple acceptable ways to test relevant research questions. So why should it matter that our book lifts our curtain on reproducible finance by providing a fully transparent code base for many typical financial applications? First and foremost, we hope to inspire others to make their research truly reproducible. This is not a purely theoretical exercise: our examples start with data preparation and conclude with communicating results to get readers to do empirical analysis on real data as fast as possible. 1Menkveld, A.

Understanding and agreeing on standard procedures hopefully frees up resources to focus on what matters: a novel research project, a seminar paper, or a thorough analysis for your employer. If our book helps to provide a foundation for discussions on which determinants render code useful, we have achieved much more than we were hoping for at the beginning of this project. Unlike typical stylized examples, our book starts with the problems of any serious research project. The often overlooked challenge behind empirical research may seem trivial at first glance: we need data to conduct our analyses. Finance is not an exception: raw data, often hidden behind proprietary financial data sources, requires cleaning before there is any hope of extracting valuable insights from it. While you can despise data cleaning, you cannot ignore it. We describe and provide the code to prepare typical open- source and proprietary financial data sources (e.g., CRSP , Compustat, Mergent FISD, TRACE). We reuse these data in all the subsequent chapters, which we keep as self-contained as possible. The empirical applications range from key concepts of empirical asset pricing (beta estimation, portfolio sorts, performance analysis, Fama-French factors) to modeling and machine learning applications (fixed effects estimation, clustering standard errors, difference-in-difference estimators, ridge regression, Lasso, Elastic net, random forests, neural networks) and portfolio optimization techniques.Necessarily, our book reflects our opinionated perspective on how to perform empirical analyses. From our experience as researchers and instructors, we believe in the value of the workflows we teach and apply daily. The entire book rests on two core concepts: coding principles using the tidyverse family of R packages and tidy data. We base our book entirely on the open-source programming language R. R and the tidyverse community provide established tools to perform typical data science tasks, ranging from cleaning and manipulation to plotting and modeling. R is hence the ideal environment to develop an accessible code base for future finance students. The concept of tidy data refers to organizing financial data in a structured and consistent way, allowing for easy analysis and understanding.2 Taken together, tidy data and code help achieve the ultimate goal: to provide a fundamentally human-centered experience that makes it easier to teach, learn, and replicate the code of others - or even your own!14 Jonathan Schwabish the author of Data Visualization in Excel, on how to level up your graphs in Microsoft Excel. Jonathan Schwabish is an economist and data communication expert working and living outside Washington, DC. Dr. Schwabish is considered a leader in the data visualization field and is a leading voice for clarity and accessibility in research. Dr. Schwabish is a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a non-profit research institution in Washington, DC, and is the founder of the data visualization and presentation skills firm, Policy Viz. He helps non-profits, research institutions, and governments at all levels improve how they communicate their work and findings to their colleagues, partners, clients, and constituents. Data Visualization in Excel A Guide for Beginners, Intermediates, and Wonks Jonathan Schwabish ISBN 9781032343280 May 12, 2023 400 Pages 349 Color Illustrations Subject: Computer Graphics & Visualization Have you ever scrolled past the New York Times, Washington Post, Guardian, Berliner Morgenpost, or a hundred other websites and wondered how you or your organization could improve how you communicate data? How could you or your team create the engaging graphs, charts, and diagrams found across the world? Have you instinctively concluded that the skills and tools needed to create such visualizations are just too great for you to pursue? Well, wonder no more because Data Visualization in Excel puts the power of creating better, more effective graphs and charts in your hands using the Microsoft Excel software tool. In this book, I show you how to build more than 20 \"non-standard\" graphs in Excel, graphs that are more complex than those in the standard drop-down menus\u2014and that can show your data in better and more engaging ways. Data Visualization in Excel focuses on how to extend and combine the basic graphs in the Excel charting engine; how to use Excel formulas to make your graphs and data more responsive and flexible; and how you can be more productive and efficient when working with the tool. With more than 750 million users worldwide, Excel continues to be the standard for desktop data analysis. It is relatively cheap to purchase, requires no computer programming skills, and can be used by even the most novice user. In addition to step-by-step tutorials in creating more advanced Excel graphs, this book introduces the novice user to the Excel environment, key formulas, and how to export graphs from the tool. There are a lot of data analysis and visualization tools you can use to work with and display your data. But whatever tool you use, it's important to keep in mind that it's just that: a tool. As much as I am a fan of Excel and its capabilities, it clearly can't do everything. I wouldn't use Excel to create an interactive data visualization for the Washington Post website, and I wouldn't use it for a large dataset with millions of observations. But if I need to create a basic bar chart or line chart\u2014or even some more complex charts like those found later in the book\u2014Excel might be the perfect tool for the job. With all of the data visualization tools now available, why focus on Excel? Why not explore programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and R that enable more data dense analysis and interactive data visualizations? Or dashboarding tools like PowerBI, Qlick, and Tableau that can be used to provide at-a-glance view across multiple indicators? For one, it requires time and dedication to become proficient in these other tools and languages. But more importantly, everyone has Excel and everyone can easily get started in it. Think about a small nonprofit organization staffed by six, seven, or eight people. Maybe that organization has one person who is the data person\u2014they are responsible for collecting and assembling the data, cleaning it, and making the graphs, slides, and reports. 15Maybe that person showed an interest in data visualization or maybe they were thrust into the role because, well, there wasn't really anyone else who could (or wanted to) do it. That person may not have the interest\u2014nor the time\u2014to learn another tool. That person's organization might not be able to afford other tools or might not house a huge amount of data. Or maybe that person's needs are relatively simple\u2014a good bar chart or line chart can go a long way\u2014so creating interactive dashboards or websites is not what their organization needs. Consider even a large organization home to a large team of data scientists and large amounts of data. How are they getting their analyses to their clients and stakeholders? Perhaps they do not need to build bespoke websites and mobile apps, but instead, all they need to do is simply communicate their analyses through quarterly reports, PowerPoint presentations, and memos. Excel may be their best solution to their data communication needs. While Excels' data visualization library has significantly expanded since it was introduced in 1985, at its core, it is still a drag-and- drop tool. On the one hand, that simple functionality makes it more accessible because anyone can open it up, type in some data, and start making something. On the other hand, the tool is limited by what is in the drop-down menus and what is in the library of options. This book's tutorials and the accompanying Excel files show you how to incorporate key formulas into your datasets to set up, create, and style effective data visualizations that are more reproducible, scalable, and reliable.Excel, with its relatively low price point and low barrier to entry, makes it a prime tool for creating useful and effective data visualizations for organizations in every sector and of every size. The approach to Excel demonstrated in this book will show you and your team that you can create great, effective visualizations without having to lean on an entire suite of data visualization tools. 16 Nello Cristianini the author of The Shortcut: Why intelligent machines do not think like us, explores the topic of living with intelligent machines. Nello Cristianini is a Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bath. He has been an active researcher in artificial intelligence for over 25 years, making contributions to the theory of machine learning, to bioinformatics, the digital humanities and various other areas. He is the co-author of two influential books on learning algorithms, and currently he is working on the philosophical challenges posed by AI to society. Cristianini holds a degree in physics from the University of Trieste, a Masters in computational intelligence from the University of London and a PhD from the University of Bristol. Previously he was a Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bristol, an Associate Professor at the University of California, Davis, and held visiting positions at other universities. The Shortcut Why Intelligent Machines Do Not Think Like Us Nello Cristianini ISBN 9781032305097 March 8, 2023 186 Pages 1 B/W Illustrations Subject: Artificial Intelligence So, we built intelligent machines and we use them every day. Was it worth it? Are we going to regret it? A lot will depend on what we do next: how we adapt to them, how much power we give them, and even how we think about them. This is currently the main challenge: we do not seem to have the right tools to think correctly about intelligent artefacts, and this is hampering our efforts to make them safe. Lady Lovelace, the Victorian computer pioneer, used to say that computers can only do \"what we know how to order them to do\" , but from the exploits of AlphaGo we see them do things that we cannot explain, and do them much better than us. Artificial Intelligence, the science and art of creating autonomous and adaptive goal-driven machines, has taken a decisive turn away from human-like cognition, and towards a very effective form of thinking that is rooted in statistical patterns and vast quantities of data. Our artefacts are so different from us that they may as well be aliens. There is little chance of translating their knowledge and motivations in human terms, and this is making people anxious. As we delegate to these machines a growing amount of decisions, some of which are very consequential, we still do not know how to think about their alien form of intelligence. At the same time, AI has also found its way to the very core of our infrastructures, and it is no longer realistic to consider going back to a world without it. It would not be recommendable either. So the question that is left for us to face is: how can we share the world with our intelligent creatures, ensuring that we can benefit from their help without reducing our safety, autonomy and dignity? In other words, how do we trust intelligent machines? The answer will come from changing the way we think about intelligence, understanding that this is not exclusive to humanity, and that language and logical reasoning are not necessary requisites for it. In fact, intelligent behaviour can be observed in a range of organisms, and even organisations, and artefacts: just not of the type that we see in people. Consider the recommender agents that populate the pages of our social media or video sharing apps. They compile a personalised shortlist of options based on our past activities, and on those of myriad other users, in a way that is intended to maximise our \"engagement\" . This decision is informed by hundreds of \"signals\" the agent can observe about us and the videos, and by a statistical analysis of what is most likely to engage our attention. What are the effects of long-term exposure to these agents, in terms of both personal and social wellbeing? Some suspect that polarisation could emerge as a result of echo chambers in the news feeds, formed by these agents, while others worry that emotional wellbeing and self-control problems can result as a consequence of this interaction. The truth is that we still do not have clear and strong scientific evidence, and this should be concerning everybody. 17At the same time, we also started devolving some high-stake decisions to our machines, including some that may determine access to opportunities such as jobs, financing, education, and healthcare. How do we make sure that nobody's legal rights are violated by mistake? Legal regulation of AI technologies is necessary and urgent, but it should be based on a solid understanding of their effects on users and society, and this is currently an important open research problem. Regulation will also need to start from the understanding that we are not regulating a human-like type of agent, and therefore our expectations and demands need to reflect the specific form of intelligence that we are dealing with. For example, it will not be easy to obtain explanations from the current machines, to justify their decisions. A new philosophical understanding of intelligent agents still needs to find its way to the general public, and even policy makers. The complex interactions between science, technology, culture and society are not a detail in this new type of AI, they are part of its core. The next big challenge for AI will take place at the interface between the social, human and natural sciences. Scholars from a variety of disciplines, and journalists, and lawmakers, have joined the quest to understand and regulate the alien form of intelligence that is emerging from the interaction between algorithms and human behaviour. For the general public, it is time to let go of what we remember from the narratives of science fiction, or from the marketing hype of digital companies. For the engineers it is time to focus more on the philosophical foundations of the discipline, probably not what many expected to do. But here is my promise: along the way we can learn a lot about ourselves, rediscover beautiful disciplines such as Cybernetics, connect modern technology with many classical themes of the philosophy of science. We can learn from looking closely at how business models influence the growth of science, and how values struggle to keep up, and this will leave us stronger and safer. Making intelligent agents safe will require a much deeper understanding of the interplay between social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences, and cannot be done by computer scientists alone. This is the next big challenge, and adventure, for AI. 18 IN CONVERSATION WITH Clay Biles the author of How to Stop a Hijacking, on the civil aviation security. Clay W. Biles is a former US Federal Air Marshal and inflight security instructor. Biles joined the Federal Air Marshal Service in 2008 and flew more than 1 million miles on international and domestic flights. Biles resigned in 2013 and founded High Order Security, a company that assists at-risk personnel in Latin America. How to Stop a Hijacking Critical Thinking in Civil Aviation Security Clay W. Biles ISBN 9781032373003 April 7, 2023 280 Pages Subject: Security Studies You are former military and served as an air marshal. What is your security background and training? I went into the Navy in 1994 and spent two years training as a SEAL. But, I was immature and got in a lot of trouble so the Navy showed me the door in 1996. I was studying in college when the 9/11 attacks happened, and a rear admiral helped me get back into the SEAL teams. I served for three years at SEAL team three, received an honorable discharge, and then started performing contract security overseas for the US government. This began with providing protective security for the President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, alongside other former special forces personnel and diplomatic security agents from the US Department of State. I eventually found my way to the federal air marshal service in 2008. I was sent to instructor training in 2010 and spent two years providing training to air marshals at the San Francisco field office and as an adjunct instructor at the federal air marshal training center in Atlantic City, New Jersey. I resigned in 2013 and started a security company in California that I moved to Mexico for. I ran teams throughout Latin America that performed protective security work for the CEOs of companies like Oracle and Fisher Investments. I also had the opportunity to analyze and report on a criminal case as an expert witness, for the federal court in Utah, that involved a 2012 incident with a team of federal air marshals. Eventually the Covid pandemic had an impact on my business, so I decided to put my business on hold and go back to college. I am currently a student of Women's and Gender Studies at Saint Mary's College of California. I plan to go to law school next. You mentioned 9/11, since that event the world in general, but the U.S. in particular, has lived through a time of heightened security\u2014to the point where it's raised everyone's awareness and permeated so many aspects of our daily lives to an unprecedented extent. What are your thoughts on this as well as your motivation to write this book? It is amazing to me that, although we were all impacted in such a dramatic way by the violence of the 9/11 attacks, the training that flight attendants and armed law enforcement officers receive today is no better at preparing them to deal with threats inside the aircraft than it was on September 11, 2001. Compared to the hundreds of air marshals who fly daily in the United States, 19there are thousands of armed law enforcement officers who do the same. Not to mention the flight attendants who are on every flight to keep passengers safe, as mandated by law. Unfortunately, armed law enforcement officers who fly armed have never been provided with information that would help them combat violence in the air, should they be faced with it. They could be utilized as an asset in the event an emergency, though\u2014to my knowledge\u2014this has never been considered. Now, air marshals receive some computer-based training from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) that allows them to carry a firearm inside the aircraft, but they receive no tactical training. While I was flying around the world as an air marshal, I always thought that our training and tactics should be provided to flight attendants and armed law enforcement officers traveling by air. I wrote How to Stop a Hijacking specifically for first responders in civil aviation, like flight attendants and those law enforcement officers who fly armed. Interestingly, the TSA vetted a version of my book only a few years ago and had redacted a lot of the material; fortunately, this year (2022) the TSA reviewed the book again and allowed all of the previously redacted material to go forward to publication; I'm assuming this is due to such previously redacted material having since gone, into public domain through news articles and otherwise released information. This is a great opportunity for first responders in civil aviation and I am grateful to the TSA, to my editor Mark, and to CRC Press for helping to make this happen. The information in this book will undoubtedly help first responders make decisions inside the aircraft that will help protect the integrity of the aircraft and provide a safer environment for everyone on board. I hope that someday every flight attendant, frequent-flying law enforcement officer, and first responder in civil aviation (both on the ground and in the air) will receive a copy of this book. Critical thinking in aviation security is only possible when first responders have the information they need to make those critical decisions. My new book provides that information.You mentioned the audience you had in mind for the book, is there anything in particular that you want people to take away from it? Yes, while the main audience that I had in mind when writing this book was first responders in civil aviation, such as flight attendants and law enforcement officers who fly armed. Now I realize that this book could be helpful to all first responders in civil aviation, because it will help them think critically about the aviation domain and the specific ways that criminals and terrorists plan and execute attacks against aircraft and airports. It also teaches first responders how to respond like an air marshal to threats in civil aviation. This is all valuable information and so, I don't think there is any one particular thing in the book that I hope first responders take away: it is all equally valuable information that has the potential to save lives both in the air and on the ground.20 Cosmic Ray Physics An Introduction to The Cosmic Laboratory VERONICA BINDI MERCEDES PANICCIA MARTIN POHL What exactly is this stardust that we call cosmic rays? Charged particles which constantly rain down on the Earth. Causing showers which penetrate all the way down to the ground and beyond. Such that they influence the evolution of life, weather and climate in the biosphere. And are a deadly threat to technology and humans in space. This book documents the answers that cosmic ray physics can provide today, in the light of up-to-date experimental findings. It starts out with a brief history of this branch of physics, from early research on \"air electricity\" to today's precision experiments on ground, underground and in space. The major contributions of pioneers are covered, establishing the extra-terrestrial origin and particle nature of cosmic radiation. Breakthroughs in technology have led to an ever-increasing richness and precision of data, providing us with precious knowledge about this important part of our environment. During more than hundred years of research, the role of cosmic rays has thus changed: from being a major source of high-energy particles to becoming themselves the focus of intense research. Research on the sources, accelerators and transport mechanisms of particles throughout the cosmos, the Milky Way and the solar system, all the way to us. After a short resum\u00e9 of the gross features of cosmic rays and the major observables, the book draws up a top-down description of the life cycle of cosmic rays. It starts out with a discussion of the production of cosmic ray particles, which ranges from the aftermath of the Big Bang, through synthesis of elements in stars, to explosive events at their end of life. More speculative sources of particles - like dark matter annihilation and decay, or antimatter left over from the Big Bang - are also discussed. Different acceleration mechanisms can take cosmic rays from thermal energies to the fabulous ones that are observed, many orders of magnitude greater than anything man-made particle accelerators can ever hope to achieve. Their voyage through interstellar matter and fields is then covered, transforming elements, changing their energy and making them lose memory of where they came from. All through the life cycle of cosmic rays, photons and neutrinos witness the various mechanisms at work. In contrast to charged particles, they are not scrambled by the ubiquitous magnetic fields present at all scales. The book thus shortly summarizes what can be learned from these messengers, which are pointing back to where they come from. Cosmic Ray Physics reverses gear and discusses what happens to cosmic rays on three scales: in the heliosphere, in the Milky Way and in the cosmos at large. The Sun is itself a source of particles, mostly with energies below what is required to reach Earth, but occasionally also above. Interplay between the solar and the terrestrial magnetic field guides interplanetary plasma. It causes the beautiful ephemeral aurorae observable near the poles. But it also intervenes now and again with air traffic and power distribution. As far as cosmic rays from outside are concerned, it modulates their flux at low energies in a major way. ISBN 9781032020013 March 27, 2023 336 Pages 216 B/W Illustrations Subject: AstrophysicsPHYSICS 2023 HIGHLIGHT21Up to an energy limit which is not very precisely defined, the bulk of cosmic rays is confined to our own galaxy, the Milky Way. A major chapter of the book is devoted to their properties. Both the elemental composition and the energy spectrum of each species offer surprising features. They challenge the current paradigm, which says that galactic cosmic rays are produced and accelerated in supernovae explosions and share a very similar fate during their confinement. This would lead to a universal spectral shape which is not observed. Characteristic differences exist between primary species - those which arrive from their source unaltered - and secondary ones, which are produced along the way. Different approaches and models to understand these are discussed in the chapter. Potential signals for unconventional sources of galactic cosmic rays are also covered, like annihilation or decay of dark matter particles or small residues of antimatter in the Milky Way. Above the confinement energy, cosmic rays become too rare to be observed in situ, by balloon or space borne detectors. Instead, giant ground-based observatories use the atmosphere as a particle detector. Covering many square kilometers in area, they extend the observable energy range to the extragalactic domain. New sources and accelerator types like gamma ray burst, active galactic nuclei and starburst galaxies become accessible. The cost is that less detailed knowledge about the observed particle types is available. The book covers spectra and composition data from major hybrid detectors, which use at least two of the basic experimental techniques, surface arrays, air fluoresce cameras and underground muon detectors. Again, no simple picture results. Important features are exposed, like the transition between galactic and extragalactic fluxes, as well as the cut-off at the highest energies ever observed. The last chapter of the book is devoted to an optimistic outlook into the medium- and long-term future of this field. Important upgrades of existing observatories are under way or planned. Ambitious new facilities to increase the scope and depth of cosmic day research have been proposed. There is thus no loss in momentum after more than a hundred years of cosmic ray physics.

LAPLANTE What Every Engineer Should Know About Data-Driven Analytics is a comprehensive introduction to the machine learning theoretical concepts and approaches that are widely used in predictive data analytics. Using machine learning we can build predictive models that can be used to mine patterns from large datasets. Such models can also be tailored to reason on why it sees a particular pattern in the dataset. Mining large datasets from different domains (healthcare, financial, sports, manufacturing, social media, advertisement etc.) needs a different type of mindset and skillset for predictive model building. This textbook offers a detailed and focused treatment of the important machine learning approaches and concepts that can be exploited to build models to enable decision making in different domains. The theoretical concepts and approaches in machine language are further illustrated by numerous practical applications in the form of worked examples using the R statistical computing language. Interesting and informative sidebar discussions provide additional applications and historical context to many of the key concepts. Through many examples the book demonstrates how to go from data, to insight, to decision making. Each examples takes a unique approach to build models that exploits different algorithms. In addition he authors present techniques used for validating and evaluating the predictive models. The topics covered include techniques for data collection and cleaning, background in mathematics, statistics and probability for predictive analytics, regression techniques and strategies for regularization, supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, natural language processing strategies for analyzing unstructured data and performing sentiment/emotion classifications, deep neural architectures such as convolutional and recurrent networks for image and text analytics, recommendation systems and strategies for architecting customized Big Data analytical pipeline for predictive analytics. This book is intended for professional data engineers, software engineers, systems engineers, and senior and graduate students of analytics and Artificial Intelligence. Much of the material is derived from the graduate-level \"Data Analytics\" course taught at Penn State's Great Valley School of Graduate and Professional Studies and online through its World Campus, where the authors work.

Hands-On Data Science for Librarians Sarah Lin and Dorris Scott ISBN 9781032080826 April 18, 2023 207 Pages 35 Color & 33 B/W Illustrations Subject: Mathematics & Statistics www.routledge.com/9781032080826 Librarians understand the need to store, use and analyze data related to their collection, patrons and institution, and there has been consistent interest over the last 10 years to improve data management, analysis, and visualization skills within the profession. However, librarians find it difficult to move from out-of-the-box proprietary software applications to the skills necessary to perform the range of data science actions in code. This book will focus on teaching R through relevant examples and skills that librarians need in their day-to-day lives that includes visualizations but goes much further to include web scraping, working with maps, creating interactive reports, machine learning, and others. While there's a place for theory, ethics, and statistical methods, librarians need a tool to help them acquire enough facility with R to utilize data science skills in their daily work, no matter what type of library they work at (academic, public or special). By walking through each skill and its application to library work before walking the reader through each line of code, this book will support librarians who want to apply data science in their daily work. Hands-On Data Science for Librarians is intended for librarians (and other information professionals) in any library type (public, academic or special) as well as graduate students in library and information science (LIS). Key Features: Only data science book available geared toward librarians that includes step-by-step code examples Examples include all library types (public, academic, special) Relevant datasets Accessible to non-technical professionals Focused on job skills and their applications31 Sigrid Keydana is an Applied Researcher at Posit (formerly RStudio, PBC).

He co-initiated openEO, an open source software ecosystem around a language neutral API for analyzing very large data cubes and image collections. Roger Bivand is a geographer, emeritus professor of the Department of Economics of the Norwegian School of Economics, Bergen, Norway, has worked with spatial autocorrelation since the 1970's, and is a Fellow of the Spatial Econometrics Association. Spatial Data Science introduces fundamental aspects of spatial data that every data scientist should know before they start working with spatial data. These aspects include how geometries are represented, coordinate reference systems (projections, datums), the fact that the Earth is round and its consequences for analysis, and how attributes of geometries can relate to geometries. In the second part of the book, these concepts are illustrated with data science examples using the R language. In the third part, statistical modelling approaches are demonstrated using real world data examples. After reading this book, a number of major spatial data analysis errors should no longer be made because of lack of knowledge. The book gives a detailed explanation of the core spatial software packages for R: sf for simple feature access, and stars for raster and vector data cubes - array data with spatial and temporal dimensions. It also shows how geometrical operations change when going from a flat space to the surface of a sphere, which is what sf and stars use when coordinates are not projected (degrees longitude/latitude). Separate chapters detail a variety of plotting approaches for spatial maps using R, and different ways of handling very large vector or raster (imagery) datasets, locally, in databases, or in the cloud. The data used and all code examples are freely available online from https://r-spatial.org/book/.

Geographic Data Science with Python introduces a new way of thinking about analysis, by using geographical and computational reasoning, it shows the reader how to unlock new insights hidden within data. Key Features: Showcases the excellent data science environment in Python. Provides examples for readers to replicate, adapt, extend, and improve. Covers the crucial knowledge needed by geographic data scientists. It presents concepts in a far more geographic way than competing textbooks, covering spatial data, mapping, and spatial statistics whilst covering concepts, such as clusters and outliers, as geographic concepts. Intended for data scientists, GIScientists, and geographers, the material provided in this book is of interest due to the manner in which it presents geospatial data, methods, tools, and practices in this new field.34 Luke Austen graduated from the University of Oxford in 2018 and is a UK Core Trainee in Anaesthetics. The Bleep Test How New Doctors Can Get Things Right Luke Austen ISBN 9781032422374 May 12, 2023 244 Pages 12 B/W Illustrations Subject: General Medicine www.routledge.com/9781032422374 What does it mean to help save someone's life? How does it feel to nearly kill a patient? Can we keep our patients safe at night? In the face of overwhelming pressures, can we thrive or only survive? And is a happy life as a doctor still possible? In the early months and years of work, it is these kinds of questions, rather than any technical or knowledge-based queries, which preoccupy many new doctors. This elusive, hidden curriculum is pervasive within departments, around hospitals and across health systems, but is rarely, if ever, explicitly examined and discussed. At its core is the issue that should matter above all others - how we can keep our patients as safe as possible. The Bleep Test combines gripping and startlingly vulnerable recollections of early experiences on the wards with an array of research findings, from psychology and human biology to anthropology, business and behavioural economics. Acknowledging that the truly complex challenges facing new doctors lie far beyond the realms of the traditional medical sciences in which they were trained, the book explains that the shift to being a doctor depends on first understanding how we think, reason and behave as someone we have been all our lives - a human amongst humans. Focused on the experiences of, and the issues facing, recently qualified medics, The Bleep Test is not only for young doctors, but also for anyone who manages them, works with them, cares for them or may one day depend on them.35 ISBN 9781032284323 May 12, 2023 308 Pages 6 B/W Illustrations Subject: General Medicine www.routledge.com/9781032284323Every Doctor Healthier Doctors = Healthier Patient, 2nd Edition Leanne Rowe, Vihangi Abeygunawardana and Michael Kidd Leanne Rowe General Practitioner and past Deputy Chancellor, Monash University, Australia.

Hancock John T. Hancock is Professor of Cell Signalling at the University of the West of England, Bristol (UWE), UK. He has authored several editions of a textbook, Cell Signalling, where the processes of how cells perceive and respond to their environment is discussed. John also has several editorial positions for international journals, and is Editor-in-Chief of the journal Oxygen.Why Elephants Cry is a fascinating frolic through the literature and evidence surrounding the use of unusual behavior of animals to measure and predict the environment. The role of animals, from the smallest ant to the biggest elephant, as predictors of environmental changes is framed around the climate crisis, which highlights the increasingly important part that animals will have to play in the future. Renowned biologist Professor John T. Hancock collects anecdotal stories and myths along with scientific evidence, demonstrating that observation of animals can be of tangible use. He looks at the measurement of the air temperature using ants, crickets and snakes, and goes on to assess the evidence that the observation of a wide range of animals can predict the weather or the imminent eruption of volcanoes and earthquakes. Evidence of animals being able to predict lunar and solar events, such as lunar cycles and the Northern Lights, is also considered. This is the only time that all this literature has been brought together in one place, a fascinating reference for anybody interested in animals and the environment. The book is also an ideal supplementary textbook for students studying animal behaviour.41 Dr. G.R.

Robinson ISBN 9781032455464 April 14, 2023 296 Pages 35 B/W Illustrations Subject: Physics www.routledge.com/9781032455464 This book offers readers an entirely original and unconventional view of quantum mechanics. It is a view that accepts quantum mechanics as the natural way to think about the way nature works, rather than the view commonly expressed, especially in books on quantum physics, that quantum theory is weird and counterintuitive. It is based on the concept of itemization. From this simple premise, quantities like energy and momentum, both linear and angular emerge naturally, as do configuration space, potentials, the electromagnetic field, many-body dynamics, special relativity and relativistic wave mechanics. The many-body dynamics, because it is not tied to physics from the outset, can be applied to population dynamics outside physics as well as the usual physical situations. From this emerges much of the basic physics that describes, mathematically, how the natural world behaves. This accessible introduction does not require exotic maths, and is aimed at inquisitive physics students and professionals who are interested in exploring unconventional approaches to physics. It may also be of interest to anyone studying quantum information theory or quantum computing.49 Dr. John Morgan is internationally recognized for his work in forensic science, body armor, special operations technology, and police technology.

All species have a net positive effect on their environment, other species, and diversity. No species evolves in isolation, and most evolution is coevolution. The nature and number of links between species are as important as species number. Eukaryotes coevolve with complex ecosystems of microbes with which they exchange genes. Genomes and intraspecific interactions both act to promote evolution and diversification. Viruses increase diversity of their hosts and cause macroevolutionary transitions. more information, visit: www.routledge.com/9781032158020 Dummy text to and more information, visit: www.routledge.com/9781032465395 The Developing Brain and its Connections Oribatid Mites Lynne M.

It is a view that accepts quantum mechanics as the natural way to think about the way nature works, rather than the view commonly expressed, especially in books on quantum physics, that quantum theory is weird and counterintuitive. It is based on the concept of itemization. From this simple premise, quantities like energy and momentum, both linear and angular emerge naturally, as do configuration space, potentials, the electromagnetic field, many-body dynamics, special relativity and relativistic wave mechanics.
