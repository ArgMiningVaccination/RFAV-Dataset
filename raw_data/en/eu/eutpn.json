An expert panel told federal officials late Monday that AstraZeneca \"may have included outdated information\" in a press release announcing results from a trial of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, the NIH said. The drug maker announced Monday in a press release and call with reporters that its vaccine candidate [demonstrated an overall efficacy of 79%](https://www.healio.com/news/infectious-disease/20210322/astrazeneca-vaccine-79-effective-in-us-trial-with-no-identified-safety-concerns) against symptomatic disease from COVID-19 and was completely protective against severe disease or hospitalization. Anthony S. Fauci, MD, who heads the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he was copied on a \"rather harsh note\" written by the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) to AstraZeneca saying that the company had made conclusions about the efficacy data included in the press release that \"were somewhat outdated and might in fact be misleading a bit and wanted them to straighten it out.\" Around midnight, the NIAID issued a [press release](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/niaid-statement-astrazeneca-vaccine) that \"essentially told the company they better get back with the DSMB and make sure that the correct data get put into a press release,\" Fauci [said](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/video/fauci-discusses-concerns-oxfordastrazeneca-vaccine-data-76626319) on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" In the release, the NIAID said the DSMB sent notes to the NIAID, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and AstraZeneca \"[expressing] concern that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data.\" According to [details of the letter reported by The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/astrazeneca-oxford-vaccine-concerns/2021/03/23/2f931d34-8bc3-11eb-a33e-da28941cb9ac_story.html), the DSMB wrote that the data AstraZeneca \"chose to release was the most favorable for the study as opposed to the most recent and most complete.\" The DSMB saw data showing that the vaccine may be 69% to 74% effective and \"strongly recommended\" that AstraZeneca include that information in the press release, according to the Post report. \"This is really what you call an unforced error,\" Fauci said. \"The fact is, this is very likely a very good vaccine, and this kind of thing does nothing but really cast some doubt about the vaccines and maybe contribute to hesitancy. If you look at it, the data really are quite good. When they put it into the press release, it wasn't completely accurate.\" The data reported Monday by AstraZeneca were from a trial conducted primarily in the United States. The overall efficacy number was higher than the average efficacy for the vaccine [reported from trials](https://www.healio.com/news/infectious-disease/20201123/covid19-vaccine-developed-by-astrazeneca-oxford-is-up-to-90-efficacious) in the United Kingdom and Brazil last year. In a [statement](https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2021/update-following-statement-by-niaid-on-azd1222-us-phase-iii-trial-data.html), AstraZeneca said the newly released data \"were based on a prespecified interim analysis with a data cutoff of 17 February.\" \"We have reviewed the preliminary assessment of the primary analysis, and the results were consistent with the interim analysis. We are now completing the validation of the statistical analysis,\" the company said. \"We will immediately engage with the independent DSMB to share our primary analysis with the most up-to-date efficacy data. We intend to issue results of the primary analysis within 48 hours.\" Amesh A. Adalja, MD, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said he would like to see more information about what the DSMB was referring to. \"Unfortunately, most newspaper headlines are not going to contain the nuance that likely underlies the DSMB concerns, and it will be a challenge to communicate what is occurring to the general public,\" Adalja told Healio. \"It's important that the statement does not mention anything about safety but, in my reading, is about the way the data were combined, using older trials, to arrive at an efficacy calculation.\" AstraZeneca said Monday that it would submit the vaccine to the FDA for emergency use authorization in the U.S. in the first half of April and would have 50 million doses ready to be shipped in the first month, pending authorization. The company said the DSMB identified no safety concerns in the new trial, including no increased risk for thrombosis or \"events characterized by thrombosis\" among more than 21,500 people who had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Health officials in Europe also have [declared the shot safe](https://www.healio.com/news/infectious-disease/20210318/european-medicines-agency-declares-astrazeneca-vaccine-safe) after several European countries halted their rollout of the vaccine over reports of blood clots in vaccinees. \"We have to keep trying as hard as we can to get people to understand that there are safeguards in place,\" Fauci said. \"I think the data and safety monitoring board picking up this discrepancy was an example of a safeguard, and at the end of the day, all of this is going to be decided by the FDA. They will independently go over every bit of data themselves and not rely on any interpretation from anyone, including the company.\" References: Johnson CY, et al.
