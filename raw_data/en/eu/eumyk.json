[RTC RESTRUCTURING.] For purposes of restructuring the regional treatment centers and state nursing homes, any regional treatment center or state nursing home employee whose position is to be eliminated shall be afforded the options provided in applicable collective bargaining agreements. All salary and mitigation allocations from fiscal year 1998 shall be carried forward into fiscal year 1999. Provided there is no conflict with any collective bargaining agreement, any regional treatment center or state nursing home position reduction must only be accomplished through mitigation, attrition, transfer, and other measures as provided in state or applicable collective bargaining agreements and in Minnesota Statutes, section 252.50, subdivision 11, and not through layoff. [RTC POPULATION.] If the resident population at the regional treatment centers is projected to be higher than the estimates upon which the medical assistance forecast and budget recommendations for the 1998-1999 biennium were based, the amount of the medical assistance appropriation that is attributable to the cost of services that would have been provided as an alternative to regional treatment center services, including resources for community placements and waivered services for persons with mental retardation and related conditions, is transferred to the residential facilities appropriation. [REPAIRS AND BETTERMENTS.] The commissioner may transfer unencumbered appropriation balances between fiscal years for the state residential facilities repairs and betterments account and special equipment. [PROJECT LABOR.] Wages for project labor may be paid by the commissioner of human services out of repairs and betterments money if the individual is to be engaged in a construction project or a repair project of short-term and nonrecurring nature. Compensation for project labor shall be based on the prevailing wage rates, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 177.42, subdivision 6. Project laborers are excluded from the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, sections 43A.22 to 43A.30, and shall not be eligible for state-paid insurance and benefits.

With the concurrence of the affected bargaining unit representatives, this consolidation may commence upon the date following enactment. [DEVELOPMENT OF ADULT MENTAL HEALTH PILOT PROJECTS.] The commissioner shall ensure that exclusive bargaining representatives are informed about and allowed to participate in all aspects of the development of adult mental health pilot projects. Prior to authorizing additional funding for any county adult mental health pilot project, the commissioner shall give written assurance to the affected exclusive bargaining representatives that the mental health pilot project: (1) does not infringe on existing collective bargaining agreements or the relationships between public employees and their employers; (2) will effectively use bargaining unit employees; and (3) will foster cooperative and constructive labor and management practices under Minnesota Statutes, chapters 43A and 179A. [RTC STAFFING LEVELS.] In order to maintain adequate staffing levels during reallocations, downsizing, or transfer of regional center nonfiscal resources, the commissioner must ensure that any reallocation of positions between regional centers does not reduce required staffing at regional center programs for adults and adolescents with mental illness. Each regional treatment center serving persons with mental illness must have a written staffing plan based on program services and treatment plans that are required for individuals with mental illness at the regional center using standards established by the commissioner. The written plan must include a detailed account of the staffing needed at the regional center for the following inpatient and other psychiatric programs: (1) acute inpatient; (2) long-term inpatient; (3) adolescent programs; and (4) mobile and other crisis services and transitional services. If requested, the regional treatment center chief executive officer must provide the exclusive bargaining representative or any other interested party with a copy of the staffing plan. If the exclusive bargaining representative or another interested party believes that actual staffing or planned staffing for a regional treatment center is not adequate to provide necessary treatment, they may request the ombudsman for mental health and mental retardation to investigate, report findings, and make recommendations under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 245. If an investigation is requested in light of such circumstances, the report and recommendations must be completed no less than 30 days before an actual reallocation, downsizing of staff, or transfer of nonfiscal resources from a regional treatment center. By November 1, 1997, the commissioner shall begin to develop regional treatment center staffing plans for inpatient and other psychiatric programs. The commissioner will consult with representatives of exclusive bargaining representatives during the development of these plans. By February 1, 1998, the commissioner shall prepare and transmit to the legislature a report of the staffing level standards for regional treatment centers. The commissioner may also recommend any changes in statute, rules, and appropriations needed to implement the recommendations.

[FINDINGS.] The legislature declares that a moratorium on the licensure and medical assistance certification of new nursing home beds and construction projects that exceed the lesser of $500,000 or 25 percent of a facility's appraised value$750,000 is necessary to control nursing home expenditure growth and enable the state to meet the needs of its elderly by providing high quality services in the most appropriate manner along a continuum of care. Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 144A.071, subdivision 2, is amended to read: Subd. 2. [MORATORIUM.] The commissioner of health, in coordination with the commissioner of human services, shall deny each request for new licensed or certified nursing home or certified boarding care beds except as provided in subdivision 3 or 4a, or section 144A.073. \"Certified bed\" means a nursing home bed or a boarding care bed certified by the commissioner of health for the purposes of the medical assistance program, under United States Code, title 42, sections 1396 et seq. The commissioner of human services, in coordination with the commissioner of health, shall deny any request to issue a license under section 252.28 and chapter 245A to a nursing home or boarding care home, if that license would result in an increase in the medical assistance reimbursement amount. In addition, the commissioner of health must not approve any construction project whose cost exceeds $500,000, or 25 percent of the facility's appraised value, whichever is less,$750,000 unless: (a) any construction costs exceeding the lesser of $500,000 or 25 percent of the facility's appraised value$750,000 are not added to the facility's appraised value and are not included in the facility's payment rate for reimbursement under the medical assistance program; or (b) the project: (1) has been approved through the process described in section 144A.073; (2) meets an exception in subdivision 3 or 4a; (3) is necessary to correct violations of state or federal law issued by the commissioner of health; (4) is necessary to repair or replace a portion of the facility that was damaged by fire, lightning, groundshifts, or other such hazards, including environmental hazards, provided that the provisions of subdivision 4a, clause (a), are met; (5) as of May 1, 1992, the facility has submitted to the commissioner of health written documentation evidencing that the facility meets the \"commenced construction\" definition as specified in subdivision 1a, clause (d), or that substantial steps have been taken prior to April 1, 1992, relating to the construction project. \"Substantial steps\" require that the facility has made arrangements with outside parties relating to the construction project and include the hiring of an architect or construction firm, submission of preliminary plans to the department of health or documentation from a financial institution that financing arrangements for the construction project have been made; or (6) is being proposed by a licensed nursing facility that is not certified to participate in the medical assistance program and will not result in new licensed or certified beds. Prior to the final plan approval of any construction project, the commissioner of health shall be provided with an itemized cost estimate for the project construction costs. If a construction project is anticipated to be completed in phases, the total estimated cost of all phases of the project shall be submitted to the commissioner and shall be considered as one construction project. Once the construction project is completed and prior to the final clearance by the commissioner, the total project construction costs for the construction project shall be submitted to the commissioner. If the final project construction cost exceeds the dollar threshold in this subdivision, the commissioner of human services shall not recognize any of the project construction costs or the related financing costs in excess of this threshold in establishing the facility's property-related payment rate. The dollar thresholds for construction projects are as follows: for construction projects other than those authorized in clauses (1) to (6), the dollar threshold is $500,000 or 25 percent of appraised value, whichever is less$750,000. For projects authorized after July 1, 1993, under clause (1), the dollar threshold is the cost estimate submitted with a proposal for an exception under section 144A.073, plus inflation as calculated according to section 256B.431, subdivision 3f, paragraph (a). For projects authorized under clauses (2) to (4), the dollar threshold is the itemized estimate project construction costs submitted to the commissioner of health at the time of final plan approval, plus inflation as calculated according to section 256B.431, subdivision 3f, paragraph (a). The commissioner of health shall adopt rules to implement this section or to amend the emergency rules for granting exceptions to the moratorium on nursing homes under section 144A.073. Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 144A.073, subdivision 2, is amended to read: Subd. 2. [REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.] At the authorization by the legislature of additional medical assistance expenditures for exceptions to the moratorium on nursing homes, the interagency committee shall publish in the State Register a request for proposals for nursing home projects to be licensed or certified under section 144A.071, subdivision 4a, clause (c). The public notice of this funding and the request for proposals must specify how the approval criteria will be prioritized by the advisory review panel, the interagency long-term care planning committee, and the commissioner. The notice must describe the information that must accompany a request and state that proposals must be submitted to the interagency committee within 90 days of the date of publication. The notice must include the amount of the legislative appropriation available for the additional costs to the medical assistance program of projects approved under this section.

Authorized funds shall be allocated proportionally to the number of processes. Funds not encumbered by an earlier process within a biennium shall carry forward to subsequent iterations of the process. Authorization for expenditures does not carry forward into the following biennium. To be considered for approval, a proposal must include the following information: (1) whether the request is for renovation, replacement, upgrading, conversion, or relocation; (2) a description of the problem the project is designed to address; (3) a description of the proposed project; (4) an analysis of projected costs of the nursing facility proposal, which are not required to exceed the cost threshold referred to in section 144A.071, subdivision 1, to be considered under this section, including initial construction and remodeling costs; site preparation costs; financing costs, including the current estimated long-term financing costs of the proposal, which consists of estimates of the amount and sources of money, reserves if required under the proposed funding mechanism, annual payments schedule, interest rates, length of term, closing costs and fees, insurance costs, and any completed marketing study or underwriting review; and estimated operating costs during the first two years after completion of the project; (5) for proposals involving replacement of all or part of a facility, the proposed location of the replacement facility and an estimate of the cost of addressing the problem through renovation; (6) for proposals involving renovation, an estimate of the cost of addressing the problem through replacement; (7) the proposed timetable for commencing construction and completing the project; (8) a statement of any licensure or certification issues, such as certification survey deficiencies; (9) the proposed relocation plan for current residents if beds are to be closed so that the department of human services can estimate the total costs of a proposal; and (10) other information required by permanent rule of the commissioner of health in accordance with subdivisions 4 and 8. Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 144A.073, is amended by adding a subdivision to read: Subd. 9. [BUDGET REQUEST.] The commissioner of human services, in consultation with the commissioner of finance, shall include in each biennial budget request a line item for the nursing home moratorium exception process. If the commissioner of human services does not request funding for this item, the commissioner of human services must justify the decision in the budget pages. Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 252.28, is amended by adding a subdivision to read: Subd. 3a. [LICENSING EXCEPTION.] Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 3, the commissioner may license service sites, each accommodating up to six residents moving from a 48-bed intermediate care facility for persons with mental retardation or related conditions located in Dakota county that is closing under section 252.292. Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.421, subdivision 1, is amended to read: Subdivision 1. [SCOPE.] For the purposes of this following terms and phrases shall have the meaning given to them. Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.431, subdivision 25, is amended to read: Subd. 25. [CHANGES TO NURSING FACILITY REIMBURSEMENT BEGINNING JULY 1, 1995.] The nursing facility reimbursement changes in paragraphs (a) to (h) shall apply in the sequence specified to Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0010 to 9549.0080, and this section, beginning July 1, 1995. (a) The eight-cent adjustment to care-related rates in subdivision 22, paragraph (e), shall no longer apply. (b) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1995, the commissioner shall limit a nursing facility's allowable operating per diem for each case mix category for each rate year as in clauses (1) to (3). (1) For the rate year beginning July 1, 1995, the commissioner shall group nursing facilities into two groups, freestanding and nonfreestanding, within each geographic group, using their operating cost per diem for the case mix A classification. A nonfreestanding nursing facility is a nursing facility whose other operating cost per diem is subject to the hospital attached, short length of stay, or the rule 80 limits. All other nursing facilities shall be considered freestanding nursing facilities. The commissioner shall then array all nursing facilities in each grouping by their allowable case mix A operating cost per diem. In calculating a nursing facility's operating cost per diem for this purpose, the commissioner shall exclude the raw food cost per diem related to providing special diets that are based on religious beliefs, as determined in subdivision 2b, paragraph (h). For those nursing facilities in each grouping whose case mix A operating cost per diem: (i) is at or below the median minus 1.0 standard deviation of the array, the commissioner shall limit the nursing facility's allowable operating cost per diem for each case mix category to the lesser of the prior reporting year's allowable operating cost per diems plus the inflation factor as established in paragraph (f), clause (2), increased by six percentage points, or the current reporting year's corresponding allowable operating cost per diem; (ii) is between minus .5 standard deviation and minus 1.0 standard deviation below the median of the array, the commissioner shall limit the nursing facility's allowable operating cost per diem for each case mix category to the lesser of the prior reporting year's allowable operating cost per diems plus the inflation factor as established in paragraph (f), clause (2), increased by four percentage points, or the current reporting year's corresponding allowable operating cost per diem; or (iii) is equal to or above minus .5 standard deviation below the median of the array, the commissioner shall limit the nursing facility's allowable operating cost per diem for each case mix category to the lesser of the prior reporting year's allowable operating cost per diems plus the inflation factor as established in paragraph (f), clause (2), increased by three percentage points, or the current reporting year's corresponding allowable operating cost per diem. (2) For the rate year beginning on July 1, 1996, the commissioner shall limit the nursing facility's allowable operating cost per diem for each case mix category to the lesser of the prior reporting year's allowable operating cost per diems plus the inflation factor as established in paragraph (f), clause (2), increased by one percentage point or the current reporting year's corresponding allowable operating cost per diems; and (3) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the commissioner shall limit the nursing facility's allowable operating cost per diem for each case mix category to the lesser of the reporting year prior to the current reporting year's allowable operating cost per diems plus the inflation factor as established in paragraph (f), clause (2), or the current reporting year's corresponding allowable operating cost per diems. (c) For rate years beginning on July 1, 1995, the commissioner shall limit the allowable operating cost per diems for high cost nursing facilities. After application of the limits in paragraph (b) to each nursing facility's operating cost per diems, the commissioner shall group nursing facilities into two groups, freestanding or nonfreestanding, within each geographic group. A nonfreestanding nursing facility is a nursing facility whose other operating cost per diems are subject to hospital attached, short length of stay, or rule 80 limits. All other nursing facilities shall be considered freestanding nursing facilities. The commissioner shall then array all nursing facilities within each grouping by their allowable case mix A operating cost per diems. In calculating a nursing facility's operating cost per diem for this purpose, the commissioner shall exclude the raw food cost per diem related to providing special diets that are based on religious beliefs, as determined in subdivision 2b, paragraph (h). For those nursing facilities in each grouping whose case mix A operating cost per diem exceeds 1.0 standard deviation above the median, the commissioner shall reduce their allowable operating cost per diems by two percent. For those nursing facilities in each grouping whose case mix A operating cost per diem exceeds 0.5 standard deviation above the median but is less than or equal to 1.0 standard deviation above the median, the commissioner shall reduce their allowable operating cost per diems by one percent. (d) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1996, the commissioner shall limit the allowable operating cost per diems for high cost nursing facilities. After application of the limits in paragraph (b) to each nursing facility's operating cost per diems, the commissioner shall group nursing facilities into two groups, freestanding or nonfreestanding, within each geographic group. A nonfreestanding nursing facility is a nursing facility whose other operating cost per diems are subject to hospital attached, short length of stay, or rule 80 limits. All other nursing facilities shall be considered freestanding nursing facilities. The commissioner shall then array all nursing facilities within each grouping by their allowable case mix A operating cost per diems. In calculating a nursing facility's operating cost per diem for this purpose, the commissioner shall exclude the raw food cost per diem related to providing special diets that are based on religious beliefs, as determined in subdivision 2b, paragraph (h). In those nursing facilities in each grouping whose case mix A operating cost per diem exceeds 1.0 standard deviation above the median, the commissioner shall reduce their allowable operating cost per diems by three percent. For those nursing facilities in each grouping whose case mix A operating cost per diem exceeds 0.5 standard deviation above the median but is less than or equal to 1.0 standard deviation above the median, the commissioner shall reduce their allowable operating cost per diems by two percent. (e) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1995, the commissioner shall determine a nursing facility's efficiency incentive by first computing the allowable difference, which is the lesser of $4.50 or the amount by which the facility's other operating cost limit exceeds its nonadjusted other operating cost per diem for that rate year. The commissioner shall compute the efficiency incentive by: (1) subtracting the allowable difference from $4.50 and dividing the result by $4.50; (2) multiplying 0.20 by the ratio resulting from clause (1), and then; (3) adding 0.50 to the result from clause (2); and (4) multiplying the result from clause (3) times the allowable difference. The nursing facility's efficiency incentive payment shall be the lesser of $2.25 or the product obtained in clause (4). (f) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1995, the forecasted price index for a nursing facility's allowable operating cost per diems shall be determined under clauses (1) to (3) using the change in the Consumer Price Index-All Items (United States city average) (CPI-U) or the change in the Nursing Home Market Basket, both as forecasted by Data Resources Inc., whichever is applicable. The commissioner shall use the indices as forecasted in the fourth quarter of the calendar year preceding the rate year, subject to subdivision 2l, paragraph (c). If, as a result of federal legislative or administrative action, the methodology used to calculate the Consumer Price Index-All Items (United States city average) (CPI-U) changes, the commissioner shall develop a conversion factor or other methodology to convert the CPI-U index factor that results from the new methodology to an index factor that approximates, as closely as possible, the index factor that would have resulted from application of the original CPI-U methodology prior to any changes in methodology. The commissioner shall use the conversion factor or other methodology to calculate an adjusted inflation index. The adjusted inflation index must be used to calculate payment rates under this section instead of the CPI-U index specified in paragraph (d). If the commissioner is required to develop an adjusted inflation index, the commissioner shall report to the legislature as part of the next budget submission the fiscal impact of applying this index. (1) The CPI-U forecasted index for allowable operating cost per diems shall be based on the 21-month period from the midpoint of the nursing facility's reporting year to the midpoint of the rate year following the reporting year. (2) The Nursing Home Market Basket forecasted index for allowable operating costs and per diem limits shall be based on the 12-month period between the midpoints of the two reporting years preceding the rate year. (3) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1996, the forecasted index for operating cost limits referred to in subdivision 21, paragraph (b), shall be based on the CPI-U for the 12-month period between the midpoints of the two reporting years preceding the rate year. (g) After applying these provisions for the respective rate years, the commissioner shall index these allowable operating costs per diems by the inflation factor provided for in paragraph (f), clause (1), and add the nursing facility's efficiency incentive as computed in paragraph (e). (h)(1) A nursing facility licensed for 302 beds on September 30, 1993, that was approved under the moratorium exception process in section 144A.073 for a partial replacement, and completed the replacement project in December 1994, is exempt from paragraphs (b) to (d) for rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1995. (2) For the rate year beginning July 1, 1997, after computing this nursing facility's payment rate according to section 256B.434, the commissioner shall make a one-year rate adjustment of $8.62 to the facility's contract payment rate for the rate effect of operating cost changes associated with the facility's 1994 downsizing project. (3) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the commissioner shall add 35 cents to the facility's base property related payment rate for the rate effect of reducing its licensed capacity to 290 beds from 302 beds and shall add 83 cents to the facility's real estate tax and special assessment payment rate for payments in lieu of real estate taxes. The adjustments in this clause shall remain in effect for the duration of the facility's contract under section 256B.434. (i) Notwithstanding Laws 1996, chapter 451, article 3, section 11, paragraph (h), for the rate years beginning on July 1, 1996, July 1, 1997, and July 1, 1998, a nursing facility licensed for 40 beds effective May 1, 1992, with a subsequent increase of 20 Medicare/Medicaid certified beds, effective January 26, 1993, in accordance with an increase in licensure is exempt from paragraphs (b) to (d). Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.431, is amended by adding a subdivision to read: Subd. 26. [CHANGES TO NURSING FACILITY REIMBURSEMENT BEGINNING JULY 1, 1997.] The nursing facility reimbursement changes in paragraphs (a) to (f) shall apply in the sequence specified in Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0010 to 9549.0080, and this section, beginning July 1, 1997. (a) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the commissioner shall limit a nursing facility's allowable operating per diem for each case mix category for each rate year. The commissioner shall group nursing facilities into two groups, freestanding and nonfreestanding, within each geographic group, using their operating cost per diem for the case mix A classification. A nonfreestanding nursing facility is a nursing facility whose other operating cost per diem is subject to the hospital attached, short length of stay, or the rule 80 limits. All other nursing facilities shall be considered freestanding nursing facilities. The commissioner shall then array all nursing facilities in each grouping by their allowable case mix A operating cost per diem. In calculating a nursing facility's operating cost per diem for this purpose, the commissioner shall exclude the raw food cost per diem related to providing special diets that are based on religious beliefs, as determined in subdivision 2b, paragraph (h). For those nursing facilities in each grouping whose case mix A operating cost per diem: (1) is at or below the median of the array, the commissioner shall limit the nursing facility's allowable operating cost per diem for each case mix category to the lesser of the prior reporting year's allowable operating cost per diem as specified in Laws 1996, chapter 451, article 3, section 11, paragraph (h), plus the inflation factor as established in paragraph (d), clause (2), increased by two percentage points, or the current reporting year's corresponding allowable operating cost per diem; or (2) is above the median of the array, the commissioner shall limit the nursing facility's allowable operating cost per diem for each case mix category to the lesser of the prior reporting year's allowable operating cost per diem as specified in Laws 1996, chapter 451, article 3, section 11, paragraph (h), plus the inflation factor as established in paragraph (d), clause (2), increased by one percentage point, or the current reporting year's corresponding allowable operating cost per diem. (b) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the commissioner shall limit the allowable operating cost per diem for high cost nursing facilities. After application of the limits in paragraph (a) to each nursing facility's operating cost per diem, the commissioner shall group nursing facilities into two groups, freestanding or nonfreestanding, within each geographic group. A nonfreestanding nursing facility is a nursing facility whose other operating cost per diem are subject to hospital attached, short length of stay, or rule 80 limits. All other nursing facilities shall be considered freestanding nursing facilities. The commissioner shall then array all nursing facilities within each grouping by their allowable case mix A operating cost per diem. In calculating a nursing facility's operating cost per diem for this purpose, the commissioner shall exclude the raw food cost per diem related to providing special diets that are based on religious beliefs, as determined in subdivision 2b, paragraph (h). For those nursing facilities in each grouping whose case mix A operating cost per diem exceeds 1.0 standard deviation above the median, the commissioner shall reduce their allowable operating cost per diem by three percent. For those nursing facilities in each grouping whose case mix A operating cost per diem exceeds 0.5 standard deviation above the median but is less than or equal to 1.0 standard deviation above the median, the commissioner shall reduce their allowable operating cost per diem by two percent. However, in no case shall a nursing facility's operating cost per diem be reduced below its grouping's limit established at 0.5 standard deviations above the median. (c) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the commissioner shall determine a nursing facility's efficiency incentive by first computing the allowable difference, which is the lesser of $4.50 or the amount by which the facility's other operating cost limit exceeds its nonadjusted other operating cost per diem for that rate year. The commissioner shall compute the efficiency incentive by: (1) subtracting the allowable difference from $4.50 and dividing the result by $4.50; (2) multiplying 0.20 by the ratio resulting from clause (1), and then; (3) adding 0.50 to the result from clause (2); and (4) multiplying the result from clause (3) times the allowable difference. The nursing facility's efficiency incentive payment shall be the lesser of $2.25 or the product obtained in clause (4). (d) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the forecasted price index for a nursing facility's allowable operating cost per diem shall be determined under clauses (1) and (2) using the change in the Consumer Price Index-All Items (United States city average) (CPI-U) as forecasted by Data Resources, Inc. The commissioner shall use the indices as forecasted in the fourth quarter of the calendar year preceding the rate year, subject to subdivision 2l, paragraph (c). (1) The CPI-U forecasted index for allowable operating cost per diem shall be based on the 21-month period from the midpoint of the nursing facility's reporting year to the midpoint of the rate year following the reporting year. (2) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the forecasted index for operating cost limits referred to in subdivision 21, paragraph (b), shall be based on the CPI-U for the 12-month period between the midpoints of the two reporting years preceding the rate year. (e) After applying these provisions for the respective rate years, the commissioner shall index these allowable operating cost per diem by the inflation factor provided for in paragraph (d), clause (1), and add the nursing facility's efficiency incentive as computed in paragraph (c). (f) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997, the total operating cost payment rates for a nursing facility shall be the greater of the total operating cost payment rates determined under this section or the total operating cost payment rates in effect on June 30, 1997, subject to rate adjustments due to field audit or rate appeal resolution. This provision shall not apply to subsequent field audit adjustments of the nursing facility's operating cost rates for rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1997. (g) For the rate years beginning on July 1, 1997, and July 1, 1998, a nursing facility licensed for 40 beds effective May 1, 1992, with a subsequent increase of 20 Medicare/Medicaid certified beds, effective January 26, 1993, in accordance with an increase in licensure is exempt from paragraphs (a) and (b). (h) For a nursing facility whose construction project was authorized according to section 144A.073, subdivision 5, paragraph (g), the operating cost payment rates for the third location shall be determined based on Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0057. Paragraphs (a) and (b) shall not apply until the second rate year after the settle-up cost report is filed. Notwithstanding subdivision 2b, paragraph (g), real estate taxes and special assessments payable by the third location, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, shall be included in the payment rates determined under this subdivision for all subsequent rate years. (i) For the rate year beginning July 1, 1997, the commissioner shall compute the payment rate for a nursing facility licensed for 94 beds on September 30, 1996, that applied in October 1993 for approval of a total replacement under the moratorium exception process in section 144A.073, and completed the approved replacement in June 1995, with other operating cost spend-up limit under paragraph (a), increased by $3.98, and after computing the facility's payment rate according to this section, the commissioner shall make a one-year positive rate adjustment of $3.19 for operating costs related to the newly constructed total replacement, without application of paragraphs (a) and (b). The facility's per diem, before the $3.19 adjustment, shall be used as the prior reporting year's allowable operating cost per diem for payment rate calculation for the rate year beginning July 1, 1998. A facility described in this paragraph is exempt from paragraph (b) for the rate years beginning July 1, 1997, and July 1, 1998. (j) For the purpose of applying the limit stated in paragraph (a), a nursing facility in Kandiyohi county licensed for 86 beds that was granted hospital-attached status on December 1, 1994, shall have the prior year's allowable care-related per diem increased by $3.207 and the prior year's other operating cost per diem increased by $4.777 before adding the inflation in paragraph (d), clause (2), for the rate year beginning on July 1, 1997. (k) For the purpose of applying the limit stated in paragraph (a), a 117 bed nursing facility located in Pine county shall have the prior year's allowable other operating cost per diem increased by $1.50 before adding the inflation in paragraph (d), clause (2), for the rate year beginning on July 1, 1997. (l) For the purpose of applying the limit under paragraph (a), a nursing facility in Hibbing licensed for 192 beds shall have the prior year's allowable other operating cost per diem increased by $2.67 before adding the inflation in paragraph (d), clause (2), for the rate year beginning July 1, 1997. Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.433, is amended by adding a subdivision to read: Subd. 3a. [EXEMPTION FROM REQUIREMENT FOR SEPARATE THERAPY BILLING.] The provisions of subdivision 3 do not apply to nursing facilities that are reimbursed according to the provisions of section 256B.431 and are located in a county participating in the prepaid medical assistance program. Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.434, subdivision 3, is amended to read: Subd. 3. [DURATION AND TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS.] (a) Subject to available resources, the commissioner may begin to execute contracts with nursing facilities November 1, 1995. (b) All contracts entered into under this section are for a term of four yearsone year. Either party may terminate a contract effective July 1 of any year by providing written notice to the other party no later than April 1 of that yearat any time without cause by providing 30 calendar days advance written notice to the other party. The decision to terminate a contract is not appealable. If neither party provides written notice of termination by April 1, the contract is automatically renewed for the next rate yearthe contract shall be renegotiated for additional one-year terms, for up to a total of four consecutive one-year terms. The provisions of the contract shall be renegotiated annually by the parties prior to the expiration date of the contract. The parties may voluntarily renegotiate the terms of the contract at any time by mutual agreement. (c) If a nursing facility fails to comply with the terms of a contract, the commissioner shall provide reasonable notice regarding the breach of contract and a reasonable opportunity for the facility to come into compliance. If the facility fails to come into compliance or to remain in compliance, the commissioner may terminate the contract. If a contract is terminated, the contract payment remains in effect for the remainder of the rate year in which the contract was terminated, but in all other respects the provisions of this section do not apply to that facility effective the date the contract is terminated. The contract shall contain a provision governing the transition back to the cost-based reimbursement system established under section 256B.431, subdivision 25, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0010 to 9549.0080. A contract entered into under this section may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties. Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.434, subdivision 9, is amended to read: Subd. 9. [MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS FOR OTHER SERVICES.] Beginning July 1, 1995, the commissioner may contract with nursing facilities that have entered into alternative payment demonstration project contracts under this section to provide medical assistance services other than nursing facility care to residents of the facility under a prepaid, managed care payment system. For purposes of contracts entered into under this subdivision, the commissioner may waive one or more of the requirements for payment for ancillary services in section 256B.433.Managed care contracts for other services may be entered into at any time during the duration of a nursing facility's alternative payment demonstration project contract, and the terms of the managed care contracts need not coincide with the terms of the alternative payment demonstration project contract.

[EXEMPTIONS.] (a) To the extent permitted by federal law, (1) a facility that has entered into a contract under this section is not required to file a cost report, as defined in Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0020, subpart 13, for any year after the base year that is the basis for the calculation of the contract payment rate for the first rate year of the alternative payment demonstration project contract; and (2) a facility under contract is not subject to audits of historical costs or revenues, or paybacks or retroactive adjustments based on these costs or revenues, except audits, paybacks, or adjustments relating to the cost report that is the basis for calculation of the first rate year under the contract. (b) A facility that is under contract with the commissioner under this section is not subject to the moratorium on licensure or certification of new nursing home beds in section 144A.071, unless the project results in a net increase in bed capacity or involves relocation of beds from one site to another. Contract payment rates must not be adjusted to reflect any additional costs that a nursing facility incurs as a result of a construction project undertaken under this paragraph. In addition, as a condition of entering into a contract under this section, a nursing facility must agree that any future medical assistance payments for nursing facility services will not reflect any additional costs attributable to the sale of a nursing facility under this section and to construction undertaken under this paragraph that otherwise would not be authorized under the moratorium in section 144A.073. Nothing in this section prevents a nursing facility participating in the alternative payment demonstration project under this section from seeking approval of an exception to the moratorium through the process established in section 144A.073, and if approved the facility's rates shall be adjusted to reflect the cost of the project. (c) Notwithstanding section 256B.48, subdivision 6, paragraphs (c), (d), and (e), and pursuant to any terms and conditions contained in the facility's contract, a nursing facility that is under contract with the commissioner under this section is in compliance with section 256B.48, subdivision 6, paragraph (b), if the facility is Medicare certified.

[DRUGS.] (a) Medical assistance covers drugs, except for fertility drugs when specifically used to enhance fertility, if prescribed by a licensed practitioner and dispensed by a licensed pharmacist, by a physician enrolled in the medical assistance program as a dispensing physician, or by a physician or a nurse practitioner employed by or under contract with a community health board as defined in section 145A.02, subdivision 5, for the purposes of communicable disease control. The commissioner, after receiving recommendations from professional medical associations and professional pharmacist associations, shall designate a formulary committee to advise the commissioner on the names of drugs for which payment is made, recommend a system for reimbursing providers on a set fee or charge basis rather than the present system, and develop methods encouraging use of generic drugs when they are less expensive and equally effective as trademark drugs. The formulary committee shall consist of nine members, four of whom shall be physicians who are not employed by the department of human services, and a majority of whose practice is for persons paying privately or through health insurance, three of whom shall be pharmacists who are not employed by the department of human services, and a majority of whose practice is for persons paying privately or through health insurance, a consumer representative, and a nursing home representative. Committee members shall serve three-year terms and shall serve without compensation. Members may be reappointed once. (b) The commissioner shall establish a drug formulary. Its establishment and publication shall not be subject to the requirements of the administrative procedure act, but the formulary committee shall review and comment on the formulary contents. The formulary committee shall review and recommend drugs which require prior authorization. The formulary committee may recommend drugs for prior authorization directly to the commissioner, as long as opportunity for public input is provided. Prior authorization may be requested by the commissioner based on medical and clinical criteria before certain drugs are eligible for payment. Before a drug may be considered for prior authorization at the request of the commissioner: (1) the drug formulary committee must develop criteria to be used for identifying drugs; the development of these criteria is not subject to the requirements of chapter 14, but the formulary committee shall provide opportunity for public input in developing criteria; (2) the drug formulary committee must hold a public forum and receive public comment for an additional 15 days; and (3) the commissioner must provide information to the formulary committee on the impact that placing the drug on prior authorization will have on the quality of patient care and information regarding whether the drug is subject to clinical abuse or misuse. Prior authorization may be required by the commissioner before certain formulary drugs are eligible for payment. The formulary shall not include: (i) drugs or products for which there is no federal funding; (ii) over-the-counter drugs, except for antacids, acetaminophen, family planning products, aspirin, insulin, products for the treatment of lice, vitamins for adults with documented vitamin deficiencies, andvitamins for children under the age of seven and pregnant or nursing women ;, and (iii)any other over-the-counter drug identified by the commissioner, in consultation with the drug formulary committee, as necessary, appropriate, and cost-effective for the treatment of certain specified chronic diseases, conditions or disorders, and this determination shall not be subject to the requirements of chapter 14; (iv)(iii) anorectics; and (v)(iv) drugs for which medical value has not been established. The commissioner shall publish conditions for prohibiting payment for specific drugs after considering the formulary committee's recommendations. (c) The basis for determining the amount of payment shall be the lower of the actual acquisition costs of the drugs plus a fixed dispensing fee; the maximum allowable cost set by the federal government or by the commissioner plus the fixed dispensing fee; or the usual and customary price charged to the public. The pharmacy dispensing fee shall be $3.85$3.65. Actual acquisition cost includes quantity and other special discounts except time and cash discounts. The actual acquisition cost of a drug shall be estimated by the commissioner, at average wholesale price minus nine percent.

Establishment of the amount of payment for drugs shall not be subject to the requirements of the administrative procedure act. An additional dispensing fee of $.30 may be added to the dispensing fee paid to pharmacists for legend drug prescriptions dispensed to residents of long-term care facilities when a unit dose blister card system, approved by the department, is used. Under this type of dispensing system, the pharmacist must dispense a 30-day supply of drug. The National Drug Code (NDC) from the drug container used to fill the blister card must be identified on the claim to the department. The unit dose blister card containing the drug must meet the packaging standards set forth in Minnesota Rules, part 6800.2700, that govern the return of unused drugs to the pharmacy for reuse. The pharmacy provider will be required to credit the department for the actual acquisition cost of all unused drugs that are eligible for reuse. Over-the-counter medications must be dispensed in the manufacturer's unopened package. The commissioner may permit the drug clozapine to be dispensed in a quantity that is less than a 30-day supply. Whenever a generically equivalent product is available, payment shall be on the basis of the actual acquisition cost of the generic drug, unless the prescriber specifically indicates \"dispense as written - brand necessary\" on the prescription as required by section 151.21, subdivision 2. Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.0625, is amended by adding a subdivision to read: Subd. 31a. [AUGMENTATIVE AND ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS.] (a) Medical assistance covers augmentative and alternative communication systems consisting of electronic or nonelectronic devices and the related components necessary to enable a person with severe expressive communication limitations to produce or transmit messages or symbols in a manner that compensates for that disability. (b) By January 1, 1998, the commissioner, in cooperation with the commissioner of administration, shall establish an augmentative and alternative communication system purchasing program within a state agency or by contract with a qualified private entity. The purpose of this service is to facilitate ready availability of the augmentative and alternative communication systems needed to meet the needs of persons with severe expressive communication limitations in an efficient and cost-effective manner. This program shall: (1) coordinate purchase and rental of augmentative and alternative communication systems; (2) negotiate agreements with manufacturers and vendors for purchase of components of these systems, for warranty coverage, and for repair service; (3) when efficient and cost-effective, maintain and refurbish if needed, an inventory of components of augmentative and alternative communication systems for short- or long-term loan to recipients; (4) facilitate training sessions for service providers, consumers, and families on augmentative and alternative communication systems; and (5) develop a recycling program for used augmentative and alternative communications systems to be reissued and used for trials and short-term use, when appropriate. The availability of components of augmentative and alternative communication systems through this program is subject to prior authorization requirements established under subdivision 25.

Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.0626, is amended to read: 256B.0626 [ESTIMATION OF 50TH PERCENTILE OF PREVAILING CHARGES.] (a) The 50th percentile of the prevailing charge for the base year identified in statute must be estimated by the commissioner in the following situations: (1) there were less than tenfive billings in the calendar year specified in legislation governing maximum payment rates; (2) the service was not available in the calendar year specified in legislation governing maximum payment rates; (3) the payment amount is the result of a provider appeal; (4) the procedure code description has changed since the calendar year specified in legislation governing maximum payment rates, and, therefore, the prevailing charge information reflects the same code but a different procedure description; or (5) the 50th percentile reflects a payment which is grossly inequitable when compared with payment rates for procedures or services which are substantially similar. (b) When one of the situations identified in paragraph (a) occurs, the commissioner shall use the following methodology to reconstruct a rate comparable to the 50th percentile of the prevailing rate: (1) refer to information which exists for the first ninefour billings in the calendar year specified in legislation governing maximum payment rates; or (2) refer to surrounding or comparable procedure codes; or (3) refer to the 50th percentile of years subsequent to the calendar year specified in legislation governing maximum payment rates, and reduce that amount by applying an appropriate Consumer Price Index formula; or (4) refer to relative value indexes; or (5) refer to reimbursement information from other third parties, such as Medicare. Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.0627, subdivision 5, is amended to read: Subd. 5. [LIMITATION ON PAYMENTS.] Medical assistance payments for home care services shall be limited according to this subdivision.

(b) [PRIOR AUTHORIZATION; EXCEPTIONS.] All home care services above the limits in paragraph (a) must receive the commissioner's prior authorization, except when: (1) the home care services were required to treat an emergency medical condition that if not immediately treated could cause a recipient serious physical or mental disability, continuation of severe pain, or death. The provider must request retroactive authorization no later than five working days after giving the initial service. The provider must be able to substantiate the emergency by documentation such as reports, notes, and admission or discharge histories; (2) the home care services were provided on or after the date on which the recipient's eligibility began, but before the date on which the recipient was notified that the case was opened. Authorization will be considered if the request is submitted by the provider within 20 working days of the date the recipient was notified that the case was opened; (3) a third-party payor for home care services has denied or adjusted a payment. Authorization requests must be submitted by the provider within 20 working days of the notice of denial or adjustment. A copy of the notice must be included with the request; (4) the commissioner has determined that a county or state human services agency has made an error; or (5) the professional nurse determines an immediate need for up to 40 skilled nursing or home health aide visits per calendar year and submits a request for authorization within 20 working days of the initial service date, and medical assistance is determined to be the appropriate payer. (c) [RETROACTIVE AUTHORIZATION.] A request for retroactive authorization will be evaluated according to the same criteria applied to prior authorization requests. (d) [ASSESSMENT AND SERVICE PLAN.] Assessments under section 256B.0627, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), shall be conducted initially, and at least annually thereafter, in person with the recipient and result in a completed service plan using forms specified by the commissioner. Within 30 days of recipient or responsible party request for home care services, the assessment, the service plan, and other information necessary to determine medical necessity such as diagnostic or testing information, social or medical histories, and hospital or facility discharge summaries shall be submitted to the commissioner. For personal care services: (1) The amount and type of service authorized based upon the assessment and service plan will follow the recipient if the recipient chooses to change providers. (2) If the recipient's medical need changes, the recipient's provider may assess the need for a change in service authorization and request the change from the county public health nurse. Within 30 days of the request, the public health nurse will determine whether to request the change in services based upon the provider assessment, or conduct a home visit to assess the need and determine whether the change is appropriate. (3) To continue to receive personal care services when the recipient displays no significant change, the county public health nurse has the option to review with the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, the service plan on record and receive authorization for up to an additional 12 months at a time for up to three years. (e) [PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.] The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee, shall review the assessment, the service plan, and any additional information that is submitted. The commissioner shall, within 30 days after receiving a complete request, assessment, and service plan, authorize home care services as follows: (1) [HOME HEALTH SERVICES.] All home health services provided by a licensed nurse or a home health aide must be prior authorized by the commissioner or the commissioner's designee. Prior authorization must be based on medical necessity and cost-effectiveness when compared with other care options. When home health services are used in combination with personal care and private duty nursing, the cost of all home care services shall be considered for cost-effectiveness. The commissioner shall limit nurse and home health aide visits to no more than one visit each per day. (2) [PERSONAL CARE SERVICES.] (i) All personal care services and registered nurse supervision must be prior authorized by the commissioner or the commissioner's designee except for the assessments established in paragraph (a). The amount of personal care services authorized must be based on the recipient's home care rating. A child may not be found to be dependent in an activity of daily living if because of the child's age an adult would either perform the activity for the child or assist the child with the activity and the amount of assistance needed is similar to the assistance appropriate for a typical child of the same age. Based on medical necessity, the commissioner may authorize: (A) up to two times the average number of direct care hours provided in nursing facilities for the recipient's comparable case mix level; or (B) up to three times the average number of direct care hours provided in nursing facilities for recipients who have complex medical needs or are dependent in at least seven activities of daily living and need physical assistance with eating or have a neurological diagnosis; or (C) up to 60 percent of the average reimbursement rate, as of July 1, 1991, for care provided in a regional treatment center for recipients who have Level I behavior, plus any inflation adjustment as provided by the legislature for personal care service; or (D) up to the amount the commissioner would pay, as of July 1, 1991, plus any inflation adjustment provided for home care services, for care provided in a regional treatment center for recipients referred to the commissioner by a regional treatment center preadmission evaluation team. For purposes of this clause, home care services means all services provided in the home or community that would be included in the payment to a regional treatment center; or (E) up to the amount medical assistance would reimburse for facility care for recipients referred to the commissioner by a preadmission screening team established under section 256B.0911 or 256B.092; and (F) a reasonable amount of time for the provision of nursing supervision of personal care services. (ii) The number of direct care hours shall be determined according to the annual cost report submitted to the department by nursing facilities. The average number of direct care hours, as established by May 1, 1992, shall be calculated and incorporated into the home care limits on July 1, 1992. These limits shall be calculated to the nearest quarter hour. (iii) The home care rating shall be determined by the commissioner or the commissioner's designee based on information submitted to the commissioner by the county public health nurse on forms specified by the commissioner. The home care rating shall be a combination of current assessment tools developed under sections 256B.0911 and 256B.501 with an addition for seizure activity that will assess the frequency and severity of seizure activity and with adjustments, additions, and clarifications that are necessary to reflect the needs and conditions of recipients who need home care including children and adults under 65 years of age. The commissioner shall establish these forms and protocols under this section and shall use an advisory group, including representatives of recipients, providers, and counties, for consultation in establishing and revising the forms and protocols. (iv) A recipient shall qualify as having complex medical needs if the care required is difficult to perform and because of recipient's medical condition requires more time than community-based standards allow or requires more skill than would ordinarily be required and the recipient needs or has one or more of the following: (A) daily tube feedings; (B) daily parenteral therapy; (C) wound or postural treatments, (E) catheterization; (F) ostomy care; (G) quadriplegia; or (H) other comparable medical conditions or treatments the commissioner determines would otherwise require institutional care. (v) A recipient shall qualify as having Level I behavior if there is reasonable supporting evidence that the recipient exhibits, or that without supervision, observation, or redirection would exhibit, one or more of the following behaviors that cause, or have the potential to cause: (A) injury to the recipient's own body; (B) physical injury to other people; or (C) destruction of property. (vi) Time authorized for personal care relating to Level I behavior in subclause (v), items (A) to (C), shall be based on the predictability, frequency, and amount of intervention required. (vii) A recipient shall qualify as having Level II behavior if the recipient exhibits on a daily basis one or more of the following behaviors that interfere with the completion of personal care services under subdivision 4, paragraph (a): (A) unusual or repetitive habits; (B) withdrawn behavior; or (C) offensive behavior. (viii) A recipient with a home care rating of Level II behavior in subclause (vii), items (A) to (C), shall be rated as comparable to a recipient with complex medical needs under subclause (iv). If a recipient has both complex medical needs and Level II behavior, the home care rating shall be the next complex category up to the maximum rating under subclause (i), item (B). (3) [PRIVATE DUTY NURSING SERVICES.] All private duty nursing services shall be prior authorized by the commissioner or the commissioner's designee. Prior authorization for private duty nursing services shall be based on medical necessity and cost-effectiveness when compared with alternative care options. The commissioner may authorize medically necessary private duty nursing services in quarter-hour units when: (i) the recipient requires more individual and continuous care than can be provided during a nurse visit; or (ii) the cares are outside of the scope of services that can be provided by a home health aide or personal care assistant. The commissioner may authorize: (A) up to two times the average amount of direct care hours provided in nursing facilities statewide for case mix classification \"K\" as established by the annual cost report submitted to the department by nursing facilities in May 1992; (B) private duty nursing in combination with other home care services up to the total cost allowed under clause (2); (C) up to 16 hours per day if the recipient requires more nursing than the maximum number of direct care hours as established in item (A) and the recipient meets the hospital admission criteria established under Minnesota Rules, parts 9505.0500 to 9505.0540. The commissioner may authorize up to 16 hours per day of medically necessary private duty nursing services or up to 24 hours per day of medically necessary private duty nursing services until such time as the commissioner is able to make a determination of eligibility for recipients who are cooperatively applying for home care services under the community alternative care program developed under section 256B.49, or until it is determined by the appropriate regulatory agency that a health benefit plan is or is not required to pay for appropriate medically necessary health care services. Recipients or their representatives must cooperatively assist the commissioner in obtaining this determination. Recipients who are eligible for the community alternative care program may not receive more hours of nursing under this section than would otherwise be authorized under section 256B.49. (4) [VENTILATOR-DEPENDENT RECIPIENTS.] If the recipient is ventilator-dependent, the monthly medical assistance authorization for home care services shall not exceed what the commissioner would pay for care at the highest cost hospital designated as a long-term hospital under the Medicare program. For purposes of this clause, home care services means all services provided in the home that would be included in the payment for care at the long-term hospital. \"Ventilator-dependent\" means an individual who receives mechanical ventilation for life support at least six hours per day and is expected to be or has been dependent for at least 30 consecutive days. (f) [PRIOR AUTHORIZATION; TIME LIMITS.] The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall determine the time period for which a prior authorization shall be effective. If the recipient continues to require home care services beyond the duration of the prior authorization, the home care provider must request a new prior authorization. Under no circumstances, other than the exceptions in paragraph (b), shall a prior authorization be valid prior to the date the commissioner receives the request or for more than 12 months. A recipient who appeals a reduction in previously authorized home care services may continue previously authorized services, other than temporary services under paragraph (h), pending an appeal under section 256.045. The commissioner must provide a detailed explanation of why the authorized services are reduced in amount from those requested by the home care provider. (g) [APPROVAL OF HOME CARE SERVICES.] The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall determine the medical necessity of home care services, the level of caregiver according to subdivision 2, and the institutional comparison according to this subdivision, the cost-effectiveness of services, and the amount, scope, and duration of home care services reimbursable by medical assistance, based on the assessment, primary payer coverage determination information as required, the service plan, the recipient's age, the cost of services, the recipient's medical condition, and diagnosis or disability. The commissioner may publish additional criteria for determining medical necessity according to section 256B.04. (h) [PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUESTS; TEMPORARY SERVICES.] The agency nurse, the independently enrolled private duty nurse, or county public health nurse may request a temporary authorization for home care services by telephone. The commissioner may approve a temporary level of home care services based on the assessment, and service or care plan information, and primary payer coverage determination information as required. Authorization for a temporary level of home care services including nurse supervision is limited to the time specified by the commissioner, but shall not exceed 45 days, unless extended because the county public health nurse has not completed the required assessment and service plan, or the commissioner's determination has not been made. The level of services authorized under this provision shall have no bearing on a future prior authorization. (i) [PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED IN FOSTER CARE SETTING.] Home care services provided in an adult or child foster care setting must receive prior authorization by the department according to the limits established in paragraph (a). The commissioner may not authorize: (1) home care services that are the responsibility of the foster care provider under the terms of the foster care placement agreement and administrative rules. Requests for home care services for recipients residing in a foster care setting must include the foster care placement agreement and determination of difficulty of care; (2) personal care services when the foster care license holder is also the personal care provider or personal care assistant unless the recipient can direct the recipient's own care, or case management is provided as required in section 256B.0625, subdivision 19a; (3) personal care services when the responsible party is an employee of, or under contract with, or has any direct or indirect financial relationship with the personal care provider or personal care assistant, unless case management is provided as required in section 256B.0625, subdivision 19a; (4) home care services when the number of foster care residents is greater than four unless the county responsible for the recipient's foster placement made the placement prior to April 1, 1992, requests that home care services be provided, and case management is provided as required in section 256B.0625, subdivision 19a; or (5) home care services when combined with foster care payments, other than room and board payments that exceed the total amount that public funds would pay for the recipient's care in a medical institution. Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.0627, is amended by adding a subdivision to read: Subd. 8. [PERSONAL CARE ASSISTANT SERVICES.] Recipients of personal care assistant services may share staff and the commissioner shall provide a rate system for shared personal care assistant services. The rate system shall not exceed 1-1/2 the amount paid for providing services to one person, and shall increase incrementally by one-half the cost of serving a single person, for each person served. A personal care assistant may not serve more than three children in a single setting. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to reduce the total number of hours authorized for an individual recipient. Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.064, subdivision 1a, is amended to read: Subd. 1a. [GROUNDS FOR MONETARY RECOVERY AND SANCTIONS AGAINST VENDORS.] The commissioner may seek monetary recovery and impose sanctions against vendors of medical care for any of the following: fraud, theft, or abuse in connection with the provision of medical care to recipients of public assistance; a pattern of presentment of false or duplicate claims or claims for services not medically necessary; a pattern of making false statements of material facts for the purpose of obtaining greater compensation than that to which the vendor is legally entitled; suspension or termination as a Medicare vendor; andrefusal to grant the state agency access during regular business hours to examine all records necessary to disclose the extent of services provided to program recipients; and any reason for which a vendor could be excluded from participation in the Medicare program under section 1128, 1128A, or 1866(b)(2) of the Social Security Act. The determination of services not medically necessary may be made by the commissioner in consultation with a peer advisory task force appointed by the commissioner on the recommendation of appropriate professional organizations.

[ALLOCATION FORMULA.] (a) The alternative care appropriation for fiscal years 1992 and beyond shall cover only 180-day eligible clients. (b) Prior to July 1 of each year, the commissioner shall allocate to county agencies the state funds available for alternative care for persons eligible under subdivision 2. The allocation for fiscal year 1992 shall be calculated using a base that is adjusted to exclude the medical assistance share of alternative care expenditures. The adjusted base is calculated by multiplying each county's allocation for fiscal year 1991 by the percentage of county alternative care expenditures for 180-day eligible clients. The percentage is determined based on expenditures for services rendered in fiscal year 1989 or calendar year 1989, whichever is greater. (c) If the county expenditures for 180-day eligible clients are 95 percent or more of its adjusted base allocation, the allocation for the next fiscal year is 100 percent of the adjusted base, plus inflation to the extent that inflation is included in the state budget. (d) If the county expenditures for 180-day eligible clients are less than 95 percent of its adjusted base allocation, the allocation for the next fiscal year is the adjusted base allocation less the amount of unspent funds below the 95 percent level. (e) For fiscal year 1992 only, a county may receive an increased allocation if annualized service costs for the month of May 1991 for 180-day eligible clients are greater than the allocation otherwise determined. A county may apply for this increase by reporting projected expenditures for May to the commissioner by June 1, 1991. The amount of the allocation may exceed the amount calculated in paragraph (b). The projected expenditures for May must be based on actual 180-day eligible client caseload and the individual cost of clients' care plans. If a county does not report its expenditures for May, the amount in paragraph (c) or (d) shall be used. (f) Calculations for paragraphs (c) and (d) are to be made as follows: for each county, the determination of expenditures shall be based on payments for services rendered from April 1 through March 31 in the base year, to the extent that claims have been submitted by June 1 of that year. Calculations for paragraphs (c) and (d) must also include the funds transferred to the consumer support grant program for clients who have transferred to that program from April 1 through March 31 in the base year. Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.0913, subdivision 15, is amended to read: Subd. 15.

The county alternative care grant allocation will be supplemented with a special allocation amount based on the projected number of eligible high function class A's and computed on the basis of $240 per month per projected eligible person. Individual monthly expenditures under the service allowance option are permitted to be either greater or less than the amount of $240 per month based on individual need. County allocations shall be adjusted periodically based on the actual provision of services to high function class A persons. The allocation will be distributed by a population based formula and shall not exceed the proportion of projected savings made available under section 144.0721, subdivision 3. (b) Counties shall have the option of providing services, cash service allowances, vouchers, or a combination of these options to high function class A persons defined in section 144.0721, subdivision 3, clause (2). High function class A persons may choose services from among the categories of services listed under subdivision 5, except for case management services. (c) If the special allocation under this section to a county is not sufficient to serve all persons who qualify for alternative care servicesthe service allowance, the county is not required to provide any alternative careservices to a high function class A person but shall establish a waiting list to provide services as special allocation funding becomes available. Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.0913, is amended by adding a subdivision to read: Subd. 16.

If medical supplies and equipment or adaptations are or will be purchased for an elderly waiver services recipient, the costs may be prorated on a monthly basis throughout the year in which they are purchased. If the monthly cost of a recipient's other waivered services exceeds the monthly limit established in this paragraph, the annual cost of the waivered services shall be determined. In this event, the annual cost of waivered services shall not exceed 12 times the monthly limit calculated in this paragraph. The statewide average payment rate is calculated by determining the statewide average monthly nursing home rate, effective July 1 of the fiscal year in which the cost is incurred, less the statewide average monthly income of nursing home residents who are age 65 or older, and who are medical assistance recipients in the month of March of the previous state fiscal year.

(g) The assisted living and residential care service rates for elderly and community alternatives for disabled individuals (CADI) waivers shall be made to the vendor as a monthly rate negotiated with the county agency. The rate shall not exceed the nonfederal share of the greater of either the statewide or any of the geographic groups' weighted average monthly medical assistance nursing facility payment rate of the case mix resident class to which the elderly or disabled client would be assigned under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059. For alternative care assisted living projects established under Laws 1988, chapter 689, article 2, section 256, monthly rates may not exceed 65 percent of the greater of either the statewide or any of the geographic groups' weighted average monthly medical assistance nursing facility payment rate for the case mix resident class to which the elderly or disabled client would be assigned under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059. The rate may not cover direct rent or food costs. (h) The county shall negotiate individual rates with vendors and may be reimbursed for actual costs up to the greater of the county's current approved rate or 60 percent of the maximum rate in fiscal year 1994 and 65 percent of the maximum rate in fiscal year 1995 for each service within each program. (i) On July 1, 1993, the commissioner shall increase the maximum rate for home-delivered meals to $4.50 per meal. (j) Reimbursement for the medical assistance recipients under the approved waiver shall be made from the medical assistance account through the invoice processing procedures of the department's Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), only with the approval of the client's case manager.

If revenue bonds are issued for this purpose, the refinancing and the existing properties of the contracting party shall be deemed to constitute a project under section 469.153, subdivision 2, clause (d). Revenue bonds may not be issued pursuant to this subdivision unless the application for approval of the project pursuant to section 469.154 shows that a reduction in debt service charges is estimated to result and will be reflected in charges to patients and third-party payors. Proceeds of revenue bonds issued pursuant to this subdivision may not be used for any purpose inconsistent with the provisions of chapter 256B.

(15) Develop and implement special projects that maximize reimbursements and result in the recovery of money to the state. For the purpose of recovering state money, the commissioner may enter into contracts with third parties.

(b) The county board shall submit monthly or quarterly reports to the department as required by the commissioner. Monthly reports are due no later than 15 working days after the end of the month. Quarterly reports are due no later than 30 calendar days after the end of the quarter, unless the commissioner determines that the deadline must be shortened to 20 calendar days to avoid jeopardizing compliance with federal deadlines or risking a loss of federal funding. Only reports that are complete, legible, and in the required format shall be accepted by the commissioner. (c) If the required reports are not received by the deadlines established in clause (b), the commissioner may delay payments and withhold funds from the county board until the next reporting period. When the report is needed to account for the use of federal funds and the late report results in a reduction in federal funding, the commissioner shall withhold from the county boards with late reports an amount equal to the reduction in federal funding until full federal funding is received. (d) A county board that submits reports that are late, illegible, incomplete, or not in the required format for two out of three consecutive reporting periods is considered noncompliant. When a county board is found to be noncompliant, the commissioner shall notify the county board of the reason the county board is considered noncompliant and request that the county board develop a corrective action plan stating how the county board plans to correct the problem. The corrective action plan must be submitted to the commissioner within 45 days after the date the county board received notice of noncompliance. (e) The final deadline for fiscal reports or amendments to fiscal reports is one year after the date the report was originally due.

(f) The commissioner may not delay payments, withhold funds, or require repayment under paragraph (c) or (e) if the county demonstrates that the commissioner failed to provide appropriate forms, guidelines, and technical assistance to enable the county to comply with the requirements. If the county board disagrees with an action taken by the commissioner under paragraph (c) or (e), the county board may appeal the action according to sections 14.57 to 14.69. (g) Counties subject to withholding of funds under paragraph (c) or forfeiture or repayment of funds under paragraph (e) shall not reduce or withhold benefits or services to clients to cover costs incurred due to actions taken by the commissioner under paragraph (c) or (e). (18) Allocate federal fiscal disallowances or sanctions for audit exceptions when federal fiscal disallowances or sanctions are based on a statewide random sample for the foster care program under title IV-E of the Social Security Act, United States Code, title 42, in direct proportion to each county's title IV-E foster care maintenance claim for that period.

Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256F.05, subdivision 8, is amended to read: Subd. 8. [USES OF FAMILY PRESERVATION FUND GRANTS.] For both basic grants and single family preservation fund grants:(a) A county which has not demonstrated that year that its family preservation core services are developed as provided in subdivision 1a, must use its family preservation fund grant exclusively for family preservation services defined in section 256F.03, subdivision 5, paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (e). (b) A county which has demonstrated that year that its family preservation core services are developed becomes eligible either to continue using its family preservation fund grant as provided in paragraph (a), or to exercise the expanded service option under paragraph (c). (c) The expanded service option permits an eligible county to use its family preservation fund grant for child welfare preventativepreventive services as defined in section 256F.10, subdivision 7, paragraph (d). For purposes of this section, child welfare preventive services are those services directed toward a specific child or family that further the goals of section 256F.01 and include assessments, family preservation services, service coordination, community-based treatment, crisis nursery services when the parents retain custody and there is no voluntary placement agreement with a child-placing agency, respite care except when it is provided under a medical assistance waiver, home-based services, and other related services. For purposes of this section, child welfare preventive services shall not include shelter care or other placement services under the authority of the court or public agency to address an emergency. To exercise this option, an eligible county must notify the commissioner in writing of its intention to do so no later than 30 days into the quarter during which it intends to begin or in its county plan, as provided in section 256F.04, subdivision 2. Effective with the first day of that quarter, the county must maintain its base level of expenditures for child welfare preventativepreventive services and use the family preservation fund to expand them. The base level of expenditures for a county shall be that established under section 256F.10, subdivision 7. For counties which have no such base established, a comparable base shall be established with the base year being the calendar year ending at least two calendar quarters before the first calendar quarter in which the county exercises its expanded service option. The commissioner shall, at the request of the counties, reduce, suspend, or eliminate either or both of a county's obligations to continue the base level of expenditures and to expand child welfare preventativepreventive services based on conditions described in section 256F.10, subdivision 7, paragraph (b) or (c)under extraordinary circumstances. (d) Each county's placement earnings and development grant shall be determined under section 256.8711, but after each annual or quarterly calculation, if added to that county's basic grant, the three component grants shall be treated as a single family preservation fund grant.Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256F.06, subdivision 1, is amended to read: Subdivision 1. [RESPONSIBILITIES.] A county board may, alone or in combination with other county boards, apply for a family preservation fund grant as provided in section 256F.04, subdivision 2. Upon approval of the grant, the county board may contract for or directly provide family-based and other eligible services. A county board may contract with or directly provide eligible services to children and families through a local collaborative. Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256F.06, subdivision 2, is amended to read: Subd. 2.

For calendar years 1996 and 1997, the county board also becomes eligible to request that its basic, placement earnings, and development grants be added into a single grant under section 256F.05, subdivision 7, paragraph (a).Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256F.11, subdivision 2, is amended to read: Subd. 2. [FUND DISTRIBUTION.] In distributing funds, the commissioner shall give priority consideration to agencies and organizations with experience in working with abused or neglected children and their families, and with children at high risk of abuse and neglect and their families, and serve communities which demonstrate the greatest need for these services. Funds shall be distributed to crisis nurseries according to a formula developed by the commissioner in consultation with the Minnesota crisis nursery association. This formula shall include funding for all existing crisis nursery programs that meet program requirements as specified in paragraph (a), and consideration of factors reflecting the need for services in each service area, including, but not limited to, the number of children 18 years of age and under living in the service area, the percent of children 18 years of age and under living in poverty in the service area, and factors reflecting the cost of providing services, including, but not limited to, the number of days of service provided in the previous year. At least 25 percent of available funds for state fiscal year 1998 shall be set aside to accomplish any of the following: establish new crisis nursery programs; increase statewide availability of crisis nursery services; and enhance or expand services at existing crisis nursery programs.

(b) The crisis nurseries are encouraged to provide: (1) on-site support groups for facility model programs, or agency sponsored parent support groups for volunteer family model programs; (2) parent education classes or programs that include parent-child interaction; and (3) opportunities for parents to volunteer, if appropriate, to assist with child care in a supervised setting in order to enhance their parenting skills and self-esteem, in addition to providing them the opportunity to give something back to the program. (c) Parents shall retain custody of their children during placement in a crisis facility. The crisis nurseries are encouraged to include one or more parents who have used the crisis nursery services on the program's multidisciplinary advisory board. Sec. 21. [257.85] [RELATIVE CUSTODY ASSISTANCE.] Subdivision 1. [CITATION.] This section may be cited as the \"Relative Custody Assistance Act.\" Subd. 2. [SCOPE.] The provisions of this section apply to those situations in which the legal and physical custody of a child is established with a relative according to section 260.191, subdivision 3b, by a court order issued on or after July 1, 1997. Subd. 3. [DEFINITIONS.] For purposes of this section, the terms defined in this subdivision have the meanings given them. (a) \"AFDC or MFIP standard\" means the monthly standard of need used to calculate assistance under the AFDC program, the transitional standard used to calculate assistance under the MFIP-S program, or, if neither of those is applicable, the analogous transitional standard used to calculate assistance under the MFIP or MFIP-R programs. (b) \"Local agency\" means the local social service agency with legal custody of a child prior to the transfer of permanent legal and physical custody to a relative. (c) \"Permanent legal and physical custody\" means permanent legal and physical custody ordered by a Minnesota juvenile court under section 260.191, subdivision 3b.

(h) \"Remains in the physical custody of the relative custodian\" means that the relative custodian is providing day-to-day care for the child and that the child lives with the relative custodian; absence from the relative custodian's home for a period of more than 120 days raises a presumption that the child no longer remains in the physical custody of the relative custodian. Subd. 4. [DUTIES OF LOCAL AGENCY.] (a) When a local agency seeks a court order under section 260.191, subdivision 3b, to establish permanent legal and physical custody of a child with a relative, or if such an order is issued by the court, the local agency shall perform the duties in this subdivision. (b) As soon as possible after the local agency determines that it will seek to establish permanent legal and physical custody of the child with a relative or, if the agency did not seek to establish custody, as soon as possible after the issuance of the court order establishing custody, the local agency shall inform the relative about the relative custody assistance program, including eligibility criteria and payment levels. Anytime prior to, but not later than seven days after, the date the court issues the order establishing permanent legal and physical custody of the child with a relative, the local agency shall determine whether the eligibility criteria in subdivision 6 are met to allow the relative to receive relative custody assistance. Not later than seven days after determining whether the eligibility criteria are met, the local agency shall inform the relative custodian of its determination and of the process for appealing that determination under subdivision 9. (c) If the local agency determines that the relative custodian is eligible to receive relative custody assistance, the local agency shall prepare the relative custody assistance agreement and ensure that it meets the criteria of subdivision 6. (d) The local agency shall make monthly payments to the relative as set forth in the relative custody assistance agreement. On a quarterly basis and on a form to be provided by the commissioner, the local agency shall make claims for reimbursement from the commissioner for relative custody assistance payments made. (e) For a relative custody assistance agreement that is in place for longer than one year, and as long as the agreement remains in effect, the local agency shall send an annual affidavit form to the relative custodian of the eligible child within the month before the anniversary date of the agreement. The local agency shall monitor whether the annual affidavit is returned by the relative custodian within 30 days following the anniversary date of the agreement. The local agency shall review the affidavit and any other information in its possession to ensure continuing eligibility for relative custody assistance and that the amount of payment made according to the agreement is correct. (f) When the local agency determines that a relative custody assistance agreement should be terminated or modified, it shall provide notice of the proposed termination or modification to the relative custodian at least ten days before the proposed action along with information about the process for appealing the proposed action. Subd. 5. [RELATIVE CUSTODY ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT.] (a) A relative custody assistance agreement will not be effective, unless it is signed by the local agency and the relative custodian no later than 30 days after the date of the order establishing permanent legal and physical custody with the relative, except that a local agency may enter into a relative custody assistance agreement with a relative custodian more than 30 days after the date of the order if it certifies that the delay in entering the agreement was through no fault of the relative custodian. There must be a separate agreement for each child for whom the relative custodian is receiving relative custody assistance. (b) Regardless of when the relative custody assistance agreement is signed by the local agency and relative custodian, the effective date of the agreement shall be the first day of the month following the date of the order establishing permanent legal and physical custody or the date that the last party signs the agreement, whichever occurs later. (c) If MFIP-S is not the applicable program for a child at the time that a relative custody assistance agreement is entered on behalf of the child, when MFIP-S becomes the applicable program, if the relative custodian had been receiving custody assistance payments calculated based upon a different program, the amount of relative custody assistance payment under subdivision 7 shall be recalculated under the MFIP-S program. (d) The relative custody assistance agreement shall be in a form specified by the commissioner and shall include provisions relating to the following: (1) the responsibilities of all parties to the agreement; (2) the payment terms, including the financial circumstances of the relative custodian, the needs of the child, the amount and calculation of the relative custody assistance payments, and that the amount of the payments shall be reevaluated annually; (3) the effective date of the agreement, which shall also be the anniversary date for the purpose of submitting the annual affidavit under subdivision 8; (4) that failure to submit the affidavit as required by subdivision 8 will be grounds for terminating the agreement; (5) the agreement's expected duration, which shall not extend beyond the child's eighteenth birthday; (6) any specific known circumstances that could cause the agreement or payments to be modified, reduced, or terminated and the relative custodian's appeal rights under subdivision 9; (7) that the relative custodian must notify the local agency within 30 days of any of the following: (i) a change in the child's status; (ii) a change in the relationship between the relative custodian and the child; (iii) a change in composition or level of income of the relative custodian's family; (iv) a change in eligibility or receipt of benefits under AFDC, MFIP-S, or other assistance program; and (v) any other change that could affect eligibility for or amount of relative custody assistance; (8) that failure to provide notice of a change as required by clause (7) will be grounds for terminating the agreement; (9) that the amount of relative custody assistance is subject to the availability of state funds to reimburse the local agency making the payments; (10) that the relative custodian may choose to temporarily stop receiving payments under the agreement at any time by providing 30 days' notice to the local agency and may choose to begin receiving payments again by providing the same notice but any payments the relative custodian chooses not to receive are forfeit; and (11) that the local agency will continue to be responsible for making relative custody assistance payments under the agreement regardless of the relative custodian's place of residence. Subd. 6. [ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA.] A local agency shall enter into a relative custody assistance agreement under subdivision 5 if it certifies that the following criteria are met: (1) the juvenile court has determined or is expected to determine that the child, under the former or current custody of the local agency, cannot return to the home of the child's parents; (2) the court, upon determining that it is in the child's best interests, has issued or is expected to issue an order transferring permanent legal and physical custody of the child to the relative; and (3) the child either: (i) is a member of a sibling group to be placed together; or (ii) has a physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral disability that will require financial support. When the local agency bases its certification that the criteria in clause (1) or (2) are met upon the expectation that the juvenile court will take a certain action, the relative custody assistance agreement does not become effective until and unless the court acts as expected. Subd. 7. [AMOUNT OF RELATIVE CUSTODY ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS.] (a) The amount of a monthly relative custody assistance payment shall be determined according to the provisions of this paragraph. (1) The total maximum assistance rate is equal to the base assistance rate plus, if applicable, the supplemental assistance rate. (i) The base assistance rate is equal to the maximum amount that could be received as basic maintenance for a child of the same age under the adoption assistance program. (ii) The local agency shall determine whether the child has physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral disabilities that require care, supervision, or structure beyond that ordinarily provided in a family setting to children of the same age such that the child would be eligible for supplemental maintenance payments under the adoption assistance program if an adoption assistance agreement were entered on the child's behalf. If the local agency determines that the child has such a disability, the supplemental assistance rate shall be the maximum amount of monthly supplemental maintenance payment that could be received on behalf of a child of the same age, disabilities, and circumstances under the adoption assistance program. (2) The net maximum assistance rate is equal to the total maximum assistance rate from clause (1) less the following offsets: (i) if the child is or will be part of an assistance unit receiving an AFDC, MFIP-S, or other MFIP grant, the portion of the AFDC or MFIP standard relating to the child; (ii) Supplemental Security Income payments received by or on behalf of the child; (iii) veteran's benefits received by or on behalf of the child; and (iv) any other income of the child, including child support payments made on behalf of the child. (3) The relative custody assistance payment to be made to the relative custodian shall be a percentage of the net maximum assistance rate calculated in clause (2) based upon the gross income of the relative custodian's family, including the child for whom the relative has permanent legal and physical custody. In no case shall the amount of the relative custody assistance payment exceed that which the child could qualify for under the adoption assistance program if an adoption assistance agreement were entered on the child's behalf. The relative custody assistance payment shall be calculated as follows: (i) if the relative custodian's gross family income is less than or equal to 200 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the relative custody assistance payment shall be the full amount of the net maximum assistance rate; (ii) if the relative custodian's gross family income is greater than 200 percent and less than or equal to 225 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the relative custody assistance payment shall be 80 percent of the net maximum assistance rate; (iii) if the relative custodian's gross family income is greater than 225 percent and less than or equal to 250 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the relative custody assistance payment shall be 60 percent of the net maximum assistance rate; (iv) if the relative custodian's gross family income is greater than 250 percent and less than or equal to 275 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the relative custody assistance payment shall be 40 percent of the net maximum assistance rate; (v) if the relative custodian's gross family income is greater than 275 percent and less than or equal to 300 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the relative custody assistance payment shall be 20 percent of the net maximum assistance rate; or (vi) if the relative custodian's gross family income is greater than 300 percent of federal poverty guidelines, no relative custody assistance payment shall be made. (b) This paragraph specifies the provisions pertaining to the relationship between relative custody assistance and AFDC, MFIP-S, or other MFIP programs: (1) the relative custodian of a child for whom the relative is receiving relative custody assistance is expected to seek whatever assistance is available for the child through the AFDC, MFIP-S, or other MFIP programs. If a relative custodian fails to apply for assistance through AFDC, MFIP-S, or other MFIP program for which the child is eligible, the child's portion of the AFDC or MFIP standard will be calculated as if application had been made and assistance received; (2) the portion of the AFDC or MFIP standard relating to each child for whom relative custody assistance is being received shall be calculated as follows: (i) determine the total AFDC or MFIP standard for the assistance unit; (ii) determine the amount that the AFDC or MFIP standard would have been if the assistance unit had not included the children for whom relative custody assistance is being received; (iii) subtract the amount determined in item (ii) from the amount determined in item (i); and (iv) divide the result in item (iii) by the number of children for whom relative custody assistance is being received that are part of the assistance unit; or (3) if a child for whom relative custody assistance is being received is not eligible for assistance through the AFDC, MFIP-S, or other MFIP programs, the portion of AFDC or MFIP standard relating to that child shall be equal to zero. Subd. 8. [ANNUAL AFFIDAVIT.] When a relative custody assistance agreement remains in effect for more than one year, the local agency shall require the relative custodian to annually submit an affidavit in a form to be specified by the commissioner. The affidavit must be submitted to the local agency each year no later than 30 days after the relative custody assistance agreement's anniversary date. The affidavit shall document the following: (1) that the child remains in the physical custody of the relative custodian; (2) that there is a continuing need for the relative custody assistance payments due to the child's physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral needs; and (3) the current gross income of the relative custodian's family. The relative custody assistance agreement may be modified based on information or documentation presented to the local agency under this requirement and as required by annual adjustments to the federal poverty guidelines.

Subd. 6. [DETERMINATION.] If the individual cannot provide the information required in subdivision 5, before making a determination that the individual is cooperating, the child support agency shall make a finding that the individual could not reasonably be expected to provide the information. In making this finding, the child support agency shall consider: (1) the age of the child for whom support is being sought; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conception of the child; (3) the age and mental capacity of the parent or caregiver of the child for whom support is being sought; (4) the time period that has expired since the parent or caregiver of the child for whom support is sought last had contact with the alleged father or obligor, or the person's relatives; and (5) statements from the applicant or recipient or other individuals that show evidence of an inability to provide correct information about the alleged father or obligor because of deception by the alleged father or obligor.

[NONCOOPERATION.] Unless good cause is found to exist under subdivision 10, upon a determination of noncooperation by the child support agency, the agency shall promptly notify the individual and each public assistance agency providing public assistance to the individual that the individual is not cooperating with the child support agency. Upon notice of noncooperation, the individual shall be sanctioned in the amount determined according to the public assistance agency responsible for enforcing the sanction. Subd. 8.

Good cause may be claimed and exemptions determined according to subdivisions 10 to 13. Subd. 10. [GOOD CAUSE EXEMPTION.] (a) Cooperation with the child support agency under subdivision 5 is not necessary if the individual asserts, and both the child support agency and the public assistance agency find, good cause exists under this subdivision for failing to cooperate. An individual may request a good cause exemption by filing a written claim with the public assistance agency on a form provided by the commissioner of human services. Upon notification of a claim for good cause exemption, the child support agency shall cease all child support enforcement efforts until the claim for good cause exemption is reviewed and the validity of the claim is determined. Designated representatives from public assistance agencies and at least one representative from the child support enforcement agency shall review each claim for a good cause exemption and determine its validity. (b) Good cause exists when an individual documents that pursuit of child support enforcement services could reasonably result in: (1) physical or emotional harm to the child for whom support is sought; (2) physical harm to the parent or caregiver with whom the child is living that would reduce the ability to adequately care for the child; or (3) emotional harm to the parent or caregiver with whom the child is living, of such nature or degree that it would reduce the person's ability to adequately care for the child. Physical and emotional harm under this paragraph must be of a serious nature in order to justify a finding of good cause exemption. A finding of good cause exemption based on emotional harm may only be based upon a demonstration of emotional impairment that substantially affects the individual's ability to function. (c) Good cause also exists when the designated representatives in this subdivision believe that pursuing child support enforcement would be detrimental to the child for whom support is sought and the individual applicant or recipient documents any of the following: (1) the child for whom child support enforcement is sought was conceived as a result of incest or rape; (2) legal proceedings for the adoption of the child are pending before a court of competent jurisdiction; or (3) the parent or caregiver of the child is currently being assisted by a public or licensed private social service agency to resolve the issues of whether to keep the child or place the child for adoption. The parent or caregiver's right to claim a good cause exemption based solely on this paragraph expires if the assistance lasts more than 90 days. (d) The public authority shall consider the best interests of the child in determining good cause. Subd. 11. [PROOF OF GOOD CAUSE.] (a) An individual seeking a good cause exemption has 20 days from the date the good cause claim was provided to the public assistance agency to supply evidence supporting the claim. The public assistance agency may extend the time period in this section if it believes the individual is cooperating and needs additional time to submit the evidence required by this section. Failure to provide this evidence shall result in the child support agency resuming child support enforcement efforts. (b) Evidence supporting a good cause claim includes, but is not limited to: (1) a birth certificate or medical or law enforcement records indicating that the child was conceived as the result of incest or rape; (2) court documents or other records indicating that legal proceedings for adoption are pending before a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) court, medical, criminal, child protective services, social services, domestic violence advocate services, psychological, or law enforcement records indicating that the alleged father or obligor might inflict physical or emotional harm on the child, parent, or caregiver; (4) medical records or written statements from a licensed medical professional indicating the emotional health history or status of the custodial parent, child, or caregiver, or indicating a diagnosis or prognosis concerning their emotional health; (5) a written statement from a public or licensed private social services agency that the individual is deciding whether to keep the child or place the child for adoption; or (6) sworn statements from individuals other than the applicant or recipient that provide evidence supporting the good cause claim. (c) The child support agency and the public assistance agency shall assist an individual in obtaining the evidence in this section upon request of the individual. Subd. 12. [DECISION.] A good cause exemption must be granted if the individual's claim and the investigation of the supporting evidence satisfy the investigating agencies that the individual has good cause for refusing to cooperate. Subd. 13. [DURATION.] (a) A good cause exemption may not continue for more than one year without redetermination of cooperation and good cause pursuant to this section. The child support agency may redetermine cooperation and the designated representatives in subdivision 10 may redetermine the granting of a good cause exemption before the one year expiration in this subdivision. (b) A good cause exemption must be allowed under subsequent applications and redeterminations without additional evidence when the factors that led to the exemption continue to exist. A good cause exemption must end when the factors that led to the exemption have changed. Subd. 14. [TRAINING.] The commissioner shall establish domestic violence and sexual abuse training programs for child support agency employees. The training programs must be developed in consultation with experts on domestic violence and sexual assault.

[BLOOD OR GENETIC TESTS REQUIRED.] (a) The court or public authority may, and upon request of a party shall, require the child, mother, or alleged father to submit to blood or genetic tests. A mother or alleged father requesting the tests shall file with the court an affidavit either alleging or denying paternity and setting forth facts that establish the reasonable possibility that there was, or was not, the requisite sexual contact between the parties. (b) A copy of the test results must be served on the parties as provided in section 543.20each party by first class mail to the party's last known address. Any objection to the results of blood or genetic tests must be made in writing no later than 15 days prior to a hearing at which time those test results may be introduced into evidence30 days after service of the results. Test results served upon a party must include notice of this right to object. (c) If the alleged father is dead, the court may, and upon request of a party shall, require the decedent's parents or brothers and sisters or both to submit to blood or genetic tests. However, in a case involving these relatives of an alleged father, who is deceased, the court may refuse to order blood or genetic tests if the court makes an express finding that submitting to the tests presents a danger to the health of one or more of these relatives that outweighs the child's interest in having the tests performed. Unless the person gives consent to the use, the results of any blood or genetic tests of the decedent's parents, brothers, or sisters may be used only to establish the right of the child to public assistance including but not limited to social security and veterans' benefits. The tests shall be performed by a qualified expert appointed by the court. Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 257.62, subdivision 2, is amended to read: Subd. 2.

Custody and visitation and all subsequent motions related to them shall proceed and be determined under section 257.541. The remaining matters and all subsequent motions related to them shall proceed and be determined in accordance with chapter 518. The judgment or order may direct the appropriate party to pay all or a proportion of the reasonable expenses of the mother's pregnancy and confinement, after consideration of the relevant facts, including the relative financial means of the parents; the earning ability of each parent; and any health insurance policies held by either parent, or by a spouse or parent of the parent, which would provide benefits for the expenses incurred by the mother during her pregnancy and confinement. Pregnancy and confinement expenses and genetic testing costs, submitted by the public authority, are admissible as evidence without third-party foundation testimony and constitute prima facie evidence of the amounts incurred for those services or for the genetic testing. Remedies available for the collection and enforcement of child support apply to confinement costs and are considered additional child support. Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 257.66, is amended by adding a subdivision to read: Subd. 6. [REQUIRED INFORMATION.] Upon entry of judgment or order, each parent who is a party in a paternity proceeding shall: (1) file with the public authority responsible for child support enforcement the party's social security number, residential and mailing address, telephone number, driver's license number, and name, address, and telephone number of any employer if the party is receiving services from the public authority or begins receiving services from the public authority; (2) file the information in clause (1) with the district court; and (3) notify the court and, if applicable, the public authority responsible for child support enforcement of any change in the information required under this section within ten days of the change.

All papers and records, other than the final judgment, pertaining to the action or proceeding, whether part of the permanent record of the court or of a file in the state department of human services or elsewhere, are subject to inspection only upon consent of the court and all interested persons, or in exceptional cases only upon an order of the court for good cause shown. (b) In all actions under this chapter in which public assistance is assigned under section 256.741 or the public authority provides services to a party or parties to the action, notwithstanding statutory or other authorization for the public authority to release private data on the location of a party to the action, information on the location of one party may not be released by the public authority to the other party if: (1) the public authority has knowledge that a protective order with respect to the other party has been entered; or (2) the public authority has reason to believe that the release of the information may result in physical or emotional harm to the other party. Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 257.75, subdivision 2, is amended to read: Subd. 2.

Upon receipt of a revocation of the recognition of parentage or joinder in a recognition, the state registrar of vital statistics shall forward a copy of the revocation to the nonrevoking parent, or, in the case of a joinder in a recognition, to the mother and father who executed the recognition. Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 257.75, subdivision 3, is amended to read: Subd. 3. [EFFECT OF RECOGNITION.] Subject to subdivision 2 and section 257.55, subdivision 1, paragraph (g) or (h), the recognition has the force and effect of a judgment or order determining the existence of the parent and child relationship under section 257.66. If the conditions in section 257.55, subdivision 1, paragraph (g) or (h), exist, the recognition creates only a presumption of paternity for purposes of sections 257.51 to 257.74. Once a recognition has been properly executed and filed with the state registrar of vital statistics, if there are no competing presumptions of paternity, a judicial or administrative court may not allow further action to determine parentage regarding the signator of the recognition. Until an order is entered granting custody to another, the mother has sole custody. The recognition is: (1) a basis for bringing an action to award custody or visitation rights to either parent, establishing a child support obligation which may include up to the two years immediately preceding the commencement of the action, ordering a contribution by a parent under section 256.87, or ordering a contribution to the reasonable expenses of the mother's pregnancy and confinement, as provided under section 257.66, subdivision 3, or ordering reimbursement for the costs of blood or genetic testing, as provided under section 257.69, subdivision 2; (2) determinative for all other purposes related to the existence of the parent and child relationship; and (3) entitled to full faith and credit in other jurisdictions. Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 257.75, subdivision 4, is amended to read: Subd. 4. [ACTION TO VACATE RECOGNITION.] (a) An action to vacate a recognition of paternity may be brought by the mother, father, husband or former husband who executed a joinder, or the child. A mother, father, or husband or former husband who executed a joinder must bring the action within one year of the execution of the recognition or within six months after the person bringing the action obtains the results of blood or genetic tests that indicate that the man who executed the recognition is not the father of the child. A child must bring an action to vacate within six months after the child obtains the result of blood or genetic tests that indicate that the man who executed the recognition is not the father of the child, or within one year of reaching the age of majority, whichever is later. If the court finds a prima facie basis for vacating the recognition, the court shall order the child, mother, father, and husband or former husband who executed a joinder to submit to blood tests. If the court issues an order for the taking of blood tests, the court shall require the party seeking to vacate the recognition to make advance payment for the costs of the blood tests. If the party fails to pay for the costs of the blood tests, the court shall dismiss the action to vacate with prejudice. The court may also order the party seeking to vacate the recognition to pay the other party's reasonable attorney fees, costs, and disbursements. If the results of the blood tests establish that the man who executed the recognition is not the father, the court shall vacate the recognition. If a recognition is vacated, any joinder in the recognition under subdivision 1a is also vacated. The court shall terminate the obligation of a party to pay ongoing child support based on the recognition. A modification of child support based on a recognition may be made retroactive with respect to any period during which the moving party has pending a motion to vacate the recognition but only from the date of service of notice of the motion on the responding party. (b) The burden of proof in an action to vacate the recognition is on the moving party. The moving party must request the vacation on the basis of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact. The legal responsibilities in existence at the time of an action to vacate, including child support obligations, may not be suspended during the proceeding, except for good cause shown. Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 257.75, subdivision 5, is amended to read: Subd. 5. [RECOGNITION FORM.] The commissioner of human services shall prepare a form for the recognition of parentage under this section. In preparing the form, the commissioner shall consult with the individuals specified in subdivision 6. The recognition form must be drafted so that the force and effect of the recognition, the alternatives to executing a recognition, and the benefits and responsibilities of establishing paternity are clear and understandable. The form must include a notice regarding the finality of a recognition and the revocation procedure under subdivision 2. The form must include a provision for each parent to verify that the parent has read or viewed the educational materials prepared by the commissioner of human services describing the recognition of paternity. The individual providing the form to the parents for execution shall provide oral notice of the rights, responsibilities, and alternatives to executing the recognition. Notice may be provided by audiotape, videotape, or similar means. Each parent must receive a copy of the recognition. Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 257.75, subdivision 7, is amended to read: Subd. 7. [HOSPITAL AND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH DISTRIBUTION OF EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS; RECOGNITION FORM.] Hospitals that provide obstetric services and the state registrar of vital statistics shall distribute the educational materials and recognition of parentage forms prepared by the commissioner of human services to new parents and shall assist parents in understanding the recognition of parentage form, including following the provisions for notice under subdivision 5. On and after January 1, 1994, hospitals may not distribute the declaration of parentage forms. Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 299C.46, subdivision 3, is amended to read: Subd. 3. [AUTHORIZED USE, FEE.] (a) The data communications network shall be used exclusively by: (1) criminal justice agencies in connection with the performance of duties required by law; (2) agencies investigating federal security clearances of individuals for assignment or retention in federal employment with duties related to national security, as required by Public Law Number 99-1691; and(3) other agencies to the extent necessary to provide for protection of the public or property in an emergency or disaster situation; and (4) the public authority responsible for child support enforcement in connection with the performance of its duties.

The court shall order the party with the better group dependent health and dental insurance coverage or health insurance plan to name the minor child as beneficiary on any health and dental insurance plan that is available to the party on: (i) a group basis; (ii) through an employer or union; or (iii) through a group health plan governed under the ERISA and included within the definitions relating to health plans found in section 62A.011, 62A.048, or 62E.06, subdivision 2. \"Health insurance\" or \"health insurance coverage\" as used in this section means coverage that is comparable to or better than a number two qualified plan as defined in section 62E.06, subdivision 2. \"Health insurance\" or \"health insurance coverage\" as used in this section does not include medical assistance provided under chapter 256, 256B, or 256D. (b) If the court finds that dependent health or dental insurance is not available to the obligor or obligee on a group basis or through an employer or union, or that group insurance is not accessible to the obligee, the court may require the obligor (1) to obtain other dependent health or dental insurance, (2) to be liable for reasonable and necessary medical or dental expenses of the child, or (3) to pay no less than $50 per month to be applied to the medical and dental expenses of the children or to the cost of health insurance dependent coverage. (c) If the court finds that the available dependent health or dental insurance does not pay all the reasonable and necessary medical or dental expenses of the child, including any existing or anticipated extraordinary medical expenses, and the court finds that the obligor has the financial ability to contribute to the payment of these medical or dental expenses, the court shall require the obligor to be liable for all or a portion of the medical or dental expenses of the child not covered by the required health or dental plan. Medical and dental expenses include, but are not limited to, necessary orthodontia and eye care, including prescription lenses. (d) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties and approved by the court, if the court finds that the obligee is not receiving public assistance for the child and has the financial ability to contribute to the cost of medical and dental expenses for the child, including the cost of insurance, the court shall order the obligee and obligor to each assume a portion of these expenses based on their proportionate share of their total net income as defined in section 518.54, subdivision 6. (e) Payments ordered under this section are subject to section 518.611.

[EFFECT OF ORDER.] (a) The order is binding on the employer or union and the health and dental insurance plan when service under subdivision 3 has been made. In the case of an obligor who changes employment and is required to provide health coverage for the child, a new employer that provides health care coverage shall enroll the child in the obligor's health plan upon receipt of an order or notice for health insurance, unless the obligor contests the enrollment. The obligor may contest the enrollment on the limited grounds that the enrollment is improper due to mistake of fact or that the enrollment meets the requirements of section 518.64, subdivision 2. If the obligor chooses to contest the enrollment, the obligor must do so no later than 15 days after the employer notifies the obligor of the enrollment, by doing all of the following: (1) filing a request for contested hearing according to section 518.5511, subdivision 3a; (2) serving a copy of the request for contested hearing upon the public authority and the obligee; and (3) securing a date for the contested hearing no later than 45 days after the notice of enrollment. (b) The enrollment must remain in place during the time period in which the obligor contests the withholding.

Upon receipt of the order, or uponapplication of the obligor pursuantaccording to the order or notice, the employer or union and its health and dental insurance plan shall enroll the minor child as a beneficiary in the group insurance plan and withhold any required premium from the obligor's income or wages. If more than one plan is offered by the employer or union, the child shall be enrolled in the least costly health insurance plan otherwise available to the obligor that is comparable to a number two qualified plan. If the obligor is not enrolled in a health insurance plan, the employer or union shall also enroll the obligor in the chosen plan if enrollment of the obligor is necessary in order to obtain dependent coverage under the plan. Enrollment of dependents and the obligor shall be immediate and not dependent upon open enrollment periods. Enrollment is not subject to the underwriting policies described in section 62A.048. (b)(c) An employer or union that willfully fails to comply with the order is liable for any health or dental expenses incurred by the dependents during the period of time the dependents were eligible to be enrolled in the insurance program, and for any other premium costs incurred because the employer or union willfully failed to comply with the order. An employer or union that fails to comply with the order is subject to contempt under section 518.615 and is also subject to a fine of $500 to be paid to the obligee or public authority. Fines paid to the public authority are designated for child support enforcement services. (c)(d) Failure of the obligor to execute any documents necessary to enroll the dependent in the group health and dental insurance plan will not affect the obligation of the employer or union and group health and dental insurance plan to enroll the dependent in a plan. Information and authorization provided by the public authority responsible for child support enforcement, or by the custodial parent or guardian, is valid for the purposes of meeting enrollment requirements of the health plan.

The court's order must be stayed for 90 days in order to allow the obligor to execute a written payment agreement regarding both current support and arrearages. The payment agreement must be approved by either the court or the public authority responsible for child support enforcement. If the obligor has not executed or is not in compliance with a written payment agreement regarding both current support and arrearages after the 90 days expires, the court's order becomes effective.

(b) Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures, and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this state and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner. (c) A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state.

(d) On issuance of an order modifying a child support order issued in another state, a tribunal of this state becomes the tribunal of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction. (e) Within 30 days after issuance of a modified child support order, the party obtaining the modification shall file a certified copy of the order with the issuing tribunal which had continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the earlier order, and in each tribunal in which the party knows that earlier order has been registered.Sec. 68.

[518C.613] [JURISDICTION TO MODIFY SUPPORT ORDER OF ANOTHER STATE WHEN INDIVIDUAL PARTIES RESIDE IN THIS STATE.] (a) If all of the parties who are individuals reside in this state and the child does not reside in the issuing state, a tribunal of this state has jurisdiction to enforce and to modify the issuing state's child support order in a proceeding to register that order. (b) A tribunal of this state exercising jurisdiction as provided in this section shall apply sections 518C.101 to 518C.209 and 518C.601 to 518C.614 to the enforcement or modification proceeding.

Timely payments are those made in the month in which they are due. If, after that time, the obligor fails to make complete and timely payments of both current support and court-ordered paybacks of child support debt or arrearage, the public authority or the obligee may move the court for the reinstatement of interest as of the month in which the obligor ceased making complete and timely payments.

From the time of docketing, the judgment is a lien upon all the real property in the county owned by the judgment debtor, but it is not a lien on registered land unless the obligee or the public authority causes a notice of judgment lien or certified copy of the judgment to be memorialized on the certificate of title or certificate of possessory title under section 508.63 or 508A.63.

Partial releases do not release the obligor's personal liability for the amount unpaid. Sec. 82. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 548.091, is amended by adding a subdivision to read: Subd. 12. [CORRECTING ERRORS.] The public authority shall maintain a process to review the identity of the obligor and to issue releases of lien in cases of misidentification.

[THIRD PARTY DISCLOSURE AND REMITTANCE.] Within 15 days after receipt of the notice of support judgment levy, unless governed by section 552.05, the third party shall disclose and remit to the public authority as much of the amount due as the third party's own debt equals to the judgment debtor. Subd. 6. [ORAL DISCLOSURE.] Before or after the service of a written disclosure by a third party under subdivision 5, upon a showing by affidavit upon information and belief that an oral examination of the third party would provide a complete disclosure of relevant facts, any party to the execution proceedings may obtain an ex parte order requiring the third party, or a representative of the third party designated by name or by title, to appear for oral examination before the court or a referee appointed by the court. Notice of the examination must be given to all parties. Subd. 7. [SUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT.] If a third party holds property, money, earnings, or other indebtedness by a title that is void as to the judgment debtor's creditors, the property may be levied on although the judgment debtor would be barred from maintaining an action to recover the property, money, earnings, or other indebtedness. In this and all other cases where the third party denies liability, the public authority may move the court at any time before the third party is discharged, on notice to both the judgment debtor and the third party for an order making the third party a party to supplemental action and granting the public authority leave to file a supplemental complaint against the third party and the judgment debtor. The supplemental complaint shall set forth the facts upon which the public authority claims to charge the third party. If probable cause is shown, the motion shall be granted. The supplemental complaint shall be served upon the third party and the judgment debtor and any other parties.

Judgment against the third party under this section shall not bar the public authority from further remedies under this chapter as a result of any subsequent defaults by the third party. The court upon good cause shown may remove the default and permit the third party to disclose or remit on just terms. Subd. 9. [SATISFACTION.] Upon expiration, the public authority making the execution may file a partial satisfaction by amount or, if applicable, shall file the total satisfaction with the court administrator without charge. Subd. 10. [THIRD PARTY GOOD FAITH REQUIREMENT.] The third party is not liable to the judgment debtor, public authority, or other person for wrongful retention if the third party retains or remits disposable earnings, indebtedness, or money of the judgment debtor or any other person, pending the third party's disclosure or consistent with the disclosure the third party makes, if the third party has a good faith belief that the property retained or remitted is subject to the execution. In addition, the third party may, at any time before or after disclosure, proceed under Rule 67 of the Minnesota rules of civil procedure to make deposit into court. No third party is liable for damages if the third party complies with the provisions of this chapter. Subd. 11. [BAD FAITH CLAIM.] If, in a proceeding brought under section 552.05, subdivision 9, or a similar proceeding under this chapter to determine a claim of exemption, the claim of exemption is not upheld, and the court finds that it was asserted in bad faith, the public authority shall be awarded actual damages, costs, reasonable attorney's fees resulting from the additional proceedings, and an amount not to exceed $100. If the claim of exemption is upheld, and the court finds that the public authority disregarded the claim of exemption in bad faith, the judgment debtor shall be awarded actual damages, costs, reasonable attorney's fees resulting from the additional proceedings, and an amount not to exceed $100. The underlying judgment shall be modified to reflect assessment of damages, costs, and attorney's fees. However, if the party in whose favor a penalty assessment is made is not actually indebted to that party's attorney for fees, the attorney's fee award shall be made directly to the attorney, and if not paid, an appropriate judgment in favor of the attorney shall be entered. Any action by a public authority made in bad faith and in violation of this chapter renders the execution levy void and the public authority liable to the judgment debtor named in the execution levy in the amount of $100, actual damages, and reasonable attorney's fees and costs. Subd. 12. [DISCHARGE OF A THIRD PARTY.] Subject to subdivisions 6 and 13, the third party, after disclosure, shall be discharged of any further obligation to the public authority when one of the following conditions is met: (a) The third party discloses that the third party is not indebted to the judgment debtor or does not possess any earnings, property, money, or indebtedness belonging to the judgment debtor that is attachable as defined in subdivision 2. The disclosure is conclusive against the public authority and discharges the third party from any further obligation to the public authority other than to retain and remit all nonexempt disposable earnings, property, indebtedness, or money of the judgment debtor which was disclosed. (b) The third party discloses that the third party is indebted to the judgment debtor as indicated on the execution disclosure form. The disclosure is conclusive against the public authority and discharges the third party from any further obligation to the public authority other than to retain and remit all nonexempt disposable earnings, property, indebtedness, or money of the judgment debtor that was disclosed. (c) The court may, upon motion of an interested person, discharge the third party as to any disposable earnings, money, property, or indebtedness in excess of the amount that may be required to satisfy the public authority's claim. Subd. 13. [EXCEPTIONS TO DISCHARGE OF A THIRD PARTY.] The third party is not discharged if: (a) Within 20 days of the service of the third party's disclosure, an interested person serves a motion relating to the execution levy. The hearing on the motion must be scheduled to be heard within 30 days of the service of the motion. (b) The public authority moves the court for leave to file a supplemental complaint against the third party, as provided for in subdivision 7, and the court upon proper showing vacates the discharge of the third party. Subd. 14. [JOINDER AND INTERVENTION BY PERSONS IN INTEREST.] If it appears that a person, who is not a party to the action, has or claims an interest in any of the disposable earnings, other indebtedness, or money, the court shall permit that person to intervene or join in the execution proceeding under this chapter. If that person does not appear, the court may summon that person to appear or order the claim barred. The person so appearing or summoned shall be joined as a party and be bound by the judgment. Subd. 15. [APPEAL.] A party to an execution proceeding aggrieved by an order or final judgment may appeal as allowed by law. Subd. 16. [PRIORITY OF LEVY.] Notwithstanding section 52.12, a levy by the public authority made under this section on an obligor's funds on deposit in a financial institution located in this state has priority over any unexercised right of setoff of the financial institution to apply the levied funds toward the balance of an outstanding loan or loans owed by the obligor to the financial institution. A claim by the financial institution that it exercised its right to setoff prior to the levy by the public authority must be substantiated by evidence of the date of the setoff and must be verified by the sworn statement of a responsible corporate officer of the financial institution. For purposes of determining the priority of a levy made under this section, the levy must be treated as if it were an execution made under chapter 550. Sec. 89. [552.05] [SUMMARY EXECUTION UPON FUNDS AT A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.] Subdivision 1. [PROCEDURE.] In addition to the provisions of section 552.04, when levying upon funds at a financial institution, the public authority must comply with this section.

The underlying judgment must be modified to reflect assessment of damages, costs, and attorney fees. However, if the party in whose favor a penalty assessment is made is not actually indebted to the party's attorney for fees, the attorney's fee award shall be made directly to the attorney and if not paid, an appropriate judgment in favor of the attorney shall be entered. Upon motion of any party in interest, on notice, the office of administrative hearings shall determine the validity of any claim of exemption, and may make any order necessary to protect the rights of those interested.

[STUDY; WAIVER APPLICATION.] The commissioner shall authorize a study to assess the need for home and community-based waivers for chronically ill children who have been and will continue to be hospitalized without a waiver, and for disabled individuals under the age of 65 who are likely to reside in an acute care or nursing home facility in the absence of a waiver. If a need for these waivers can be demonstrated, the commissioner shall apply for federal waivers necessary to secure, to the extent allowed by law, federal participation under United States Code, title 42, sections 1396-1396p, as amended through December 31, 1982, for the provision of home and community-based services to chronically ill children who, in the absence of such a waiver, would remain in an acute care setting, and to disabled individuals under the age of 65 who, in the absence of a waiver, would reside in an acute care or nursing home setting. If the need is demonstrated, the commissioner shall request a waiver under United States Code, title 42, sections 1396-1396p, to allow medicaid eligibility for blind or disabled children with ineligible parents where income deemed from the parents would cause the applicant to be ineligible for supplemental security income if the family shared a household and to furnish necessary services in the home or community to disabled individuals under the age of 65 who would be eligible for medicaid if institutionalized in an acute care or nursing home setting. These waivers are requested to furnish necessary services in the home and community setting to children or disabled adults under age 65 who are medicaid eligible when institutionalized in an acute care or nursing home setting. The commissioner shall assure that the cost of home and community-based care will not be more than the cost of care if the eligible child or disabled adult under age 65 were to remain institutionalized. The average monthly limit for the cost of home and community-based services to a community alternative care waiver client, determined on a 12-month basis, shall not exceed the statewide average medical assistance adjusted base year operating cost for nursing and accommodation services under sections 256.9685 to 256.969 for the diagnostic category to which the waiver client would be assigned except the admission and outlier rates shall be converted to an overall per diem. The average monthly limit for the cost of services to a traumatic brain injury neurobehavioral hospital waiver client, determined on a 12-month basis, shall not exceed the statewide average medical assistance adjusted base-year operating cost for nursing and accommodation services of neurobehavioral rehabilitation programs in Medicare designated long-term hospitals under sections 256.9685 to 256.969. The following costs must be included in determining the total average monthly costs for a waiver client: (1) cost of all waivered services; and (2) cost of skilled nursing, private duty nursing, home health aide, and personal care services reimbursable by medical assistance. The commissioner of human services shall seek federal waivers as necessary to implement the average monthly limit. The commissioner shall seek to amend the federal waivers obtained under this section to apply criteria to protect against spousal impoverishment as authorized under United States Code, title 42, section 1396r-5, and as implemented in sections 256B.0575, 256B.058, and 256B.059, except that the amendment shall seek to add to the personal needs allowance permitted in section 256B.0575, an amount equivalent to the group residential housing rate as set by section 256I.03, subdivision 5. Sec. 25. Laws 1995, chapter 207, article 8, section 41, subdivision 2, is amended to read: Subd. 2. [PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION.] (a) The pilot projects shall be established to design, plan, and improve the mental health service delivery system for adults with serious and persistent mental illness that would: (1) provide an expanded array of services from which clients can choose services appropriate to their needs; (2) be based on purchasing strategies that improve access and coordinate services without cost shifting; (3) incorporate existing state facilities and resources into the community mental health infrastructure through creative partnerships with local vendors; and (4) utilize existing categorical funding streams and reimbursement sources in combined and creative ways, except appropriations to regional treatment centers and all funds that are attributable to the operation of state-operated services are excluded unless appropriated specifically by the legislature for a purpose consistent with this section. (b) All projects funded by January 1, 1997, must complete theirthe planning phase and be operational by June 30, 1997; all projects funded by January 1, 1998, must be operational by June 30, 1998. Sec. 26. [NAMES REQUIRED ON GRAVES.] Unless the individual's family indicates otherwise to the appropriate authority, the commissioner of human services with assistance of the communities in which regional treatment centers are located and in consultation with the state council on disability shall replace numbers with the names of individuals whose graves are located at regional treatment centers operated by the commissioner or formerly operated by the commissioner. The commissioner and the state council on disability shall develop a plan to accomplish this systematically over a five-year period. The individual names may be placed on a central marker or memorial for a designated cemetery. Sec. 27. [WAIVER AMENDMENT.] By July 15, 1997, the commissioner of human services shall submit proposed amendments to the Health Care Financing Administration for changes in the home and community-based waiver for persons with mental retardation or a related condition that maximize the number of persons served within the limits of appropriations and divert persons from institutional placement. The commissioner shall monitor county utilization of allocated resources and, as appropriate, reassign resources not utilized. Priority consideration for the reassignment of resources shall be given to counties who enter into written agreements with other counties to jointly plan, request resources, and develop services for persons with mental retardation or a related condition who are screened and waiting for waivered services. In addition to the priorities listed in Minnesota Rules, part 9525.1880, the commissioner shall also give priority consideration to persons whose living situations are unstable due to the age or incapacity of the primary caregiver. The commissioner shall report to the chairs of the senate health and family security budget division and the house health and human services finance division by March 1, 1998, on the results of the waiver amendment, the authorization and utilization of waivered services for persons with mental retardation or a related condition, including crisis respite services, plans to increase the number of counties working together, additional persons served by the reassignment of resources, and options which would allow an increased number of persons to be served within the existing appropriation. Sec. 28. [REQUEST FOR WAIVER.] By January 1, 1998, the commissioner of human services or health shall request a waiver from the federal Department of Health and Human Services to permit the use of the alternative quality assurance system to license and certify intermediate care facilities for persons with mental retardation.

[CAPITATION PAYMENT.] (a) The commissioner shall pay a capitation payment to the county authority and, when applicable under subdivision 6, paragraph (a), to the service delivery organization for each medical assistance eligible enrollee. The commissioner shall develop capitation payment rates for the initial contract period for each demonstration site in consultation with an independent actuary, to ensure that the cost of services under the demonstration project does not exceed the estimated cost for medical assistance services for the covered population under the fee-for-service system for the demonstration period. For each year of the demonstration project, the capitation payment rate shall be based on 96 percent of the projected per person costs that would otherwise have been paid under medical assistance fee-for-service during each of those years. Rates shall be adjusted within the limits of the available risk adjustment technology, as mandated by section 62Q.03. In addition, the commissioner shall implement appropriate risk and savings sharing provisions with county administrative entities and, when applicable under subdivision 6, paragraph (a), service delivery organizations within the projected budget limits. Any savings beyond those allowed for the county authority, county administrative entity, or service delivery organization shall be first used to meet the unmet needs of eligible individuals. Payments to providers participating in the project are exempt from the requirements of sections 256.966 and 256B.03, subdivision 2. (b) The commissioner shall monitor and evaluate annually the effect of the discount on consumers, the county authority, and providers of disability services. Findings shall be reported and recommendations made, as appropriate, to ensure that the discount effect does not adversely affect the ability of the county administrative entity or providers of services to provide appropriate services to eligible individuals, and does not result in cost shifting of eligible individuals to the county authority. Subd. 11. [INTEGRATION OF FUNDING SOURCES.] The county authority may integrate other local, state, and federal funding sources with medical assistance funding. The commissioner's approval is required for integration of state and federal funds but not for local funds. During the demonstration project period, county authorities must maintain the level of local funds expended during the previous calendar year for populations covered in the demonstration project. Excluding the state share of Medicaid payments, state appropriations for state-operated services shall not be integrated unless specifically approved by the legislature. The commissioner may approve integration of other state and federal funding if the intergovernmental contract includes assurances that the people who would have been served by these funds will receive comparable or better services. The commissioner may withdraw approval for integration of state and federal funds if the county authority does not comply with these assurances. If the county authority chooses to integrate funding, it must comply with the reporting requirements of the commissioner, as specified in the intergovernmental contract, to account for federal and state Medicaid expenditures and expenditures of local funds. The commissioner, upon the request and concurrence of a county authority, may transfer state grant funds that would otherwise be made available to the county authority to provide continuing care for enrollees to the medical assistance account and, within the limits of federal authority and available federal funding, the commissioner shall adjust the capitation based on the amount of this transfer.

Service coordinators may only provide services and supports if the enrollee is informed of potential conflicts of interest, is given alternatives, and gives informed consent. Eligible service coordinators are individuals age 18 or older who meet the qualifications as described in paragraph (b). Enrollees, their legal representatives, or their advocates are eligible to be service coordinators if they have the capabilities to perform the activities and functions outlined in paragraph (b). Providers licensed under chapter 245A to provide residential services, or providers who are providing residential services covered under the group residential housing program may not act as service coordinator for enrollees for whom they provide residential services. This does not apply to providers of short-term detoxification services. Each county administrative entity or service delivery organization may develop further criteria for eligible vendors of service coordination during the demonstration period and shall determine whom it contracts with or employs to provide service coordination. County administrative entities and service delivery organizations may pay enrollees or their advocates or legal representatives for service coordination activities. (b) The service coordinator shall act as a facilitator, working in partnership with the enrollee to ensure that their needs are identified and addressed. The level of involvement of the service coordinator shall depend on the needs and desires of the enrollee. The service coordinator shall have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to, and is responsible for: (1) arranging for an initial assessment, and periodic reassessment as necessary, of supports and services based on the enrollee's strengths, needs, choices, and preferences in life domain areas; (2) developing and updating the personal support plan based on relevant ongoing assessment; (3) arranging for and coordinating the provisions of supports and services, including knowledgeable and skilled specialty services and prevention and early intervention services, within the limitations negotiated with the county administrative entity or service delivery organization; (4) assisting the enrollee and the enrollee's legal representative, if any, to maximize informed choice of and control over services and supports and to exercise the enrollee's rights and advocate on behalf of the enrollee; (5) monitoring the progress toward achieving the enrollee's outcomes in order to evaluate and adjust the timeliness and adequacy of the implementation of the personal support plan; (6) facilitating meetings and effectively collaborating with a variety of agencies and persons, including attending individual family service plan and individual education plan meetings when requested by the enrollee or the enrollee's legal representative; (7) soliciting and analyzing relevant information; (8) communicating effectively with the enrollee and with other individuals participating in the enrollee's plan; (8) educating and communicating effectively with the enrollee about good health care practices and risk to the enrollee's health with certain behaviors; (10) having knowledge of basic enrollee protection requirements, including data privacy; (11) informing, educating, and assisting the enrollee in identifying available service providers and accessing needed resources and services beyond the limitations of the medical assistance benefit set covered services; and (12) providing other services as identified in the person support plan. (c) For the demonstration project, the qualifications and standards for service coordination in this section shall replace comparable existing provisions of existing statutes and rules governing case management for eligible individuals. (d) The provisions of this subdivision apply only to the demonstration sites that begin implementation on July 1, 1998. Subd. 13.

External advocacy contractors must demonstrate that they have the expertise to advocate on behalf of all categories of eligible individuals and are independent of the commissioner, county authority, county administrative entity, service delivery organization, or any service provider within the demonstration project. These advocacy services shall be provided through the ombudsman for mental health and mental retardation directly, or under contract with private, nonprofit organizations, with funding provided through the demonstration project. The funding shall be provided annually to the ombudsman's office based on 0.1 percent of the projected per person costs that would otherwise have been paid under medical assistance fee-for-service during those years.

[PUBLIC GUARDIANSHIP ALTERNATIVES.] Each county authority with enrollees under public guardianship shall develop a plan to discharge all those public guardianships and establish appropriate private alternatives during the demonstration period. The commissioner shall provide county authorities with funding for public guardianship alternatives during the first year of the demonstration project based on a proposal to establish private alternatives for a specific number of enrollees under public guardianship. Funding in subsequent years shall be based on the county authority's performance in achieving discharges of public guardianship and establishing appropriate alternatives. The commissioner may establish fiscal incentives to encourage county activity in this area. For each year of the demonstration period, an appropriation is available to the commissioner based on 0.2 percent of the projected per person costs that would otherwise have been paid under medical assistance fee-for-service for that year.

Subd. 17. [APPROVAL OF ALTERNATIVES.] The commissioner may approve alternatives to administrative rules if the commissioner determines that appropriate alternative measures are in place to protect the health, safety, and rights of enrollees and to assure that services are of sufficient quality to produce the outcomes described in the personal support plans. Prior approved waivers, if needed by the demonstration project, shall be extended. The commissioner shall not waive the rights or procedural protections under sections 245.825; 245.91 to 626.557; or procedures for the monitoring of psychotropic medications.

(b) The commissioner may reject any proposal if, in the judgment of the commissioner, a contract with a particular facility is not in the best interests of the residents of the facility or the state of Minnesota. The commissioner may accept up to the number of proposals that can be adequately supported with available state resources, as determined by the commissioner , except that the commissioner shall not contract with more than 40 nursing facilities as part of any request for proposals.

The commissioner shall present recommendations to the legislature by February 1, 1996, on the number of nursing facility contracts that may be entered into by the commissioner as a result of a request for proposals.(c) In issuing the request for proposals, the commissioner may develop reasonable requirements which, in the judgment of the commissioner, are necessary to protect residents or ensure that the contractual alternative payment demonstration project furthers the interest of the state of Minnesota. The request for proposals may include, but need not be limited to, the following: (1) a requirement that a nursing facility make reasonable efforts to maximize Medicare payments on behalf of eligible residents; (2) requirements designed to prevent inappropriate or illegal discrimination against residents enrolled in the medical assistance program as compared to private paying residents; (3) requirements designed to ensure that admissions to a nursing facility are appropriate and that reasonable efforts are made to place residents in home and community-based settings when appropriate; (4) a requirement to agree to participate in a project to develop data collection systems and outcome-based standards for managed care contracting for long-term care services. Among other requirements specified by the commissioner, each facility entering into a contract may be required to pay an annual fee in an amount determined by the commissioner not to exceed $50 per bed.

A facility's compliance history shall not be the sole determining factor in situations where the facility has been sold and the new owners have submitted a proposal; (2) whether the facility has a record of excessive licensure fines or sanctions or fraudulent cost reports; (3) financial history and solvency; and (4) other factors identified by the commissioner that the commissioner deems relevant to a determination that a contract with a particular facility is not in the best interests of the residents of the facility or the state of Minnesota. (e) If the commissioner rejects the proposal of a nursing facility, the commissioner shall provide written notice to the facility of the reason for the rejection, including the factors and evidence upon which the rejection was based.

(c) A nursing facility's case mix payment rates for the second and subsequent years of a facility's contract under this section are the previous rate year's contract payment rates plus an inflation adjustment. The index for the inflation adjustment must be based on the change in the Consumer Price Index-All Items (United States City average) (CPI-U) forecasted by Data Resources, Inc., as forecasted in the fourth quarter of the calendar year preceding the rate year. The inflation adjustment must be based on the 12-month period from the midpoint of the previous rate year to the midpoint of the rate year for which the rate is being determined. (d) The commissioner mayshall develop additional incentive-based payments of up to five percent above the standard contract rate for achieving outcomes specified in each contract. The incentive system may be implemented for contract rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1996.The specified facility-specific outcomes must be measurable and must be based on criteria to be developedand approved by the commissioner. The commissioner may establish, for each contract, various levels of achievement within an outcome. After the outcomes have been specified the commissioner shall assign various levels of payment associated with achieving the outcome. Any incentive-based payment cancels if there is a termination of the contract. In establishing the specified outcomes and related criteria the commissioner shall consider the following state policy objectives: (1) improved cost effectiveness and quality of life as measured by improved clinical outcomes; (2) successful diversion or discharge to community alternatives; (3) decreased acute care costs; (4) improved consumer satisfaction; (5) the achievement of quality; or (6) any additional outcomes proposed by a nursing facility that the commissioner finds desirable.
