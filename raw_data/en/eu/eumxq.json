Many patients experience PTS as some combination of chronic leg heaviness, fatigue, swelling, aching, and paresthesia that can be managed with modest lifestyle changes (e.g. rest periods with leg elevation). Disabling (moderate-to-severe) PTS, on the other hand, occurs in approximately 50% of patients who develop PTS and produces physical limitations comparable to severe chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and rheumatoid arthritis, resulting in work disability, inability to perform household tasks, and major impairment of health-related quality of life. In clinical practice, patients with disabling PTS frequently have chronic iliac vein obstruction (from previous iliac vein thrombosis orstenosis). Such patients with \"disabling iliac-obstructive prone short-distance venous claudication with \"bursting\" pain, necessitating cessation of walking or exercise, 2) massive edema that, because it involves the thigh as well as the calf, is markedly restrictive to activity and less amenable to relief with compression therapy, 3) chronic pain syndromes that often prompt chronic use of pain medications, and 4) venous ulcers that profoundly impair the quality of life, cause local and systemic infection, and/or require surgical therapy.
