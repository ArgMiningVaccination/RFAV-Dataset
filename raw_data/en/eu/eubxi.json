Chiropractic care is used most often to treat musculoskeletal conditions, including back pain, neck pain, pain in the joints of the arms or legs, and headaches. Our team of Chiropractic Doctors practice a drug-free, hands-on approach to health care that includes patient examination, diagnosis and treatment. They have broad diagnostic skills and are also trained to recommend therapeutic and rehabilitative exercises, as well as to provide nutritional, dietary and lifestyle counseling. \"Spinal manipulation,\" also called \"chiropractic adjustment,\" is one of the most commonly performed therapeutic procedures. Its purpose is to restore joint mobility by manually applying a controlled force into joints that have restricted movement as a result of a tissue injury. Tissue injury can be caused by a single traumatic event, such as a motor vehicle accident or improper lifting of a heavy object, or through repetitive stresses, such as sitting in an awkward position with poor spinal posture for an extended period of time. In either case, injured tissues undergo physical and chemical changes that can cause inflammation, pain, and diminished function. The chiropractic adjustment can restore mobility, thereby alleviating pain and muscle tightness, enabling tissues to heal. Importance of Chiropractic Care for Back Pain Relief Occasional back pain is common, but it is crucial to find some relief when it begins to affect your day-to-day life. Chiropractic care can reduce pain and restore functionality, but it does take a few sessions to show improvement. For chiropractic care to be effective, a chiropractor will determine a plan that is specific to you and your pain. An example of this plan could be two to three short sessions a week for four weeks and then once a month after your pain starts to diminish. It is important to remember that one visit will not take your pain away; it takes time and patience to get the back pain relief you are looking for. At Albany Chiropractic & Physical Therapy, we take pride in providing back pain relief with chiropractic care. Our chiropractic professionals will listen to your back pain relief goals, assess your condition, and determine the best treatment plan for you and your back.

How Can Chiropractic Care Help You Recover from Car Accident Injuries? Skip the medication - As tempting as it may be to get temporary pain relief from taking medication for the pain after a car accident, you may want to avoid it. A better option is to go see a chiropractor and have them help you recover from your car accident injury by making natural adjustments to your body. Reduce inflammation - Being injured in a car accident can cause inflammation, which ultimately will manifest itself as pain. Visiting a chiropractor will get rid of that inflammation because adjusting your body will release natural anti-inflammatory chemicals which will promote healing. Help get mobility back - Your mobility is directly tied to how much inflammation you have after a car accident. This is why doctors usually recommend going to a chiropractor when you are dealing with a car accident injury. When you have a car accident injury you can't move your neck or back like you were able to before the accident, but that can typically be improved with regular chiropractic care. Our Chiropractors Offer Back Pain Treatment & More In many cases, such as lower back pain, chiropractic care is often the \"go-to\" method of treatment. Headaches often have their cause in the spine itself, and chiropractic care during pregnancy can be an amazing drug free solution to pain, and can even decrease the pain that can occur during delivery. Our chiropractors may assess you through clinical examination, laboratory testing, diagnostic imaging, or other diagnostic interventions to determine when chiropractic treatment is appropriate or when it is not appropriate. When chiropractic care is not suitable for your condition or your situation warrants co-management in conjunction with other members of the health care team, we can refer you to the appropriate health care provider.
