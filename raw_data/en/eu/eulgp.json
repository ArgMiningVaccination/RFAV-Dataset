Vaccination enables immunity to be achieved in broad sections of the population. The aim is to counter the spread of the virus, reduce the potential health -re- lated consequences of infection and prevent the health system from being overrun. How- ever, developing and introducing new vaccine s in pandemic conditions is challenging. This is the backdrop against which the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG), together with the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), and t he Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA), presented the \"National COVID -19 Vaccination Strategy: Strat- egy to Introduce and Evaluate a Vaccine against SARS -CoV -2 in Germany\" on 6 November 2020 . That document set s out the key components of the national COVID -19 vaccination strategy and describes the systems to ensure vaccination of the German population ac- cording to uniform standards along with timely evaluation of the vaccines following their widespread applicatio n. More than 280 different COVID -19 vaccine candidates, some on the basis of novel vaccine platforms, are currently under development worldwide (as of 8 June 2021). The first four vaccines have received central EU approval since December 2020. On 31 May 20 21, ap- proval for the BioNTech vaccine (Comirnaty\u00ae) was extended to include adolescents from age 12. Moderna has likewise applied for approval for its vaccine to be extended to adoles- cents from age 12. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is currently consid ering that application. Other promising vaccine candidates are expected to be approved this year. The objective is to provide safe and effective vaccines as soon as possible and in sufficient quantities. The Federal Government is thus actively engaged in vaccine procurement and in the expansion of production capacity to be able to provide reliable vaccines in sufficient quantities. Vaccination in vaccination centres and with mobile vaccination teams began on 27 De- cember 2020. The basic aim is to make vaccin es available to the entire population once approved. However, the supply of vaccines has been limited from the outset. As a result, the Standing Committee on Vaccination ( St\u00e4ndige Impfkommission - STIKO) initially called in its vaccination recommendations for the prioritisation of specific groups of per- sons who need to be vaccinated first. This was made law in the Coronavirus Vaccination Ordinance (Coronavirus -Impfverordnung - CoronaImpfV ). The prioritisation was lifted on 7 June 2021 under the revised Ordi nance of 1 June 2021. Over 67 million vaccine doses have already been administered in Germany. More than 42 million people have been vaccinated at least once (51.2%) and over 26 million (31.6%) are already fully vaccinated. Over half of the German populati on have thus already been vac- cinated at least once and almost a third are already fully vaccinated (as of 22 June 2021). 4 The target is to be able to offer vaccination to the entire population by the end of summer 2021. In April, in view of the progress mad e in the vaccination campaign, some of Ger- many's 16 L\u00e4nder went over to offering vaccinations to persons in prioritisation group 3 (moderately high priority) and started allowing people to make appointments. All L\u00e4nder had taken this step by the end of May 2021. On 17 May 2021, the German Health Ministers Conference (GMK) decided to cease prioritising from 7 June 2021 and to open the vaccina- tion campaign to all those willing to be vaccinated. This was enacted into law in the Coro- navirus Vaccination Ordinanc Teil Section of the Federal Gazette] of 2 June 2021). Because of the quantities of vaccines ex- pected to be delivered, it should be emphasised that it will not be possible to vaccinate all those willing t o be vaccinated in the course of June. As has been announce d, the vaccina- tion campaign will have to continue in this form until the end of summer 2021. This (updated) National COVID -19 Vaccination Strategy constitutes a revision of the Na- tional Vaccination Strategy of 6 November 2020 , taking into account the current status as described above. In particular, deprioritisation from 7 June 2021 has taken the vaccination strategy into a new phase. Primarily in view of the initial target group prioritisation, the ongoing limited number of vaccine doses and in some cases certain product characteristics (such as storage and transport conditions and supply in multi -dose vials), it continues to make sense to cond uct vaccinations in central vaccination centres and using mobile teams , and this remains a central component of the National Vaccination Strategy. Organ- isationally speaking, vaccination has been placed on a far broader basis since April 2021. Since 6 April 2021, statutory health insurance (SHI) -accredited medical practices have been included in the vaccination campaign. This was initially limited to general medical practices but was subsequently extended to include specialist medical practices and from 7 June 2021 also private medical practices. Likewise commencing 7 June 2021, vaccinations can now be obtained in the workplace, where they are provided by workplace occupa- tional physicians or occupational medicine service providers. These steps are included in the newly inserted Phase II of vaccination under the updated National Vaccination Strat- egy, the previous Phase I having been subdivided for the purpose. The long -term goal is a transition to routine vaccination, meaning Phase III of the National Vaccinati on Strategy (previously Phase II in the strategy as of 6 November 2020). In light of the pandemic situation, the use of novel vaccine platform technologies, high public expectations and multiple vaccines with different product properties being used simulta neously, close communication and scientific support are needed to ensure safe and successful implementation of the COVID -19 vaccination strategy. Like its predecessor, this (updated) National Vaccination Strategy sets out the key compo- nents of the COVID -19 vaccination campaign and describes the systems ensuring vaccina- tion of the German population according to uniform standards along with timely evaluation of the vaccines following their widespread application. 5 The strategy also includes a number of additio nal instruments. For example, the digital vaccination certificate has been introduced and provides a new, additional means of veri- fying vaccination status towards third parties. Instead of showing their vaccination date, vaccine and name in analogue , print ed form, users can now conveniently store this infor- mation on their smartphones. The rollout of the digital vaccination certificate will con- tinue step by step during June 2021. Looking ahead, it is also necessary to consider the question of any booster vac cinations that may be necessary and also that of second generation vaccinations (adapted to muta- tions). This will depend on research into the duration of immunity and on the further path of the pandemic. Table 1 gives an overview of the components and stakeholders in the National Vaccination Strategy.

Overview: COVID -19 vaccines and vaccine development Vaccine development takes place in various phases, from the exploratory and pre -clinical phase with trials on laboratory animals, to clinical phases 1, 2 and 3 with trials on huma ns, to marketing authorisation. Figure 1: Overview of the phases of vaccine development After producing a potential vaccine candidate in the research laboratory, initial animal and cell culture experiments are conducted to assess whether, in addition to tolerability, the vaccine candidate is capable of producing a protective effect against the target patho- gen or the infectious disease caused by it, where an animal model exists for this purpose. Subsequently, toxicological and pharmacological properties are evaluated in various ani- mal models. Only when th ere is no doubt as to safety for use on humans is a first clinical trial performed to assess the vaccine candidate 's safety on healthy human adult volunteers (Phase 1). In the subsequent clinical trial phases , the optimal dosage and vaccination schedule ar e tested in a larger number of volunteers (several hundred) (Phase 2) and then the efficacy and side -effect profile of the vaccine are determined in a large, randomised, controlled clinical study (Phase 3) with several thousand volunteers from different ag e groups. Four COVID -19 vaccines have now been authorised for the EU market. In addition, vari- ous novel vaccine candidates (such as protein, mRNA and vector vaccines) continue to be being developed and clinically tested on a variety of manufacturing platfo rms. The Fed- eral Government supports vaccine research and production and, seeing it as a global re- sponsibility, advocates fair global distribution of vaccines. For example, the Federal Exploratory Phase Aim: Identification of vaccine candidatesPre-clinical Phase Aim: Identification of safe vaccine candidates, production in good manufacturing practiceClinical Phase 1 Aim: Safety, toleranceClinical Phase 2 Aim: Dose optimisationClinical Phase 3 Aim: Proof of efficacy and safetyMarket - ing author - isation 7 Government has been a full member of the Coalition for Epidemic Prepare dness Innova- tions (CEPI) since its inception in 2017. In this connection, the Federal Government has provided additional funding for SARS -CoV -2 vaccine development in 2020/2021. The Fed- eral Government also directly funded the development of the BioNTech an d CureVac vac- cines. Table 2 focuses on COVID -19 vaccines already authorised for the EU market, plus vaccine candidates for which it is known that such authorisation is aimed for, where the vaccines or vaccine candidates are or may be available for the ongo ing national vaccination cam- paign.

Pharmaceutical companies and research institutes develop vaccines and obtain their approval. 8 2. COVID -19 vaccine approval Approval of the approved COVID -19 vaccines and vaccine candidates listed in Table 2 is granted by the European Commission for all EU member states following a centralised assessment procedure coordinated by the EMA. The approval p rocedure demonstrate s vaccine efficacy, pharmaceutical quality and safety, thus ensuring that the medicinal products administered to patients are of appropriate quality and demonstrate a positive risk-benefit ratio. It is possible for COVID -19 vaccines to be assessed in a fast -track procedure. In such a fast - track procedure, which was used for the four approved vaccines, individual data packages are submitted to and assessed by the EMA as they become available, even before official marketing authorisation i s granted. If sufficient data is available to assess the pharmaceutical quality, efficacy and safety of a vaccine in terms of its risk -benefit ratio, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommend s to the EMA that the vaccine be approved if t he risk -benefit ratio is fa- vourable. Based on that recommendation, the European Commission grants central EU approval. The Paul Ehrlich Institute or another government control laboratory in Europe tests batches of vaccine experimentally before they are marketed. Based on this testing, the Paul Ehrlich Institute issues batch release. Subsequent to approval, vaccines continue to be assessed for a positive benefit/risk ratio as part of pharmacovigilance (drug safety monitoring), and experience with their use is continuously and systematically collected and evaluated. 3. Vaccine recommendations and vaccine requirements Based at the Robert Ko ch Institute, the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) , a statutory entity, has the task of drawing up and issuing vaccine recommendations for Ger- many. Whereas the main focus during the approval process is on the safety, efficacy and quality of a new vaccine, STIKO decides how an approved vaccine can best be applied within the population. This goes beyond an individual risk -benefit assessment and also takes in the potential effects on the population (such as maximum reduction in the num- ber of deaths or a reduction in virus transmission). Marketing authorisation for COVID -19 vaccines at EU level is granted by the Euro- pean Commission. The Paul Ehrlich Institute issues batch release after experimental testing of vaccine batche s by PEI or another European government control laboratory. Subsequent to approval, vaccines continue to be assessed for a positive benefit/risk ratio as part of pharmacovigilance. 9 All STIKO vaccination recommendations are based on a detailed and thorough evalua- tion of the currently available evidence. In particular, this includes the assessment of risk factors (for infection or serious illness) a nd the safety and efficacy of the available vaccines. At present, there is still insufficient vaccine to meet demand for COVID -19 vaccinations. For this reason, from the commencement of vaccination on 27 December 2020, vaccina- tion was initially normally on ly offered to groups at a particularly high risk of a severe or fatal course of COVID -19 or to those who in their work have particular exposure to or close contact to vulnerable groups. Prioritisation of the groups was based on infectiological, epidemiolog ical and ethical criteria taking into account a position paper jointly devel- oped by STIKO, the German Ethics Council and Leopoldina. The first STIKO recommendation for COVID -19 vaccination was published shortly after approval of the first COVID -19 vaccine (BioNTech) on 17 December 2020. STIKO regularly evaluates its COVID -19 vaccination recommendation taking into account vaccination rates, vaccination acceptance and vaccine efficacy and safety studies. Further- more, STIKO continuously reviews the scientific ally published data on vaccines - col- lected among other things in the course of approval and in post -marketing surveillance subsequent to approval - and adjusts its recommendation as necessary. Updates were made on 8 and 29 January, 12 March, 1 and 8 April , 12 May and 10 June 2021. A further update on deprioritisation is imminent (as of 22 June 2021). STIKO has also issued supple- mentary position statements. Prioritisation is enacted in law in the Coronavirus Vaccination Ordinance issued by BMG. This is larg ely based on STIKO's COVID -19 vaccination recommendation and divides those eligible for vaccination into three prioritisation groups based on the previously mentioned criteria. The Ordinance is continuously evaluated and updated in line with current develo pments. Prioritisation was lifted on 7 June 2021. However, the L\u00e4nder may choose to retain prioritisation in vaccination centres for the time being. The legislative amendments were made in the Coronavirus Vaccination Ordinance of 1 June 2021 (Bun- desanzeige r Amtlicher Teil [Official Section of the Federal Gazette] of 2 June 2021). It is possible that SARS -CoV -2 will become endemic and continue to cause illness in the population after the pandemic, meaning vaccination against COVID -19 - including against the virus variants now in circulation - is also expected to be necessary in the longer term (in the post -pandemic phase). 10 4. Production and procurement To ensure the availability of sufficient quantities of COVID -19 vaccines in Germany as quickly as possible, the Federal Government procures vaccines centrally via an EU pro- curement mechanism. In view of current plans at EU level, vaccine procurement may re- main with the Federal Government for the foreseeable future (and at least until the end of 2023). In the event of promising development and research projects, the European Com- mission agrees advance purchase agreements with manufacturers on behalf of the EU member states. Bilateral agreements are additionally entered into with individual compa- nies as required. These agreements ensure that people have early access to successfully tested, safe vaccines as soon as they are approved for use in the EU. The agreem ents also enable manufacturers to build up production capacity in line with the scientific onward development of the vac- cines, allowing faster supply following approval. The EU has already secured access to as many as 4.36 billion doses of vaccine for the EU population from various manufacturers . These doses are generally shared among the EU member states in proportion to their respective populations. Negotiations with companies have also begun at EU level for the purchase of additional vaccine doses for 20 22 and 2023. The European Commission has already signed a contract for 1.8 billion doses with BioN- Tech/Pfizer for 2022 and 2023. This also includes vaccines against mutations and for chil- dren under 12. The Federal Government is providing the industry with support in order to secure the production processes for the supply of the required vaccine doses in 2021 and to expand production capacity in 2022 and beyond. To coordinate this task, the interdepartmental Vaccine Production Task Force was established at t he Federal Ministry for Economic Af- fairs and Energy in March 2021. The task force also liaises with the EU, which is likewise It was initially necessary to prioritise groups of persons who needed to be vaccinated first. STIKO, in collaboration with the German E thics Council and the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, previously developed ethical guidelines to aid that prioritisa- tion. In addition, STIKO drew up a recommendation for the use of available, approved COVID -19 vaccines (STIKO COVID -19 vaccination recommend ation). The STIKO recommendation is updated to continuously adapt and align it in accord- ance with the current status of evidence and the available vaccines. Until it was withdrawn, prioritisation was enacted in law - along with other stipula- tions that rema in in force - in the Coronavirus Vaccination Ordinance (Coronavirus - Impfverordnung - CoronaImpfV) issued by BMG. Prioritisation was lifted on 7 June 2021 under the revised Coronavirus Vaccination Ordinance of 1 June 2021. 11 acting to secure production capacity. In February 2021, the European Commission issued a communication, \"HERA Incubator: Anticipat ing together the threat of COVID -19 vari- ants\". An objective of HERA Incubator is to help secure industrial production capacity for COVID -19 vaccines and thus achieve sufficient supply quantities, including for the longer term in view of the potential need to adapt vaccines to variants. 5. Distribution, storage and logistics Proper and safe transport is necessary to ensure that COVID -19 vaccines arrive unharmed at the locations where they are to be administered to vacci ne recipients in all 16 L\u00e4nder (primarily vaccination centres, medical practices and contracted workplace occupational physicians). Special requirements for transport and storage conditions must be taken into account dur- ing planning: Certain vaccines (such as mRNA vaccines) require special conditions for long -time storage ( cold chain with temperatures below 60 \u00b0C). By generating additional data, a number of manufacturers have already succeeded at continuously improving and simplifying the storage and transport requirements with the result that short -term storage and transport are now possible at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C provided that certain rules are complied with. Vaccines currently come in multi -dose vials . The manufacturers do not supply the neces- sary vaccination accessories (syringes and cannulas) or, where applicable, diluent solutions (such as 0.9% sodium chlorid e solution). For vaccination centres, the provision of vaccina- tion accessories and any diluent solutions is the responsibility of the L\u00e4nder. In the case of SHI-accredited medical practices taking part in the vaccination campaign, both the vac- cines and the vaccination accessories are provided by pharmaceutical wholesalers and pharmacies. The agreements the European Commission has reached with the vaccine manufacturers so far stipulate that the manufacturers deliver vaccine doses to central bodies in the var i- ous EU member states. The available quantities of vaccine doses for vaccination centres are distributed among the L\u00e4nder according to their relative shares of the population. A BMG/the Federal Government procure s COVID -19 vaccines via a common EU pro- curement mechanism. As part of that process, Germany participates in the Euro- pean Commission's Vaccine Initiative. The Federal Government, in coopera tion with the EU member states and the phar- maceutical industry, is supporting the expansion of production capacity and help- ing to secure the necessary precursor and associated products. The interdepartmental Vaccine Production Task Force was established at the Fed- eral Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy in March 2021. 12 number of vaccines are currently delivered by the armed forces to sites design ated by the L\u00e4nder. One manufacturer delivers vaccine doses directly to these sites. Since early April 2021, SHI -accredited medical practices have been included in the vac- cination campaign. For these, a portion of the available COVID -19 vaccines are suppli ed through pharmaceutical wholesalers and pharmacies. Distribution is likewise organised through pharmaceutical wholesalers and pharmacies for workplace occupational physi- cians, occupational medicine service providers and private medical practices, all of which have been included in the campaign since 7 June 2021. BMG/the Federal Government organises the distribution of COVID -19 vaccines to designated locations in each of the L\u00e4nder. The L\u00e4nder are responsible for correct and safe storage and distributio n of vaccines in vaccination centres, and for procuring and maintaining stocks of the vaccination accessories needed by them. So that vaccination can be performed by SHI -accredited medical practices, a por- tion of the available vaccines and vaccination acce ssories have been supplied to them through pharmaceutical wholesalers and pharmacies since early April 2021. Since 7 June 2021, distribution of vaccines and vaccination accessories has likewise been organised through pharmaceutical wholesalers and pharmaci es for workplace occupational physicians, occupational medicine service providers and private med- ical practices. 13 6.

The reasons behind this strategy were the special transport and (long -term) storage requirements, vaccine supply in multi -dose vials, the need for priori- tisation due to initial limited availability of vaccine doses and the resulting central alloca- tion sy stem for vaccination appointments, the availability of different vaccines and the need for increased control measures, including centrally organised data -supported mon- itoring of vaccinations as a pandemic management. Under these condi- tions, ce ntralised structures were needed at the beginning to be able to conduct a controlled, efficient and effective vaccination campaign. In December 2020, as guidance for implementation throughout the country, the Federal Ministry of Health, in coopera- tion with experts and specialist departments in the L\u00e4nder, compiled and published a set of recommendations for the organisation and delivery of vaccinations against SARS -CoV - 2 in vaccination centres and with mobile teams. For centralised COVID -19 vaccinations, the L\u00e4nder are responsible for organising the vaccination centres and mobile vaccination teams. They are set up and operated with the support of practice -based physicians - primarily as represented by the regional Associa- tions of Statutory Health Insurance Ph ysicians ( ASHI Ps, German : Kassen\u00e4rztliche Ver- einigungen or KVen) - and in some cases hospital medical staff and other medical 15 professionals such as workplace occupational physicians. In some cases, the L\u00e4nder in- volve other outside parties such as aid organ isations, the armed forces and logistics com- panies. Since early April 2021, SHI -accredited medical practices have been included in the vac- cination campaign . This was initially limited to general medical practices and subse- quently extended to include specia list medical practices. Since 7 June 2021, private medical practices have been additionally included in the vaccination campaign. Likewise since 7 June 2021, the vaccination campaign has also been extended to involve more workplace occupational physicians and occupational medicine service providers. Good appointment management in vaccination centres is essential for efficient vaccine delivery and so that vaccine recipients can plan ahead. This again is the responsibility of the L\u00e4nder. Together with kv.digi tal GmbH, the National Association of Statutory Health Insura Physicians vides a standardised system for making appointments at vaccination centres. Some of the L\u00e4nder have opted for the NASHIP appointment service while the remainder use appoint- ment systems of their own. A number of the L\u00e4nder also operate an invitation manage- ment system to notify those entitled to vaccination about the possibility of obtaining vaccination against COVID -19. National Vaccination Plan On 10 February 2021, the Federal Government and the L\u00e4nder agreed to supplement the National Vaccination Strategy with a Vaccination Plan. In close consultation between the Federal Government and the L\u00e4nder, the vaccination cam paign was supplemented with additional delivery elements based on the latest information about volumes available from the various manufacturers. Allocation of the available vaccines was coordinated be- tween the Federal Government and the L\u00e4nder and consulte d upon weekly in the German Health Ministers Conference (GMK). Regularly updated schedules published by BMG showing quantities of vaccines to be supplied to the L\u00e4nder for use in vaccination centres take into account both agreed baseline quantities and cur rent requirement levels in each of the L\u00e4nder. 16 7. Financing COVID -19 vaccines are provided by the Federal Government free of charge. Financing of COVID -19 vaccination in vaccination centres and by mobile vaccination teams is kept simple and efficient in order to achieve high vaccination rates and speedy vaccination. After consultation with STIKO, NASHIP , the Federal Association of Health Insurance Funds (Spitzenverband Bund der Krankenkassen) and the Association of Private Health Insurances (Verband der Privaten Krankenversicherung) , BMG stipulated in the original and revised Coronavirus Vaccination Ordinance that per sons with or without statutory health insurance are entitled to receive a COVID -19 vaccination. To enable the rapid establishment and expansion of vaccination centres and so that they can be run efficiently with minimum red tape, the running costs of vacci nation centres and mobile vaccination teams are shared in fixed proportions . Under a GMK decision of 10 March 2021, 50 percent of the necessary ongoing operating costs of vaccination cen- tres , including mobile vaccination teams, established, maintained or o perated by or on behalf of the L\u00e4nder are reimbursed from federal funds from 1 January 2021 to at least 30 September 2021. The other 50 percent is met by the L\u00e4nder. The Federal Government provides the vaccines it procures free of charge to vaccination cen tres, medical practices and from 7 June 2021 also workplace occupational physicians and occupational medicine service providers. Since the 10 March 2021 revision of the Coronavirus Vaccination Ordinance, the Ordinance has stipulated a uniform remuneration rate for vaccination by medical practices. Under a further revision of 31 March 2021, this remuneration rate was also laid down for contracted workplace occupational physicians and occupational medicine service providers subject to the general proviso that the same service is not already paid for under other arrangements. The 1 June 2021 revision of the Ordinance supplemented The L\u00e4nder are responsible for organising and setting up the vaccination centres and for ensuring that vaccines are properly dispensed to those in the priority vaccination groups and with the involvement of local stakeholders. SHI-accredited medical practices were g radually included in vaccination against COVID -19 beginning in April 2021. Since 7 June 2021, this has also applied to prac- tice-based private physicians, workplace occupational physicians and occupational medicine service providers. In the long term, COVID -19 vaccination is to become part of the routine vaccination cycle and the statutory health insurance funds will be responsible on behalf of those with statutory health insurance for entering into agreements for the delivery and organisation of vaccination s with the regional associations of SHI -accredited phy- sicians, practitioners, workplace occupational physicians, the health administra- tions in each of the L\u00e4nder and other bodies. 17 these remuneration provisions and applied them more broadly for the increased involvement of workplace occupational physicians and oc cupational medicine service providers. The remuneration for the services of physicians is paid for out of federal funds. 8. Communication, specialist training and public information Since the onset of the pandemic, the Federal Government has aimed to provide the public with easily understood and reliable informa tion that is continually adapted to meet the needs of specific situations, groups and regions. Based on this precept, and under the um- brella of the \"Zusammen gegen Corona\" (\"Together Against Corona\") campaign, a public information campaign was developed ar ound the acronym \"AHA\" for \"Abstand -Hygiene - Alltagsmasken\" (\" Distance , Hygiene , Community Masks \"). A similar goal is followed by a further information and education campaign on vaccination, \"Deutschland krempelt die \u00c4rmel hoch\" (\" Time to roll up our sleeve s\"). This campaign faced many and various com- munication challenges from the outset. In the early days especially, it was necessary to explain to the public that because so little vaccine was available, it was only possible to offer vaccination to high -risk groups and people in certain occupations. At the same time, the population had to be encouraged to \"get vaccinated\" while also dispelling any doubts about new vaccines and combating deliberate misinformation. A transparent, proactive and target group -spec ific communication strategy that also covers vaccine reactions and side effects to address deliberate misinformation therefore remains indispensable. To ensure comprehensive and targeted communication in this way, a national -level steer- ing committee, \"Serv dialogue ser- has been established with representatives from BMG, BZgA, RKI (including PEI) and contracted agencies. Responsibility for the management of communication on COVID -19 vaccination l ies with BMG. The steering committee coordinates communica- tion activities and hence also the content, which is then put out on digital, social and con- ventional media in formats such as printed advertisements or TV and radio spots. Another focus of the stee ring committee's work is on developing information and communication material and making it available in digital form for use by communicators at regional and local level. Communication around vaccination is adapted on an ongoing basis with the growing bod y of scientific knowledge on vaccination and vaccination progress. From the outset, the focus has been on transparent information and on involving and communi- The Coronavirus Vaccination Ordinance provides for vaccination centres run by the L\u00e4nder to be co -financed by the Federal Government in 2021. The Coronavirus Vaccination Ordinance stipulat es a uniform remuneration rate for vaccination by medical practices, workplace occupational physicians and occupational medicine service providers and for the remuneration to be paid for out of federal funds. 18 cating with relevant social groups. In view of the high demands that the vaccination cam- paign plac es on physicians and medical staff working in the vaccination centres, mobile teams, medical practices and health care facilities , BMG also funded the development of training content on the subject of vaccination in the pandemic by the Academy for Public Health in D\u00fcsseldorf ( https://impfencovid19.de ). Regarding communication on COVID - 19 vaccinations in statutory health insurance -accredited medical practices, a central role is played by NASHIP . With a view to the greater involvement of workplace occupational physicians and occupational medicine service providers, close consultation in particular with the Confederation of German Employers' Associations (BDA) and occupational medicine associations is especially impor tant in order to provide occupational physicians the best possible support in the vaccination process. 9. Vaccination rate monitoring Valid data on vaccination uptake (vaccination rates) provides the basis for analysing vac- cination behaviour and the success of the accompanying information campaign . Target group -specific vaccination rates enable both management and adaptation of the vaccina- tion campaign. For example, the campaign can be adapted if vaccination rates are par tic- ularly low in certain population groups or if there are large regional differences between the L\u00e4nder. The vaccination rates also serve as a 'denominator' for ranking efficacy and safety (differentiating between individual cases versus representative ca ses based on the total number of all vaccine recipients) (see Section 10). For the purpose of vaccination rate monitoring, the following non -personal data is re- quired: Data on the vaccine recipient: age, gender, place of residence (Land/district), vaccina- tion indication Data on the vaccination: place of vaccination, vaccination date, vaccine product (name and batch number), vaccination dose administered (first vaccination or follow -on vac- cination where applicable) In order to ensure both timely analysis of and transparency in the delivery of COVID -19 vaccinations, vaccination centres must forward this data to RKI effectively in real time .

The Bund es- druckerei temporarily stores the dat a for retrieval by RKI. Under the Coronavirus Vaccina- tion Ordinance, this also covers occupational medicine service providers and workplace occupational physicians. SHI-accredited medical practices collect the above data as with other vaccinations in a da- taset that the regional associations of SHI -accredited physicians transmit to RKI at up to a six-month time lag as part of statutory health insurance vaccination surv eillance (see Ta- ble 3). For timely information on vaccination campaign progress, SHI -accredited medical practices additionally send the RKI a truncated, aggregated dataset recording total vac- cinations per day by place of vaccination, vaccine, dose and age group (<18, 18 -59 and 60+); the under -18 age criterion was added in the Coronavirus Vaccination Ordinance of 1 June 2021 in view of the BioNTech vaccine now being approved for age 12 upwards from 31 May 2021. In order to obtain statistics for private medic al practices as well, these submit the data in a similar manner. RKI analyses the vaccination rates obtained in this way on a daily basis. The results are published on the RKI website and the German Vaccination Dashboard . RKI also submits the aggregated German vaccination data to the European Vaccine Tracker via the Euro- pean surveillance system (TESSy). This provides an at -a-glance view of vaccination cam- paign progress in Europe. Realtime online data collection is combined with other components for integrated m oni- toring of vaccination rates in Germany (Table 3). The results are made available in aggre- gated form to other stakeholders (BMG, PEI, BzgA and the L\u00e4nder). Table 3: Components of integrated vaccination rate monitoring in Germany Components Description DIM (digital vaccination rate moni tor- ing) Quasi -realtime collection of pseudonymised data on vaccination update and computation of vaccination rates.

Surveillance : Evaluating the safety and efficacy of COVID -19 vaccines The introduction of new COVID -19 vaccines makes active surveillance of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine products absolutely essential. Large clinical trials on the clinical efficacy and safety of the vaccines are ongoing worldwide and are evaluated for approval purposes. Only vaccines with a proven positive risk -benefit ratio are approved and made available. This has now taken place for an initial group of vaccines. Due to the accelerated development and the limited duration of observation in the clinical trials, continuous monitoring and collection of further data during widespread application is necessary in order to identify any additional potential risks arising from the vaccines as quickly as pos- sible. Vaccine benefit and risk assessment is a continuous process spanning all stages, from vaccine d evelopment and pre -approval clinical trials through to post -marketing surveil- lance. While pre -marketing clinical trials provide important information on the safety and efficacy of vaccines, post -marketing surveillance is essential in order to obtain furthe r in- formation on the vaccine safety (such as the occurrence of rare adverse effects) in larger RKI is responsible for monitoring the vaccination rates. RKI has developed an online vaccination rate monitoring system (DIM) for nation- wide use in vaccination centres and by mobile teams. Data from occupational phy- sicians and occupational medicine service providers is also submitted using DIM. The dataset to be submitted is specified in the Coronavirus Va ccination Ordinance. RKI designs and conducts parallel studies and surveys to monitor vaccination rate and vaccination acceptance. 21 and more heterogeneous populations that have not been studied in pre -approval clinical trials. Post -marketing surveillance of vaccine efficacy and safety and of the duration of immun- ity ensures that the positive risk -benefit profile established at the time of approval can be continuously reviewed as a vaccine becomes widely used and that vaccination recommen- dations can be adapted where needed to reflect new findin gs. Table 4: Overview of the systems and studies for use in evaluating vaccine efficacy and safety in COVID -19 vaccinations in Germany Data collection in real time or near - real time Data collection in the medium and longer term Vaccine ef- ficacy Case reports under the Protection against Infection Act (IfSG) (vac- cine breakthrough infections) Screening methods Hospital -based case -control studies (efficacy, period of protection) Outbreak studies in the form of cohort studies Vaccine safety Routine pharmacovigilance Cohort studies, including app - based Hospital -based case -control studies Evaluation of digital health data Surveillance of pregnant women 10.1. Vaccine efficacy Information on reported COVID -19 cases, including the vaccination status, is transmitted to the Robert Koch Institute as part of reporting obligations under the Protection against Infection Act. Vaccine efficacy can be estimated in the short term by compar ing the pro- portion of vaccinated persons among reported COVID -19 cases ( vaccine breakthrough infections) with the proportion of vaccinated persons in the population (screening method). In the longer term, the efficacy of COVID -19 vaccines deployed in Germa ny will be meas- ured by including COVID -19 patients (vaccinated and unvaccinated) in a hospital -based case -control study . This study will collect data on protection against hospitalisation and severe illness from COVID -19 infection , estimate vaccine efficac y among seniors and pa- tient groups with specific underlying conditions, ascertain the duration of immunity and compare these parameters across the available vaccines. Outbreaks in specific types of facilities (such as retirement homes, care homes and com- munity facilities) or at events where the group of exposed persons can be easily defined are also to be investigated using a standardised methodology and data collection tools. In such settings, depending on the institution involved and especially as regards particularly vulnerable groups, vaccine efficacy can be determined in a retrospective cohort study . 22 10.2. Vaccine safety Routine pharmacovigilance is based on established monitoring of possible side effects or vaccination -related complications in accorda nce with sections 6, 8 and 11 of the Protec- tion against Infection Act (IfSG) and section 63 (c) of the Medicinal Products Act (AMG). PEI regularly evaluates incoming reports and publishes safety reports on its website. A cohort study using the SafeVac 2.0 smartphone app will prospectively track the fre- quency and severity of adverse effects and of SARS -CoV -2 infections in vaccinated adults over a period of one year. The app can be downloaded from the major app stores ( Google Play Store and Apple App Store ). A hospital -based case -control study to investigate the efficacy of vaccination in hospital- ised COVID -19 patients (vaccinated and unvaccinated, see 10.1) also aims to investigate the severity of the clinical outcomes and look for any indications of a more severe out- come following vaccination . A research project on the safety of COVID -19 vaccines will also include an analysis of treatment and billing data . This will cover electronic data from five large health insurance funds that serve about 70 percent of the population covered by statutory h ealth insurance in Germany. Data on potential risk signals from Phase I -III studies and new risk signals detected in broad use after approval are examined on a quarterly basis. Modelling and ar- tificial intelligence are used to estimate the risks for subseq uent quarters. To perform these analyses, it is necessary for treatment and billing data to be linked with the data recorded at the time of vaccination. Surveillance of pregnant women : To the extent that pregnant women are vaccinated in individual instance s, the safety of the vaccines is to be investigated for this vulnerable group, who are mostly not included in pre -marketing clinical trials (pregnancy complica- tions in pregnant women who have been vaccinated shortly before or during pregnancy - such as abo rtion, premature birth, stillbirth and eclampsia, compared with unvaccinated pregnant women - foetal malformations, low birth weight, postnatal adaptation disorders compared to non -exposed newborns). 11. Proof of immunity to COVID -19: Digital vaccination certifi- cates Once a person has been vaccinated against COVID -19, the vaccination is recorded in the World Health Organization (WHO) standard international vaccination certificate. If a per- son does not have a vaccination certificate, a 'reserve documentation on vaccination ' form can be issued . The digital vaccination certificate provides a new, additional and easy means of verifying vaccination status towards third parties. Instead of showing their vaccination As higher federal authorities and within the scope of their remits, RKI and PEI are actively involved in monitoring the efficacy and the safety of COVID -19 vaccines. 23 date, vaccine and name in analogue , printed form, users can now conveniently store this information on their smartphones. However, the digital vaccination certificate cannot be used as a substitute for the docu mentation of vaccination under the Protection against Infection Act (IfSG). The contract to develop the system was put out to tender and awarded to a consortium on 19 March 2021. With implementation now underway, the rollout of the digital vaccination cert ificate will continue step by step during June. Germany is also participating in the EU pilot. The digital vaccination certificate meets the EU -level interoperability requirements enabling the certificates also to be used in other European countries. The digital vaccination certificate system consists of a certificate app (CovPass App) and a certificate check app (CovPassCheck App). People who have been vaccinated can store and display their vaccination certificate in the certificate app. Alternatively, th e vaccination certificate can be stored and displayed in the Corona Warn App (CWA). The CovPassCheck App can be used to scan a vaccination certificate. It then indicates whether the person con- cerned has a valid vaccination. The CovPass App and the Corona W arn App will also be updated on a timely basis to inte- grate the remaining parts of the EU Green Certificate, meaning certification of testing and recovery. The two apps are generally available free of charge. Integration of their function- ality into third -party apps is expressly encouraged on the basis of the open source ap- proach. 12. International coordination and cooperation The SARS -CoV -2 pandemic is a global challenge and the Federal Government attaches great importance to its containment across the whol e world . Coordination and coopera- tion with international partners is thus an essential component of the vaccination strategy in order to accelerate the development of effective and innovative responses and solu- tions. BMG is actively involved in various int ernational forums and promotes cooperation be- tween stakeholders from civil society, foundations and the public and private sectors. The Federal Government has committed to globally equitable access to vaccines as a global public good and favours multilater al solutions to this end. Activities at global level centre on the Access to COVID -19 Tools Accelerator (ACT -A) plat- form, which was initiated in the context of G20 and launched by WHO in April 2020, and the associated COVAX vaccine platform. ACT -A targets the development, scale -up and eq- uitable distribution of COVID -19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, underpinned by the strengthening of health systems. COVAX is spearheaded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the WHO, and Ga vi, the Vaccine Alliance , and aims to accelerate research and development of new vaccines. It also supports the establishment of production capacity. The COVAX Facility, which is part of COVAX and is managed by 24 Gavi, has the goal of providing vaccines to 2 0 percent of the population of participating countries in 2021. It has already secured over two billion doses of vaccine through to the end of 2021, with about one billion earmarked for developing countries and up to five per- cent for acute and humanitarian emergencies. In total, the Federal Government is provid- ing over \u20ac2 billion in support for ACT -A. Combating the COVID -19 pandemic and the provision of vaccines is also an important issue for both the G7 and the G20. BMG, together with the agencies in its r emit (RKI and PEI), also provides support in the aid of international knowledge transfer. This includes various projects and committee -based activities . PEI is represented in the WHO/Europe Regional Working Group on COVID -19 Vaccina- tion and Deployment and also in the WHO SAGE Working Group on COVID -19 Vaccines. In the ECDC -coordinated EU Network of National Vaccination Commissions, RKI is the lead organisation in a \"living systematic review\" on the efficacy and safety of the COVID - 19 vaccines and thus provi des key input to aid decision -making concerning COVID -19 vaccination strategies in other EU countries. As a collaboration centre for vaccines and blood products, PEI supports, among others, the WHO, the regulatory authorities in African partner countries, WHO AFRO and regulatory bodies of the African Union in establishing structures and procedures to promote the ap- proval and implementation of clinical trials for medicines and vaccines and to establish effective pharmacovigilance in the use of medical produc ts. The Federal Government is responsible for cooperation and coordination at inter- national level. German activities at global level centre on the Access to COVID -19 Tools Accelera- tor (ACT -A) platform launched by WHO and others in April 2020. The authorities that fall within BMG's remit (RKI and PEI) conduct specific projects for international cooperation, including in relation to the vaccination strategy. "}
