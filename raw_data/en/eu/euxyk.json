It is a chronic age-related disorder, which often involves cardiovascular and renal complications risks. HT affects approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide. In KSA, HT is affecting more than one-fourth of the adult Saudi population.[ [1]] High BP prevalence in KSA is mainly age-related, which reached 3.2% among those aged 15-24 years, 51.2% among those aged 55-64 years, and the heights which are to 70% among those aged 65 years and older. There has been an increase in prehypertension instances, with males accounting for 46.5% (3 million) and females 34.3% (more than 2 million).[ [2]] HT or the silent killer can occur due to many reasons such as obesity or heavy intake of alcohol or other substances that can interfere with BP.[ [3]] Excessive intake of saturated fatty and trans-fatty acids are risk factors for CV diseases including HT and fatal coronary heart disease. Reduction in dietary sodium intake will reduce the mean population BP, as well as the prevalence of HT. The World Health Organization recommends a reduction in sodium intake to less than 2 g/day.[ [4]] Additionally, obstructor sleep apnea and hormone abnormalities can also have a significant effect on BP.[ [5], [6]] There are pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. The decision on which pharmacological treatment will start as the first line depends on many variables including CV disease risk, organ damage, and obesity.[ [7], [8]] Five classes of drugs are suitable for the initiation and maintenance of treatment, either as monotherapy or combinations.[ [8]] Some patients will require two or more antihypertensive medications to achieve their BP target.[ [9]] Non-pharmacological HT treatment could be by multiple other ways as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), folk medicine, and Chinese medicine as cupping.[ [10], [11]] The choice is affected by each society's beliefs that suggested using its methods as an alternative or with or without the medical drugs. Cupping is a traditional alternative medicine practiced in different cultures and can be from more than 2000 years ago. It reduces BP symptoms such as headaches and anxiety.[ [12]- [14]] There are different cupping types, including dry cupping, wet cupping, moving to cup, fire cupping.[ [2], [15], [16]] Hijama, the wet cupping, is the most used method and was performed by applying suction to the desired points on the skin using plastic, bamboo, earthenware, silicone, or glass cup, making incisions in the same areas of the skin to remove and suck the blood into the replaced cups.[ [17]] Hijama involves the removal of excess fluid (interstitial and intravascular fluid) and harmful metabolic substances.[ [18]] It could stimulate endogenous nitric oxide production excretion, including accumulated vasoactive substances and free radicals.[ [19]] This has shown to have beneficial effects on BPs in some clinical trials.[ [19]- [22]] Acupuncture is another form of folk medicine (traditional Chinese medicine) that involves inserting needles into the skin at certain places.[ [23]] Some patients prefer using herbal medicine other than using pharmacological medicine. Many plants are used in HT. Allium sativum [Garlic] has a significant effect in reducing BP and in mild HT if used at a dose of 2600 mg/day garlic powder for 10 days.[ [24]] Allicin, the main active component of Allium, mode of action increases the nitric oxide synthesis, which causes smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.[ [25]] Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) Calyx infusion (karkadeh) is widely used as an antihypertensive medication by Nigerians. It contains antibacterial, antioxidant, anticholesterol, and antihypertensive properties.[ [18]] It was comparable to captopril but less effective than lisinopril compared to ACE inhibitors. Mode of action reduces the amount of uric acid in the body[ [20]] and blocks Ca2+ channels[ [19]] in weeks.[ [21]] Apium graveolens [alkarfs] was also used because of its antihypertensive capabilities and it was used in the manufacture of many therapeutic formulations.[ [22]] It can block Ca2+ channels if taken dose up to one week.[ [23]] The dose is 8 ounces of juice mixed with an equal amount of honey and given orally thrice a day.[ [26]] Therefore, our objective is to study the prevalence use of folk medicine, such as Hijama, acupuncture, or herbal drugs, in HT treatment in Saudi Arabia. Method Research method and study type Online questionnaires were used as a study tool among the population in different regions of Saudi Arabia [Appendix 1]. Ethical consideration All ethical issues were taken into consideration, including the confidentiality and privacy of participants' data. Participants were informed that their participation was completely voluntary. The data was collected from the website that was created and it explained the research to the participants. No names were recorded on the questionnaires and all questionnaire responses were kept safe. The survey protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Taif University with protocol coded 43-049. Sampling The following formula was used to calculate the size of the required sample: n = (z) 2 p (1 - p)/d2 or when p = 1/2 (0.5) n = (z) 2/4d2 n = sample size z = level of confidence according to the standard normal distribution p = estimated proportion of the population that presents the characteristic d = tolerated margin of error According to the plan, a sample proportion with a 95% (0.625) level of confidence with a margin of error of 5% is applied to select the sample size at p = 0.5. n = (1.96) 2/4 (0.05) 2 = 384 \u00d7 0.625 = 240 Sample size of 240 will be taken for this study. This accessible sampling method amplified the exposure of the survey to the participants from the different regions of Saudi Arabia and boosted the representativeness of the sample. The distribution of the survey was done in five sets. Incomplete questionnaires were dropped out. It included an explanatory letter that explained the purpose of the study and clarified some of the clinical terms. Participants were requested to report their nationality and region upon submission. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Male and female Saudi hypertensive patients in KSA were included in this study while the exclusion criteria were hypertensive patients from any other country rather than KSA, or any other patients rather than Saudi hypertensive patients were excluded from this study. Variables The following variables were included in the study analysis: - The prevalence of using folk medicines such as Hijama and Acupuncture in HT treatment in Saudi Arabia. - The prevalence of using herbal drugs in HT treatment in Saudi Arabia. - The impact of age, gender, and education on health beliefs and behaviors is discussed, as well as the feasibility of using these therapies in HT treatment. - The common type used and common conditions for which it is being used and also the doses used. - The effects of THM and folk medicine used in HT treatment. Data analysis plan The proposed study employed univariate and multivariable regression data analyses to identify the effect of using folk medicine and herbal medicine in HT treatment in Saudi Arabia. The influence of age, gender, and education factors on health beliefs and behaviors is noted with noting the feasibility of using these therapies in HT treatment and the common type it has been used for and the common conditions for which it is being used and also the doses used. In making comparisons, Pearson's chi-squared tests were used to compare proportions. All analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Version 26 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results To achieve the objectives of the study, online questionnaires [Appendix 1] were conducted on 229 participants as a study tool among the population in different regions of Saudi Arabia and statistical analysis of the results using the Chi-square test. [Table 1](javascript:void(0)) shows the effect of age on adherence to taking medications, wherein 25.85% from all age categories answered yes and they were adherent to taking their medications regularly while 74.13% from all age categories answered no and they were not adherent to taking their medications. 65.51% of female participants were not adherent to taking their medications, while only 8.62% of male participants were not adherent to taking their medications. As represented in [Table 2](javascript:void(0)), about 68.99% of all ages were not using an alternative or complementary medicine, while only 31.00% from all age categories were using an alternative or complementary medicine. With the same gender effect as 71.57% females and 56.41% males answered that they were not using alternative or complementary medicine. Education grades are not significant (Chi-square test: 12.90; df: 9; P > 0.05). More than 30% of the participants tried treating the high BP elevation using alternative or complementary medicine [ [Figure 1a](javascript:void(0))]. Herbal therapy and Hyjama were the most used form that was 42.2% and 32.5%, respectively [ [Figure 1b](javascript:void(0))]. Statistical analysis of the results using the Chi-square test showed that generally herbal therapy and Hyjama have a significant beneficial effect (Chi-square test: 49.72; df: 20; P < 0.05). They considered that using Allium sativum and HS has a great effect of 44.1% and 32.9%, respectively. In contrast, the participant opinion was that the administration of Allium sativum and HS once daily is sufficient to adjust the BP, as shown in [ [Figures 1c](javascript:void(0)) and [d](javascript:void(0))]. Although only 31% were using alternative or complementary medicine in HT management, more than 46% consider it was significantly an way in HT management; Chi-square test: 69.71; 3](javascript:void(0)) and [Figure 2](javascript:void(0)). Only 10.5% consider THM to be not useful. The other represents 43.5% said it to be: good, I don't know, useful sometimes, not healthy, not too bad, etc.). [Table 4](javascript:void(0)) shows that most of the participant's get their information from social media (39.43%), 42.96% found out from their families are beneficial and only 13.38% from their friends. Some suggested other sources from the previous study, and the Qur'an and the Sunnah of the Prophet. Discussion In our study of the prevalence of using folk media (Hijama and acupuncture) and/or natural products in the treatment of HT problems compared with medicinal drugs in KSA. The study was also conducted to assess the influence of age, gender, and education factors on health beliefs and behaviors while noting the feasibility of using these therapies in HT treatment. Also, study the prevalence of using herbal drugs in HT treatment in Saudi Arabia. The common type used and the used doses. Additionally, the study evaluates the participants' opinion on the effects of THM and folk medicine used in HT treatment and illustrate if THM has an efficient effect on HT. By studying the education effect of age, gender, and education on medication adherence, it was found that education has no significant effect on medication adherence, but age and gender had a highly significant effect on medication adherence P < 0.001. Female were less adherent than male. This result was in agreement with those previously reported by Alsolami et al. in 2015[ [27]] where patients older than 45 years in KSA could not regularly adhere to their antihypertensive medication, and more than 70% of them were female patients. By studying the same factors on choosing any alternative or complementary medicine for HT management, it was found that they have no significant effect on choosing any alternative or complementary medicine for HT management. The participants do not believe in the effectiveness of alternative or complementary medicine in HT management. Participants also with different education grades do not resort to using an alternative or complementary medicine in HT management. This contrasts to a previous coherent study that demonstrated that other factors could have a more efficient effect than smoking.[ [28]] Although the good level of patients does not believe on the effectiveness of alternative or complementary medicine in HT management, misconceptions were still reported in this study. This is somewhat true as many previous studies approved the Hyjama effect in reducing BP, especially if used in conjunction with the conventional antihypertensive agents and could reduce the antihypertensive medication dose and side effects.[ [15]] HS had a significant antihypertensive effect on both systolic BP (SBP) and DBP.[ [29]] However, these studies could not explain the exact mechanisms responsible for HS effects as it is still unknown. In contrast, the long-term benefits of Hijama need further investigation to provide evidence of sustained effects and explain how Hyjama could reduce BP alone and in combination with medications. Allium sativum in traditional medicines has been reported to possess antihypertensive activities. It could reduce oxidative stress, and increase the production of nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The latter leads to endothelial-dependent vasodilation which improves peripheral blood circulation and reduce the SBP without affecting the SBP.[ [30], [31]] The significant effect of social media in sharing information about THM was previously described in many studies which explain that social media helps in sharing the user/practitioner beliefs, attitudes, and experiences about THM and acts as a vehicle for the spread of misinformation.[ [32]- [34]] Although the outcomes of using certain CAMs are poor, the prevalence of using them within a family was related to the family cohesion and functioning. Family information could also improve the patient's health condition through being information seekers, advocates, and/or role models, in promoting, enabling, and encouraging the use of certain medications.[ [35]] Conclusion We concluded from the previous study that age and gender have a significant effect on health beliefs and behaviors related to the use of herbal or alternative medicine in HT treatment. However, education level has no significant effect. By studying the prevalence of using folk and herbal medicine in HT treatment in Saudi Arabia, it was found that it was not commonly used and only 31% of people might use it and 46% consider its effects significant in HT management. Hijama was the most used method; this could be for a revival of the Prophet's Sunnah. The same issue is observed in using herbal drugs in HT treatment where 42.2% of participants believed that taking garlic once a day has a significant effect on managing high BP. This may be because our true religion commands us to treat and take the reasons for this. Patients have resorted to medical examinations to identify and diagnose their diseases, and to take appropriate drugs to treat these diseases. More pharmacological studies should be conducted to identify the effect of herbal or alternative medicines in reducing BP alone or in combination with hypertensive medications.
