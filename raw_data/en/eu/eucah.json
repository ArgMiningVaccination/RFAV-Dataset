Naturopathy is the practice of natural medicine. It encompasses the use of Western herbal medicine, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, massage and dietary and lifestyle advice. It is a powerful and commonly used treatment for PCOS, with many people experiencing great success in reducing and even removing their symptoms. Naturopathy is practised in varying ways by naturopaths, homeopaths and herbalists, and almost always accompanies recommendations for the ideal diet, exercise and lifestyle for YOUR body. NATUROPATHY AND PCOS A naturopathic practitioner will assess you, your symptoms and your test results to create a tailored treatment program that specifically suits you. Something I love about naturopathic practitioners is that they tend to look at test results a bit more deeply than a doctor might. For example, if your blood test results for zinc sit low within the \"normal range\", a naturopathic practitioner may consider that zinc supplementation could help you, given that zinc can be powerful in the fight against PCOS. SOME SPECIFIC NATUROPATHIC SUPPLEMENTS FOR PCOS Zinc: Can increase fertility, lower insulin levels and improve hirsutism, hair loss, acne and PMS Vitamin D: Up to 85% of people with PCOS have a Vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D3 can improve fertility and may reduce insulin resistance. Vitamin B12: Can improve fertility, decrease fatigue, help metabolise carbohydrates and improve mood. Vitamin C: Can raise progesterone levels and improve skin. Apple Cider Vinegar: Can improve insulin sensitivity and gut health. Licorice and Peony Root Combination: can balance the LH:FSH ratio, support healthy follicle development, increase progesterone levels, reduce elevated androgens, balance blood sugar and reduce inflammation. Chasteberry: Can prevent you from creating too much prolactin - an ovulation inhibiting hormone. This can allow for proper ovulation and improved levels of progesterone. It can also reduce excess male androgens. However, it is not necessarily good for people who have high levels of Lutinising Hormone - it can cause the levels to go higher. D-Chiro Inositol and Myo Inositol combination: Can decrease androgens, regulate your cycle, improve egg quality and ovarian function and reduce the risk of gestational diabetes. Magnesium: It is estimated that 80% of the worlds population are magnesium deficient due to the decreased quality of our soil and people with PCOS are 19 times more likely to have a magnesium deficiency. Magnesium is a natural anti-inflammatory that can improve sugar metabolism. Omega 3: Can aid in weight loss, reduce testosterone levels, relieve depression, lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, improve egg quality, decrease insulin resistance and reduce menstrual cramps. Red raspberry leaf tea: can strengthen and tone the uterine lining for implantation. CoQ10: an antioxidant necessary for many functions including metabolism. It can reduce insulin resistance, increase egg quality and can improve embryo quality in IVF. It can also improve the effectiveness of the fertility drug clomid. Selenium (Selenomethionine): can improve insulin metabolism, is a powerful anti-inflammatory, can improve mood, depression and anxiety, and is essential for a healthy thyroid. And, low levels of selenium have been shown to be correlated with increased luteinising hormone and testosterone. Studies have found that people with PCOS can have significantly lower levels of selenium. Cinnamon: can improve insulin sensitivity. MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH NATUROPATHY Ayurveda When I was first diagnosed with PCOS, I have to say I was relieved and even a bit excited to have found a reason for all my symptoms. I immediately began on a Low GI diet. This certainly caused me to shed a few kilograms but then I plateaued. My weight wouldn't shift and my symptoms were still bothering me. So I booked an appointment with a Naturopath. She was wonderful. The initial appointment went for 2.5 hours. I had never felt so cared for by a health practitioner in my life. I really felt like she was on my side, in my corner and filled with helpful information. I was right! My naturopath helped me to get comprehensive blood tests from my Doctor (even though my Doctor hated this) and she delved deep into the results. She found things my Doctor hadn't mentioned and I wouldn't have known to look for. She started me on a range of supplements and I began seeing results. The best of which was short menstrual cycles. The best I had was 28 days but it was a one off. Usually, I was up around the 40 mark. Still not bad though! The best thing about my naturopath was that when something didn't work, she found another path to explore. She never gave up on me or made me feel like there was nothing left to do. The other great thing I found about naturopaths is that they only use scientifically supported, researched treatments. She didn't play into any of the airy ideas some people throw around and usually had research to support why these things wouldn't work. (not to say I don't love an airy idea...but I respected that she only treated me with things known to work). Naturopathy didn't cure me of my PCOS. But that wasn't the reason I stopped seeing my Naturopath. I stopped because my nose led me elsewhere and I stumbled upon Ayurveda - traditional Indian medicine. I never intended to stop with the Naturopathy but I just went with the flow and was never led back there. There are countless people having success treating and even curing their PCOS with Naturopathy. It should be considered an effective, stand alone treatment for PCOS.
