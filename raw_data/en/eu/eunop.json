After primary SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, the higher risks remain. In this prospective observational cohort study, SARS-CoV-2spike S1 -speci c antibody responses after routine SARS- (BNT162b2, messenger RNA [mRNA] - 1273, or ChAdOx1) in adults with Down syndrome andhealthy controls were compared. Adults with Down syndrome showed lower antibody concentrations after 2 mRNA vaccinations or after 2 ChAdOx1 vaccinations. After2 mRNA vaccinations, lower antibody concentrations were seen with increasing age. Clinical Trials Registration .NCT05145348. Keywords. Down syndrome; antibody response; COVID-19 vaccination; SARS-CoV-2.Down syndrome (DS), also known as trisomy 21, is the most common chromosomal abnormality in the Netherlands. Individuals with DS show, at all ages, an increased incidenceof respiratory morbidity and mortality. The risk of a severe course of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in people with DS is substantially in-creased, resulting in hospitalization rates up to 56% [ 1-3]. Viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and bacterial pneumonia are the most prevalent complications seen in indi-viduals with DS during a SARS-CoV-2 infection [ 1]. The risk of death is 3- to 10-fold higher compared with individuals without DS [1,2]. Aging is an additional risk factor, as is shown by high- er mortality rates in people with DS .40 years of age [ 1]. Recent evidence shows a 12.7-fold increased risk for individ- uals with DS in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) -related mortality and hospital admissions, even after 1 or 2SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations [ 4]. T-cell and B-cell responses in people with DS are impaired and previous, non - SARS-CoV-2, vaccine responses are known to be suboptimal[5,6]. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been registered for adults and children 12 years of age, but none of them have been studied in people with DS. In this study, we investigated the an-tibody response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in individualswith DS and compared these with the antibody response in healthy controls (HCs). METHODS Study Design and Participants The PRIDE study (Prospective Monitoring of Antibody Response Following COVID-19 Vaccination in Patients WithDown Syndrome) is a prospective, observational cohort study. Adults ( 18 years of age) with Down syndrome (DS cohort) were compared with a healthy control cohort without Downsyndrome (HC cohort). Participants with DS were recruitedthrough patient networks and specialized DS outpatient clinics throughout the Netherlands. Household contacts of the DS participants and healthcare workers were asked to participatein the HC cohort. Exclusion criteria were receipt of organ transplant, active malignancy or completion of treatment for malignancy in the previous 3 months, or an infection with hu-man immunode ciency virus. For the HC cohort, additional exclusion criteria were any disease or condition for which reg- ular visits to a healthcare provider were necessary. Participantsreceived 2 doses of the following SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as partof the Dutch national immunization program: BNT162b2 interval 3 -6 weeks), and ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca, interval 10 -14 weeks).

The study was approved by theUniversity Medical Center Utrecht medical research ethics committee (NL76336.041.21). All participants and/or legal rep- resentatives provided written informed consent beforeinclusion. Procedures Blood samples were collected at baseline ( ,2 months before the rst vaccination) (T =1), 21 -28 days after the rst vaccination (T=2), and 28 days (range, 21 -42 days) after the second vacci- nation (T =3). SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) the spike protein domain,and nucleocapsid protein (N) were measured by multiplex im-munoassay and reported as binding antibody units (BAU)/mL as previously described [ 7], according to the rst serum stan- dard for COVID-19 (20/136), as provided by the NationalInstitute for Biological Standards and Control and recommend- ed by the World Health Organization to de ne speci c serum antibody concentrations in an international perspective. Statistical Analysis Antibody concentrations are presented as geometric mean an- tibody concentrations (GMCs). An S antibody concentration .10.08 BAU/mL was considered positive. Participants with a concentration below this value at T =3 were de ned as nonre- sponders. At the moment of analysis, no speci c threshold in correlation to neutralization is known for individuals withDS. Participants with a positive anti-S IgG concentration atT=1(.10.08 BAU/mL) were considered to be previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and excluded from primary analysis. In case no T =1 sample was available, a positive anti-N IgG concentration at T =2o rT=3(.14.3 BAU/mL) was also regarded as a possible previous infection and excluded from primary analysis [ 8]. Statistical analyses after log- transformation included a Student ttest for comparison between the DS cohort and HC cohort and between the admin- istered mRNA vaccines. For correlations, a Pearson test wasused. Unfortunately, we were not powered to undertake a mul- tivariable analysis. Statistical analyses were performed in IBM SPSS Statistics 26 software (IBM, Armonk, New York).APvalue,.05 was considered statistically signi cant. RESULTS Population Between February and September 2021, 318 participants were included, of whom 214 DS participants (51.8% male) and 93 HC participants (27.4% male) had results available at T =3a t the time of preliminary analysis ( Figure 1 ). Further baseline characteristics are presented in Supplementary Table 1 .Antibody Concentrations None of the participants, HC or DS, were nonresponders. However, the DS cohort showed a signi cantly lower GMC af- ter vaccination with an mRNA vaccine compared with the HC cohort The signi cant difference in GMCs between the DS cohort and HC cohort was found inboth subgroups ,40 years of the DS cohort also showed signi cantly lower concentra- tions after ChAdOx1 were lower compared with antibodyconcentrations after mRNA vaccines, showing values ,100 BAU/mL in DS participants ,30 years of age. In the DS cohort, a negative correlation was found between age and log-transformed antibody concentration after mRNA vaccination, showing lower antibodies with increasing age (Pearson r=0.522, P,.001; Figure 2 D). No such correlation was found in the HC cohort (Pearson r=0.245, P=.170). No correlation for antibody concentration in relation to age was found in the DS cohort after vaccination with ChAdOx1 (Pearson r=0.176, P=.247), nor in the HC cohort (Pearson r=0.092, P=.544). For the DS cohort, the BNT162b2 (n =28; 2228.9 observed between the DS and HC cohort remainedwhen BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 were analyzed separately. The relation with age is also found after BNT162b2 vaccina- tion but could not be determined after mRNA-1273 vaccina- tion (only 4 participants were .40 years of age). The participants with evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection showed a signi cantly higher GMC after vaccination compared with SARS-COV-2 -naive participants ( Figure 2 Aand 2 B). DISCUSSION Our results show that adults with DS have decreased antibody concentrations after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with mRNA or ChAdOx1 vaccine compared with healthy controls. To our knowledge, this is the rst report determining SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antibody responses in a large cohort of adults with 674 \u0081JID 2022:226 (15 August) \u0081BRIEF REPORTDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/226/4/673/6617441 by guest on 15 September 2022 DS. Our ndings are important since recent evidence shows that individuals with DS have a higher risk for COVID-19 - related mortality and hospital admissions even after 1 or 2 vac- cinations [ 4]. It is not fully clear how our results relate to protection. Currently, no validated cutoff values for either themRNA or ChAdOx1 vaccines are validated; suggestions in literature differ based on testing technique and timing of mea- surement [ 9,10]. Antibody concentrations were measured at peak levels and will decline over time [ 11]. It is conceivable that vaccine protec- tion decreases more rapidly in adults with DS than in controls.The Dutch Health Council recently recommended an earlybooster vaccination for adults with DS, based on our prelimi- nary results. Since vaccine ef cacy is higher for mRNA vaccines and recent studies showed high antibody concentrations with apotent T-cell response and only limited side effects after heter- ologous vaccine schedules with a vector vaccine followed by an mRNA vaccine, a third vaccination with an mRNA vaccine isadministered to adults with DS in the Netherlands [ 12]. A strength of our study is the large number of participants in our DS cohort. There was no loss to follow-up. Besides this, thecontrol group is relatively large, which makes it possible todraw solid conclusions from the data. Our study has limitations. First, the design is observational. Vaccines were given as part of the national immunization pro-gram and changed during the observation period. However, werecruited enough participants to draw conclusions for each vac- cine type, and this enabled us to compare the antibody responsein 2 vaccine types. Second, the HC cohort consists of a higher percentage of women and this could have affected the antibody response. Third, we only analyzed and compared binding anti-bodies and were not able to determine a threshold for adequate response, for which analysis of neutralizing antibodies is need- ed. By comparing antibody concentrations between DS and HCand with increasing age we were able to determine relative an- tibody responses between groups and with increasing age. Fourth, additional information on cellular responses after vac-cination is not yet present, which is also important in the eval-uation of vaccine immunogenicity, especially in people with DS, as previous studies have shown that individuals with DS have lower amounts of circulating B and T cells [ 13,14]. Decreased thymic output results in low amounts of naive T cells [15]. Loss of memory against SARS-CoV-2 may further con- tribute to risk of severe COVID-19 disease over time in adultswith DS. Fifth, long-term response in our cohort is not yet known, so we do not have information about waning immunity in this particular population. In conclusion, antibody responses after SARS-CoV-2 vac- cination in adults with DS are signi cantly decreased com- pared with those of healthy adults. In older adults with DS, the decreased antibody responses were even more pro-nounced, which, combined with the highest mortality rates, Figure 1.

A third or early booster vaccination should be considered in all adults with DS, given their risk for severe disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
