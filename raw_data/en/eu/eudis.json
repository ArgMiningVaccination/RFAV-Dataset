RISKS IN LABORATORY WORKERS /CLINICAL SUMMARY Bordetella pertussis B. pertussis is a fastidious, gram -negative bacterium requiring special media for isolation. B. pertussis produces multiple antigenic and biologically active products cytotoxin These are responsible for the clinical features of pertussis , and an immune response to one or more produces immunity followi ng infection. Pathogenesis Pertussis is primarily a toxin -mediated disease. The bacteria attach to the cilia of the respiratory epithelial cells, produce toxins that paralyze the cilia, and cause inflammation of the respiratory tract, which interferes with the clearing of pulmonary secretions. Until recently, it was thought that B. pertussis did not invade the tissues; however, recent studies have suggested that the bacteria are present in alveolar macrophages.From: http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/clinical/disease -specifics.html Pertussis, or whooping cough, is a disease caused by B. pertussis, a gram -negative bacterium, which adheres to the cilia of the upper respiratory tract of humans, colonizes this tissue, and releases a number of virulence factors responsible for the local and systemic damages associated with the disease (paroxysmal cough, accompanied by whoops, vomiting, cyanosis and apnea). Vaccination is the only way to cont rol pertussis. Mass vaccination using killed bacteria (cellular vaccine) was introduced in the 1950s and reduced by 99% the incidence of the disease in infants. In the 1980s, the use of this vaccine in developed countries decreased dramatically because o f concerns of potential side effects associated with vaccination. This stimulated the search for an acellular vaccine that restrained efficacy but was less reactive than the whole -cell vaccine. Several molecules produced by B. pertussis were identified as candidates for inclusion in acellualar vaccine against whooping cough. This included 6/27/2016 UCSF Pertussis Toxin /Injury Protocol for Research Laboratories Page 14 of 19 UCSF Office of Environment , Health and Safety molecules involved in the adhesion of the bacteria to the eukaryotic cells and to the cilia of the upper respiratory tract (e.g., filamentous hemagglutinin and periacti n) and molecules that cause local and systemic damage of the host (pertussis toxin, or PT)...PT plays a central role in the pathogenis of whooping cough and induces protective immunity against infection. As for the other toxins, to be included in vaccines , PT needs to be detoxified. In the early 1980s, during the development of acellualar pertussis vaccines, a number of chemical methods (formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, tetranitromethane, and gluteraldehyde) were used to detoxify PT. Although many of the vaccines in use today contain a formaldehyde detoxified PT, genetic engineering was used to detoxify PT.\" From: Bacterial Protein Toxins, Edited by Drusilla Butnsd et al, ASM Press, 2003. PT is a protein of 105,000 daltons composed of five noncovalently linked subunits named S1 through SF, and organized into two functional domains called A and B. The A domain, which is composed of the subunit, is an enzyme that intoxicated eukaryotic cells by ADP -ribosylating their GTP proteins...The B domain i s a nontoxic oligomer...Many mutants containing single or multiple amino acid substitutions in the A or B subunits have been constructed by site directed mutagenesis of the PT gene...The most popular one is PT -9K/129G...The nontoxic mutant is being used for vacc ination against pertussis and therefore is produced in gram quantities. From: Guidebook to Protein Toxins and Their Use in Cell Biology, Edited by Rino Rappuoli, Sambrook & Tooze Publication at Oxford University Press, 1997. \"Pertussis toxin was discovered in the late 1960s and originally named islet -activating protein or lymphoctytosis -promoting factor. It was purified soon thereafter. It also has a heterohexameric structure, but is composed of five different subunits, S1 through S5, with two molecul es molecule. The S1 ADP -RT while receptor formed from dimmers of S2S4 and S3S4 subunits, linked by the SF subunit. The locus encoding PT was cloned in 1986 and shown to encode a five gene operon. Each gene in the operon encodes a subunit with a predicted signal sequence that directs the mature polypeptide to periplasmic space. Predicted molecular masses of the mature polypeptides agrees with their sizes as seen by SDS -Page of purified hol otoxin....The contribution of PT to the symptoms of whooping cough is more difficult to elucicdate since B. pertussis has multiple virulence factors and toxins, including tracheal ...Modulation of the immune system by PT is responsible for some of the symptoms of the disease such as lymphocytosis, and PT has been used experimentally as an adjuvant to induce organ specific immune diseases.\" From Microbial Toxins: Molecular and Cell ular Biology, edited by Thomas Proft, Horixon Bioscience, 2005. Overview Portions : http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/index.htm ) Diagnosti c Tests/Clinical Signs & Symptoms Diagnostic testing is not useful in acute management, but blood serum should be obtained and held for later analysis. Clinical signs and symptoms should guide clinical treatment. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis A vaccine containing toxoid or a genetically inactivated toxin is available, and all potentially exposed employees must be fully immunized and may need to receive a booster dose every ten years. 6/27/2016 UCSF Pertussis Toxin /Injury Protocol for Research Laboratories Page 15 of 19 UCSF Office of Environment , Health and Safety Post-exposure Prophylaxis/Treatment: Pertussis immune globulin may be helpful, if available. Pertussis immune serum has been in use d since the 1940s. II. A DDITIONAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION DESCRIPTION AND IMPLICATIONS OF RISK: The primary pertussis vaccine series is usually given in a combination injection with tetanus and diptheria vaccines, and is known as the DTP vaccine. A child should have received four DTP shots by 18 months of age, with a booster shot given between the ages of 4 to 6 years. After that, pertussis, dip htheria and tetanus boosters (Tdap) should be g iven as an adult every 10 years to provide continued protection. Studies show that as age increases, the circulating antibody levels progressively decline. 6/27/2016 UCSF Pertussis Toxin /Injury Protocol for Research Laboratories Page 16 of 19 UCSF Office of Environment , Health and Safety UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO ENVIRONMENT , HEALTH AND SAFETY /BIOSAFETY PERTUSSIS TOXIN EXPOSURE PROTOCOL GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR TOXIN USE (BMBL 5TH ED.) APPENDIX 3 AGENT SUMMARY STATEMENT Agent: Bordetella pertussis LABORATORY SAFETY AND CONTAINMENT RECOMMENDATIONS The agent may be present in high levels in respiratory secretions, and may be found in other clinical material, such as blood and lung tissue in its infrequent manifestation of septicemia and pneumonia, respectively.22,23 Because the natural mode of transmission is via the respiratory route, aerosol generation during the manipulation of cultures and contaminated clinical specimens generates the greatest potential hazard. BSL-2 practices, containment equipment, and facilities are recommended for all activities involving the use or manipulation of known or potentially infe ctious clinical material and cultures. ABSL -2 practices and containment equipment should be employed for housing experimentally infected animals. Primary containment devices and equipment, including biological safety cabinets, safety centrifuge cups or safety centrifuges should be used for activities likely to 126 Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories generate potentially infectious aerosols. BSL -3 practices, containment equipment, and facilities are appropriate for production operations. SPECIAL ISSUES Vaccines The reader is advised to review the current recommendations of the ACIP published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) and at the CDC Vaccines and Immunizations Web site for the latest recommendations for adolescent s and adults. Transfer of Agent Importation of this agent may require CDC and/or USDA importation permits. Domestic transport of this agent may require a permit from USDA/APHIS/VS. A DoC permit may be required for the export of this agent to another count ry GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR TOXIN USE Laboratory work with most toxins, in amounts routinely employed in the biomedical sciences, can be performed safely with minimal risk to the worker and negligible risk to the surrounding community. Toxins do not replicate, are not infectious, and are difficult to transmit mechanically or manually from person to person. Many commonly employed toxins have very low volatility and, especially in the case of protein toxins, are relatively unstable in the environment; thes e characteristics further limit the spread of toxins. Toxins can be handled using established general guidelines for toxic or highly- toxic chemicals with the incorporation of additional safety and security measures based upon a risk assessment for each specific laboratory operation. The main laboratory risks are accidental exposure by direct contamination of mouth, eyes or other mucous membranes; by inadvertent aerosol generation; and by needle -sticks or other accidents that may compromise the normal barrie r of the skin. TRAINING AND LABORATORY PLANNING 6/27/2016 UCSF Pertussis Toxin /Injury Protocol for Research Laboratories Page 17 of 19 UCSF Office of Environment , Health and Safety Each laboratory worker must be trained in the theory and practice of the toxins to be used, with special emphasis on the nature of the practical hazards associated with laboratory operations. This includes h ow to handle transfers of liquids containing toxin, where to place waste solutions and contaminated materials or equipment, and how to decontaminate work areas after routine operations, as well as after accidental spills. The worker must be reliable and su fficiently adept at all required manipulations before being provided with toxin. A risk assessment should be conducted to develop safe operating procedures before undertaking laboratory operations with toxins; suggested \"pre -operational checklists\" for wor king with toxins are available.4 For complex operations, it is recommended that new workers undergo supervised practice runs in which the exact laboratory procedures to be undertaken are rehearsed without active toxin. If toxins and infectious agents are u sed together, then both must be considered when containment equipment is selected and safety procedures are developed. Likewise, animal safety practices must be considered for toxin work involving animals. Each laboratory that uses toxins should develop a specific chemical hygiene plan. The National Research Council has provided a review of prudent laboratory practices when handling toxic and highly toxic chemicals, including the development of chemical hygiene plans and guidelines for compliance with regu lations governing occupational safety and health, hazard communication, and environmental protection. An inventory control system should be in place to account for toxin use and disposition. If toxins are stored in the laboratory, containers should be seal ed, labeled, and secured to ensure restricted access; refrigerators and other storage containers should be clearly labeled and provide contact information for trained, responsible laboratory staff. Laboratory work with toxins should be done only in designa ted rooms with controlled access and at pre -determined bench areas. When toxins are in use, the room should be clearly posted: \"Toxins in Use \u2014Authorized Personnel Only.\" Unrelated and nonessential work should be restricted from areas where stock solutions of toxin or organisms producing toxin are used. Visitors or other untrained personnel granted laboratory access must be monitored and protected from inadvertently handling laboratory equipment used to manipulate the toxin or organism. SAFETY EQUIPMENT AND CONTAINMENT Routine operations with dilute toxin solutions are conducted under BSL -2 conditions with the aid of personal protective equipment and a well -maintained BSC or c omparable engineering controls. Engineering controls should be selected according t o the risk assessment for each specific toxin operation. A certified BSC or chemical fume hood will suffice for routine operations with most protein toxins. Low molecular weight toxin solutions, or work involving volatile chemicals or radionucleotides comb ined with toxin solutions, may require the use of a charcoal -based hood filter in addition to HEPA filtration. All work with toxins should be conducted within the operationally effective zone of the hood or BSC, and each user should verify the inward airf low before initiating work. When using an open- fronted fume hood or BSC, workers should wear suitable laboratory PPE to protect the hands and arms, such as laboratory coats, smocks, or coveralls and disposable gloves. When working with toxins that pose dir ect percutaneous hazards, special care must be taken to select gloves that are impervious to the toxin and the diluents or solvents employed. When conducting liquid transfers and other operations that pose a potential splash or droplet hazard in an open- fronted hood or BSC, safety glasses and disposable facemask, or a face shield, should be worn. Toxin should be removed from the hood or BSC only after the exterior of the closed primary container has been decontaminated and placed in a clean secondary contai ner. Toxin solutions, especially concentrated stock solutions, should be transported in leak/spill - proof secondary containers. The interior of the hood or BSC should be decontaminated periodically, for example, at the end of a series of related experiments. Until thoroughly decontaminated, the hood or BSC should be posted to indicate that toxins remain in use, and access should remain restricted. Selected operations with toxins may require modified BSL -3 practices and procedures. The determination to use B SL-3 is made in consultation with available safety 6/27/2016 UCSF Pertussis Toxin /Injury Protocol for Research Laboratories Page 18 of 19 UCSF Office of Environment , Health and Safety staff and is based upon a risk assessment that considers the variables of each specific laboratory operation, especially the toxin under study, the physical state of the toxin (solution or dry form), the t otal amount of toxin used relative to the estimated human lethal dose, the volume of the material manipulated, the methodology, and any human or equipment performance limitations. INADVERTENT TOXIN AEROSOLS Emphasis must be placed on evaluating and modify ing experimental procedures to eliminate the possibility of inadvertent generation of toxin aerosols. Pressurized tubes or other containers holding toxins should be opened in a BSC, chemical fume hood, or other ventilated enclosure. Operations that expose toxin solutions to vacuum or pressure, for example sterilization of toxin solutions by membrane filtration, should always be handled in this manner, and the operator should also use appropriate respiratory protection. If vacuum lines are used with toxin, t hey should be protected with a HEPA filter to prevent entry of toxins into the line. Centrifugation of cultures or materials potentially containing toxins should only be performed using sealed, thick- walled tubes in safety centrifuge cups or sealed rotors. The outside surfaces of containers and rotors should be routinely cleaned before each use to prevent contamination that may generate an aerosol. After centrifugation, the entire rotor assembly is taken from the centrifuge to a BSC to open it and remove it s tubes. MECHANICAL INJURIES Accidental needle- sticks or mechanical injury from \"sharps\" such as glass or metal implements pose a well-known risk to laboratory workers, and the consequences may be catastrophic for operations involving toxins in amounts that exceed a human lethal dose. Only workers trained and experienced in handling animals should be permitted to conduct operations involving injection of toxin solutions using hollow -bore needles. Discarded needles/syringes and other sharps should be placed directly into properly labeled, puncture -resistant sharps containers, and decontaminated as soon as is practical. Glassware should be replaced with plastic for handling toxin solutions wherever practical to minimize the risk of cuts or abrasions from cont aminated surfaces. Thin- walled glass equipment should be completely avoided. Glass Pasteur pipettes are particularly dangerous for transferring toxin solutions and should be replaced with disposable plastic pipettes. Glass chromatography columns under pressure must be enclosed within a plastic water jacket or other secondary container. ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONS Experiments should be planned to eliminate or minimize work with dry toxin (e.g. freezedried preparations). Unavoidable operations with dry toxin should only be undertaken with appropriate respiratory protection and engineering controls. Dry toxin can be manipulated using a Class III BSC, or with the use of secondary containment such as a disposable glove bag or glove box within a hood or Class II BSC. \"Static- free\" disposable gloves should be worn when working with dry forms of toxins that are subject to spread by electrostatic dispersal. In specialized laboratories, the intentional, controlled generation of aerosols from toxin solutions may be undertak en to test antidotes or vaccines in experimental animals. These are extremely hazardous operations that should only be conducted after extensive validation of equipment and personnel, using non- toxic simulants. Aerosol exposure of animals should be done in a certified Class III BSC or hoodline. While removing exposed animals from the hoodline, and for required animal handling during the first 24 h after exposure, workers should take additional precautions, including wearing protective clothing (e.g., dispos able Tyvek suit) and appropriate respiratory protection. To minimize the risk of dry toxin generating a secondary aerosol, areas of animal skin or fur exposed to aerosols should be gently wiped with a damp cloth containing water or buffered cleaning soluti on before the animals are returned to holding areas. For high- risk operations involving dry forms of toxins, intentional aerosol formation, or the use of hollow -bore needles in conjunction with amounts of toxin estimated to be lethal for humans, considerat ion should be given to requiring the presence of at least two knowledgeable individuals at all times in the laboratory.7 DECONTAMINATION AND SPILLS 6/27/2016 UCSF Pertussis Toxin /Injury Protocol for Research Laboratories Page 19 of 19 UCSF Office of Environment , Health and Safety Toxin stability varies considerably outside of physiological conditions depending upon the temperature, pH, ionic strength, availability of co -factors and other characteristics of the surrounding matrix. Literature values for dry heat inactivation of toxins can be misleading due to variations in experimental conditions, matrix composition, and experimental crit eria for assessing toxin activity. Moreover, inactivation is not always a linear function of heating time, and some protein toxins possess a capacity to re-fold, and partially reverse inactivation caused by heating. In addition, the conditions for denaturi zing toxins in aqueous solutions are not necessarily applicable for inactivating dry, powdered toxin preparations. I nactivation procedures should not be assumed to be 100% effective without validation using specific toxin bioassays. Many toxins suscept ible to inactivation of 0.1- 0.25N, and/or bleach solutions at concentrations of 0.1- 0.5% (w/v). Use freshly prepared bleach solutions for decontamination; undiluted, commerci ally available bleach solutions typically contain 3 -6% (w/v) NaOCl. Depending upon the toxin, contaminated materials and toxin waste solutions can be inactivated by incineration or extensive autoclaving, or by soaking in suitable decontamination solutions. All disposable material used for toxin work should be placed in secondary containers, autoclaved and disposed of as toxic waste. Contaminated or potentially contaminated protective clothing and equipment should be decontaminated using suitable chemical methods or autoclaving before removal from the laboratory for disposal, cleaning or repair. If decontamination is impracticable, materials should be disposed of as toxic waste. In the event of a spill, avoid splashes or generating aerosols during cleanup by covering the spill with paper towels or other disposable, absorbent material. Apply an appropriate decontamination solution to the spill, beginning at the perimeter and working towards the center, and allow sufficient contact time to completely inactivate the toxin. Decontamination of buildings or offices containing sensitive equipment or documents poses special challenges. Large- scale decontamination is not covered explicitly here, but careful extrapolation from the basic principles may inform more extens ive clean -up efforts. The above "}
