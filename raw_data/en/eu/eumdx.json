The word \"chiropractic\" combines the Greek words cheir (hand) and praxis (action), and simply means \"done by hand.\" Chiropractic uses conservative forms of treatment, rather than medications or surgeries. Although chiropractors provide a wide range of other services, including musculoskeletal assessment, exercise therapy, and nutritional and lifestyle advice, chiropractic is most commonly associated with spinal manipulative therapy.
