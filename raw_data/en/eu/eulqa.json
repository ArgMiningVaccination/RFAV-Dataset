As of October 12, the new COVID-19 booster recommendations for people ages 5 years and older is to receive 1 bivalent mRNA booster after completion of a monovalent primary series or previously received monovalent booster dose(s); these recommendations replace all prior booster recommendations for this age group. - Recommendations for use of a bivalent Moderna booster dose in people ages 6-17 years - Recommendations for use of a bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech booster dose in people ages 5-11 years The CDC recommends a bivalent (containing components of both the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the omicron variant of the virus) COVID-19 booster for people ages 5 years and older. The bivalent vaccines, which offer better protection against COVID-19 caused by the omicron variant than the earlier, monovalent vaccines, have been authorized for use as a single booster dose administered at least two months after primary or booster vaccination. The monovalent COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be available for booster doses in patients over the age of 5. However, the monovalent vaccines will remain available for the primary vaccine series in all patients and for booster doses in patients younger than 5 years old. Visit the [CDC's COVID-19 vaccine and booster page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) for more details.
