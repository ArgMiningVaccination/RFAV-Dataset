Executive summary The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to present an extraordinary challenge to global health, complicated by rapidly evolving epidemiology. The complexities associated with the differences in composition and regimens of the currently authorized and approved COVID-19 vaccines in the United States (U.S.), the still incomplete understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immunology, and the absence of an established framework to inform periodic vaccine composition updates, leave open scientific and policy questions regarding recommendations for simplifying the immunization schedule and updating the current COVID-19 vaccines for future vaccination campaigns. The January 26 th Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) meeting will consider questions around simplifying the composition and immunization schedules of the authorized and approved COVID-19 vaccines, the process for determining the need for recommending a periodic update to COVID-19 vaccines, and the timing for implementation of such an update. The VRBPAC met on April 6 and June 28, 2022, to discuss the framework for updated vaccine composition and the strain composition for the fall 2022 COVID-19 vaccine, respectively. Based on emerging clinical data, there was a preference for a bivalent vaccine booster that incorporated a component based on the original strain and an Omicron variant component to provide greater breadth of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron, as the future circulating strains were unknown at that point. Based on the totality of the evidence, on June 30, 2022, FDA notified COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers of its recommendation to develop a bivalent vaccine (original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) as a booster dose to improve protection during the fall 2022 booster vaccination campaign. There are currently four authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S.: Spikevax (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) referred to as Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), manufactured by ModernaTX; Comirnaty (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA), referred to as Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine under the EUA manufactured by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech; the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, which is a non-replicating adenovirus type 26-vectored vaccine encoding the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 original strain manufactured by Janssen Biotech, Inc.; and the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted, which contains recombinant S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 original strain and Matrix-M adjuvant manufactured by Novavax, Inc. Both Spikevax and Comirnaty contain a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the Spike (S) protein of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain that is formulated in lipid particles. Only the two mRNA vaccines were ultimately updated to have a bivalent composition (original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) and authorized as a booster: Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, and Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent was also authorized as a third dose in the 3-dose primary series in individuals 6 months to 4 years of age. The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529 lineage) variant of concern (VOC) emerged in late 2021 and rapidly became the dominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 virus throughout the world, replacing earlier strains of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., Wuhan) and the previously designated VOCs (e.g., Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta). Omicron has continued to evolve into sublineages with additional amino acid mutations in the spike glycoprotein and the receptor binding domain (RBD), the predominant target of neutralizing antibodies elicited by infection and vaccination. The distribution of Omicron sublineages varies at different points in time in different regions of the world. Reward Your Curiosity Everything you want to read. Anytime. Anywhere. Any device.
