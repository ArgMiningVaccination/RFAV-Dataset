(These were previously housed at PTNow.) These CPGs are based on a systematic review of the evidence and published by APTA, APTA sections and academies, or by other health care associations, organizations, and societies. None of the CPGs were written by individuals. APTA does not endorse any of these guidelines unless specifically noted. Guidelines are provided to assist in clinical decision making, not to take the place of clinician judgment. Some CPGs include a CPG+ analysis, a translation aid for applying CPGs to practice, including an Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II, or AGREE II, conducted by a team of experts. - APTA members can access additional [evidence-based practice resources](/patient-care/evidence-based-practice-resources). - APTA also supports the [development of CPGs](/patient-care/evidence-based-practice-resources/cpgs/cpg-development)to reduce unwarranted variation in care and to improve the value of physical therapist services.
