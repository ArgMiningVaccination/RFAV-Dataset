COVID -19 Updates On May 25, 2023, the University of California announced revisions to the [University of California COVID-19 vaccine policy](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2023/05/uc-updating-covid-19-vaccination-policy-to-systemwide-opt-out-program.html) in light of changes to state and federal COVID-19 public health guidance and the [end of the federal Public Health Emergency](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/09/fact-sheet-end-of-the-covid-19-public-health-emergency.html) on May 11, 2023. Effective immediately: - The University will require students to either receive COVID-19 vaccination or opt out by declination by filing an exemption each year in the UCR patient portal. - Students will no longer be required to submit documentation of a COVID-19 primary series or submit and receive an approved medical or religious exemption, or disability deferral to be present on campus. - Students will no longer have registration holds for COVID-19 vaccination. We ask for your patience as we transition to accommodate these new changes in Banner/R'Web and the UCR patient portal systems. [The Policy on Vaccination Programs](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/5000695/VaccinationProgramsPolicy)\u2014With Updated Interim Amendments will be revised to reflect these changes.
