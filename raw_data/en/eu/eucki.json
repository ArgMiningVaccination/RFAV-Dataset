San Francisco, CA ABSTRACT: Ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic plant brew from the Amazon basin used as part o f healing ceremonies by the region's indigenous people for centuries, is no w consumed by growing numbers of people throughout the world. Ayahuasca consumption has moved f rom strictly being part of indigenous shamanic healing ceremonies, to being a key component o f the Brazilian syncretic churches formed in the last century, to most recently being part of ''New Age'' rituals conducted throughout the Western world. The discovery of ayahuasca by the Westerners, has resulted in a growing body of research suggesting that participants who ta ke part in ayahuasca ceremonies experience significant spiritual and psychotherapeutic eff ects. Along with these potential benefits, however, the adoption of indigenous practices into W estern cultures brings simultaneous challenges. As participation in ayahuasca ritual spreads i nto Western cultures, it becomes necessary to examine how to integrate these spiritual healing rit uals into contemporary Western concepts of psychological health and ethical conduct. INTRODUCTION Even as modern psychiatry and psychotherapy create space for patients' psychological growth and self-exploration, research has shown that indi viduals often desire to have their spiritual beliefs and values integrated into cl inical settings (Privette, Quackenbos, & Bundrick, 1994). Given the importance of mystical and spiritual experience in people's lives, it is not surprising that more and more individuals are turning towards alternative and emergent forms o f religion and spirituality in search of healing and fulfillment. In Brazil, and throughout the world, the hallucinogenic plant brew ayahua sca, used in sacred healing rituals in indigenous Amazonian cultures for centu ries, has found more recent use in a wide variety of modern spiritual contexts and communities. Its reputation for connecting those who participate in thes e ceremonies to the spirit world has stimulated the interest of those seekin g connection with what they perceive to be ''the divine'' (Trichter, Klimo, & Krippner, 2009). Shanon's (2002) description of the spiritual power of ay ahuasca provides a starting point from which to understand this phenomenon: Personally, if I were to pick one single effect of Ayahuasca that had the mos t important impact on my life ... I would say that before my encounter with stephen@drstephentrichter.com The author would like to thank Stanley Krippner, Ph.D. for his thoughtful s upport and guidance in the writing of this paper. Copyright '2010 Transpersonal Institute The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 2010, Vol. 42, No. 2 131the brew I was an atheist ... and when I returned back home after my long journey to South America, I no longer was one. Likewise, a significant number of informants I have interviewed indicated that the main lesson the y received from Ayahuasca was religious or spiritual. (p. 260) The increasing popularity of ayahuasca among Western spiritual seekers, due to its reputation for creating profound spiritual and mystical states of consciousness, has created a necessity to examine how to integrate these spiritual healing rituals into Western concepts of psychological health and ethical conduct. As the use of ayahuasca shifts to use outside of its origin al cultural context, we must examine how the spread of this healing practice c an not only bring the benefits for which it was originally intended, but how it s transfer into a new cultural framework potentially can also cause distres s and harm. AYAHUASCA BASICS Many studies of both the historical and contemporary use of entheogens, a term etymologically rooted in Latin meaning ''generating the divine with in,'' have suggested that the experiences they induce can have profoundly posit ive, even life-changing effects upon individuals, often because they provide insights into possible solutions to psychological dilemmas (Metzner, 1999). Ayah uasca, classifiable as an entheogen, is a psychoactive brew originating in the Am azon Basin region of South America. The ayahuasca drink is made by boiling, in a particular ratio, the pulverized bark of the Banisteriopsis caapi vine together with the leaves of another plant, usually the Psychotria viridis (Shanon 2002; Trichter et al., 2009). For centuries, ayahuasca has been used in South America both as a healing tool and purportedly to communicate with plant and animal spirits. The ter m ''ayahuasca'' is a compound word from the Quechua language meaning ''vine of the spirits'' (Metzner, 1999, p. 1). Widely found in the Amazon cultures , the drinking of ayahuasca was taken up by mestizos (people of mixed European and indigenous, non-European ancestry) living near tribal peoples. This resulted in a number of different movements that have incorporated ayahua sca into their doctrines and activities (Luna, 1986). Today there are several ayahuasca churches in Brazil that combine indigen ous traditional beliefs and practices with Christian and African-Brazilian elements in their patterns of use (Mercante, 2006; Metzner, 1999). The three major churches are Daime, the Uniao do Vegetal (UDV), and Barquinha. The Church of Santo Daime was founded in the 1930s in the Brazilian rain forest. In its rituals, Daime , their name for ayahuasca, is consumed as a sacrament. The Daime is regarded as a divine being, or even as the ''Divine'' itself, and is believed to be the source of life, vitality, and health, on th e one hand, and all knowledge and supreme wisdom, on the other. Another of these churches, the Brazilian UDV, a religious sect that uses ayahuasca (referr ed to ashoasca ) as a sacrament, was founded in 1961. Today, the UDV numbers 132 The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 2010, Vol. 42, No. 2more than 7,000 members in 60 nucleos or churches. Members care for the Church's sick and elderly, provide food and shelter for women and children , and are actively involved in many ecological projects. Both of these tradi tions use ayahuasca at least twice monthly in ceremonial use, as does Barquinha (''little boat''), the smallest of the three congregations (Dawson, 2007 ; Labate & Arau \u00b4jo 2004). Most recently, over the past few decades, another type of setting has devel oped for the use of ayahuasca that extends from South America to both Europe and North America (Tupper, 2009). These are ceremonies, independent from any centralized organization, which vary in form and in the manner in which the y are conducted. Ceremonial leaders use techniques borrowed from both the more traditional and the contemporary expressions of ayahuasca usage (Metzner, 1999). In addition, and of particular importance to this paper, there is an increase in frequency of the occurrence of these rituals in both urban and rural settings throughout the Western world, led by a shaman or by local experienced guides. AYAHUASCA 'SBENEFITS Spiritual Benefits Over the past two decades, growing evidence has emerged that drinking ayahuasca in a ritualized context has benefits that are felt to be ''spirit ual'' in nature by practitioners. In a study examining those who seek traditional u se of ayahuasca, Winkelman (2005) found that the motivations for attending the se ceremonies were primarily focused upon ''issues of spiritual relations a nd development'' (p. 214). He found participants reported that their experi ences resulted in an ''increased and enhanced awareness of their own self, havin g obtained insight into deeper levels of their being'' (p. 214). ''The ideas of contact with a sacred nature, God, spirits and plant and natural energies w ere expressed by many participants; others emphasized the importance of thei r personal spiritual development being promoted by the plant experiences' ' (p 214). Those who seek spiritual insight through ayahuasca tend to find what they a re looking for. Typically, those who drink the brew may feel that they are gain ing access to new sources of knowledge and that the mysteries and ultimate trut hs of the universe are being revealed to them. This is often in addition to a drinker's experience, or encounter with the Divine (Shanon, 2002). The vi sions encountered with ayahuasca are often reminiscent of those reported in the mystical traditions of different cultures throughout the ages (Shanon, 2 002). It is not for nothing that psychoactive plants have been called ''plants of th e gods'' (Schultes & Hofmann, 1979). Investigators have found that not only do participants in ayahuasca ritua lh a v e spiritual experiences, but such experiences tend to shape their ongoing spirituality. The author of this article and his colleagues found that the Ayahuasca Beyond the Amazon 133positive peak experiences that participants experience in an ayahuasca ceremony ''lead to greater incorporation of the peak experiences into one 's ongoing spiritual well being'' (Trichter, 2006). Psychotherapeutic Benefits Along with facilitating access to spiritual domains, and creating states of consciousness felt to be ''spiritual'' by experients, there seems to be gr eat promise for the use of entheogens such as ayahuasca in psychotherapy. It should be noted that these substances are not panaceas, but require work on the part of the user. The value of having entheogens as part of psychotherap yi s that the work takes place on a different level (Trichter, 2006). Alan Watts (1965) stated that entheogens ''are useful to the extent that the individu al can integrate what they reveal into the whole pattern of his behavior and the wh ole system of his knowledge'' (p.16). Chilean psychiatrist Claudio Naranjo (1979) used harmaline, one compone nt of ayahuasca, in analytic psychotherapy, claiming that 10 out of 30 patien ts diagnosed as ''psychoneurotic'' exhibited positive changes that would otherwise have been expected only after intensive psychotherapy. The potential found through Naranjo's (1979) research led to several deca des of exploration by other psychologists curious about the clinical applica tion of ayahuasca in a Western context. Trichter (2006) reported that the ayahuas ca ceremony participants were able to experience sadness, anger, and joy tha t they typically had difficulty accessing. Additionally, approximately 50 %of the participants in the Trichter (2006) study reported experiencing persona l reflections and insights. These types of experiences included the partic ipants' examination of personal interactions from their past and reflections on t heir attitudes and beliefs. The significant and meaningful spiritual and myst ical experiences resulting from participating in an ayahuasca ceremony can produce the desired affective expression that Spezzano (1993) states pat ients seek in psychotherapy. Integrating ayahuasca ceremony into the psychoth er- apeutic process gives the patient an alternate perspective in examining unconscious, unexpressed affect. Examining the psychological effects of ayahuasca, Doering-Silveira et a l. (2005) compared ayahuasca-drinking adolescents to those in a control gro up for psychological symptomatology. Screening tests for major DSM-IV diagnoses were used to assess the participants' mental health. The resear chers found that adolescents who drink ayahuasca were comparable in their DSM- IV profiles to those in a control group. Despite finding similar results, t he study did show slight differences. Results showed that the ayahuasca group memb ers were characterized by less anxiety, less body image dysmorphia, and fewer attention deficit disorders. In addition, the study found that ''ayahuas ca using participants were considered to be more confident, optimistic, outgoing energetic, persistent, reflective, and scored higher than control measu res of social desirability and emotional maturity'' (p.132). The researchers a cknowl- 134 The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 2010, Vol. 42, No. 2edged that ''It is still unclear if the reported changes can be attributed t o the effect of the substance itself or to the religious affiliating process'' ( p. 132). Another study on adolescents and ayahuasca was conducted by Dobkin de Rios et al. (2005) examining differences between users and controls on qualitative measures. Although there were no significant differences be tween the ayahuasca-drinking adolescents and the control group, the researche rs found that the ayahuasca-drinking group seemed ''to be more responsible, respectful, and concerned about the welfare of others...The teens appear to be healthy, thoughtful, considerate, and bonded to their families and relig ious peers'' (p. 139). A clinical psychological examination of ayahuasca psychiatric diagnost ic assessments revealed that, although an appreciable percentage of the lon g-term ayahuasca-using adult participants had manifested alcohol, depressive ,o r anxiety disorders prior to their initiation into an ayahuasca church, ''a ll disorders had remitted without recurrence after entry into the Uniao do Vegetal'' (Grob et al., 1996, p. 93). The researchers found that this chang e was particularly evident in the area of excessive alcohol consumption, where ,i n addition to the five participants who had diagnoses of prior alcohol abuse disorders, six additional participants reported moderate patterns of al cohol consumption that fell short of achieving actual psychiatric diagnostic s tatus on a formal structured interview. After affiliating with the ayahuasca chur ch, all 11 of these participants with prior involvement with alcohol achieved com plete abstinence sustained over many years. The study also found that participa nts reported that they had undergone radical transformations of their behavi or, attitudes toward others, and outlook on life beyond their decrease in alco hol use. Participants were convinced that they had been able to ''eliminate th eir chronic anger, resentment, aggression, and alienation, as well as acquir e greater self-control, responsibility to family and community, and perso nal fulfillment through their participation in the ayahuasca ceremonies of t he UDV'' (p. 94). Grob et al. concluded: Although the salutary effects of a strong group support system and religio us affiliation cannot be minimized, it is not inconceivable that the long-te rm use of the ayahuasca itself may have had a direct positive and therapeutic effect on the participants' psychiatric and functional status. (p. 94) In the first report to focus on the cognition of long-term ayahuasca-using adolescents, Doering-Silveira et al. (2005) found that those who use ayah uasca in a religious context did not differ significantly from those in the contr ol group. The study examined adolescents who attended UDV churches in Brazil , comparing their results on various neurological tests to those in the cont rol group consisting of adolescents who had never imbibed ayahuasca. The authors concluded they had found no evidence that ayahuasca has injurious effects on adolescents who participated with their families in ceremonia l rituals using psychoactive substances. Furthermore, they stated ''we have been allowed access to study the effects and have found, at least in this pilot Ayahuasca Beyond the Amazon 135preliminary investigation, that ayahuasca did not have a toxic or deleter ious effect on adolescent neurocognitive functioning'' (p. 127). In other research examining the psychological effects of ayahuasca, Hoff mann, Keppel-Hesselink, & da Silveira Barbosa (2001) examined the effects of ayahuasca consumption on participants' EEG results. Despite being a neurological study, Hoffmann et al. concluded, ''ayahuasca opens up peop le to their unconscious feelings and memories and gives them an opportunity t o explore new psychological insights'' (p. 29). Finally, Trichter et al. (2009) concluded that those who drink ayahuasca on just one occasion tend to have positive spiritual experiences during ceremonies and afterwards, and then take th ese positive experiences and integrate them into their daily lives. These ayahuasca ceremony participants tend to, after their experience, be more empathic and feel more connected to others, nature and their sense of god or the divine. They are consistently shown to, in the short-term, feel healed , grateful and peaceful, with an increased sense of responsibility for, and reconciliation with, themselves, others, and the world. The data from thi s research indicates that these positive measures are clearly linked to experience of an ayahuasca ceremony, and reveals incentive for further investigation into ayahuasca's promise. (p. 133) AYAHUASCA 'SRISKS AND CHALLENGES Given the many research findings related to the use of ayahuasca, from find ing no physical or psychological harm in chronic use (Callaway et al., 1999; Ri ba & Barbanoj, 2005), to its benefits in spiritual inquiry and psychological g rowth (Shanon 2002; Trichter, 2006; Trichter et al., 2009), it is of no wonder tha t increased attention is being given to the brew by Western researchers and s eekers alike. Despite these findings and extensive anecdotal reports of healing and transformation, there is concern about how this growing phenomenon could harm those Westerners who partake in the ayahuasca brew, unless guideline s are created to protect their physical, psychological and spiritual health. The movement of ayahuasca rituals from an Amazonian cultural context to a Western one creates the potential for serious risks to participants as thi s movement gains popularity in the West. It is only within the Amazonian indigenous cultures and syncretic Brazilian churches in which power hierarchies and traditional family-community structure exist that the c urrent models of ayahuasca ritual have thrived. Although there are many aspects o f these rituals that would benefit Westerners, it is important to realize ho w differences in culture are likely to require an adaptation and evolution w hen applied to new settings. In a detailed look into what is happening in ''ayahuasca tourism,'' Dobkin de Rios and Rumrrill (2008) pointed to the health of Western users who 136 The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 2010, Vol. 42, No. 2participate in an unregulated and economically challenged Amazon region where charlatans and malevolent practitioners use the hallucinogenic br ew to take advantage of high paying Western ayahuasca tourists. They discuss ho w the growing demand for ayahuasca has resulted in neither shamanistic practitioners nor their brews being regulated to a dangerous degree. They point out that many of these practitioners ''lack the experience, appropr iate personality, and requisite training for this traditional healing work...n or are they aware of the important facts about drug interactions'' (p. 76). Going further they state ''at best, they are simply inept and rely on luck so as not to harm their clients. At worse, they fleece them out of substantial cash. Som eo f the women are seduced, raped, and discarded after their novelty to the heal er wears off'' (p. 82). Their work calls for the regulation of the tourism indu stry centered around ayahuasca, that puts participants' well being at risk as t hey are actively preyed upon by ''neo-shaman'' looking for sex, money and power. Although their work and similar findings contain important contribution st o the literature, I take the position that a significant number of more subtl e, yet equally harmful psychological risks are involved in integrating ayahuas ca- based rituals into Western contexts, even if knowledgeable, trained and respected ceremony leaders are the ones sharing the brew. Ayahuasca ritua ls over the centuries have adapted to their indigenous cultural context to be st serve those communities. With a rapidly growing diversity of people participating in these rituals, the slow refining process used to best sui t the people and communities involved is not possible. With the import of the ayahuasca trade to North America, Europe and Australia, those participat ing in these ceremonies, even with well intentioned and trained ayahuasca rit ual leaders, are at risk of harm. Psychiatric and Medical Risks Because of the increased consumption of ayahuasca in the West, there is a ne ed to acknowledge the medical, psychiatric, and psychological, risks invol ved in mixing the psychoactive chemicals of the brew. Psychiatric risks include the risks of combining ayahuasca with prescription medications, particular ly the SSRI anti-depressants (Callaway & Grob, 1998). In addition, individuals diagnosed with a mental health disorder or at high risk for one are taking a potent psychedelic and are putting themselves at risk for decompensation and the potential for mental and emotional stress. Experiences can bring up pa st traumas or can bring about new traumatic experiences that participants ma y not be able have the ego strength or emotional capabilities to work through without causing significant disturbances to themselves, their friends, and their families. Further research is needed in identifying the risks and benefit so f different populations, including healthy populations, neurotic patien ts, and psychotic patients. Dobkin de Rios and Rumrrill (2008) showed how ''uncontrolled use of the plants was precipitating [a] woman into a psycho tic state'' (p.78). This kind of experience is not for everyone, just as any psychospiritual practice may not be a good match for everyone. The hallucinogenic properties of the brew allow the ego's defenses to lower, Ayahuasca Beyond the Amazon 137facilitating investigation into oneself; however, this scenario can ind uce a rush of fear and paranoia, and psychotic states can result. Therefore it is sugg ested that only healthy people would find the most value participating in an ayahuasca ceremony. Determining who can safely participate in these ayahuasca rituals will continually need to be re-addressed as further res earch is conducted. Spiritual Risk In a time of postmodern and New Age hodgepodge spirituality in which Westerners often reject their Judeo-Christian past, and end up picking an d choosing from different religious and mystical traditions to create an idiosyncratic spirituality, it is of great importance that the implicati ons of introducing such a powerful shamanic tool into the West are examined. Ofte n spiritual seekers, in an effort to escape their own psychological challen ges and traumas of their past, turn towards spirituality to find answers. Roberts (2001) explained that a ''genuine encounter with the Ultimate does not guarantee a genuine spirituality. The experience may be authentic, but how authentic their spirituality was depends on what those who had the experience do with it'' (p. xii). John Welwood (2000), in his examination of the Eastern religious movement into the West termed the phenomenon ''spiritual bypass,'' explo red the idea that people often turn to and get absorbed into an unhealthy relationship with spirituality to avoid examining their psychological i ssues. He describes spiritual bypass as, the tendency to avoid or prematurely transcend basic human needs, feeling s, and developmental tasks...they wind up using spiritual practices to create a new 'spiritual' identity, which is actually an old dysfunctional identit y- based on avoidance of unresolved psychological issues - repackaged in a new guise. (p. 12) Welwood's concern about spiritual bypass expresses the sentiment that we are only successful at finding psychological health if we truly unravel our unhealthy personality patterns and/or have a history of positive psychol ogical development. Participating in an ayahuasca ceremony in and of itself crea tes a risk of falling into old patterns, newly masked. This idea flies in the face of many of those who blindly rush towards the potential spiritual and psychological benefits discussed earlier. As Welwood illuminated, much has been learned from the challenges of the movement of Eastern religions to th e West that those seeking enlightenment in ashrams and on mountaintops may sometimes merely push their pain into the unconscious while donning a shin y new spiritual practice veneer. Immersing oneself in a community based on ayahuasca rituals can create many similar blind spots to self-growth and w ell- being. Furthermore, one must acknowledge the possibility that spiritual seeker s who pursue ayahuasca rituals may be looking for answers to some of their life's challenges in the bottom of a glass of a hallucinogenic tea. While studies 138 The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 2010, Vol. 42, No. 2(MacRae, 1992; Sulla, 2005; Trichter, 2006; Villaescusa, 2002) have show n that profound insights are possible during ayahuasca ceremonies, there are no studies of Westerners to date that show that these insights can be integrat ed into the patient's ongoing life in order to make the positive changes they a re seeking. With no ongoing treatment or continuity of care, not only might patients find it difficult to integrate these insights into their life, bu t if the ceremony breaks down psychological defenses and results in opening up trauma that is left unresolved, these patients are at risk of developing ne wo r exacerbating old psychological difficulties. Through my clinical work, I have discovered that many Western participant si n ayahuasca ceremonies seek out the weekend long spiritual retreats typica li n the West, for similar reasons that Fotiou (2010) has found in shamanic tour ism - for self transformation, healing, accessing the sacred, etc. They end up depending on the retreats for this type of environment and seek out ceremon ies during which they may connect to the medicine, sometimes several dozen tim es per year. As discussed elsewhere in more detail (Trichter, 2009) and seen through my clinical work with patients, some of these individuals often fi nd themselves coming back for more insights, connection with alleged spirit s, and alleged spiritual healing in a compulsive way. This ceremony-craving behavior is the result of a co-dependence on the ayahuasca rituals and its component s, which is a form of what could be called spiritual addiction . It is a way in which the person uses an external object as a soothing coping mechanism. This wil l likely fail repeatedly as the patient will become psychologically depend ent on the ayahuasca to achieve these visions, feelings, and insights. Despite the sense of connection that I previously reported in many ayahuas ca ceremony participants (Trichter, 2006), I have observed in some patients in my clinical practice a sense of spiritual narcissism, a phenomenon similar t o Welwood's (2000) observations when eastern religions moved to the West. Individuals become so deeply involved in the spiritual path with the cerem onies that they become unaware of the impact of their spiritual pursuits. Throug hm y clinical practice I have observed participants who do not have compassion for others who do not share the ideology of the community. Other people have pushed aside their life's work and their loved ones in order to spend more ti me drinking ayahuasca in ceremony to connect with what they consider to be ''t he spirit world.'' Ethical and Legal Challenges One of the greatest challenges of the movement of ayahuasca culture to the West is the movement of a tradition rooted in psychoactive substances and shamanic community leaders to ones with vastly different contemporary an d historical cultural values. In a risk similar to the challenges of adoptin g Eastern guru-based practices in the West (Kornfield, 1993; Welwood, 2000), the ayahuasca ritual leader's position of power in combination with the psychoactive brew can create many challenges. An ayahuasca ceremony for the ayahuasca tourist costs from next to nothing in its indigenous setting all the Ayahuasca Beyond the Amazon 139way up to $200 USD in the Amazon and $500 USD per ceremony in Western countries. Ayahuasqueros are in the center of power, of psychoactive substances, and of wealthy and devoted participants who often see the brew as a means of connecting with the Divine. This often leads to participants w ho idealize the shamanic practitioner, sometimes falling in love and occasi onally developing a sexual relationship with him or her. The interpersonal dynamics and energy between the practitioner who is conducting an ayahuasca ritual and the participant can cause significant harm in the participant when not handled appropriately. Ayahuasca ceremony leaders often come from other Amazonian cultural traditions and are rarel y trained in the knowledge of transference and countertransference issues - terms used in psychotherapy to describe the unconscious projections of energy between patient and therapist. This knowledge is necessary in order for ayahuasca ritual leaders to navigate these powerful energies within a cul turally appropriate Western framework. As discussed in more detail elsewhere (Trichter, 2009), it is not uncommon that well-established and seasoned ayahuasca ritual leaders demonstrate cou nter- transference towards the participants in their circles. The ayahuasqueros may end up superimposing their own agenda on the client, claiming that the clie nt needs to go through certain types of intense experiences, some of them sexu al in nature. Some ritual leaders have been known to project erotic fantasies into their work with participants. Although often not consciously wielding th eir power over the participants in drug induced states, sexual relationships are quite common between healers and participants during rituals and sometim es continue on an ongoing basis. Strong feelings of the ayahuasca ritual leader can emerge in other ways as w ell. Leaders can be supportive or punishing towards certain of the participant s' reactions to their action, the effects of the brew, or the ceremony in gener al. Ritual leaders may project their feelings of anger, disappointment, sham e, or guilt onto participants if they do not act according to expectations. Clie nts can also idealize the leaders losing their original intention for participat ing in the rituals by focusing more attention and energy on the leader than on their ow n growth and development (Kornfield, 1993). Regardless of the setting, ayahuasca leaders have been known to be attache dt o certain ideologies and dogmas that are entwined in their traditions. It is often in these cases that ceremony leaders with little understanding of how thei r own personal reactions can be psychologically harmful to the participants ca nd oa great disservice to those they attempt to heal. Another challenge to the healing potential of ayahuasca rituals is a conce rn that it is mainly through suggestion that participants feel any healing be nefit. Participants in the ayahuasca ceremonies in the Trichter (2006) study wer e told beforehand by the ceremony organizers that they were participating in a healing ceremony, so it is not surprising that this was a common theme discussed by participants. Within the contemporary psychotherapeutic c ontext, 140 The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 2010, Vol. 42, No. 2it is believed that external demand characteristics do not produce psycho logical growth, but healing comes through self-discovery. It is questionable whe ther or not the healing that occurs during ayahuasca rituals is generated through self- exploration or merely imposed on the participants during a trance state by the ritual leader. Within the Western framework of psychological healing, the therapist cre ates a safe container by examining his or her countertransference issues and kee ping any idiosyncratic or impulsive feelings from entering the room or the grou p. A well-developed theory regarding how the ayahuasca ceremony leader relat es to participants as part of the healing process would be useful in this explora tion. Otherwise, without this relational agreement, negative results can occu r, causing pain to the participant. For example, if the ceremony leader prefe rs hearing about one type of experience and not another, then the result becom es conditioned, and little, if any, growth can occur. A final consideration involves the regulation of ayahuasca. In the countr ies of the Amazon (principally Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador), the use of ayahuasca, whether in the indigenous context or in the religious contexts described e arlier, is legal. In the Western world, the situation is not clear. Although UDV's r ight to use ayahuasca has been affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court, Dimethyl- tryptamine, in itself, remains a Schedule I substance in the United States , which makes it illegal for administration and consumption (Bullis, 2008). Regardless of whether or not there is ambiguous legal status there are no standards (or protocol) of how ayahuasca ceremonies are to be safely and effectively conducted, nor any ethical guidelines for how ayahuasca cere mony leaders should work with their participants in any country. There are many disparate ceremony leaders from various cultural traditions, and differ ent schools of thought, each with idiosyncratic variations on ceremonies tha t make standards and regulations of ayahuasca ceremonies and ceremony leaders' conduct difficult, if not impossible, to maintain. Furthermore , because of the great variability within ayahuasca ceremonies and ceremon y leaders right now, there is no current protocol on how ayahuasca ceremonie s could be integrated as a beneficial part of psychotherapy, counseling, or spiritual development. CONCLUSIONS The growing evidence of the positive benefits of drinking ayahuasca has le dt o a surge in use from its original base in South America to ritual leaders trav eling worldwide conducting ceremonies with the brew. However, these benefits d o not come without serious risks involved. There are many precautions that should be taken on order to insure the protection of ayahuasca ritual participants as this indigenous shamanic tradition makes its way into the Western world. The following list is by no means exhaustive, as it is not mea nt to make recommendations beyond the author's field of expertise. Ayahuasca Beyond the Amazon 141Education It is of increasing importance that the public needs to be educated about th e traditional use of ayahuasca in both church and indigenous settings, so th at they can be well-informed about making a decision whether or not to participate in these rituals. Too often participants blindly trust ayahu asca ritual leaders and place their medical and psychological well-being into the hands of strangers. The growing body of knowledge gathered by seasoned ayahuasca communities and academia needs to be utilized to educate na \u00a8ve newcomers about the psychological and spiritual risks and benefits of wor king with ayahuasca. Creating a cross-cultural document about the medical ris ks involved in contraindicated medicines and foods and sharing the document with pertinent forums and centers could prevent unnecessary hospitaliza tions and deaths. Additionally, by educating those interested in participating in ayahuas ca rituals regarding the traditional uses of the brew, the cultures in which t he rituals originated and the cosmology of the traditions, there would likel yb ea n increase in seriousness, reverence, structure, and cohesive community s upport with contemporary rituals. Simultaneously, education of this sort would likely decrease the use of ayahuasca ritual as ''spiritual recreation,'' as well as the number of unskilled leaders who are not prepared to handle the challenges t hat manifest during ceremonies. Psychotherapeutic Integration By combining ayahuasca rituals with Western psychotherapeutic models, participation in these traditions could be brought towards a healthy West ern psychospiritual healing practice. Takiwasi, a center that combines ayah uasca and other indigenous healing tools with psychotherapy, is one such model t hat has been treating patients suffering from severe drug addiction for the pa st 25 years in Tarapoto, Peru (Mabit, 2007). Through such integration, the psychological health of participants could be safeguarded so that during psychotherapy sessions they could explore potential spiritual bypass an d investigate shame or guilt that may have come up in transference- countertransference issues within the ayahuasca ritual context. Standi ng alone, the ayahuasca ceremony has the potential of creating meaningful and significant mystical and spiritual states of being; however, combined wi th psychotherapy, specific qualities of such states can further promote the essential goals that have been proven to be effective in the Western psychotherapeutic modalities. Another benefit of integrating psychotherapy and ayahuasca rituals is th at it would allow licensed and experienced mental health professionals to help screen, prepare potential crisis intervention, and work with emerging tr aumas and post-ceremony integration. The work that can be done with an experienc ed licensed mental health professional begins with preparing the client wit h the potential of emotionally challenging material that may come up during the 142 The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 2010, Vol. 42, No. 2ceremonies. The clinician can also work with the client to prepare an inten tion as a focusing of the client's psychospiritual needs at the time of the cerem ony. Doing so may enable the client to guide the direction of the experience towa rds gaining insights into pertinent areas that are challenging the client's p resenting problem or development. To achieve the greatest benefit from an ayahuasca ceremony, it would be valuable for the client to have participated in therapy for some time. One o f the key benefits that could be found in integrating psychotherapy and an ayahuasca ritual would be that the previous therapeutic work could be brought into the ayahuasca ritual for further investigation, the experie nces could be further explored, and the interpretation's validity tested in th e dream- like states of the ayahuasca experience. The client could prepare for the ayahuasca ritual work by setting an intent ion to further explore themes that have come up during therapy and could examin e any resistance recognized in the consultation room during the ceremony. T he clients who might be working on several themes in their ongoing therapy cou ld determine with appropriately trained clinicians which ones might be most effectively explored during an ayahuasca ritual. During ayahuasca rituals it would be valuable to have a well-trained clini cian available for participants who were overwhelmed, agitated, and/or unsta ble during the experience. It is possible for participants in ayahuasca cerem ony to be in crisis due to fear and anxiety over the altered state of consciousness or the psychological material that comes up. One major psychological service th at can be employed during these ceremonies is having people trained in crisis intervention available. Often in the Western context, ceremonies have '' sitters'' assisting participants who are confused or disoriented. Sitters could be trained in relaxation techniques, empathic listening, and simply being present t o alleviate some of the stressors that occur during these crises. Few sitters are trained in mental health procedures and many are inadequat ely able to assist the participants or work with the client to use the psycholog ical material that is coming up for the client to their benefit. In the tradition al ayahuasca context, the ritual leader, or ayahuasquero uses icaros (songs), native tobacco, and other shamanic tools to assist the struggling participant (L una, 1986). However, this is part of a larger context of community support found in the traditional culture. Although these tools can and should be utilized i n the ceremony, it is not unheard of that individuals sometime seek more Western - oriented tools to aid in the process during ceremony. A cliniciantrained i n integrating spirituality and psychotherapy, is helpful to have on hand to help individuals work through their experience if needed in the moment. Most contemporary psychotherapeutic frameworks state that a therapeuti c relationship is necessary for the client to experience sincere relatedne ss to others and to develop a stronger sense of oneself. Therefore, the sense of interconnectedness that participants feel with this type of work could be supplemented with such psychotherapeutic techniques to create compleme n- Ayahuasca Beyond the Amazon 143tary benefits (Shanon 2002; Trichter, 2006). Although the sense of connec tion sometimes felt during experiences with ayahuasca can have healing benefi ts for participants, there is often no ongoing concrete relationship that is del iberately occurring during the group rituals. This causes questions of the sustaina ble impact of these feelings on contemporary Western psyche. By bringing the feelings of connection to a therapeutic relationship alongside particip ation in an ayahuasca ritual, they could be further explored and integrated. The integration of ayahuasca ceremony into a framework of ongoing psychotherapy would create a greater sense of safety for the client when participating in an ayahuasca ritual. This would allow the participant to explore a situation that often brings up fear, feeling fully prepared. It w ould also allow the client to share his or her experiences with the therapist pos t- ceremony. Lastly, this rapport would create an opportunity for the therap ist to make interpretations more freely while the ceremony experience is more temporally and affectively grounded within the client. After participat ing in the ceremony, the affective experiences and the insights that may have been obtained through the ayahuasca ritual could be interpreted, worked throu gh, and integrated into the ongoing therapy. In order to avoid the pitfalls of spiritual bypass, numbing distraction, a nd egocentric self involvement (Welwood, 2000), it is valuable for a trained clinician to work with the participants of the ayahuasca ceremony afterwa rds in order to help them use the material to interface with their intentions, spiritual growth, interpersonal connections, and psychological develo pment. Welwood's concern about spiritual bypass expresses sentiments similar t o the psychotherapy model which states that we are only successful at finding he alth if we link affective expression and interpersonal connection with realit y, not fantasy (Mitchell, 1993). When clients participate in an ayahuasca cerem ony, psychotherapy creates an opportunity for the therapist and client to work through any of the breakthroughs that occurred during the ceremony to explore whether they are founded in fantasy or reality. As ayahuasca ritua ls are transferred into a Western culture that does not automatically support th em, a means of integration is needed in order for clients to take the lessons from the ritual and incorporate them into their daily life. Because these rituals o nly happen sporadically in the West and the ritual leaders are often traveling between communities, there is often a feeling of longing for the next opportunity to connect with the experiences attached to earlier ayahuasc a experiences. By exploring the insights, wisdom, and healing that have com e out of ayahuasca ritual experiences regularly in psychotherapy, the feeling so f connection, growth, strength, will, and purpose that are often reported c an not only be integrated, but a tendency for dependence on the ayahuasca rituals for such states can be extinguished. Ethical Guidelines In addition to education and integration into Western psychotherapy, individuals would be protected from potential risks if ayahuasca ritual 144 The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 2010, Vol. 42, No. 2communities created ethical guidelines stating the proper use of the sacr ament and conduct of participants and ceremony leaders. The educational moveme nt and the collaboration with mental health professionals will only be possi ble through building communities and community networks to share knowledge and set standards of care during ayahuasca rituals. This is a departure fro m the rivalry that is commonplace between ayahuasqueros in the indigenous setting, where shamans speak badly of each other and are sometimes involved in combative sorcery (Dobkin de Rios & Rumrrill, 2008). The building of these collaborative relationships between Western communities and the ayahua sca ritual leaders with whom they work will allow proper dissemination of the educational materials, as well as medical and psychological screening standards. Ayahuasca ritual leaders in the Western setting need to be held accountabl e for these outcomes because if they are not embedded in a community in which there is a continuum of feedback and accountability, they can take advanta ge of and abuse ritual participants and continue on to their next destination unchecked. In a similar vein to Dobkin de Rios and Rumrrill's (2008) work, I am proposing that by setting up intra and intercommunity dialogue around ethics and monitoring the reputations of different ritual leaders the com munity can be protected from predators. Those ritual leaders who need to work on issues that come up with Westerners can receive the feedback they need in order to obtain further training or do personal work. Kornfield (1993) wri tes that Eastern religion teachers in the West had ''to deal with the underlyin g roots of problems in themselves, whether old wounds, cultural and family history, isolation, addiction, or their own grandiosity. In some communi ties masters have ended up attending AA meetings or seeking counseling. In othe rs, decision-making councils were formed to end the isolation of the teacher' ' (p. 264). Setting up ethics for the communities and ayahuasca ritual leaders also wo uld be beneficial so that the powerful temptations of power, sex, and money can be discussed transparently and leaders could be held accountable. Currentl y, there are no cross-cultural ethical standards by which ayahuasca ritual leader s must abide. They receive no coursework in ethics, nor are they required or advis ed to go through any type of personal psychotherapy, consultation, or supervis ion to examine any personal issues that may come up in the work they conduct. Some groups have already begun to explore this idea such as the Montreal chapter of the Santo Daime (Ceu do Montreal Santo Daime Church of Canada, 2008) and the Indigenous Doctors Union Yageceros of the Colombian Amazon ( Unio\u00b4n , 1999). The UDV also has a 50 year tradition of monitoring the ethical conduc ts of their leaders \u00b4s Fernando To \u00b4foli, personal communication, February 6, 2011). More dialogue needs to be created not on ly within communities, but between communities so that those seeking guidan ce and healing from this plant medicine are adequately protected when enteri ng such powerful and vulnerable states of consciousness. Ayahuasca Beyond the Amazon 145Dobkin de Rios and Rumrrill (2008) make a strong case for the dangers involved in working with inexperienced or charlatan neo-shamans, those w ho have not studied the depths of the tradition and are solely seeking money, s ex, and/or power. Although their investigation is extensive, there is an equa lly important need for the examination of well established and respected ayahuasqueros and other ayahuasca ritual leaders, whose practices and/or personal beliefs may be in conflict with participants from urban or international cultures, thus causing unintended harm to their patients. A well-developed theory regarding how the ayahuasca ceremony leader relat es to participants as part of the healing process would be useful in the explorat ion of transference and counter-transference issues. If the participant knows that their emotions are accepted within the therapeutic relationship, the client ca n move from the fantasy that they have been holding onto - that affective expressi on yields pain and tension - to a realistic observation that connection with o thers through affective expression can exist. In this global age it is no longer acceptable to claim naivete \u00b4 or tradition when intentionally crossing cultural boundaries as a healer. Until we begin to look at all of these challenges in detail, the full range of potential benefits can not be considered inside a vacuum. The community of those who participate in ayahuasca rituals must take it upon themselves to protect themselves as individuals and a community from potential harms so that they can explore t he depth and beauty of the healing potential of the sacred brew.
