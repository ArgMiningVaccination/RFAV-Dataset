Its goal is to exercise the immune system by familiarizing it with the frequency of viruses or bacteria, and to reduce individual susceptibility. This offers many benefits without the risks of wild disease. The immediate benefit is that once an individual is familiar with the energetic signature of a targeted disease, he or she can either recognize and repel the disease when met in nature, or mount an appropriate immune response to it. No method is 100% effective. There is always the chance of catching a disease. The greatest benefit with homeoprophylaxis is improved long-term immune function. A robust immune system is not as likely to develop chronic illness. Acute illness may still occur since this is the body's way to promote the greatest vitality.Homeopathic influenzinum is prepared from a broad spectrum of current and historical influenza viruses. Homeopathic dilution and succussion render the contents devoid of all original molecules. Influenzinum CV30 is the foundational influenzinum product with an added component to boost immunity during current outbreaks. Cuba is currently providing homeoprophylaxis to its citizens due to its success and safety during multiple HP interventions over the last few decades. This product is delivered in two separate 2-dram vials. The benefits are: \u00b7 You will have enough for a family of six. \u00b7 You will be able to add or subtract Genus Epidemicus (GE) remedies as new information emerges. \u00b7 You will be able to use part 1 (INF-CV) every year to boost immunity. \u00b7 You will be able to use part 2 (PNC-CV30) separately if needed. \u00b7 The two separate vials sold together are still called \"INFLUENZINUM CV30\" \u00b7 If you are already in an HP program AND have the original Influenzinum sold before the current virus, you already have both components! Just take the PNC in your kit as outlined in the program and take INF-CV weekly. InfluenzinumCV 30 is not intended to prevent or treat illness.

PLEASE NOTE: -Only two orders per household will be honored -The number of pellets taken per dose is directed by their size. Depending on what size pellets our supplier has in stock, the number of pellets that constitutes a dose changes, i.e. more pellets per dose if they are smaller. Therefore, instructions on how many to take varies. In reality, since homeopathy is energy, the number of pellets is NEVER critical. This is NOT a pharmaceutical. Any number of pellets per dose is safe for any age. No return on opened products. "}
