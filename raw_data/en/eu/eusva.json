In 25% of the cases, infertility is of male origin and is often attributed to a lower quality of spermatozoa (concentration and mobility). The cause may come from the sometimes unbalanced lifestyle we lead. Certain behaviors alter the fertilizing power of the sperm. Thus, it happens that anxious people have fertility disorders. Their sperm is then less rich in spermatozoa. Tobacco, but also alcohol, can also be responsible for a decline in fertility. Finally, many European and American studies have shown that chemicals, which are omnipresent in our daily lives, also have an impact on male fertility. Oligobs Procrea.M has been specially designed to improve this quality, formulated towards 3 axes: - the fight against oxidative stress: use of antioxidants and major enzyme cofactors: vitamin C, E, Zinc, Selenium. - the supply of energy necessary for the proper functioning of the spermatozoa: L-Carnitine, Coenzyme Q10, Arginine, - the supply of structural elements necessary for the formation of the spermatozoa membrane: the omega 3.
