Beware: like most cosmetics, many scar creams contain a long list of harmful ingredients! Even though they can help to \"reduce the appearance of the scar,\" they can come with a host of possible negative side effects. Some ingredients commonly found in anti-scar creams include: - Silicone - Mineral Oil - Lanolin - Glycerin - Ceresin - Lactic For [Related Article: - Fragrance - [Related Article: [Related Article: - DMDM Hydantoin - This is a potential Formaldehyde releaser - Vitamin E (tocopherol) I go into detail on why these ingredients can cause harm in my [Clean Beauty Checklist](https://www.inonaround.org/clean-beauty-checklist-landing/). Many of these ingredients are potentially linked to cancer, endocrine disruption, allergies, fertility issues, and more (no bueno!). The Common Scar-Healing Protocol When you're usually healing from a small injury (like stitches), it's common for dermatologists to recommend putting petroleum jelly (aka petrolatum, paraffin oil, mineral oil, white petrolatum) on the injury. These may help protect the wound from additional harm and keep it moist for healing. While these products can help protect the scar, they are oftentimes derived from petroleum and can be linked to allergic reactions. Any allergic reactions can seriously slow the healing process. Topical antibiotics can potentially contribute to antibiotic resistance. [ [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC132740/)] There are other options that can keep the wound protected, without the use of petroleum-based products that can be contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). [ [5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S102194981930016X), [6](http://www.idph.state.il.us/cancer/factsheets/polycyclicaromatichydrocarbons.htm)] PAHs are linked to cancer, unless the product is fully refined. Unlike Europe, petroleum-based products are not always fully refined in the United States. [ [7](https://www.nappturality.com/natural-hair-care/hair-talk/3926/petrolatum-what-they-don-t-tell-you), [8](https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/ewg-research-shows-22-percent-all-cosmetics-may-be-contaminated-cancer)] Best Practices To Avoid Scarring The severity of a scar usually fades over time, but following these tips can help ensure the scar is not made worse. - Look for the following active ingredients: - Avoid scar creams with questionable & toxic ingredients (like parabens, unnecessary fragrance, specific preservatives). Many harsh ingredients can lead to dry skin, which can make healing even more difficult. - Skip the petroleum-based products & antibiotic topicals, unless necessary or there is a serious risk of infection (discuss this with your doctor). - Beware of very bold claims which can misrepresent the product. - Never pick at the injury! This will only make healing more difficult. Leave the damaged skin alone to heal (especially if you're trying to avoid acne scars). As always, it's best to patch test any new product to ensure you don't have an adverse reaction. - Use a non-toxic scar cream as soon as you can, but wait for it to properly heal first (once approved by your dermatologist or doctor). The longer you wait, the harder it can be to fade. - Keep the injury clean with non-toxic soap (not antimicrobial soap) and covered with a clean bandage - In fact, uncovered wounds can take 50% longer to heal than if they were protected with a bandage. Cover it up with a moisture-protective agent, like beeswax. [ [14](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31126777/)] - In fact, uncovered wounds can take 50% longer to heal than if they were protected with a bandage. Cover it up with a moisture-protective agent, like beeswax. [ - See a doctor if there's intense pain, pus, or signs of infection. - Protect your scar from the sun. - Wear clothing to cover it, bandages, and stay in the shade. Sun exposure can darken the scar and lead to irritation, especially if you're using a cream that makes you more prone to sunburn. Adequate sun protection is key. - Be patient & remain consistent. It will take a while before you see results (sometimes 2-6+ months). Don't expect the scar to disappear in 24 hours! Scar treatment takes time. - The amount of healing time can depend on how deep the scar is (or the layer of skin impacted by the wound). Very deep marks are more difficult to fade. - Some creams will require consistent reapplication a couple of times a day. What Are Better Non-Toxic Scar Creams For Kids?
