Codes are: | - 1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care; - 2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO). | Is Organization Subpart || N | | The \"Is the organization a subpart?\" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart = , the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes. Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the \"parents\"). Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their \"parents\": (1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the \"parent\"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. (2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the \"parent\") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. (3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the \"parent\") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. The \"parent\"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI. | | Provider Organization Name (Legal Business Name) || BALANCE INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE, PC | | Provide organization name (legal business name used to file tax returns with the IRS).
