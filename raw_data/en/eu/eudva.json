Theabilityofvirus-specicimmuneresponsestoprevent or limit viral replication in genital or rectal mucosal tissuesis likely to be critical for defense against HIV-1 infection.An important goal for vaccination is, therefore, to developstrategies that will induce durable immune responses bothat mucosal sites of transmission as well as in the systemiccirculation. Mucosal immune responses are often regulatedindependently of systemic immunity. Lymphocyte homingto mucosal tissues is mediated partly by cell surface inte-grinsinteractingwiththeirligandsonlocalbloodvesselwalls[7]. The genital tract lacks organized lymphoid aggregates, althoughitisrepletewithpotentantigen-presentingcells [2], raisingthepossibilitythatinductionofgenitalresponsesmayoccur elsewhere, including other mucosal sites, followed byre-circulation of immune cells into these tissues. Clearly, agreater understanding of mechanisms underlying the gen-eration of immune responses in the genital tract will becriticalfortherationaldevelopmentofprotectivevaccinationstrategies.Nevertheless,evaluationofnovelmucosaldeliverystrategiesofpromisingHIV/SIVvaccinestrategiesisclearlywarranted.

Other vector-based approaches, using constructs designedtoreplicateinmucosaltissues,haveshowngreaterpromise for induction of mucosal immunity to SIV/HIV-1[15-17], although strategies restricted to the use of a single virally-vectoredvaccinemayalsohavelimitedpotentialdueto weaker immunogenicity than prime-boost regimens and the development of anti-vector immunity in the host. Systemically-deliveredheterologousprimeandboostHIV vaccine strategies involving priming by DNA vaccinationand boosting with recombinant attenuated poxvirus vectorsencodingcommonHIVorSIVantigensreliablyinducehighlevels of circulating T cell immunity [18-22]. Avian poxviruses such as over vaccinia virus-basedapproaches since anti-vaccinia responses from prior small-pox vaccination limits the widespread utility of recombi-nantvacciniavirusvaccines.DNA/poxvirusvaccine-inducedSHIV-specic T cell responses correlate with partial protec-tion from virulent SHIV infection [22,23]. When given in prime-boost combination via mucosal routes, similar DNAand poxvirus-based vaccines have been shown to inducemucosal T cell immunity in both mice and T cells than CCR5-utilizing viruses,which are most commonly transmitted via the heterosexualroute and are generally more difcult to neutralize and pro-tect against [21,28]. Furthermore, our recent studies in mice indicatethatdeliveryofDNAandpoxvirusHIVvaccinesinmucosal-mucosal (intranasal) or systemic-mucosal combi-nations is also immunogenic for both systemic and mucosalTcellresponses,notablyinthelymphnodesdrainingthegen-ital and rectal mucosa (Ranasinghe et al., unpublished data,[24]).Wethereforeevaluatedtheimmunogenicityandprotec- tiveefcacyofmucosally-deliveredDNAandrFPVvaccinesagainstavirulentvaginalCCR5-utilizingSHIVchallengeinnon-human primates. 2.

Results 3.1. HIV-1 macaque study Intherstsetofexperiments,wecomparedtheimmuno- genicity of HIV-1-encoding DNA and (IM) or in mucosal andsystemic combination in groups of four to six pig-tail macaques ( Table 1). High levels of T cell immunity in peripheral blood were generated when DNA and rFPVvaccines were administered by the IM route (IM/IM), aswe have previously reported [18,22,29] . The two groups of animals primed with DNA vaccines by the IN route andboosted with rFPV, either by the IN route (IN/IN) or the IMroute (IN/IM) failed to generate signicant HIV-specic Tcell immunity blood as demonstrated by IFN /H9253 ELISpotassays( Fig.1A).Asimilarpatternofresponseswas observed by HIV-specic T cell proliferation, with prolifer-ationinresponsetoHIV-1antigensobservedonlyinPBMCobtainedfromtheIM/IMgroupaftereither1or2rFPVboosts(Fig.1B).Inaddition,noHIV-1antibodiesweredetectedby EIA or western blot in plasma from macaques immunizedwith the IN/IN or IN/IM regimens (data not shown). In con-trasttoanimalsgivenrFPVIM [29],noanti-FPVantibodies were detected by western blot in macaques given IN rFPV(data not shown), suggesting limited presentation of rFPVantigens to the circulating immune system following deliv-ery by this mucosal route. To examine mucosal T cell immunity in the mucosally (IN)-immunizedanimals,weobtainedrectalmucosaltissuesand lymph nodes draining the rectum and genital tract of IFN /H9253release and the results were inconclusive (data not shown).

In parallel experiments,wealsostudiedtheefcacyofINandIRdeliv-ery of rFPV for boosting mucosal responses in systemically(IM) DNA-primed animals based on the success of theseapproaches in mice (IM/IN and IM/IR groups). We evalu-atedboththeimmunogenicityofthesevaccineregimensandtheircapacitytoameliorateasubsequentpathogenicmucosal(vaginal) SHIV challenge. Five groups of pigtail macaqueswere primed with SHIV-expressing DNA (three doses) andboosted with rFPV expressing the shared SIV mac239Gag and Pol proteins (two doses) in the combinations shown inTable 2. The kinetics, magnitude and phenotype of the systemic (circulating) cellular immune responses induced by thesevaccines were quantied by antigen-specic T cell produc-tionofIFN after IM DNA vaccina- tion(meanresponse13SFC/106PBMC,range0-38,toGag peptides at week 9), a rapid rise within 1 week of the IMrFPV booster demonstrated effective priming of the cellularresponse.

Mucosal boostingwith rFPV either or IN routes in macaques that hadbeen primed systemically (IM) with DNA vaccines inducedrecallCD4andCD8TcellimmunitytoSHIVandamodest but signicant reduction in acute SHIV viral loads. Interest-ingly, these animals had poor circulating T cell responsespriortochallengewithSHIVcomparedtothoseprimedandboostedviatheintramuscularroute.IncontrasttothepromiseoftheIM/IRandIM/INvaccineregimens,aDNA/rFPVvac-cine regimen based wholly on intranasal delivery was notprotective in macaques. It may be that further adjuvants arerequired to increase the efcacy of nasal delivery of theseconstructsinmacaques [27].Ourdataindicatethateffective immune priming for partial protection against pathogenicmucosal challenge was achieved with these systemic DNAprime and mucosal rFPV boost vaccination strategies. Toassesstheprotectiveefcacyofourvaccinestrategies, we utilized a detailed kinetic analysis of acute SHIV 23 (2005) 5009-5021 5019 SHIVSF162P3is derived from a CCR5-tropic primary HIV- 1 isolate and the vaginal infection model we studied likelyrepresents a good approximation of male to female HIV-1 transmission in humans [28]. Many vaccine studies to date have used intra-rectal challenge with CXCR4-utilizingSHIV strains such as SHIV 89.6Pthat target na \u00a8ve rather than memory CD4 T cells [28]. Similar to natural infection in humans,andincontrasttoSHIV 89.6Pchallengestudies,high levels of homologous NAb responses to SHIV SF162P3were notgenerateduntilaftertheacuteinfectionperiodfollowingchallenge. The slow generation of NAb to SHIV SF162P3is consistent with the heterologous nature of the neutralizationdeterminants in the vaccines, and the primary, CCR5-tropicHIV-1 SF162P3Envelope in the SHIV challenge stock. This enabled the primary analysis of T cell responses in protec-tiveimmunity,theprimarygoalofourDNA/rFPVregimens,giventhatenvelopeimmunogensthatinducebroadandeffec-tive NAb remain elusive. The efcacy of a protective vaccine against HIV-1 will depend, at least in part, on its ability to induce long-termmucosal immune responses and/or those that are rapidlyactivated upon local exposure to the virus. After infec-tion, the time period during which local immune responsescould potentially contain or even eradicate the virus beforewidespread systemic dissemination are likely to be of theorder of a few days [41]. The protection that we observed in our systemic prime/IR mucosal boost vaccine group wasintriguing. Little or no SHIV-specic circulating CD4 orCD8 T cell responses were induced by either the IM/IR orIM/IN vaccination regimen as measured by IFN /H9253ELISpot, intracellularcytokinestaining,orproliferationstudies.How-ever, following challenge, sharp increases in the magnitudeofCD8 +TcellresponseswereobservedintheIM/IRand,to somewhatlesserextent,intheIM/INvaccinationgroup(sim-ilar to those observed in the systemically vaccinated IM/IMgroup). Although the \"priming\" effect of the IM DNA vac-cinealonemayhavebeensufcienttorecalleffectiveimmuneresponsesfollowingchallenge,themucosallydeliveredrFPVmayhavecontributedtoenhancedprotectiveimmunity [22]. In our recent murine studies of these vaccine strategies,mucosal IR or IN rFPV boosting was required for (IM)DNApriming,notablyinthelymphnodesdrainingthegenital and rectal mucosa (Ranasinghe et al., unpublisheddata).Inthiscontext,theanalysesofmacaquemucosalCD4 + and CD8+T cell responses performed at autopsy, i.e. after vaginalchallenge,wereinteresting,demonstratingenhancedendocervical T cell responses in the mucosally-immunizedanimals in comparison to the systemically (IM/IM) immu-nized animals and controls. These data raise the possibilitythatmoreeffectiveprimingofgenitaltractimmunityoccurredfollowing mucosal administration of the rFPV booster vac-cine.InterpretationofthesemucosalTcellresponsesshouldbe tempered with the small numbers of animals in the out-bred pigtail macaque groups and the knowledge that manyof the responses are likely to reflect the disseminated SHIVinfection, rather than the priming of responses induced by the vaccines alone. The functional role of mucosal T cellslater following virus exposure is likely to be diminishedin comparison to responses present or generated within therst few days of challenge. Further studies in macaques arewarranted involving detailed kinetic studies of mucosal Tcell responses following vaccination by these routes andpathogenic mucosal challenge. Multiple \"real-time\" analy-ses of mucosal T cell immunity would be greatly + T cells in inbred Mamu-A*01 rhesus macaques [25,27].W e are now tetramers to common SIVepitopes in pigtail macaques to facilitate such studies [40]. Effective uptake of vaccine antigens at mucosal surfaces is problematical and has long represented a challenge formucosal vaccine development. The use of alternative vec-tor systems, including those with demonstrated tropism formucosal surfaces, may help increase the uptake and pre-sentation of encoded vaccine antigens at mucosal surfaces[15,16]. We are currently evaluating mucosal delivery of recombinant adenovirus vectors and recombinant vacciniavirus/rFPV prime-boost as in a signicant reductionin acute SHIV viral levels. An important goal is to developstrategiesthatwillinducedurableimmuneresponsesbothatmucosalsitesoftransmissionandinthesystemiccirculation.Additionalrenementstoourvaccineregimensandimprove-ments in the technology for mucosal T cell analysis, shouldprovide a rationale for future human trials with the goal ofreducing HIV-1 transmission and disease.
