Maybe you also think of soothing music, essential oils, and incense. Do healing crystals also come to mind? Although not popularly associated with one another, crystal healing and massage therapy are a powerful combination against negative energy, stress, muscle pain, and other ailments. What is Crystal Healing? [Crystals](https://www.gemsociety.org/article/crystal/) are minerals that have atoms in a highly ordered repeating pattern. Most crystals form organically due to geological processes. Humans have [used crystals for thousands of years](https://www.crystalage.com/crystal_information/crystal_history/#healing), dating all the way back to the ancient Sumerians. In holistic medicine, crystals have powerful healing energy due to their vibration frequencies. They help us release negative energy, rebalance our chakras, and reset the electrical currents and energy flow in our bodies. How Can Crystal Healing Be Used During a Massage? Massage therapists rely on natural tools to amplify the healing effect of the ancient techniques on your body. This can include [hot stones](/should-i-get-hot-stone-massage-therapy/), [Himalayan salt](/considering-himalayan-salt-stone-massage-explore-the-benefits/), essential oils, [cups](/what-is-a-massage-with-cupping-and-its-benefits/), and, of course, crystals. Using healing crystals before, during, and after a massage helps to amplify the positive effects of the session. 1. Before the Massage It's important to prepare the body for a cleanse. Meditation and breathing exercises with crystals will open your chakras to be detoxed and realigned as the body relaxes during the massage. Grounding crystals associated with the root chakra are best for pre-massage relaxation. 2. During the Massage Your massage therapist may use crystals in different ways, depending on the massage. The most common uses of crystal healing and massage therapy include: - Placing a crystal directly on each chakra center to realign the energy flow while the therapist massages your body - Arranging crystals around your body to cleanse the energy field and prevent negative energy from entering the space - Massaging high-tension areas with tumbled stones or a crystal massage wand - Using crystal beads or small tumbled stones and water for a foot and palm massage 3. After the Massage Using the healing power of crystals after the massage can help to maximize the benefits and prolong your feeling of relaxation and good health. Just as you did with pre-massage crystal prep work, sit with grounding crystals, close your eyes, and focus on your breath and body. Pay attention to how you feel now that your body is recharged and refreshed and your energy is back into alignment and flowing correctly. Taking this extra time with grounding crystals helps to fix those alignments into place and attract more positive energy. You'll enjoy the benefits of your crystal massage longer when you take a moment to notice and appreciate the harmony of your mind, body, and spirit. What Crystals Are Used During the Massage? Each crystal has specific healing properties. Some excel at detoxing the body, while others are masters of resetting your energy field or restoring balance. A massage therapist may use a preselected set of crystals designed to target all of the chakras for total realignment, or s/he may tailor the crystal selection to best serve the client's specific needs based on mental, emotional, and physical issues. The crystals most commonly associated with healing and detoxification include: - Amethyst (Third Eye Chakra): One of the most popular healing and balancing crystals that foster equilibrium. - Aventurine (Heart Chakra): A stone that is known for promoting mental and emotional healing properties. - Black Tourmaline (Root Chakra): A powerful healing crystal that absorbs and neutralizes negative energy to cleanse the body. - Citrine (Solar Plexus Chakra): Also called the \"light maker\" crystal, promotes positive energy and recharges the energy field. - Clear Quartz (Crown Chakra): The ultimate healing crystal, highly versatile when it comes to purifying negative energy. - Hematite (Root Chakra): A grounding crystal that helps to detox the body and make us feel stable and grounded. - Rose Quartz (Heart Chakra): Known as the crystal of love, rose quartz helps to heal the heart from negativity caused by relationship stress, including romance, friendships, family, and even self-love. - Sodalite (Throat Chakra): A wonderful anti-stress crystal that excels at promoting calmness and relaxation to restore balance. - Tiger's Eye (Sacral Chakra): A stone of protection, good fortune, mental clarity, and focus. Any one of these crystals can be a powerful healing companion to the skills and expertise of your massage therapist. It's always important to have an open conversation and convey any pain, stress, and frustration before the massage begins so your therapist can select the crystal(s) best suited to help you. All of the crystals on this list are good at healing, but their properties and vibration frequencies work in different ways. You may already know which crystals resonate best with your energy - but if not, that's okay. Trust your massage therapist to select the right crystals to maximize the healing effect of the massage. Just as you take care of your vehicle with oil changes and tire rotations, your body also needs regular tune-ups to keep functioning at maximum efficiency. But we're more complex than a car. Our ailments often go deeper than the mechanical issues in our muscles, joints, and nerves. Our spiritual energy needs attention, too. This is why combining crystal healing and massage therapy produces such powerful results. Considering a crystal massage?
