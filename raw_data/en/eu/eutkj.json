What to Expect During a Massage Therapy Appointment If you've never had a massage before, you might be wondering what to expect during your first appointment. A trained massage therapist at One Source Integrative Medicine will begin by asking you a series of health-related questions, including: - Whether you're experiencing any chronic pain - If you're currently on medications - Your pain threshold level Your massage therapist will then prescribe the right type of massage for you. During the actual massage process, you'll lay on a padded treatment table, and the therapist will work their way down your body using their hands to manipulate your soft tissue and work on any areas of tightness or concern. Massage sessions can last anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes in length, and frequency depends on your overall health concerns. Regular massage visits are quite common, with most patients reporting a difference in wellness within as little as three weeks.
