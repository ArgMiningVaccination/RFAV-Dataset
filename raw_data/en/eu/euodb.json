Most of us feel the burden of burnout regularly. We all know what it feels like to be running on empty and not giving ourselves any time to refuel and replenish. Women are bearing the major brunt of burnout. [We experience far more stress than men](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2016/coping-with-change.pdf) due to a complex constellation of factors, including the greater demands of managing multiple roles \u2014 and the influence of hormonal changes on our life cycles. Whether you're a new momma; a woman juggling teens, a job, and older parents who also need your care; or a woman building a new career, you know what it's like to feel like you're on 24/7. And it can add up fast. Burnout has many faces. Some are familiar - feeling stressed out and overwhelmed, feeling agitated, losing sleep, eating a bit more sugar than we'd usually choose to. We may find ourselves noticing that there's more tension in our relationships than we care to admit when we suddenly lose it with a spouse, kid, or even the woman at the grocery store check-out. But symptoms of burnout can also be subtle. For example, burnout causes anxiety, depression, and even [procrastination and low motivation](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/escape-from-inertia/). It makes us less able to focus and concentrate, puts our memory on the fritz, and can cause us to feel brittle to the point of snapping like a dry branch. Burnout can manifest in physical symptoms including, but not limited to: [Fatigue or exhaustion](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/fending-off-adrenal-fatigue/) - Hives and rashes - Digestive problems - Headaches - Aches and pains - Insomnia - Weight gain \u2014 [especially around your middle](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/anatomy-of-a-potbelly/) [Hormone imbalances](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/how-to-balance-your-hormones/) - Chronic signs of inflammation, like joint aches and pains - Headaches [Low libido](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/boost-your-libido/) - Decreased willpower and decision-making ability - Getting sick more often than you should with colds, UTIs, yeast infections, and cold-sore outbreaks. What's Really Happening When You're Burned Out Burnout happens when you've pushed your [ stress response system](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/reset-your-stress-response/) past its limit of resilience. You've been 'stretched' for so long that you've actually started to put strain on your body's stress system - the circuit between your brain and your adrenals \u2014 and the downstream effects show up in your body, mind, and mood. Your brain starts saying, \"I can't let you keep pushing yourself like this anymore, so I'm going to basically send you into exhaustion and breakdown so you have no choice but to hit the brakes and pull over to the side of the road.\" This is a phenomenon I call SOS, or Survival Overdrive Syndrome, which you can [read about here](https://avivaromm.com/10-signs-adrenals-overdrive/). The problem is that even though as women we're incredibly resilient, overwhelm can eventually turn into burnout and burnout into breakdown \u2014 that's where little physical symptoms you may have been ignoring can start to turn into bigger problems. Adaptogens to the Rescue [Adaptogens are a group of herbs](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/ancient-healers-adaptogens/) that were first categorized with that name around the 1940s, though they've been used in traditional herbalism for thousands of years for their ability to improve stamina, fertility, and immunity, and as general tonics to promote longevity and well-being. These herbs are well suited to help us rebound from burnout because they help us adapt to and heal from stress (that's why they're called adaptogens). They help to regulate the hypothalamus and adrenal glands (your HPA axis), which are in charge of your stress response and cortisol production. All adaptogens can help to heal the stress response system and [boost your reserves and resilience,](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/the-5-best-ways-to-build-resiliency/) but adaptogens exist on a spectrum \u2014 from the calming, soothing, gentle, nourishing ones, to those that are stimulating and arousing. When your energy tank is already \"below the empty line,\" and you're running on fumes, adding high-octane adaptogens \u2014 for example, the more stimulating adaptogens like ginseng and rhodiola \u2014 can add fuel to a fire. When we're in burnout, it's more effective to soothe and repair the nervous system, and heal any damage that's been done. Therefore, when it comes to adaptogens for burnout and related symptoms, I typically start with the most gentle \u2014 ashwagandha and [reishi mushroom](https://avivaromm.com/reishi-hot-chocolate/), combined with herbs like lemon balm and motherwort which are not adaptogens, but are classically used to calm the nervous system. I may do this for for two to 12 weeks, while also adding in a [ daily meditation](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/how-to-begin-a-daily-meditation-practice/) or yoga practice and a nourishing diet with special attention to blood-sugar balance. Only after this do I usually add the next spectrum of adaptogens, those that are most energizing. I reserve the more stimulating adaptogens (for example, ginseng) for women who aren't actually burned-out at all, but need extra support for high-demand times in their lives \u2014 extra immune boosting for travel, during athletic training, while working night shifts, or when under a great deal of cognitive demand (like medical residents)! While adaptogens are not generally recommended for use in pregnancy due to lack of safety data, they are a great ally for tired new moms \u2014 but again, only the most gentle in the calming and nourishing categories in this article to prevent overstimulating baby if you're breastfeeding. By definition, adaptogens are non-toxic, even with long-term use. But an important caution: Adaptogens are not meant to be used to keep you pushing harder and for longer. They're not a substitute for sleep, meditation, time in nature, time with friends, or good food. While adaptogens may give you the extra support you need for those occasional times when you just can't hit the pause button, the real goal is to address the underlying issues that are keeping you in [chronic overwhelm](https://avivaromm.com/fear-freedom/). Choosing the Right Adaptogen(s) for You Let's take a look at some of the soothing and nourishing adaptogens - these are the ones at the end of the adaptogen spectrum that will help you feel like you're getting restored, repaired, and replenished. When taking adaptogens for burnout, start with the lowest dose, and choose the most gentle among them. Follow the [tips for integrating adaptogens that I laid out in this blog](http://avivaromm.com/adaptogens-beating-stress/), and if you still feel too stimulated, wait to take the adaptogens again until you've tried other self-care techniques. When your reserve tank has been empty for a long time, you may have to get a little bit more nourished before you can even start to add in something that supports the engine further. Make sure to balance your blood sugar and get enough sleep. Getting some root vegetables or whole grains at dinner can help you sleep better because it helps reset your evening cortisol levels. Sometimes I \"prescribe\" a [weekly massage](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/mmm-massage-surprising-ways-massage-heals-the-body-and-mind/), a short morning and evening meditation practice, and an Epsom-salts-and-lavender bath at night. Here are some of my favorites: CALMING/SOOTHING ADAPTOGENS Ashwagandha: The mind, mood, and muscle soother It's suited for when you might say: - I'm tired and wired. - I struggle to fall asleep. - I have chronically achy and painful joints or arthritis. - I deal with memory and brain fog. - I'm nervous or anxious. - I have chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, or chronic muscle tension.

Contrary to popular misinformation, this herb is considered safe for women with Hashimoto's and other [autoimmune conditions](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/autoimmune-disorders-when-your-body-turns-on-you/). It is a nightshade but is not usually considered troublesome for those avoiding nightshades, but use your discretion on how you feel and start with the lowest dosing.

It calms the nervous system and can be taken before bed for deeper, relaxing, and restorative sleep. It is also powerful herb for your immune system, so if you're getting sick a lot because of stress, or never get sick and then crash on your first day of vacation, this might be a great choice for you. Dose: 3 to 9 g dried mushroom in capsules or tablets daily or 2 to 4 mL tincture in water 2 to 3x/day. (Possibly avoid if you have a true mushroom allergy). NOURISHING/REPLENISHING ADAPTOGENS Ashwagandha (see Calming Adaptogens, above) Holy basil: The vitalizer It's suited for when you might say: - I want a gentle tonic for mind, mood, and immunity. - I am struggling with depression, anxiety, or low mood. - I have sleep problems. - I want help shifting to a new mindset and making healthy lifestyle changes. - I struggle with mental clarity. - I have chronic inflammation. - I have high blood sugar, cholesterol, or triglycerides. Holy or \"sacred\" basil calms the mind and spirit and promotes longevity.

The Quechua Indians of Peru consider maca a food that promotes mental acuity, physical vitality, endurance, and stamina. Maca reduces anxiety and depression and is rich in essential amino acids, iodine, iron, and magnesium, as well as sterols that may possess a wide range of activities that support adrenal and hormone function. Dose: 75 to 100 mg/day Schizandra: The detoxifier It's suited for when you might say: - I can't focus. I have brain fog or memory problems. - I don't have energy anymore.

Shatavari: The hormonal harmonizer, queen of women's adaptogens It's suited for when you might say: - I feel like I need rejuvenation, balance, and calm. - I have [hormonal imbalances](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/how-to-balance-your-hormones/), including PMS, fertility, or menopausal problems.

It is nourishing and calming, as well as hormonally balancing; it is used for irritability and many hormonal imbalances affecting the mood, for example, emotional symptoms of PMS and menopause. Avoid if you have a history of estrogen-receptor-positive cancer. Dose: 2 to 4 mL (40 to 80 drops) of tincture in water 2 to 3x/day When we're tired we need to give ourselves what might seem impossible - time to restore, heal, and replenish. We need permission to pause. If you can learn to hit the reset button when you need to, the benefits will be many \u2014 greater longevity, inner peace, better relationships, a healthier more vital body and mind \u2014 and in the long run, more productivity, not less.
