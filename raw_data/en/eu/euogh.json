Where they disagreed the most was with the use of traditional healing in the intensive care units, only 16.9% agreed with the use of this treatment for serious illness, such as cardiac or respiratory compromise, whether in the hospital (21.2% agreed) or as outpatients (26.4% agreed). Nearly half (48.6%) agreed with using traditional medicines for chronic illnesses, such as non-insulin dependent diabetes or Parkinson's disease (Zubek, 1994, p. 1926). One instance where physicians were unwilling to allow their patients to use Native medicine was while the patient is in the hospital, because the physician could be held legally responsible for any treatment administered while admitted under their care. There is also the problem of differentiating between legitimate Native healing practitioners and those who would take advantage of anyone not aware of the proper rituals and techniques that need to be performed (Zubek, 1994, p. 1929). This could be overcome by having a formalized licensing organization such as is used by Western practitioners (i.e. American Society of Clinical Pathology [ASCP]). That poses another problem though, as to whether traditionalists would be willing to have such an organization. The Journal of Dietary Supplements discusses the increased use of \"Complimentary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)\" and how it is becoming a need among physicians to educate and train themselves so that the idea of Integrative Medicine is a realization to the public (Litchy, 2011). This holistic approach allows the ability for conventional medicine to be incorporated with \"Treatment originates outside you; healing comes from within\" Andrew Weil M.D. once said (citation). Most of people have heard of some form of alternative or eastern medicine and I'm sure the first thing that came to mind was skepticism. It's difficult to understand that the human body can be healed in different ways, especially when those ways seem foreign and unusual. Even in today's society, the human body still holds mysteries that science has not yet discovered. Although, it has been shown that traditional western medicine does treat pains, alternative medicine has been known to treat the soul. In 2007, 38% of adults used some sort of CAM, complementary and alternative medicine (citation). While this method of treatment is not as widely A Paradigm Shift to Complementary and Alternative Medicine Over the last century, religion, spirituality, and science have all played a major role in health care, although they have never been integrated with traditional medical science in the United States. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is a set of medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not part or integrated as part of Western medicine which is the dominant health care system in the United States. Religion and spirituality have both played dominant roles in healing since the beginning of history. Today it is believed that prayer and faith can bring healing and is referred to as holistic healing, or focus on the mind, body, and spirit rather Both Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal medicine have long roots in American history as alternatives to the Biomedical practice, albeit with Herbal medicine gaining greater early popularity due to it's similarities to alternative medicines in American cultural traditions. The fulfillment of needs not adequately addressed by biomedicine, whether it be the basic lack of healthcare of any sort in early Western America in which the first Chinese American arrived, or the lack of preventative care in the modern day United States, is a defining thread in the practice of TCM in the US, of which Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture served as vanguards. Another defining thread in these practices history and future in the US is the influences of cultural adaption, The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine: Research on Paradigm, Practice, and Policy is the premier peer-reviewed journal of scientific work for healthcare professionals, practitioners, and scientists seeking to evaluate and integrate Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) into mainstream practice. The Journal delivers original research that directly impacts patient care therapies, protocols, and strategies, ultimately improving the quality of physical and spiritual healing. The article is great for alternative medicine practitioners, researchers and students. The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine includes exclusive topics that focus on alternative and complementary treatments and ideas that are not duplicated elsewhere. It gives insight that I can incorporate into research and knowledge about this wide-ranging topic. One part of the article I found especially fascinating is about our modern culture, constantly offering and encouraging the use of painkillers and other pills to momentary sooth pair or illness. \"Pills have been a part of a revolution of medical science that has yielded relief Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Therapies in Cancer Patients Acquiring the knowledge and understanding of how to get complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatment covered by health insurance companies can be extremely convoluted and unclear\u2014in fact, one would be hard-pressed to make a specific statement regarding CAM treatment because coverage varies so significantly depending on state laws, regulations, and differences among specific health insurance plans. Considering the use of CAM therapy requires extensive investigation of your health insurance providers' plans to determine if any portion of this treatment will be covered; and utilization of other agencies such as the National Center for Complementary The popularity of complementary and alternative medicine, CAM continues to grow as more people embrace alternatives to conventional medicine to improve their lives and cure various diseases and conditions. In the United States, the CAM practice is more common in people with anxiety, severe depression, and insomnia. In the midst of the acceptance of CAM, other people still rely on conventional medicine and integrative care models to treat severe depression. In the past few decades, the use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) has moved from a fringe movement to highly popular and widely used therapies in Western society that are being integrated into conventional treatment (Cherry & Jacob, 2011). Although various forms of CAM have been reported for centuries, Naturopathy & Nutritional Medicine Introduction Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) also, \"integrative medicine\" like acupuncture and meditation are approaches to medicine and healthcare that are practiced in many places in the world, including in the United States. In fact an article in the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Alternative medicine has been considered the \"hidden mainstream\" of patient care in America. As biomedicine increased in popularity, alternative methods of healing arose as a response to the treatments used by physicians. Historically, alternative (or \"complementary\") medicine conveyed itself by highlighting its \"natural\" attributes. These characteristics attracted those who were wary of the chemicals used in allopathic medicines. Much of the skepticism that has accompanied complementary alternative medicine (CAM) stems from the lack of scientifically-based evidence that shows its efficacy; there is no \"alternative\" medicine there is simply \"unproven\" medicine (Fontanarosa and Lundberg 1618). This argument suggests that medicine and Monique Osigbeme Advanced Clinical Medicine University of Louisville School of Medicine July 2016 Complementary and Alternative Medicine: A Deeper Look In an ever-changing world, humans are evolving and with that come evolving diseases. With this progression, we have developed advanced technologies and treatments in order to eradicate these diseases\u2014from vaccines to chemotherapy Complementary and Alternative Medicines Complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) are medicines that are not considered conventional medicine. Conventional Medicine is also known as Western Medicine and is often practice by medical professional like medical doctors, nurses and therapist. The boundaries between CAM and conventional medicine are not fixed, and because CAM has recently become more accepted, the treatment combination of CAM and conventional medicine increased and the boundaries between the two faded even further. Conventional practices can't cure everything and this also pushes people towards alternative methods. Things that pull people towards CAM are claims of cure, natural treatment, (appealing because natural is good, and the news being in the media which they have easy access to. CAM consider more than just treating the illness and are also involved in having support groups which help people cope with their illness. Because they are often not reimbursed they have more time to spend with the clients. And they practice the three T's, talk, touch, time. The speaker also explained that the people who practice Complementary medicine are the medical doctors, CAM practitioners, traditional healers, and patients. A reason why CAM might be risky for the public is that often times information that is found on the Internet isn't correct, misleading, or the source is unknown. Introduction Alternative healthcare options or alternative medicine is \"any of various systems of healing or treating disease (such as acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy, or faith healing) that is not included under traditional medical practice in the United States and Britain\" (Webster dictionary). Alternative medicine is the term used for medical products and practices that are not part of the standard of care. Standard of care is what medical doctors, doctors of traditional medicine, and allied health professionals, such as nurses and physical therapists, practice. Alternative medicine is used in place of standard medical care. Examples of alternative practices that do not include traditional medicine are aroma therapy, diet therapy, herbalism, homeopathy, massage therapy, reflexology, chiropractic therapy, cannabis, faith or spiritual healing and acupuncture amongst others (Medicine.net). Alternative medical systems are built upon complete systems of theory and practice sometimes these systems develop into something substantial; some if these systems have even developed in western cultures. Examples of alternative medical systems that have developed in Western cultures are homeopathic medicine and naturopathic medicine. Examples of systems that have developed in non-Western cultures include traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda (Medicine.net). There are more than a hundred different types of alternative medicine but there are five key types of alternative "}
