It does not contain MDMA. The product (pictured to the right) is a pill/tablet, branded 'UPS', lime-green, speckled, shield-shaped, and approximately 8mm x 10mm x 3mm in size. Possible effects of these pills N-ethylpentylone is significantly stronger than MDMA, but produces more unwanted effects People often report N-ethylpentylone gives them less euphoria than MDMA and more unwanted effects, such as heart palpitations, anxiety, agitation and paranoia. If you take N-ethylpentylone at a dose similar to a typical MDMA dose, your chance of overdose will increase significantly. Higher doses of N-ethylpentylone can lead to hallucinations/bizarre behaviour, an inability to sleep (24-72 hours), overheating, seizures, heart attack, stroke and death. N-ethylpentylone is a synthetic stimulant that is classified as a 'substitute cathinone'. Consuming N-ethylpentylone with other substances - especially stimulants like MDMA, cocaine or methamphetamine - will increase your risk of toxicity. The effects of N-ethylpentylone take longer to appear than MDMA, and will also wear off more quickly This may make you feel like you should consume more. If you have a delayed or unexpected reaction to a drug, do not take more - it will increase your chance of experiencing serious or even life-threatening effects, including overdose. N-ethylpentylone can appear in other forms and cannot be distinguished from MDMA N-ethylpentylone may also appear as a white or off-white powder/crystal. It can look and smell very similar to MDMA. It is not possible to tell the difference between a product containing MDMA and a product containing N-ethylpentylone without laboratory testing.
