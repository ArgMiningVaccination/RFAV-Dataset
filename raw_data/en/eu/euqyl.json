Adult vaccinations, though, may not be on your calendar. Here are the vaccines that should be on your radar, at the very least: - Flu vaccine will help slow the spread of flu through our communities. Since there are new strains every year, you should plan to get the flu vaccine every year. - Tetanus is a life threatening nervous system disease which can be contracted by contaminated wounds. The tetanus vaccine, combined with diphtheria vaccine (Td) should be taken by all adults every 10 years. All adults should also have the Tdap vaccine once. This includes Pertussis vaccine to prevent whooping cough. Women get the Tdap vaccine with each pregnancy to protect their newborns from Pertussis (whooping cough). - Pneumonia is a serious disease, but the vaccine is not recommended for everyone. Adults over 65 should have the vaccine, and some people between 19 and 65 should receive the vaccine.There are two types of pneumococcal vaccines, and they are recommended for different people on different schedules. In short, this is not a one-size-fits-all thing, and you must talk with your medical professional about this vaccine. - Hepatitis B is a virus that can affect the liver and can be serious or even fatal. Adults may need several doses of the vaccine, especially if they are in high-risk groups or did not have the vaccine as a child. All adults under 60 with diabetes should receive the series of Hepatitis B vaccines. - Shingles is a painful skin condition caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox in children. The virus remains dormant in people who have had chickenpox, and can break out at shingles in adults. Shingles vaccine can help adults avoid shingles outbreaks. - The COVID-19 virus can cause life-threatening illness and even death. The COVID-19 Vaccine and recommended booster shots can protect you from getting seriously ill from the virus. Check the CDC for the current recommendations or ask your doctor's office. Ask your healthcare professional which vaccines you should put on your calendar. "}
