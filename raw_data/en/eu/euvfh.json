Overview Post-COVID conditions (PCC), also referred to as Long COVID or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is an umbrella term for the wide range of health consequences that are present 4 or more weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most children infected with SARS-CoV-2 have asymptomatic infection or mild acute symptoms with low rates of hospitalization and death. However, some children and adolescents, including those with mild or asymptomatic infection, develop post-acute manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During this COCA Call, presenters will discuss evaluating and supporting post-COVID conditions in children and adolescents and the recommended clinical approach to identifying and managing PCC in children and adolescents based on the \"Multi-Disciplinary Collaborative Consensus Guidance Statement on the Assessment and Treatment of PASC in Children and Adolescents\" published by the American Academy of Physical Medicine And Rehabilitation (AAPM&R).
