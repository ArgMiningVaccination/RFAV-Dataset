Many companies ask their employees to undergo drug tests with a view to keeping their workplace free from the nuisance of cannabis addiction. Employees also demand drug tests for the people they hire. It may be that you are trying to take a tolerance break or T-Break and want to cleanse your system of all the toxins to start afresh. Marijuana is called by a number of names such as weed, pot, dope, etc. People use marijuana for entertainment purposes giving them a feeling of high and relaxation. Some people, though a very small number, use it for medicinal purposes. The problem with marijuana is, it leaves behind THC and its metabolites in the system for a pretty long time in detectable condition. Hence the necessity of thc detox to pass a drug test. THC and its metabolites stay in the system even after 30 days of smoking marijuana or ingesting it. In the hair follicles, THC metabolites are detected even after 90 days of consuming the weed. Our body has a natural mechanism to get rid of all the toxins, but it takes time. If you are to face and pass drug test drinks, then you have to undergo some detox program that will flush all the toxins out of your system fast. We will talk about all the best detox kits and programs available on the market. In the beginning, we would like to reiterate some natural processes of cleansing the toxic remains from the system that accelerates the body's natural process of cleansing the toxins. [Checkout Best Weed Detox Kit By Toxin Rid - 10 Day Detox Program](http://shorturls.org/recommends/10daydetox-ndtv/) What is THC detox THC or tetrahydrocannabinol and its metabolites are the toxic remains that stay in the system for a long time after the consumption of cannabis. The process that aims to cleanse these toxic remains of cannabis from the system through a dedicated program is called a THC detox. The easiest and simplest detoxification process is to abstain from consuming further cannabis and let the body mechanism flush out the toxins through its intrinsic cleansing process. This is nature's most effective and complete detoxification. It is able to remove all the cannabinoids as well as terpenes from the system. The problem arises when we demand faster relief from toxins. The THC metabolites stay in the system for more than 30 days. In hair strands, the THC can be detected even within 90 days of consuming cannabis. There are various detox programs ranging from a day to 10 days. Natural detoxification takes six weeks to completely cleanse the system of all toxins. Again this duration depends on how intense the exposure to THC is. The thc detox program also results in some unpleasant symptoms for people who were exposed to heavy to extra-heavy exposures. Such symptoms are - Headache - Irritability - Depression - Loss of appetite - Anxiety - Insomnia But it could not be concluded by the experts whether such symptoms are withdrawal symptoms of stopping cannabis or due to the detox program. Though cannabis is not considered an addictive drug, it does develop symptoms in certain people. How to detox weed naturally Our body, through thousands of years of endeavor to adapt to the environment, has passed through trial and error methods to devise a unique mechanism of detoxifying the body system of all types of toxic substances that creep into our system damaging various body systems. We all learn from nature and try to stimulate the bodily process into enhancing the natural process of getting rid of toxins. Natural detoxification is the best method of cleansing the body. But the problem is that it takes at least 6 weeks. This bodily natural cleansing process is considered the most thorough as well as effective detoxification to get the weed remnants out of the system. We give below some strategies to quicken the natural process. The strategies work singularly as well as in combination to flush the THC metabolites out of the system. The 100% natural strategies to detox the system of the remains of marijuana are: Stop consuming THC The first and foremost principle of natural detoxification of the system is to abstain from the consumption of marijuana. Without this step, no detox program can be successful. Because as soon as you detox the toxins fresh THC metabolites refill the system making the program never-ending. You have to take a bold decision and stick to it to abstain from consuming marijuana in spite of all eventualities and after-effects of stopping the drug. Resort to regular exercise THC metabolites get stored in the fat cells. This is the reason why people with high-fat ratios carry the toxic remains for a pretty long time compared to people with lean mass. Physical exercises preferably resistance training and weight lifting burn the fats fast as well as enhance the rate of metabolism. In this way, physical exercise like cardio training can detoxify the system fast. After stopping the consumption of marijuana, the individual will earnestly long for the blissful sensation of taking the weed. But researchers have found that our body produces a wonder molecule which is named Anandamide, that can provide the same happiness, joy, and blissful feelings as the weeds used to give. This molecule is produced only after heavy cardio exercises. The wonder molecule Anandamide in a similar fashion to delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol commonly known as THC, activates the receptors CB1 & CB2 to produce those psychological feelings and even give pain relief. So by resorting to high-intensity-intermittent-exercise or HIIE the possibility of producing the molecule Anandamide becomes wider compared to low-intensity exercises. So in this way, you can even tackle the feeling of void after stopping marijuana. The runners often feel such a sensation of highness after their sprinter exercise. Many are shifting to hard intense training to get rid of cannabis and still enjoy those blissful and happy feelings of ganja smoking. Drink plenty of water Our body removes the waste products including all types of toxins through the urinary system. So one way to enhance the cleansing of THC metabolites is to increase the frequency of urination. This we can do by increasing the water intake. Increased removal of waste through urination is not only good for cleansing toxins but also for the functioning of the various organs and to improve immunity. Water is a natural detox drinks. But there is one point of caution. You must not overdo the water intake. This may have many harmful effects such as water retention. People with impaired kidneys may already be under controlled water intake. So follow the strategy in relation to your unique physical and mental conditions to pass drug test drinks. Take a balanced healthy diet A healthy diet should include vegetables, fruits, green leafy vegetables, and meats. You have to avoid foods that contain high amounts of sodium, glucose, and fats. These foods such as fast foods and red meats cause water retention in the body. This lowers the rate of metabolism thereby slowing the cleansing process of THC metabolites. Green vegetables contain minerals like iron and lots of vitamins. The minerals and vitamins help in flushing out the toxic remains from the system. Another important thing that enhances the flushing process of the body is a fiber diet. We can find fiber in beans, peanuts, whole grains, legumes, etc. Such foods also help you lift your mood and to have a proper sleep thus removing the negative thoughts. Drink tea Tea contains lots of antioxidants. There are other kinds of teas such as dandelion and milk thistle which help in flushing out the toxins. You will enjoy the drink while helping the detoxification process of the body. Care for the mental health Passing through a detoxification regime is quite a stress-creating phenomenon. One has to be calm and composed during the program. But getting yourself free from stress is easier said than done. Many people try to get out of stress and anxiety conditions by resorting to yoga, resistance training, and meditation. Others may prefer the time for detoxification during their vacation time so that they counter the stress due to the cleansing plan by moving around and entertaining. For some the psychological effect may be very burdensome. They may have to undergo some therapy. Whatever option may fit you it is important to keep your mental health in good condition lest it jeopardize the entire procedure. Change your lifestyle Convert the disadvantage into the advantage, as the saying goes. You can also utilize the time of detoxification in a vacation mood thinking less and pampering more. Visit your friends and families. Go for a picnic, read your favorite books, practice gardening, roam about in your garden, pursue your hobbies, dance, and play instruments. Make yourself happy and full of life in whatever way your mind desires, give the mind a free hand. How much time does it take to THC detox naturally? The time to completely flush out the toxins from the system depends on a number of factors. But on average, it takes more than six weeks to naturally detoxify the system of the THC metabolites. It has been noticed that after the full detoxification, the remnants of THC and its metabolites stay in the system from a few days to even a month. Tests that are done for detecting THC and its metabolites in your system are by taking samples of the following: - Urine sample - Saliva sample - Hair strands sample - Blood sample But the most prevalent drug test is done by taking a urine sample. The time for which the toxins remain in the system depends on: - The intensity and frequency of marijuana consumption - The extent of the fat content of the body - Rate of metabolism - Dietary habit - Exercise schedule The above factors are also interconnected. Say people who do regular resistance exercise will increase their metabolism rate as well as reduce their fat content. These things again enhance the amounts of toxins that are flushed out by the body. By eating healthy foods rich in fiber you can increase the flushing rate of the toxins from the system. It has been observed that people whose rate of metabolism is high, whose fat content is less, and who regularly undergo physical training, are able to flush out all the toxic remains of cannabis faster. Also, anybody can quicken the removal process of toxins from the system by following a healthy diet, doing physical exercise, and drinking sufficient water. Save from unreliable detox myths For passing the ensuing drug test or to avoid the prolonged and cumbersome detox procedures many people depend on mythical so-called detox products. Such products are unreliable and questionable. You must understand that detoxifying the system after cannabis abuse is a long-term process and there is no shortcut. Juices, vitamins, teas, or some chemicals may assist the process but there is no magical remedy. We give below some faulty detoxifying methods are mentioned below Cranberry juice It is true that cranberry juice contains ample antioxidants. But its ability to flush all the toxins by strengthening the liver and kidneys is questionable. It cannot drive the toxins completely out of the system and pass drug test drinks. So it is not a natural detox drink. Vinegar There is no denying that vinegar has a number of health benefits, but to claim that vinegar can remove the THC metabolite from the system is a tall claim. Niacin Cleansing the system of the THC metabolites by Niacin is also ill-founded. There is no scientific proof for the claim.
