Basic principles of homeopathy Homeopathy works on the principle that like cures like. This is the Law of Similars. Firstly, homeopaths evaluate a person's symptoms. They then make a cure that consists of a dilution of substances that would produce the same symptoms in a healthy person. Homeopathy courses teach the law of the minimum dose. Miniscule amounts of a substance, diluted many times, help stimulate the body's own healing ability. For example, a homoeopathically prepared coffee (coffea tosta) can treat certain types of sleeplessness. The central principle of homeopathy is that anything capable of producing symptoms of disease in a healthy person can cure those symptoms in a sick person. History of homeopathic medicine Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician, developed homeopathy in the late 1700s. His first major discovery occurred when he ingested Peruvian Bark (or Chinchona), a well-known cure for malaria. Hahnemann discovered that by taking regular doses of the bark, he began to exhibit malarial symptoms. As a result, he made his first major breakthrough in homeopathic medicine. Hahnemann set up a series of experiments to prove his theories. He tested the impact of diluted drugs on patients. Next, he noted any unusual symptoms they produced and also any improvements they made. He reported that his methods were successful in treating some of the most virulent diseases of the time, including malaria, typhus and scarlet fever. Contemporary homeopathy Homeopaths today use basically the same method developed by Dr Hahnemann. However, modern homeopaths treat the whole person. Therefore, homeopathy courses and evening classes will teach you about the importance of the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical aspects of humanity. Like all other forms of medicine, whether complementary or mainstream, only accredited professionals should practice homeopathy. If you wish to practise you should enrol in a well-established and accredited course. A homeopathy course will teach you how to diagnose problems, make up the various medicines and administer them safely. Have a look at classes on "}
