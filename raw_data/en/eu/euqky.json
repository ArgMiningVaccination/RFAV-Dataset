Subscribe to Our Newsletter is enough anecdotal evidence that proves that homeopathy can effectively treat certain chronic diseases, especially autoimmune diseases like psoriasis. But it is also easily to get cheated by quacks who pose as homeopaths, and rob you of your trust and your hard-earned money. Many patients have been at the receiving end of such fraudsters. These cheats have also brought ignominy to the practice of homeopathy and hardworking practitioners who have been ethical in their practice. For the benefit of those seeking homeopathic treatment for psoriasis, Dr Shreepad Khedekar, MD, The Imperial Clinics outlines seven important points to remember while getting treated. This will help you know whether you are seeking treatment under a genuine homeopath or a cheat. Ask your doctor to define a period Cheats posing as homeopathic doctors often fleece patients by telling them that the treatment may take time to show results. If such situation were to arise, ask your homeopath point blank to define a time period: one week, one month or one year? If the doctor gives you vague answers or is offering you short and quick-fix solutions, he is probably conning you. Ask for a prescription It is strange that we insist on prescription when we go to an allopathic doctor, but we barely care for one when we visit a homeopath. Although it may seem unorthodox, it is perfectly fine to ask your homeopath for a prescription. \"It is your right as a patient to know what your doctor is giving you. Why would you blindly follow someone's prescription?\" asks Dr Khedekar rhetorically. Ask for contact details to patients your doctor has cured Again, it is perfectly within your rights to request the details of people who had been cured by the doctor. Often charlatans will brag about patients they have cured in the past to win your trust. \"If that is the case, ask him for their contact details, call them up or meet them. See how the treatment has helped them,\" says Dr Khedekar. If the doctor refuses, it is a major red flag.

Fraud doctors may claim that the treatment is working and leech off more money from you. Beware! Check for signs of suppression Dr Khedekar says that sometimes diseases may look like it was cured, but in reality, it may have been suppressed. So outwardly, there may be no signs of psoriasis but it can manifest in other ways. \"Even if psoriasis lesions have disappeared, always check for what came after it. Diseases do not disappear, they transform to higher or lower forms, that's a law of bioenergetics and physics,\" reveals Dr Khedekar. (Read: [How psoriasis affects your mind](https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/ways-psoriasis-affects-your-mind-k0917-517937/)) Check what disease you get after psoriasis In the previous point, Dr Khedekar spoke about suppression of the disease after which it manifests in other forms. Fraud doctors or incompetent homeopaths may try to suppress the disease instead of curing them. So it may seem like the psoriasis has got better, but soon after it gets \"better\", you start suffering from other conditions like diabetes, hashimoto's thyroid, joint problems, sinusitis, gastritis or dermatitis. \"Most cases of wrongly treated psoriasis develop white patches or vitiligo: a sure sign of suppression!\" Image source: Shutterstock Follow us on Enroll for our free updates Thank You Thanks for update subscribe information "}
