A century and a half later, we are still struggling with this medical condition and are nowhere near a cure. Even though we don't know how to cure allergies, we've still learned a lot about them in the past 146 years. The biggest breakthrough came in 1914 when the concept of immunotherapy, the process of building up the immune system with injections, was uncovered. Later, in the 1930s, antihistamines were discovered - the first medications that helped our body fight allergies better. Allergies come in many forms. There are [respiratory, food, skin, insect sting allergies](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/tired-of-allergies-and-sinusitis-try-jal-neti-yoga-for-clearing-your-sinuses), and more. According to some estimates, more than 200 million people worldwide suffer from allergy-related asthma. That's troubling, wouldn't you agree? Today we are going to talk a little bit more about [food allergies](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/seasonal-allergie-and-your-gut-health-7-tips-to-ensure-lasting-relief) and their most common symptoms, and uncover some of the best home remedies that might ease these symptoms. What are food allergies? If a certain food triggers an abnormal immune response in your body, that's a clear sign that you are experiencing an allergic reaction. This happens because your immune system thinks some of the proteins in the food are harmful, so it starts releasing chemicals that cause inflammation. Depending on the severity of the allergy, this reaction can be barely noticeable or life-threatening. That means that you may eat the food with no real consequences. In more severe cases, food allergies can cause a serious reaction called anaphylaxis that may lead to death. What are the most common symptoms of allergies? Symptoms may vary from person to person, but they usually include some of the following: Swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, face or other parts of the body Itching or tingling in the mouth Nasal congestion, wheezing or trouble breathing Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea Hives, itching, or eczema Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting These symptoms can occur in just a couple of minutes, or a few hours after the meal. This should be remembered when trying new foods, especially if you are prone to allergic reactions or if you are introducing new food to your child's diet. What are the most common food allergies? Shellfish Shellfish is one of the most common allergens, and it's usually caused by the protein known as tropomyosin. Some examples of shellfish are shrimp, prawns, crayfish, lobster, squid, and scallops. The symptoms are usually felt almost instantly after consumption. As with other allergies, the only way to avoid an allergic reaction is to remove shellfish from your diet. Peanuts Peanuts are another common allergen and can cause severe, or in some cases, fatal allergic reactions. Around 4-8% of children and 1-2% of adults are suffering from a peanut allergy, and the cause is still a mystery to scientists and doctors. That being said, people with a family history of peanut allergies are at risk. Tree nuts Tree nuts affect around 1% of the US population and can cause severe allergic reactions. Around 50% of all anaphylaxis-related deaths are connected to tree nuts. Because of this, all people who are allergic to tree nuts are advised to have epi-pen with them at all times. Some examples of tree nuts include cashews, pistachios, Brazil nuts, almonds, macadamia nuts, walnuts, and pine nuts. Fish Unlike other allergies, fish allergies tend to appear later in life. Around 40% of people with this allergy first develop an intolerance as an adult. Fish allergies affect around 2% of adults. The biggest problem with fish allergies is that they may cause the same symptoms as food poisoning, so it might take more time to diagnose the cause of the reaction. Natural remedies to ease food allergies The best remedy for allergies is avoidance. If you already know what causes your food allergy, you should do whatever it takes to stay as far away as possible from that allergen, even if your allergic reaction is mild. That being said, there are plenty of natural remedies that might boost your immune system to prevent an allergic reaction or help you ease some of the symptoms associated with allergies. Dietary changes Changing your diet might help you reduce allergic reactions. A low-fat diet high in complex carbohydrates that include whole grains, beans, and vegetables can be of great help. Supplements Add supplements to your diet. Vitamins A, C, and E, zinc, and flaxseed oil can also help ease some of the most common allergic symptoms caused by food. Bioflavonoids Bioflavonoids are plant-based chemicals found in citrus fruits and blackcurrants. They have the ability to act as natural antihistamines, reducing your allergy symptoms in turn. Butterbur Butterbur, or Petasites hybridus, is an herbaceous perennial flowering plant produced in the early spring that has been found to be as effective as oral antihistamines for itchy eyes. Bromelain Bromelain, an enzyme that can be found in papaya and pineapple, is often used for helping with breathing difficulties caused by food allergies. Stinging nettle Stinging nettle is another natural antihistamine that can help ease the symptoms of allergic reactions. Quercetin Quercetin is one of the most popular natural remedies because of its ability to stabilize the release of histamines and help control allergy symptoms. It's found in green tea, cauliflower, broccoli, and citrus fruits. Yoga and Meditation Believe it or not, [stress plays a huge role in your susceptibility to allergies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3264048/): but the good news is that you can manage your stress effectively with yoga, [breathwork,](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/research-sudarshan-kriya) and [meditation](https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/meditation).
