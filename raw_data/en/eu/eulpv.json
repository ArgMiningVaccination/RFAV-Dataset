She is in the UC Davis TBI Rehab and I want to get her a crystal for her room to heal her... what one would you suggest? Thank you!\" Answer: Greetings Hillori, I am so sorry to hear about your daughter's accident. Please know that we are sending lots of love, support and healing to you, your daughter, and your family. I must share that crystals for healing should be used as a compliment to other therapies and not as a replacement for regular medical care. With that said, for your daughter, I would like to start by suggesting some crystals that can help to ease any pain, support/restore functionality and heal the body. Take a look at the list and the links provided and then choose the one that you feel the most strongly about. For any pain your daughter is feeling throughout the body as it heals/recovers, I would suggest the following: [Clear Quartz](/Listing_by_Stone_Type/Clear_Quartz/) is known as the \"Master Healer\" of the mineral kingdom, with its very high vibration, and is the most versatile healing stone among all crystals. Quartz is said to be the most powerful healing stone of the mineral kingdom, able to work on any condition. [ can help ease physical pain and provide pain relief. It also strengthens the mind and body. Lapis Lazuli](/Listing_by_Stone_Type/Lapis_Lazuli/) | Hillori, | So sorry your Daughter is going through what my daughter did. First let me say the brain needs fats to heal. Fish oil was the first oil I introduced into my daughters G tube. withing 15-18 hours she began to have gross purposeful muscle movement. She had been in PICU for 4.5 weeks in a chemically induced coma when she came out of the coma and went to pediatrics After 5 weeks she was still not able in any way able to respond to verbal commands. I started the fish oil unbeknownst to the Neurologists. As soon as she started moving arms and legs I told the neurologist and requested they add 2 tables spoons to her tube feeds. . At 5.5 weeks she was moved to a rehab unit where and we were told she would be there at least 1 year but more likely 2 years. At the rehab unit I added CBD tincture (Canabadiol) and walnut oil. She made rapid progress after that. She was in inpatient rehab a grand total o f ONLY 96 Days!!!! She missed only 1 year of high school She is now in her junior year and still improving. I also used CDof Hemi-sync anfrom the Monroe Institute. Hemi sync gets the 2 hemispheres of the brain communicating optimally. Additionally since I am a Reiki Master and an Integrated Energy Therapy Master Instructor she received daily treatments of treatments of Reiki and IET. We also brought in amethyst clusters and choral. Cats Eye or Beryl and Purpurite. Taped some of them to the head board or her bed. You may friend me on Facebook (Deborah Blish) or email me at kalistara11@yahoo.com I have her many other beneficial herbs too. Also message me her name and I will send some healing if you would like and we will put her on our blessings list. Blessings to you and your daughter Deborah Blish (Submitted by: kalistara on December 11, 2016) |Read more articles like this in the following categories:| | | "}
