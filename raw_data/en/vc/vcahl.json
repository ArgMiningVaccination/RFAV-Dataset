Swallow this pill [ ](#) Your choice: intravenous, oral, or sub-linqual? Get your Megadose! Absolutely one of AF's best, and perhaps the canyons benchmark route of the 12c grade. Sooo MEGA! The only reason I can't say \"four stars up!\" is the rock is NOT European quality limestone. Memorable sequences on a sweeping exposed face lead to a stiff crux at the top- a true classic \"boulder in the sky\". This is what 12c used to feel like. If you're sub 6' tall it feels modern 12d. Location [ ](#) Megadose is the center line of the three on the right (southfacing) wall. Begin in a seam/ finger crack, climbing up the gradually steepening wall. Lower off the chains, man. Protection [ ](#) All bolts, but the second is placed up way too high- bring the stickclip. This route used to sport two pins (visible from the ground) at the final moves. Bolts now sit next to the thin crack, replacing the rusted iron. Most bolts an this route are old and corroded badly- Hopefully we'll get around to upgrading the hardware on these walls soon!
