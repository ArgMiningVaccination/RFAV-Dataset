What do you think causes autism? Seems there are so many autistic children these days. Do you guys think something (like vaccines) causes it? Or is it just that it's now getting more diagnosed than it did in the past? (I'm NOT against vaccines, so don't come at me, lol) [For verified information about vaccines, visit our vaccine resources page.](//www.whattoexpect.com/family/vaccines) I think now they have more flexible criteria for diagnosis. Which to me, I think is good! My brother never got diagnosed for YEARS because the diagnosis guidelines back when I was younger were super strict and you had to tick every single check box to be diagnosed. Now theyre more aware of the SPECTRUM and severity that autism can come in. I think it's awesome so that kids can get appropriate treatment. Other illnesses (like ADHD) have gotten more frigid on their guidelines for diagnosis which I also like. My boyfriend was forced to be evaluated for ADHD when he was 6 years old by his elementary school solely based on the fact that at school he was excited for recess and that he said he'd rather be outside playing than inside learning. They really tried to tell him that because he was a typical 6 year old boy, that he had ADHD it probably just went undiagnosed before.. Im a BCBA (board certified behavior analyst) that works with children with autism and have my masters in psych and applied behavior analysis, there's limited research in proving vaccines cause autism, there's no evidence that says it does. There is so much more awareness now so there's more diagnosis happening and how different therapies can help someone with autism improve quality of life and the therapies are becoming more accessible just wanted to say me too (BCBA)! And to the OP, vaccines do not cause autism, that has been shown through research and the vaccine-autism link is no longer an accepted theory. The truth is nobody really knows for sure what causes autism, though there is some genetic component for SOME individuals diagnosed, it is believed there is likely some interplay of genetic and environmental factors as well for many individuals. Awareness increasing is definitely part of it, as well as the fact that autism is a spectrum and the diagnostic criteria having changed over the years. Im a Rbt currently getting my masters ! I agree with your post Nothing causes autism. Before it just went undiagnosed, when my mom and grandma were younger they just kinda ignored it or sent them away. Nothing causes it. People can be more predisposed but it's not caused by anything. It's just more likely to be diagnosed now. People used to be labeled as \"slow\" or \"misbehaving\" or \"troubled\". I absolutely think there is a cause, of course it's unknown, but I don't believe there could be any disorder or illness without a cause. There is a lot of speculation nowadays about autism being related to the mother's micro biome (gut health) and baby's microbiome. They are also linking it to brain development, immune system, auto immune diseases. It's all ground breaking research and even though there is no real testing done in humans and it doesn't mean there could be a way to avoid it or to cure it, maybe in the future there could be a way to mmanage symptoms much more efficiently. I've never done any research into this, but I highly suspect it's due to diet. The standard American diet causes probably 80% or more of all health issues. there's no evidence to support this. In the field, we cannot recommend changing an individuals diet as a form of treatment there's of lack of evidence. I know there's no evidence, I just said I suspect it, which I do. In general if society ate more real food and less processed junk, I think we would have far less health issues. That's all I was saying. it's not vaccines. it never was. it's genetics. plus the definition of autism expanded in the last ten-ish years, so more children (and adults) fall under the spectrum. (I have an adult sister diagnosed in the 90s with autism. she's nonverbal. only case in our family.) You can get tested to see if you are a carrier for fragile X syndrome to see if you carry a genetic predisposition to pass it on to your children. Just like you can get tested to see if you are a Cystic Fibrosis carrier, I am, so my husband also had to get tested. So, I'm saying genetics......
