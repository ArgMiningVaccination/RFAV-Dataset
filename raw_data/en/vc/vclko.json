As you can imagine, this led to a perfectly delightful recognition of the authentic rhythm and harmony of my unique composition. It was a lovely, soothing, nourishing experience. - 8/30/2023 Shab was amazing. She listened to me and was very warm and friendly. Great experience - 8/2/2022 I've seen Shab for years and what she has done for my overall well-being is miraculous. She has helped me in all areas of life and I'm grateful to continue my spiritual journey with Shab's guidance. - 8/2/2022 I have known Shab for 20 years. We worked together at a local hospital. I have numerous sessions with her. The sessions were so freeing and relaxing. I felt renewed. I also loved the Zoom meditation that went on for a year. She has the power to help you heal; if you totally believe. She has helped me to face my dark times I highly recommend Shab. - 8/23/2022 The moment you meet Shab, you feel the positive energy around her and immediately you feel safe to open up and share without reserves. She listens with her heart and no judgement. Her healing is warm, relaxing and grounding, you feel balanced and ready to face your challenges. If you're looking to incorporate Ayurveda practices in your life look no further. Shab is the real deal. - 6/16/2014 I met Shab at a workshop on Aryuvedic healing. I was immediately drawn to her compassion, knowledge and approach. Every session with Shab was powerful and unique. I felt stronger, balanced and more physically empowered after each session. Aryuvedic medicine has so many wonderful principles, I'm glad I added these methods and dietary tips into my daily routine. - 12/16/2012First to Review Shab is one of the most calming and compassionate people I've ever met. She takes the time to listen to your physical, mental and emotional health concerns. Her approach is gentle and she is very knowledgable in the field of Ayurveda and other techniques to help you heal. I sought the advice of Shab to help me with my Crohn's Disease. She guided me through the entire process, which included meal planning, daily herbal supplements and meditation. She was in contact with me weekly and was always available for any of my questions or concerns. Shab is a gifted practitioner and I would highly recommend her to anyone seeking a holistic approach to their health. M.
