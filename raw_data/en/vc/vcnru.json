PNNL22010 Rev. 2 / Rev 2 / SAND2016 -3078 R Protocol for Uniformly Measuring and Expressing the Performance of Energy Storage Systems David R Conover Summer R Ferreira Alasdair J Crawford David A Schoenwald Jason Fuller David M Rosewater Sri Nikhil Gourisetti Vilayanur Viswanathan April 2016 Prepared by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Richland, Washington and Sandia National Laboratories Albuquerque, New Mexico For the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE1) Funded by the Energy Storage Systems Program of the U.S. Department of Energy Dr. Imre Gyuk, Program Manager April 2016 Page iii Foreword The Protocol for Uniformly Measuring and Expressing the Performance of Energy Storage Systems (PNNL -22010) was first issued in November 2012 as a first step toward providing a foundational basis for developing an initial standard for the uniform measurement and expression of energy storage system (ESS) performance. Based on experiences with the ap plication and use of that document, and to include additional ESS applications and associated duty cycles, test procedures and performance metrics, a first revision of the November 2012 Protocol was issued in June 2014 (PNNL -22010 Rev. 1). As an update of the 2014 revision 1 to the Protocol, t his document (the April 2016 revision 2 to the Protocol) is intended to supersede the June 2014 revision 1 to the Protocol and provide a more user -friendly yet more robust and comprehensive basis for measuring and expressing ESS performance . This foreword1 provides general and specific details about what additions, revisions, and enhancements have been made to the June 2014 Protocol and the rationale for them in arriving at this April 2016 Protocol (PNNL -22010 Rev. 2 / SAND2016 -3078 R ). Dynamic Updating Process Becaus e energy storage technology development and deployment are dynamic , and as a result , the technologies and the applications and metrics needing to be covered in test standards continue to evolve, the provisions in the Protocol must continue to evolve to more fully address the wide scope and purpose stated in Sections 1 and 2 of the Protocol . For instance, further enhancements have been made since the initial publication of the P rotocol in 2012, including the addition of one more storage application in the June 2014 revision 1 to the Protocol, and five more applications in this April 2016 revision 2 to the Protocol, along with refinements to the way some performance metrics are de termined. This April 2016 revision 2 to the Protocol also includes new system performance metrics and additional general information and technical specifications associated with ESSs . The dynamic nature of storage technology development and the growing dem and for performance information by the many different entities involved with energy storage deployments support s continual and ongoing work to enhance the Protocol. The continuing need for uniformity and comparability of the reported performance informatio n for all storage technologies and the growing need for more types of performance -related information suggests that the Protocol will need to be revised and republished at reasonable intervals in the future to best serve the needs of all those who want to document ESS performance or who need such documentation to make decisions about the application and use of ESSs . The development of the first edition of a brand new standard can take considerable time, especially when those participating in development of the standard must \"start from scratch.\" Once approved and published, s tandards are generally updated and revised on a three - to five-year cycle and, in some cases, interim addenda covering needed revisions or enhancements to a standard are also issued . When first published in 2012, it was a goal that the Protocol would provide a foundational basis for brand new standards covering the topic of ESS performance so that standards development organizations (SDOs) did not have to \"start from scratch.\" That has b een r ealized through the use of the P rotocol by U.S. SDOs as 1 The information presented in this foreword is not part of the protocol. It is merely informative and does not contain requirements necessary for conformance with or use of the protocol. April 2016 Page iv well as internationally through International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Technical Committee 120 who, among others, are developing an IEC standard for measuring and expressing ESS performa nce using the Protocol as a basis for the provisions in the standard. In addition to these formal standards development efforts by SDOs, the Energy Storage Integration Council (ESIC), under the auspices of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), is a lso developing information for utilities to use in fostering their consideration and application of energy storage technology that in part covers ESS performance. Such efforts outside those of SDOs provide an additional opportunity for deployment of the Pr otocol in the short term until formal standards are approved and published by the sponsoring SDO. As formal standards are completed and available from and updated by SDOs, ongoing Protocol enhancement efforts will continue to provide r ecommendations and relevant documentation that can support updating of those standards . Until the standards are completed and published, this document and future versions of it provide the foundation and focal point for a uniform, consistent, and comparable basis for measuring and expressing system performance. The intention is to continuously enhance the Protocol based on a process open to all stakeholders on an equitable basis that provides them an opportunity to participate and provide input, while also being sensit ive to the need for continuity as enhancements to the Protocol are developed over time. Hence, the Protocol is expected to be updated at least biennially or more frequently if warranted through needed subgroups focusing on specific issues that again are op en to any and all stakeholders. The updating process will include a cutoff time a fter which additional revisions will be deferred to the next revision cycle . Work on the deferred revisions will continu e, but publication of an updated Protocol will occur no more frequently than annual ly. Protocol Enhancement Overview The enhancements contained in this document are based on a number of concurrent activities that were undertaken predominantly during 2015 . One set of activities, hosted by Pacific Northwest Nat ional Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories, involved the addition of criteria to cover five new applications for ESSs. Those new applications are photovoltaic (PV) smoothing, volt/var support, renewables (solar) firming, power quality, and frequency control. An overview of the revisions to the Protocol associated with each of these five new applications is provided below, but in general , the revisions involved the development of a duty cycle for each new application and guidance on how to determine t he values of the relevant metrics for each application. Beyond the addition to the Protocol of criteria to cover new applications and metrics, minor adjustments were made to the Protocol based on experiences from its application and use along with a signif icant change to simplify the organization of the document to make it more user friendly. In response to needs of the utility sector as presented on their behalf through the EPRI ESIC, a number of enhancements were made to the Protocol. One focuses on the i nclusion of general information and technical specifications associated with ESSs that utilities and other ESS users need above and beyond the performance metrics and test procedures covered in the Protocol. Other revisions were focused on technical clarif ications and enhancements. For instance, capacity typically denotes power in the context of the grid. Hence, energy capacity (which has been used in prior editions of the protocol) has been replaced by energy in this edition of the Protocol to avoid confusion. While consideration was given to a recommendation to now use state of energy to describe the ESS state, state of charge (SOC) has been retained because SOC associated with batteries is what the battery m anagement system relies on in controlling the ESS. Since the Protocol also applies to other types of storage (e.g., other than batteries) SOC is also appropriate to capture their state. The EPRI ESIC also suggested that 100% SOC should be April 2016 Page v the maximum SOC a nd 0% SOC should be the minimum SOC when conducting certain tests. However, to require the ESS to be charged to 100% SOC and discharged to 0% SOC is overly prescriptive and could compromise an ESS where the manufacturer may not want their ESS to be dischar ged to 0% SOC. Instances involving terms that were defined but not used in the document were identified and those terms deleted from the definitions. Definitions of some of the new applications for an ESS were also enhanced based on input from the EPRI ESI C in addition to including an equation for considering auxiliary power when auxiliary loads are powered by separate power sources. One comment suggested that an ESS can be used for power quality only in an islanded mode. It is not clear that is the case, a nd the provisions covering this new application were not changed from the final draft developed by the subgroup that developed the power -quality -related provisions in the Protocol. In addition, the 1 -minute, 1 -5 minute , and 10 -minute peak power tests for t his application were identified as not necessary. Since the overload capability of the power conversion system depends on duration, it was decided these tests would be retained as drafted by the subgroup. A comment about the rigor of data sampling frequenc y was also provided. Based on the application and use of the Protocol for frequency regulation, which has been covered in the document since late 2012, data every second appears to be necessary for frequency regulation and other applications where the ESS is subjected to signals frequently. For peak shaving or energy arbitrage, data every 10 seconds was considered sufficient. On this issue, those developing the document feel the data acquisition frequency should be at least double the rate of the signal bei ng sent to the ESS. As noted above, the intent of this document is to provide a foundation for formal standards developed by SDOs. The process for development and updating of this document is dynamic and intended to provide all stakeholders the opportunit y to provide input through subgroups that are established to focus on additions and enhancements to the document (e.g., new applications, new metrics, and adjustments based on use of the document). New Organization of Content The organization of the Novem ber 2012 Protocol and its June 2014 revision was somewhat complicated in that it contained more sections than necessary in outlining the steps associated with using the Protocol. It also repeated a considerable amount of content for each ESS application th at could have been presented once. This organization, while somewhat cumbersome, did make it easier to choose an application and then follow through the Protocol for all the relevant provisions for that application. In essence, the Protocol contained a sep arate \"track\" for each of the initial two and then the one additional application added in June 2014, even though the content in each track was in many cases identical. In revising the Protocol to include five more applications and address additional metri cs, it became clear that continuing this organization would increase the complexity of using the Protocol (i.e., now eight separate tracks) and make it less desirable to apply or to use as a basis for more formal standards. This April 2016 revision 2 to the Protocol has eliminated the separate -track approach and replaced it with three core sections that can be more easily applied to any ESS and the eight applications now covered in the Protocol. In addition, this organization will facilitate the seamless in clusion of additional applications and metrics over time while not compromising the ease of use of the document. Section 4 of the Protocol provides an overview of the Protocol and how it is to be applied to any ESS. Section 5 provides the detail associated with the relevant performance metrics, test procedures to measure performance data associated with the metrics, as well as the duty cycle that is relevant to each application and is used to guide testing associated with duty -cycle relevant metrics. Section 6 simply provides the April 2016 Page vi guidance for uniformly reporting the value of each metric based on the requirements in Section 5, covering testing, data gathering, and use of the data in calculating the relevant metrics asso ciated with the ESS. This makes it much easier to address those items that are not dependent on duty cycle one time for all ESSs regardless of application. Beyond that, the testing, measurement, and calculation of the metrics that are related to duty cycle and unique to each application and their reporting is also only presented once, noting that they would have to be repeated for each of the applications for which the ESS was intended based on subjecting the ESS to a duty cycle that is unique to each of th e eight applications covered in the Protocol. New Applications As noted in the overview, five new ESS applications have been added to the three applications (peak shaving, frequency regulation and islanded microgrids) covered in the June 2014 revision 1 to the Protocol. These are listed in Table 4.3 of the Protocol, which now covers eight applications. Each of these five new applications is then addressed in the same manner as the prior three applications; that is, they are listed along with the metrics t hat are applicable to each application, provisions have been added to provide a duty cycle for each new application, and the measurements to make when applying the duty cycle, determination of applicable performance metrics from these measurements, and the details associated with reporting those metrics are outlined. Specific detail on each of these new applications is provided in the following descriptions. PV Smoothing PV smoothing is the use of an ESS to mitigate rapid fluctuations in variable PV power output . The purpose of PV smoothing is t o mitigate frequency variation and stability issues that can arise at both feeder and transmission level s in high penetration PV scenarios to help meet ramp rate requirements . At the feeder level, PV smoothing is implemented t o mitigate voltage flicker and voltage e xcursions outside desired bands. At the transmission level, PV variability can require additional operating reserve to be set aside and can cause traditional generation to cycle more than otherwise . The method by which the ESS can provide smoothing of PV output power is to absorb or supply power at appropriate times as determined by a control system resulting in a less variable composite power signal at the feeder and/or transmission level . Permission was given by the Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) to the PV smoothing subgroup of the Protocol Working Group to use PV power output (expressed in kW) and battery power output (expressed in kW) from the PNM Prosperity Project for construction of the PV smoothing duty cycle [ see Roberson et al. (2014 ) for a descript ion and analysis of the project] . The data featured one - second time resolution and is archived going back to 2011. The duty cycle is constructed by capturing one -hour \"slices\" of PV generati on from different days and splicing these slices together into a composite signal of 10 hours in length. The majority of these slices represent moderate to very high levels of PV variability. Thus, the composite signal will lead to an aggressive tracking s ignal. Different times of the day and times of the year can be captured by one signal. The tracking signal is then computed by subtracting the 30 -minute moving average of the composite \"day\" from the composite signal itself. The duty cycle is obtained by n ormalizing the tracking signal to the rated power of the smoothing battery. Care was taken to ensure that the full \"day\" signal as well as each hour of this day is sufficiently close to net energy neutral.

Volt/Var A volt/var application addresses fluctuations in grid voltage by providing volt -amperes reactive ( var) support, injecting vars as grid voltage dips and absorbing vars as grid voltage increases. The ESS is assumed to be deployed only for volt/var support; hence , the full power rating of the ESS is available for this duty cycle. This work builds on the work done by the Smart Inverter Working Group (SIWG) convened by the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) and the California Energy Commission. The SIWG provided a set of recommendations to the CPUC on February 7, 2014. Based on these recommendations, the three investor -owned utilities in California \u2014 Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison Company , and San Diego Gas & Electric Company \u2014proposed revisions to the California Electric Tariff Rule 21. The CPUC has not yet ruled on the proposed revisions. Based on these proposed revisions, Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Sandia National Laboratories , EPRI, Xanthus and PV inverter manufacturers developed a protocol to test smart inverters under a California Solar Initiative grant (Johnson et al. 2013 a, Johnson et al. 2013b, Johnson et al. 2014 , UL 2015 ). The relationship developed by the SIWG of ESS var output as a function of grid voltage was used to develop duty cycles for th e volt/var application by simulating grid voltage at representative feeder locations using GridLAB -D. The voltage at the point of common coupling fo r a PV system at one end of a 4 kV feeder was also subjected to the SIWG relationship to develop duty cycles. The met rics that were determined to be relevant for volt/var are listed be low. Note that duty cycle round -trip efficiency, which is a metric for other applications, is not relevant to volt/var applications since no real power is being exchanged. April 2016 Page viii Reference performance metrics : round -trip efficiency response time and ramp rate energy energy stability Duty -cycle -specific metrics : reactive power ramp rate at 50% SOC (This is a new metric and uses the same procedure as real power ramp rate.) round -trip efficien cy reference signal tracking SOC _volt/var, which is the difference between the final and initial SOC SOC_active standby, which is the difference between the final and initial SOC at the end of an active standby period of the same duration as the volt/var duty cycle with auxiliary load s turned on, with the initial SOC the same as the value at the start of the volt/var duty cycle Wh_discharge, which is the real energy injected (with and without the volt/var duty cycle) Wh_charge , which is the real energy absorbed (with and without the volt/var duty cycle) Wh_net, which is the net energy (injected or absorbed) (with and without the volt/var duty cycle) Renewables Firming Renewables ( solar) firming is t he application of an ESS to provide energy to supplement renewable (solar) generation such that their combination produces steady power output over a desired time window. More precisely, t he purpose of renewables firming is to provide energy ( or conversely, to absorb energy) when ren ewable generation falls below some threshold ( or conversely, exceeds this threshold). This application is performed to provide steady power output over a desired time window, usually a period of multiple hours. Typically, the threshold is based upon the fo recasted nominal renewable power generation over the desired time window. Thus, the ESS is compensating for the forecast uncertainty in actual renewable generation during that time window. The method by which the ESS performs this application is described as follows. The ESS discharges power during periods for which renewable generation falls short of the threshold and absorbs power when renewable generation exceeds this threshold. Generally, to yield multiple hours of steady power output, the time periods over which the ESS attempts to firm power output are normally in the range of minutes, with 15 -minute time windows being common. The key differentiator between smoothing and firming applications can be explained as follows. Smoothing is applied to limit ra mp rates, typically in the one -second to one -minute time periods. Firming is more appropriately applied in the 15-minute to several -hour time periods. As with PV smoothing, data from the PNM Prosperity Project was used for construction of the renewables (s olar) firming duty cycle [ see Roberson et al. (2014 ) for a description and analysis of the April 2016 Page ix project]. The construction process is similar to PV smoothing except that the time windows of interest are in the minutes to hours range, rather than seconds to minutes. The relevant metrics for renewables (solar) firming are listed be low. Reference performance metrics: system rating round -trip energy efficiency response time ramp rate energy energy stability Duty -cycle -specific metrics: reference signal tracking SOC excursion duty-cycle round -trip efficiency maximum ambient temperature, measured in degrees Fahrenheit Power Quality A sag or interruption in voltage can cause power disturbances that negatively impact power quality. This problem can be more common in distribution systems compared to transmission systems . Energy storage can mitigate voltage sags by injecting real power for up to a few tens of seconds. The application of an ESS to address power quality does not require the ESS to provide enough energy for customers to ride through an outage of greater than 10 -minut e duration. The duty cycle consists of continuous discharge at peak power for durations of 1, 5 , and 10 minutes, where peak power is defined as maximum power delivered by the ESS for each of those time durations. The vendor and/or end user determines the S OC range for each duty cycle. Since power quality involves discharge, the starting SOC can be as high as 100%, with the lower limit at 20% (to ensure the ESS can provide peak power at the lower limit of the SOC range). The ESS ramps to the power specified and stays there for the specified duration. The duty -cycle duration is adjusted such that total discharge capacity does not exceed energy withdrawn at rated power for one hour. This is to ensure that an unnecessarily heavy burden o f energy requirement is n ot placed on the ESS, which could necessitate a derating of its power. In the development of the duty cycle for this application , it was determine d that, for power -intensive applications, derating the power to satisfy an arbitrarily long duty cycle does no t appear to be practical. The metrics that are relevant to a power quality application of ESS are listed below. Reference performance metrics : round -trip efficiency response time and ramp rate energy energy s tability April 2016 Page x Duty -cycle -specific metrics : peak discharge power for durations of 1, 5 , and 10 minutes duty-cycle round -trip efficiency reference signal tracking SOC excursion Frequency Control The conventional name for the service provided by an ESS in this application is frequency response , but for the purposes of the Protocol , the term \"frequency control \" was selected. In this service , there is a sudden loss of generation that must be made up through a discharge from the ESS. There can also be a sudden loss of load, requiring the ESS to charge, howev er that situation is not a net zero energy signal (unlike frequency regulation), since power flows in one direction during this service \u2014discharge or charge. In revising the Protocol to cover a frequency control application , it was assumed that tertiary frequency control is provided by other generators and that the ESS provides primary and secondary frequency control. The primary frequency control lasts 30 seconds ; from that point until 20 minutes has elapsed, the secondary f requency control process occurs. As secondary frequency control starts at 30 seconds, the power provided by assets for primary frequency control decrease , and the power level s provided by primary and secondary controls sum to a constant. If the ESS provides only primary frequency control, it ramps up to its 1 -minute peak power and stays there for 30 seconds. Here, peak power is defined as the maximum power the ESS can provide for 1 minute continuously, which is a new metric relevant to thi s application. If the ESS provides both primary and secondary frequency contro l, it simply ramps up to its 20 -minute peak power (the maximum power the ESS can provide for 20 minutes) and sta ys there for 20 minutes. Duty cycles for primary and secondary f requency control were developed, with the control events lasting up to 30 seconds and 20 minutes , respectively. The energy storage power used at an actual 2 MW storage system as the grid frequency deviated from its nominal frequency was also used as a basi s to develop a linear relationship between storage power and normalized grid frequency deviation. The distribution grid frequency data was obtained from a utili ty for spring, summer, a utumn , and winter; using the linear relationship that was developed, a d uty cycle was developed for each of the four seasons. The metrics that were determined to be relevant for volt/var are listed below .

While no new general metrics were added to the Protocol to cover these new applications, there were new metrics deemed relevant to each of the new duty cycles. These new metrics are listed below for each of the new applications that had new metrics included in the Protocol . Volt/Var reactive power ramp rate at 50% SOC, determined using the same procedure as real power ramp rate. The ESS is brought to 50% SOC and the time taken to go from 0 to 100 percent reactive power in the positive direction (capacitive) and in the negative direction (inductive) is measured.

Frequency Control peak power at 1 minute and 20 minute s for charge and discharge Technical Specifications As noted above, the EPRI ESIC requested that additional information be included in the Protocol that utilities and others could use in making decisions about the application and use of an ESS. This additio nal information was developed by a working group of the ESIC, and included performance metrics that were already covered in the June 2014 revision 1 to the Protocol. The information requested also included general information relevant to ESSs as well as ce rtain technical specifications associated with an ESS \u2014 that is, items not necessarily related to the performance of an ESS for any specific ESS application, but information broadly applicable to all ESS regardless of application. Section 4.2 of the June 20 14 revision 1 to the Protocol provided for a description of the ESS including its weight, volume, and footprint (area). That section has been enhanced and the April 2016 revision 2 to the Protocol includes a Table 4.4.1 of general information and technical specifications that include those prior items and adds additional items, such as operating temperature range and required clearances.

H.1 April 2016 Page 1 Protocol1 for Uniformly Measuring and Expressing the Performance of Energy Storage Systems 1.0 Purpose This Protocol provides a set of \"best practices\" for characterizing energ y storage systems (ESS s) and measuring and reporting their performance. It serves as a basis for assessing how an ESS will perform with respect to key performance attributes relevant to different applications. It is intended to provide a valid and accurate basis for the comparison of different ESSs . By achieving the stated purpose , the Protocol will enable more informed decision -making in the selection of ESSs for various stationary applications. 2.0 Scope The Protocol identifies general information and technical specifications relevant in describing an ESS and also defines a set of test, measurement , and evaluation criteria with which to express the performance of ESSs that are intended for energy -intensive and/or power -intensive stationary applications.

Normative Appendix A - Duty -Cycle Signal for Peak -Shaving Applications of Energy Storage Systems April 2016 Page A.1 Normative Appendix A Duty -Cycle Signal for Peak -Shaving Applications of Energy Storage Systems In Section 5.3.1, the charge duration is f ixed at 12 hours, and discharge durations are 6, 4 , and 2 hours for duty cycles A, B , and C , respectively. The corresponding rest times after charge and discharge are 3, 4 , and 5 hours , respectively. Feedback from the Protocol U sers Group indicate d that the 12 -hour charge window may be too long. Additional feedback indicated that the rest durations were too long. For example, for the 2 -hour discharge duty cycle, 5 hours rest after charge and after discharge brings the total rest time to 10 hours. Based on the feedback, alternate duty cyc les with charge duration varying from 4 to 12 hours, and rest durations after charge and discharge varying from 1 to 3 hours may be used. In addition, the x -axis in Figure 5.3.1 shows the hour of the day, with 0 hours corresponding to start of the day and 12 corresponding to noon. In the first version of the Protocol (November 2012) the duty cycle could be started at any time. In this version of the Protocol , the duty cycle is started at 22 hours (or 10 p.m. ) each day. This allows a continuous charge, followed by rest and continuous discharge, followed by rest. Rather th an provide time of day on the x -axis, it may be preferred to show time from the start of the duty cycle on the x -axis. Each cycle starts wit h a charge from an initial state of charge (SOC ), which is the estimated SOC from maximum SOC to the end of the constant power discharge period. At the end of the rest period after discharge, the energy storage system (ESS) is brought to its initial SOC by charge or discharge. The round -trip energy efficiency (RTE ) is calculated as provided for in the Protocol , taking into account auxiliary power when applicable. The SOC excursion associated with this change in application of the duty cycle would also be reported. An example of an alternative duty cycle is as follows. F or duty cycle A, the ESS is brought to the SOC expected after a 6 -hour discharge from the upper SOC limit for the ESS, followed by a 15 -minute test. For duty cycle B, the ESS is brought to t he SOC expected after a 4 -hour discharge from the upper SOC limit for the ESS, followed by a 15 -minute test. For duty cycle C, the ESS is brought to the SOC expected after a 2 -hour discharge from the upper SOC limit for the ESS, followed by a 15 -minute tes t. The duty cycle in Fig. 5.3.1 is embedded in this document as a spreadsheet. April 2016 Page A.2 Figure A.1.

The signals were grouped into low, average, and high standard deviation days. A representative 2 -hour average standard deviation signal was chosen, and a representative 2-hour high standard deviation signal was chosen. It was also noted that 24 -hour signals we re energy neutral. The average and high standard deviation signals were chosen such that they were energy neutral and had the same standard deviation as the average and high deviation signals over the one -year time frame . The duty cycle consisted of three 2-hour average signals, followed by one 2-hour high deviation signal, three 2 - hour average signals, one 2 -hour high deviation signal , and four 2 -hour average signals.
