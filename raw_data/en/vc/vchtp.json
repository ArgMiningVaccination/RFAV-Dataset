Admission to this class is by interview only, please contact Brittany with interest. This course is designed to help take your knowledge to the next level, create practical experience and deepen your understanding of how to implement herbal medicine. We will begin by learning to understand ourselves as vessels of information - exploring how to sustainably and holistically share our experiences and understandings of herbal medicine and healing with others. We will discuss guidelines for intake and diagnosis including listening skills, clear communication and creating a comfortable environment for those seeking support. Throughout the first portion of the class, we will discuss different intake techniques, how to create effective intakes and then how to interpret the information presented and observed. As we build diagnostic skills and explore how to make meaning from presented information and observations we will explore the many different ways to create effective and sustainable treatment protocols. Most importantly, as the course goes on, we will watch how our suggestions and protocols affect our clients over time - follow through and experience being the best, most powerful teachers. CLINICAL EXPERIENCE Several months into class we will start to see clients and do intakes as a group. Intakes will be orchestrated by one student at a time (with others observing and asking questions at the end). Each student will have the opportunity to orchestrate at least one intake during the class. After the intake, the class will work together to come up with a protocol for the client. The student who performed the intake will be responsible for sharing the protocol with the client and following up with them outside of class. Client progress will be shared and discussed during future classes. TOPIC SPECIFIC STUDY Throughout the course we will cover treatment protocols for specific body systems, chronic disease, disorders and conditions through independent research, \"lectures\" and through our work on specific case studies. HOMEWORK Homework will include independent research on assigned topics and in depth materia medica exploration. Each student will be responsible for completing their in-class intake and following up with their client responsibly and timely, outside of class time. The expected homework load between classes will be 1 - 3 hours/week. Topics Will Include - Continued study of Ayurveda as a form of Assessment and Healing - Holistic Mind/Body Approaches to Assessing Imbalances and Healing - Progression of Disease and Processes of Healing - Herbal Support for Chronic Conditions - Intake Development - Reading the Tongue - Determining the Most Effective Healing Protocol - Making Appropriate Referrals - Herbal Formulary - Food as Medicine - Materia Medica Development Required Herbals - Earthwise Herbal: Guide to New World Medicinal Plants, Matthew Wood - Earthwise Herbal: Guide to Old World Medicinal Plants, Matthew Wood - The Yoga of Herbs, Vasant Lad and David Fawley A certificate is awarded upon completion of the course.
