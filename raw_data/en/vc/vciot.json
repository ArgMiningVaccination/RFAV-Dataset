Abbreviation: AV=atrioventricular . a Grade based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 . Reference ID: 4344940 2.3 Concomitant Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers LORBRENA is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A Discontinue strong CYP3A inducers for 3 plasma half inducer prior to initiati ng inducers [see W arnings and Pre cautions (5.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.4 Dosage Modification for Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the starting dos e of LORBRENA from 100 mg orally once dail y to 75 mg orally once daily. In patients w ho have had a dose reduction to 75 mg orally once dail y due to adverse reactions and who initiate a strong CYP3A inhibitor , reduce the LORBRENA dose to 50 mg orally once daily . If concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is discontinued , increase the LORBRENA dose (after 3 plasma half-lives of the strong CYP3A inhibitor) to the dose that was used before starting the strong in hibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Tablets: 25 mg: 8 mm round , tan, immediate release , film -coated, debossed with \"Pfizer\" on one side and \"25\" and \"LLN\" on the other side 100 mg: 8.5 mm \u00d7 17 mm oval, lavender , immediate release , film -coated, debossed with \"Pfizer\" on one side and \"LLN 100\" on the other side 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS LORBRENA is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inducers, due to the potential for serious hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 1)]. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUT IONS 5.1 Risk of Serious Hepatotoxicity with Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A Inducers Severe hepatotoxicity occurred in 10 of 12 healthy subjects receiving a single dose of LORBRENA with multiple daily doses of rifampin, a strong CYP3A aminotransferase ( AST) elevations occurred in 50% of subjects, Grade 3 ALT or AST elevations occurred in 33% and Grade 2 A LT or AST elevations occurred in 8%. ALT or AST elevations occurred within 3 days and returned to within normal limits after a median of 15 day s (7 to 34 day s); the median time to recovery was 18 day s in subjects with Grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevations and 7 day s in subjects with Grade 2 ALT or AST elevations. LORBRENA is contraindicated in patients taking s trong CYP3A inducers. Discontinue strong CYP3A inducers for 3 plasma half -lives of the strong CYP3A inducer prior to initiating LORBRENA. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with moderate CYP3A inducers. If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers cannot be avoided, monitor AST, AL T, and bilirubin 48 hours after initiating LORBRENA and at least 3 times during the first week after initiat ing LORBRENA . Reference ID: 4344940 Depending upon the relative importance of each drug, discontinue LORBRENA or the CYP3A i nducer for persistent Grade 2 or higher hepatotoxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.2 Central Nervous System Effects A broad spectrum of c entral nervous s ystem (CNS) effects can occur in patients receiving LORBRENA. These include seizures, hallu cinations, and changes in cognitive function , mood (including suicidal ideation) , speech , mental status, and sleep. Overall, CNS effects occurred in 54% of patients receiving LORBRENA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )]. Cognitive effects occurred in 29% of the 332 patients who received LORBRENA at any dose in Study B7461001; 2.1% of these events were severe (Grade 3 or 4). Mood effects occurred in 24% of patients; 1.8% of these events were severe. Speech effects occurred in 14% of patients; 0.3% of these events were severe. Hallucinations occurred in 7 % of patients; 0.6% of these events were severe. Mental status changes occurred in 2.1% of patients; 1.8% of these events were severe. Seizures occurred in 3% of patients, sometimes in conjunction with other neurolo gic findings. Sleep effects occurred in 10% of patients. The median time to first onset of an y CNS effect was 1.2 months (1 day to 1.7 years). Overall, 1.5% of patients required permanent discontinuation of L ORBRENA for a CNS effect; 9% required temporary discontinuation and 8% required dose reduction. Withhold and resume at the same dose or at a reduced dose or p ermanently discontinue LOR BRENA based on severit y [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2)]. 5.3 Hyperlipidemia Increases in serum cholesterol and triglycerides can occur in patients rec eiving LORBRENA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )]. Grade 3 or 4 elevations in total cholesterol occurred in 17 % and Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides occurred in 17% of the 332 patients who received LORBRENA in St udy B7461001. The median time to onset was 15 days for both hy percholesterolemia and hy pertrigl yceridemia . Approximately 7% of patients required temporary discontinuation and 3% of patients required dose reduction of LORBRENA for elevations in cholesterol and in trigl ycerides . Eight y percent of patients required initiation of lipid-lowering medication s, with a median time to onset of start of such medication s of 21 days. Initia te or increase the dose of lipid -lowering agents in patients with hy perlipidemia . Monitor serum cholesterol and trigl ycerides before initiating LORBRENA, 1 and 2 months after initiating LORBRENA, and periodically thereafter . Withhold and resume at the same dose for the first occurrence; resume at the same or a reduced dose of LORBRENA for recurrence based on severit y [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5.4 Atrioventricular Block PR interval prolongation and atrioventricular ( AV) block can occur in patients receiving LORBRENA [s ee Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (1 2.2)]. In 295 patients who received LORBRENA at a dose of 100 mg orally once daily in Study B7461001 and who had a baseline electrocardiograph y (ECG) , 1% experienced AV block and 0.3% experienced Grade 3 AV block and underwent pacemaker placement. Monito r ECG prior to initiating LORBRENA and periodicall y thereafter. Withhold and resume at a reduced dose or at the same dose in patients who undergo pacemaker placement. Permanently discontinue for recurrence in patients without a pacemaker [see Dosa ge and Administration ( 2.2)] Disease/ Pneumonitis Severe or life -threatening pulmonary adverse reactions consistent with interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis can occur with LORBRENA. ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 1.5% of patients who received Reference ID: 4344940 6 LORBRENA at any dose in Study B7461001, including Grade 3 or 4 ILD/pneumonitis in 1.2% of patients. One patient (0.3%) discontinued LORBRENA for ILD/pneumonitis. Promptly investigate for ILD/pneumonitis in any patient who presents with wor sening of respiratory symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., d yspnea, cough, and fever). Immediately withhold LORBRENA in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue LORBRENA for treatment -related ILD/pneumonitis of an y severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5.6 Embryo -Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action , LORBRENA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of lorlatinib to pregnant rats and ra bbits by oral gavage during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations, increased post -implantation loss, and abortion at maternal exposures that were equal to or less than the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg once dail y based on area under the curve (AUC). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception , since LORBRENA can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective, during treatment with LOR BRENA and for at least 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LORBRENA and for 3 months after the final dose [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Risk of Serious Hepatotoxicity with Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A Inducers [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 1)] Central Nervous S ystem Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hyperlipidemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 3)] Atrioventricular Block [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4 )] Interstitial L ung Disease/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 5)] 6.1 Clinical Trial s Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely vary ing conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directl y compared to rates in the clinical tr ials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data in Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to LORBRENA in 332 patients with AL K-positive or ROS 1-positive , metastatic non-small cell lung i-cohort, multinational, non-comparative, , (Study B7461001 ) who received LORBRENA at doses ranging from 10 mg to 200 mg dail y in single or divided doses . The data described below reflect exposure to LORBRENA in 295 patients with ALK-positive or ROS1- positive metastatic NSCL C who received LORBRENA 100 mg orall y once daily in Study B7461001. The median duration of exposure to LORBRENA was 12.5 months (1 day to 35 months) and 52% received LORBRENA for 12 months. Pa tient characteristics were a median age of 53 years (19 to 85 years), age 65 years (18%), female (58%) , White (49%) ooperative O Group (ECOG) status 0 1 dyspnea, fatigue, weight gain, arthralgia, mood effects , and diarrhea ; the most common lipase, and increased alkaline phosphatase . Serious adverse reactions occurred in 32% of the 295 patients; the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions were 3.4%), d (1.4%), respiratory failure (1.4%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2.7% of patients and included pneumonia (0.7%), (0.3%) . Permanent discontinuation of LORBRENA for adverse reactions occurred in 8% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation were respiratory failure (1.4%), dyspnea (0.7%), my ocardial infarction mood effects (0.7%). Approximately 48% of patients required dose interruption. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose interruptions were edema ( 7%), 24% of patients required at least 1 dose reduction for adverse re actions. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reductions were edema (6%), peripheral neuropath y (4.7%), cognitive effects (4.1%), and mood effects (3.1%).

The effect of c oncomitant use of LORBRENA with a moderate CYP3A inducer on lorlatinib plasma concentrations has not been studied. Severe h epatotoxicity occurred in healthy subjects recei ving LORBRENA with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer. In 12 healthy subjects receiving a single 100 mg dose of LORBRENA with multiple daily doses of rifampin, Grade 3 or 4 increases in ALT or AST occurred in 83% of subjects and Grade 2 increases in AL T or AST occurred in 8%. A possible mechanism for hepatotoxicity is through activation of the pregnane X r eceptor (PXR) by LORBRENA and rifampin, which are both PXR agonists. The risk of hepatotoxicity with concomitant use of LORBRENA and moderate CYP3A inducer s that are also PXR agonists is unknown. LORBRENA is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inducer s. Discontinue strong CYP3A inducers for 3 plasma half -lives of the strong CYP3A inducer prior to initiating LORBRENA. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with moderate CYP3A inducers . If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers cannot be avoided, monitor ALT, AST , and bilirubin as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Reference ID: 4344940 8 Effec t of CYP3A Inhibitors Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increase d lorlatinib plasma concentrations , which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of LORBRENA . Avoid the concomitant use of LORBRENA with a strong CYP3A inhibitor. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, reduce LORBRENA dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2. 4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. 7.2 Effect of LORBRENA on Other Drugs CYP3A S ubstrates Concomitant use of LORBRENA decreases of CYP3A substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with CYP3A substrates, where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious therapeutic failures. I f concomitant use is unavoidable, increase the CYP3A substrate dosage in accordance with approved product labeling. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] , LORBRENA can cause embry o-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on LORBRENA use in pregnant women . Administration of lorlatinib to pregnant rats and rabbits by oral gavage during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations, increased post -implantation loss, and abortion at maternal exposures that were equal to or less than the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg once dail y based on AUC (see Data ). Advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively . Data Animal Data Preliminary embry o-fetal development studies investigating the administration of lorlatinib during the period of organogenesis were conducted in rats and rabbits. In rabbits , lorlatinib administration resulted in abortion and total loss of pregnancy at doses of 15 mg/kg (approxim ately 3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg) or greater. At a dose of 4 mg/kg ( approximately 0.6 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg) toxicities included increased post -implantation loss and malformations inclu ding rotated limbs, malformed kidney s, domed head, high arched palate, and dilation of the cerebral ventricles. In rats, administration of lorlatinib resulted in total loss of pregnancy at doses of 4 mg/kg ( approximately 5 times the human exposure at the r ecommended dose of 100 mg) or greater. At a dose of 1 mg/kg (approximately equal to the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg ) there was increased post- implantation loss, decreased fetal bod y weight, and malformations including gastroschisis, rotated limbs, supernum erary digits, and vessel abnormalities. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of lorlatinib or its metabolites in either human or animal milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Becau se of the potential f or serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, instruct wom en not to breastfeed during treatment with LORBRENA and for 7 day s after the final dose. Reference ID: 4344940 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnanc y status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating LORBRENA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Contraception LORBRENA can cause embry o-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Female s Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with LOR BRENA and for at least 6 months after the final dose. Advise females of reproductive potential to use a non -hormonal method of contrace ption , because LOR BRENA can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Males Based on genotoxicity findi ngs, advise male s with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LORBRENA and for at least 3 months after the final dose [see Non clinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Infertility Males Based on findings from animal studies , LORBRENA may transientl y impair male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safet y and effectiveness of LORBRENA in pediatric patients ha ve not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 295 patients in Study B7461001 who received 100 mg LORBRENA orally once daily , 18% of patients were aged 65 years or older. Although data a re limited, n o clinically important differences in safet y or efficacy were observed between patients aged 65 years or older and younger patients. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bi lirubin upper limit of normal [ ULN] with AST > ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 \u00d7 ULN with any AST) . The recommended dose of LORBRENA has not been established for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. 8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommen ded for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 30 to 89 mL /min estimated by Cockcroft- Gault ). The recommended dose of LORBRENA has not been established for patients with severe renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( is a kinase inhibitor for oral administration. The molecular formula is C 21H19FN 6O2 (anhydrous form) and t he molecular weight is 406.41 Daltons. The chemical nam Lorlatinib is a w hite to off-white powder with a pKa of 4.92. The solubility of lorlatinib in aqueous media decreases over the range pH 2.55 to pH 8.02 from 32.38 mg/mL to 0.17 mg/mL . The log of the distribution coefficient (octanol/water) at pH 9 is 2.45. LORBRENA is supplie d as tablets containing 25 mg or 100 mg of lorlatinib with the following inactive ingredients: microcry stalline ric oxide/black iron oxide , and iron oxide red. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Lorlatinib is a ki nase inhibitor with in vitro activity against ALK and ROS1 as well as TYK1 , FER, FAK, FAK2, and ACK . Lorlatinib demonstrated in vitro activity against multiple mutant forms of the ALK enzy me, including some mutations detected in tumors at the time of disease progression on c rizotinib and other ALK inhibitors. In mice subcutaneously implanted with tumors harboring EML4 fusions with either ALK variant 1 or ALK mutations, including the G1202R and I1171T mutations detected in tumors at the time of disease progression on ALK inhibitors, administration of lorlatinib resulted in antitumor activity . Lorlatinib also demonstrated anti-tumor activity and prolonged survival in mice implanted intracranially with EML4 -ALK-driven tumor cell lines. The overall antitumor activity of lorlatinib in in vivo models was dose -dependent and correlated with inhibition of AL K phosphory lation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure -Response Relationships Based on the data from Study B7461001, exposure -response relati onship s for Grade 3 or 4 hypercholesterolemia and for any Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction were observed at stead y-state exposures achieved at the recommended dosage, with higher probability of the occurrence of adverse reactions with increasing lorlatinib ex posure. Cardiac Electroph ysiology In 295 patients who received LORBRENA at the recommended dosage of 100 mg once dail y and had a n ECG measurement in Study B7461001, the maximum mean change from baseline for PR interval was 16.4 ms Reference ID: 4344940 (2-sided 90% upper confi dence interval [ CI] ms). Among the 284 patients with PR interval <200 ms at baseline , 14% had PR interval prolongation 200 ms after starting LORBRENA . The prolongation of PR interval occurred in a concentration -dependent manner. Atrioventricular bloc k occurred in 1% of patients. In 275 patients who received LORBRENA at the recommended dos age in the activity -estimating portion of Study B7461001, no large mean increases from baseline in the QTc F interval (i.e ., >20 ms) were detected. 12.3 Pharmacokine tics Steady -state lorlatinib maximum plasma concentration (C max) increases proportionally and AUC increased slightly less than proportionally over the dose range of 10 mg to 200 mg orally once daily (0.1 to 2 times the recommended dos age). At the recommen ded dosage, the mean (coefficient of variation [ CV] %) C max was 577 (42%) and the AUC 0-24h was 5650 ngh/mL (39%) in patients with cancer. Lorlatinib oral clearance increased at stead y-state compared to single dose, indicating autoinduction. Absorpt ion The median lorlatinib Tmax was 1.2 hours (0.5 to 4 hours) following a single oral 100 mg dose and 2 hours (0.5 to 23 hours) following 100 mg orally once daily at stead y state . The mean abs olute bioavailability is 81% (90% CI 86.2%) after oral administration compared to intravenous administration . Effect of Food Administration of LOR BRENA with a high fat, high calorie meal (approximately 1000 calories with 150 calories from protein, 250 calories from carbohy drate, and 500 to 600 calories from f at) had no clinically meaningful effect on lorlatinib pharmacokinetics . Distribution In vitro , lorlatinib was 66% bound to plasma proteins at a concentration of 2.4 \u00b5M. The blood -to-plasma ratio was 0.99. The mean (CV%) stead y state volume of distributio n (V ss) was 305 L (28%) following a single intravenous dose . Elimination The mean plasma half -life (t\u00bd) of lorlatinib was 24 hours (40% ) after a single oral 100 mg dose of LORBRENA . The mean oral clearance (CL/F) was 11 L /h (35%) following a single oral 100 mg dose and increased to 18 L/h (39%) at stead y state, suggesting autoinduction. Metabolism In vitro , lorlatinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and contribution from (M8) of lorlatinib resulting from the oxidative cleavage of the amide and aromatic ether bonds of lorlatinib account ed for 21% of the circulating radioactivity in a human [ 14C] mass balance stud y. oral 100 mg dose of radiolabeled lorlatinib, 48% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine (<1% as unchanged) and 4 1% in feces (about 9% as unchanged). Speci fic Populations No clinically meaningful differences in lorlatinib pharmacokinetics were observed based on age (19 to 85 years), sex, race/ethnicity , body weight, mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 89 mL /min) , mild Reference ID: 4344940 hepatic impairment (total N and ULN or total bilirubin > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN and an y AST), or metabolizer phenoty pes for CYP3A5 and CYP2C19. The effect of moderate to severe hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment on lorlatinib pharm acokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ]. Drug Interaction Studie s Clinical Studies Effect of CYP3A Inducers on Lorlatinib: Twelve healthy 600 mg onc e dail y for 8 days (Days 1 to 8) and a single oral 100 mg dose of LORBRENA on Day 8. The coadministration of rifampin with L ORBRENA reduced the mean lorlatinib AUC inf by 85% and C max by 76%. Grade 2 to 4 increases in ALT or AST occurred within 3 day s. Grade 4 ALT or AST elevations occurred in 50% , Grade 3 ALT or AST elevations in 33%, and Grade 2 A LT or AST elevations occurred in 8% of subjects. ALT and AST returned to within normal limits within 7 to 34 day s (median 15 day s). The effect of the concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducer s on lorlatinib pharmacokinetics or the risk of hepatotoxicity with the concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers is unknown [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Effect of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors on Lorlatinib: 42% and increase d C max by 24% of a single oral 100 mg dose of LORBRENA [see Drug Interactions (7.1 )]. Effect of Lorlatinib on CYP3A Substrates : LOR BRENA 150 mg orally once dail y for 15 days decreased AUC inf by 64% a nd C max by 50% of a single oral 2 mg dose of midazolam ( a sensitive CYP3A substrate ) [see Drug Interactions (7. 2)]. Effect of Acid -Reducing Agents on Lorlatinib : Concomitant use of a proton pump inhibitor, rabeprazole, did not have a clinically meaningful effect on lorlatinib pharmacokinetics. In Vitro Studies Effect of Lorlatinib on CYP Enzymes: In vitro studies indicate that lorlatinib is a time -dependent inhibitor as well as an inducer of CYP3A and that it activates PXR, with the net effect in vivo being induction. Lorlatinib induce s CYP2B6 and c onstitutive androstane r eceptor Lorlatinib and t he : Lorlatinib inhibit s P-glycoprotein (P- gp), organic cation transporter (OCT )1, organic anion transporter ( OAT )3, multidrug and toxin extrusion ( and intestinal breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP ). Lorlatinib does not inhibit organic anion 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenic ity studies have not been conducted with lorlatinib. Lorlatinib was aneugenic in an in vitro assay in human ly mphoblastoid TK6 cells and positive for micronuclei formation in vivo in the bone marrow of rats. Lorlatinib was not mutagenic in a n in vitro bacterial rever se mutation (Ames) assay . Dedicated fertility studies were not conducted with lorlatinib. Findings in male reproductive organs occurred in repeat -dose toxicity studies and included lower testicular, e pididy mal, prostate weights; y; atrophy ; and/or mal inflammation at 15 mg/kg/day and 7 mg /kg/day in rats and dogs, respectively ( approximately 8 and 2 times, respectivel y, the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg based on AUC) . The effects on male reproductive organs were reversible . 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Distended abdomen, skin rash, and increased cholesterol and trigl ycerides occurred in animals. These findings were accompanied b y hyperplasia and dilation of the bile ducts in the liver and acinar atroph y of the pancreas in rats at 15 mg/kg/day and in dogs at 2 mg/kg/day (approximately 8 and 0.5 times , respectivel y, the human exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg based on AUC). All effects were reversible within t he recovery period. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 ALK -Positive Metastatic NSCLC Previously Treated with an ALK Kinase Inhibitor The efficacy of LORBRENA was demonstrated in a subgroup of patients with AL K-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NS CLC) previousl y treated with one or more ALK kinase inhibitors who were enrolled in a non- randomized, dose -ranging and activity -estimating, multi- cohort, multicenter study (Study B7461001; NCT01970865). Patients included in this subgroup were required to h ave metastatic disease with at least 1 measurable target lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECI ST) version 1.1 (v1.1), ECOG performance status of 0 to 2, and documented ALK rearrangement in tumor tissue as determined b y fluo rescence in situ hy bridization (FISH) assay or by Immunohistochemistry (IHC), and received LORBRENA 100 mg orally once daily . Patients with asy mptomatic CNS metastases, including patients with stable or decreasing steroid use within 2 weeks prior to study entry , were eligible. Patients with severe , acute , or chronic ps ychiatric conditions including suicidal ideation o r behavior were excluded. I n addition, for patients with AL K-positive metastatic NSCL C, the extent and ty pe of prior treatment was specified f or each individual cohort ( see Table 4). The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and intracranial ORR, according to RECIST v1.1, as assessed b y Independent Central Review (ICR) committee . Data were pooled across all subgroups l isted in Table 4. Additional efficacy outcome measures included duration of response (DOR), and intracranial DOR. A total of 215 patients were enrolled across the subgroups in Table 4. The distribution of patients by type and extent of prior therap y is pr ovided in Table 4. The demographic characteristics across all 215 patients were : 59% female, 51% White, 34% Asian, and the median age was 53 years (29 to 85 years) with 18% of patients 65 years. The ECOG performance status at baseline was 0 or 1 in 96% of patients. All patients had metastatic disease and 95% had adenocarcinoma. Brain metastases a s identified b y ICR were present in 69% of patients; of these, 60% had received prior radiation to the brain and 60% (n= 89) had measurable disease per ICR .

LORBRENA may cause serious side effects, including: Liver problems due to i nteractions with other medicines. It is important to know what medicines should not be taken with LORBRENA. Problems with brain (central nervous system [CNS ]) function. Many patients experienced problems with brain function including problems with thinking (such as forgetfulness or confusion), mood (such as depression), speech, seeing or hearing things that are not real (hallucinations), and seizures during treatment with LORBRENA. In some patients , these problems are severe and your healthcare provider may need to have you stop taking LORBRENA . Increases in the cholesterol and triglycerides (lip id) levels in your blood . Most patients will have an increase in the lipid levels in your blood during treatment with LORBRENA. o If you have increases in the lipid levels in your blood during treatment with LORBRENA, your healthcare provider may need to st art you on a medicine to lower the levels. If y ou are already taking a medicine to lower the lipid levels in your blood, your healthcare provider may need to increase your dose of that medicine . o Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check the lipid levels in your blood before starting treatment, 1 to 2 months after starting treatment, and during treatment with LORBRENA. Heart problems . LORBRENA may cause very slow or abnormal heartbeats. Your healthcare provider should check your heart rhythm ( electrocardiogram [EKG ]) before starting and during treatment with LORBRENA. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you feel dizzy or faint or have abnormal heartbeats. In some patients, these problems are severe and your healthcare provider may need to have you stop taking LORBRENA or have a pacemaker placed . Lung problems. LORBRENA may cause severe or life -threatening swelling (inflammation) of the lungs during treatment that can lead to death. Sy mptoms may be similar to those from lung cancer. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any new or worsening symptoms of lung problems, including trouble breathing, shortness of breath, cough, or fever . In some patients , these problems are severe and your healthcare provider may need to have you stop taking LORBRENA. See \"What are possible side effects of LORBRENA ?\" for more information about side effects. What is LORBRENA ? LORBRENA is a prescription medicine that is used to treat people with non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is caused b y an abnormal anaplastic ly mphoma kinase (ALK) gene and, that has spread to other parts of y our body and, who have taken the medicine alectinib or ceritinib or who have taken both the medicine crizotinib and at least 1 other medicine to treat NSCLC that is caused by the ALK gene, and their NSCLC is no longer responding to these treatments .
