By burning incense, blowing water, and chanting, they direct the healing power of khawb koob spirits to relieve both physical illnesses such as: - ua qoob (fevers with rashes) - burns - broken bones - eye problems Ritual healers also relieve ceeb (spiritual distress such as fright). So they heal both physical and spiritual ailments, but their magical healing doesn't return wayward souls like soul callers do, or soothe angry ancestral spirits like shaman do. "}
