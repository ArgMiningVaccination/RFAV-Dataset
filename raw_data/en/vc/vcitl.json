Older individuals and immunocompromised individuals are more likely to develop [shingles](https://www.medicinenet.com/shingles_herpes_zoster/quiz.htm). The [shingles vaccine](https://www.medicinenet.com/zoster_vaccine_live__shingles_vaccine/article.htm) is generally recommended for those older than 50 years of age and immunocompromised individuals (those with poor immunity). The United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has approved two [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/immunizations/article.htm) to effectively prevent [shingles](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/shingles_picture/picture.htm): [Zostavax](https://www.medicinenet.com/zoster_vaccine_live__shingles_vaccine/article.htm) and Shingrix.

Two doses of Shingrix are more than 90 percent effective at preventing shingles and [postherpetic neuralgia](https://www.medicinenet.com/postherpetic_neuralgia_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm). The [vaccine](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm) is more than 85 percent effective for at least the first four years after vaccination. It is possible to get shingles after being vaccinated since no vaccine is 100 percent effective. However, the vaccine can considerably reduce the risk and intensity of shingles episodes. Zostavax and Shingrix The US FDA has approved two [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/vaccination_faqs/article.htm) to prevent shingles: - Zostavax: It is a live vaccine, which contains a weakened form of the virus. It is 51 percent effective in preventing shingles. It is no longer available for use in the United States though. - Shingrix: It is the newer vaccine and the one recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and [Prevention](https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm)(CDC). It is a recombinant vaccine, created by altering and purifying deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that codes for a shingles virus antigen. This antigen produces an immune response to fight the virus. Shingrix is 90 percent effective in preventing shingles and longer lasting than Zostavax. The vaccine is given in two doses six months apart. Who should get the vaccine? The CDC recommends the Shingrix vaccine for the following: - Healthy individuals older than 50 years of age but there is no minimum age - Uncertain about the history of having chickenpox - History of having shingles - History of taking Zostavax vaccine (Those who have taken Zostavax recently should wait at least eight weeks before getting Shingrix.) [](https://www.medicinenet.com/human_body_quiz/quiz.htm) QUESTIONSee Answer When is the shingles vaccine contraindicated? Shingrix vaccine should be avoided in the following cases: - History of [allergic reaction](https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm)to the first dose of the shingles vaccine - History of [allergy](https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm)to any of the ingredients of the vaccine - Current, ongoing shingles infection - Other current, ongoing infections that are causing [fever](https://www.medicinenet.com/aches_pain_fever/article.htm) - Currently [pregnant](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_symptoms_and_signs/symptoms.htm)or [breastfeeding](https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm) - A negative test result for the [varicella zoster virus](https://www.medicinenet.com/shingles_herpes_zoster/article.htm)(In this case, the [chickenpox vaccine](https://www.medicinenet.com/varicella_virus_vaccine-injection/article.htm)is given instead.)

What are the side effects of the shingles vaccine? Like most [vaccines](https://www.medicinenet.com/childhood_vaccination_schedule/article.htm), it is normal to experience minor side effects from the Shingles vaccine. They may last for two to three days after getting the vaccine. Common side effects include: - Pain at the injection site [Fever](https://www.medicinenet.com/fever/symptoms.htm) - Body pain [Headache](https://www.medicinenet.com/headache/article.htm) [Stomach pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/gastritis/article.htm) [Nausea](https://www.medicinenet.com/nausea_and_vomiting/article.htm) Taking an over the counter pain medication can help the symptoms. Rare serious side effects due to [allergy](https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm) [Allergic](https://www.medicinenet.com/allergy/article.htm) reaction to shingles vaccine is called [anaphylaxis](https://www.medicinenet.com/anaphylaxis/article.htm).
