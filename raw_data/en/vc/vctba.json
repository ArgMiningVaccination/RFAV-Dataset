Part of the reason for that is the resignation of two faculty members last summer. Dr. Scott Davis left WVU to assume the chairperson position of the physical therapy education program at Marshall University in Huntington, WV. Although it was a huge loss for the program, it is nice to have him in West Virginia. Dr. Erickson left for a faculty position at Midwestern University in Phoenix, Arizona. Dr. Erickson's departure created a second large gap for the program. Of course, the remaining faculty have \"done their thing\" and stepped up and into new roles. Professor Timko coordinated the first orthopedics course and the second procedures course. Dr. Mancinelli coordinated the second orthopedics course. Dr. Swisher took over evidence based and niche content. Dr. Evans took additional responsibilities in the roles courses and coordination of the comprehensive examination. Dr. Jones took over the first evidence based course. Professor Rice coordinated the evidence based course, took over as chairperson of the curriculum committee and is responsible for the publication of this newsletter. We called upon Dr. Chang's experience as an orthotist to teach prosthetics and orthotics. Dr. Utzman assumed responsibility for all full time clinical education. So, we survived the year and I believe the students got the excellent education they expect from WVU. A year later, we have a lot of exciting news to announce. First and foremost, we have new faculty members. On the clinical side, joining us in early fall 2016 are two faculty who are primarily in the clinic but who have teaching responsibilities in their areas of expertise. Dr. Kristin Phillips joined us WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY DIVISION OF PHYSICAL THERAPY NEWSLETTER WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY as the women's health expert and is currently primarily working at the WVU Medicine outpatient clinic at the University Town Center. Dr. Phillips is a graduate of the University of Pittsburgh. She finished a fellowship in women's health and obtained board certification before she moved to California where she practiced for a year before joining us. Dr. Megan Burkart joined the faculty to start a new clinical program in oncology physical therapy. Her position is supported in part by a grant obtained by Dr. Swisher as a co-investigator which focuses on lung cancer survivorship. Dr. Burkart is a graduate of our WVU physical therapy program and practiced in Annapolis, Maryland, continuing to develop her interest in acute and cancer care before joining us. Both are contributing valuable input and their energy and enthusiasm to the education program while providing clinical physical therapy services that are not otherwise easily attained in the state. We have another faculty member joining us in August, 2017, Cheryl Brandmeir. Ms. Brandmeir is a graduate of Ithaca College and is coming to work as a part-time clinical and research physical therapist in movement disorders. I am also pleased that we have successfully filled the two full time faculty positions. In April, Dr. Muhammad Arlwaily joined the faculty and is already immersed in teaching the statistics course for second year students. He received his entry level education in Saudi Arabia and master's and PhD degrees from the University of Pittsburgh, with a minor in clinical and translational science. He is also first author on a recent publication in Physical Therapy regarding treatment based classification of low back pain. Dr. Renee McGinnis will join the faculty in July, taking over much of the professional roles track previously taught by Drs. Erickson and Utzman. However, she is a board certified orthopedic clinical specialist, so she will also have some teaching responsibility in that content during spring and summer. Dr. McGinnis is a graduate of our program with both master's and doctoral degrees and is currently the academic coordinator of clinical education at Pierpont Technical College in Fairmont. In addition to all of that excitement, a few other things are of note. We had another year with 100% first time board pass rate, with two graduates earning perfect scores! WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY Our fellowship in neonatal physical therapy, which is in partnership with Nationwide Children's Hospital was accredited and the first fellow finished at the end of June. The current students did an amazing array of community service projects through inter-professional education and Dr. Evans' course Professional Roles II. One of our current students, Christa D'Egidio represented physical therapy on a panel presentation with Senator Manchin about the opiod crisis. Finally, we are busy working on a curriculum modification to make sure our entry level curriculum is in alignment with contemporary trends in the profession. A brief summary of changes are as follows. First and foremost, we want to change terminology and focus to align with APTA's movement systems model. Second, we want to evaluate efficiencies in terms of course offerings, and we want to make sure we are building content in nutrition and health promotion. Third, we want to make sure students are learning things in an appropriate and efficient sequence. Finally, we want to increase our total full time clinical education experiences and place them later in the curriculum, in accordance with national trends. Stay tuned on our web page for further details as they start to emerge.

West Virginia University WVU DPT Student Community Involvement Throughout this 2016-2017 academic year the physical therapy classes of 2018 and 2019 have been very active in promoting the role of physical therapy in the community. Last fall, the WVU DPT Class of 2018 participated in eight community health promotion projects as part of their second year coursework. These projects included fall prevention screening at a local respite care group, presentations at breast and lung cancer survivor groups, campaigns to increase awareness of alternatives to opioid use, assisting with a nationally-funded balance intervention study, conducting balance screenings at the annual NIOSH Health Fair, participating in the Physical Therapy Day of Service (PTDOS) by providing yard work assistance to community members who were unable to perform these activities on their own, and health information and screening sessions at a local transitional housing facility. This spring, first year students participated in eight additional projects, some of which were a continuation of the fall projects initiated by second year students. These projects included balance and activity interventions with music therapy students with the respite care group at Suncrest United Methodist Church as well as expansion of the alternative to opioids project both at the Health Sciences Center and within the community. New projects included interprofessional health and activity promotion at Stepping Stones as well as fall prevention education and activities to Sundale Nursing Home staff and residents, both with WVU pharmacy students. Students were mentored by several physical therapy faculty members throughout the planning and provision of these projects but were required to complete much of the project planning themselves. Students from the Classes of 2017, 2018 and 2019 participating in PTDOS, October 2016.

The program aims to provide modified, ride-on cars for children with disabilities to increase their independence in moving around and exploring their environments. The founding premise of the program is research which shows that children not only need to learn to move, they need to \"move to learn\". There are now over 40 programs at universities and rehabilitation centers across the country participating in the program. Power mobility for children with disabilities can be out of reach for many children and families due to cost, which can range upwards of $25,000. If there are available 3rd party payers, they want to be sure the child can use the power device before they approve reimbursement; however, young children need opportunities to practice. In order to address this problem, the Go Baby Go program begins with a power ride-on toy \u2014 which is purchased from a toy store and is used by able bodied children. The toy is then adapted by volunteers to run from an electric switch pad. Positioning support is provided by strategically placed PVC pipes and cut-up pool noodles. The total cost for these modified cars is around $250.00. Drs. Cronin and Mandich have led an effort to bring the program to WVU. So far, almost $5,000 has been raised. Several cars have been built, including \"Steve McQueen\", \"Sponge Bob\" and Disney's \"Frozen\". One car can be used therapeutically, because it will only advance when the child stands up off of the seat. If you would like to donate to this fund, please send a check made payable to the WVU Foundation, Go Baby Go program, c/o Julie Peasak, WVU Division of Physical Therapy, PO Box 9226, Morgantown, WV 26506. West Virginia University PT STUDENTS AT CAMP GIZMO Camp Gizmo is an annual five day, hands-on camp where parents, professionals, and students learn how assistive technology can help young children (birth-8 years) with significant and multiple developmental needs. Typically camp is held in July on the campus of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and the Blind in Romney, WV. The camp is funded by the WV Dept of Ed/Office of Special Programs, WVDHHR/Bureau for Public Health/Office of Maternal, Child and Family Health/WV Birth to Three and WVDHHR/Bureau for Children and Families/Division of Early Care and Education and in-kind support is provided by WVATS, WVU Center of Excellence in Disabilities, National Seating and Mobility and Assistive Technology Works, Inc. Support and coordination is also provided by WV Early Childhood Training Connections and Resources. Families, professionals, college students, and others who want to learn more about assistive technology come to the camp every summer. A limited number of \"focus\" children are accepted and assigned a team of professionals who help families identify and apply new strategies for solving their multiple assistive technology needs. Professionals and students attend workshops of interest that meet professional/educational needs or assist the \"focus\" family. Teams meet daily to observe, discuss and implement strategies for the \"focus\" child. WVU third year physical therapy students have begun participating in the camp. This year, four students, including some who have been awarded graduate assistantships through the WVU Center for Excellence in Disabilities attended the camp from July 8th through the 12th. The students are Taylor Croft, \"Bobbi\" Phillips, Brooke Susyneski, and Anna Wortner. We are happy to have our students participate and learn through this wonderful camp. By the looks of the photo below, the students are having a great time too! West Virginia University NEONATAL FELLOWSHIP ACCREDITED The WVU Division of Physical Therapy has collaborated with Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, to develop an ABPTS accredited fellowship in neonatal physical therapy. West Virginia University is providing the online didactic coursework for the fellowship, as well as an observational rotation through WVU Medicine Neonatal Intensive Care Units at Ruby Memorial Hospital and WVU East at Berkeley Medical Center. The goal of the Neonatal Physical Therapy Fellowship Program is to educate and train physical therapists with advanced clinical competency in neonatal physical therapy. Through the fellowship, trainees are expected to learn how to contribute expertise to the comprehensive care of premature or medically fragile infants as a member of a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) team, participate in evidence-based practice and research and provide education to a diverse array of constituents including parents and other members of the health care team, including other physical therapists. The fellowship consists of twelve months of clinical training includes the online coursework through WVU. Application to the fellowship requires a minimum or 3 years of pediatric physical therapy clinical experience OR completion of an accredited pediatric residency program with eligibility for the Pediatric Clinical Specialist (PCS) exam. The program was notified of 5 year accreditation on May 31, 2017. This program is only the third physical therapy neonatal program in the country, with the others being at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Rocky Mountain University/University of Washington with Dr. Jane Sweeney. The first fellow, Dr. Kaitlyn Brown graduated on June 27, 2017. Dr. Brown is a graduate of Boston University and completed a pediatric residency at Boston Children's Hospital. She took the risk of coming to a developing fellowship program and was an enthusiastic and patient learner. All of her efforts have been rewarded because, upon graduation, she accepted an adjunct faculty position at American International College teaching pediatrics and a clinical position in the NICU within the University of Massachusetts hospital system.

A native of Fairmont, West Virginia, Mr. Ray was honored to be able to serve in the military for six years during which he participated in seven combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. An accident helped point him to his future career in physical therapy. \"In March 2006, between my second and third deployments, my unit was conducting training in Louisiana,\" Ray said. \"One of the several training missions was to fasten rope onto a building rooftop and clear the building from top-down. As it was my turn to descend from the MH-6 Little Bird helicopter, an error was made by the flight crew, the rope was released, and I fell about 20 feet to the concrete rooftop below with the rope in my hands. The rest of that night and the following 48 hours are hazy at best.\" Refusing to let his multiple injuries slow him down, Ray spent the next six weeks resting before returning to his home base. He credits physical therapy with playing a major role in his recovery. \"During that time, the seed for physical therapy was planted,\" Ray said. \"I became very interested in anatomy and kinesiology; however, my main concern was returning to duty to do the job that I had dedicated my life to at this point. With diligent work and the reassurance of my physical therapist, I made a full recovery and was cleared to return to duty, and I served for another four years and participated in five additional combat deployments with my unit.\" Contemplating his long-term goals, Ray decided to leave the military in 2010 and pursue a college education. As a proud West Virginia native, the state's flagship university was his first and only choice. WVU's Exercise Physiology program echoed Ray's interest and catered to his aspirations and professional needs. West Virginia University \"As I scoured the course catalog, I found Exercise Physiology,\" Ray said. \"A bit of further research showed me this degree would allow me to study topics that I was interested in. With the Exercise Physiology degree, you can get into an array of graduate programs and pursue a career in medicine, dentistry or physical therapy. I have been afforded several opportunities to volunteer and shadow physical therapists in a variety of settings. This is when my prior great experience with therapy began to resurface, and I knew for certain what I wanted to do.\" Speaking of his experience at WVU, Ray describes it as inspirational. The robust support system, the resources available to students and the exposure to many different teaching styles and professors who are masters in their fields paved the way for a valuable educational journey. \"The entire faculty has made a great impression on me, and all of them have inspired me in one way or another,\" Ray said. \"I think Dr. (Scott) Davis, one of our former professors, made a big impact on me. He led the bulk of our orthopedics and therapeutic exercise courses, which are at the core of physical therapy knowledge. He brought out every student's best performance.\" Ray was on the fence about which professional route he will take. He recently accepted a full-time staff physical therapist position at Mountain State Physical Therapy, which has a number clinic locations serving north central West Virginia. \"I have kept an open mind and positive attitude about every setting a physical therapist can work in. I feel my best interests lie in orthopedic physical therapy, and I see myself practicing in rural West Virginia,\" he said. \"If I go this route, I would like to eventually pursue an orthopedic clinical specialist (OCS) certification and possibly a certification in orthopedic manual therapy.\" Ray strongly recommends the exercise physiology and physical therapy programs to prospective students. He also emphasizes the importance of investing in your education and reaching your full potential while also being actively engaged in diverse activities. For him, it was the WVU Fishing Club that resonated with his love for fishing and outdoor activities. \"I am so glad that I was admitted to the WVU Physical Therapy program and completed my education here,\" Ray said. \"You will realize when you begin your full-time clinical rotations how valuable it is. Working through this program will fill your head with knowledge that may seem overwhelming, and you may forget small things that you had just studied for long periods of time and were tested on. However, this knowledge will come back to you when you begin to see it in real clinical experiences, and you will also be glad that you received a top notch education from the best faculty around.\" West Virginia University Student Feature Stephanie Magnone always envisioned herself as a West Virginia University student. Growing up in Weirton, West Virginia and motivated by her alumni parents and her brother, a current medical student at WVU, Stephanie chose to follow the same path. \"WVU was the only school I applied to because it was the only school I wanted to be at,\" Stephanie said. \"Both of my parents are alumni, and after seeing the success my brother had here, I couldn't imagine being anywhere else especially when I came to my first football game. The atmosphere was unlike anything I have ever experienced, it was amazing and from that point on I said I need to be here as a student.\" Choosing a major can be challenging, but for Stephanie, the decision was prompted by a casual conversation with her mother, and it echoed her lifelong interest in sports. \"I wasn't really sure what my future held, and for the longest time I told myself I wasn't even going to enter into any kind of sciences, especially not the health sciences,\" she said. \"As I was looking at the list of majors on the website, my mother suggested that I check out programs that incorporate exercise, since I like that so much. With her encouragement, I found the exercise physiology program, and I thought physical therapy sounds like a track I can see myself doing.\" For students like Stephanie, the School of Medicine's exercise physiology program can be an excellent pathway to other health professions programs such as physical therapy and medicine. Stephanie's life then took a detour, one that could have changed the path she had been set on. Yet, against all odds, it further reinforced her decision to pursue an opportunity with the physical therapy program. \"In my senior year of high school, during the third game of basketball season, I jumped up and then landed completely on my left side,\" she recounted. \"The shock of landing was too much on my cartilage to absorb, and it just exploded. I had to have a micro-fracture procedure done. I had to go through physical therapy rehab, and something just clicked. I thought this is definitely the track I need to take with my life. Once I got here and started the exercise physiology program, I had no second thoughts, I loved everything about it.\" West Virginia University As an undergraduate student, Stephanie praised the exercise physiology program for the numerous opportunities it has to offer.\"I completed the health professions emphasis in aquatic therapy, and a lot of the professors I got to work with in some of those upper level biology and organic chemistry classes have really opened my mind to what is so awesome about sciences and health sciences,\" she said. \"I am really glad I did that, and I like that exercise physiology offers that option. The aquatic therapy emphasis was one of the best things I have ever done; it opened so many doors for me between job opportunities, internships and experiences.\" Stephanie ultimately decided to apply to the physical therapy at WVU. In her first year as a PT student, she explains how shadowing ignited her passion for this career path and equipped her with the skills and knowledge to help patients. \"I have done a lot of shadowing and just watching someone who never thought he could walk again take his first steps, seeing someone in chronic pain and doing anything you can to relieve that pain, just having the ability to make someone's quality of life better amazes me,\" she said. Having lived in Morgantown for a few years now, Stephanie labels it as unique. \"The community here is unlike anything else, everyone is proud to be a mountaineer,\" Stephanie said. \"Coming to WVU changes your perspective on the state and what it means to be a West Virginian.\" Stephanie strongly recommends exercise physiology to prospective students who are interested in pursuing a health sciences program for the compelling role it had in shaping her future. She also emphasizes the importance of being involved as a student in an array of activities. \"Exercise physiology gives you not only a strong background in the sciences, but it also gives you a lot of hands-on clinical experience that you won't get with other majors,\" she said. \"We have a required internship where you have to work with patients and that was a huge part in preparing me for my future. As a student, I had the chance to be part of WELL WVU. I was a member of their student ambassadors team, educating others in the different aspects of wellness. I was also heavily involved in the Exercise Physiology Club, and it was a great way to get community service, as we have a community service requirement in the program.\" Asked about her future plans, Stephanie said that it's hard to tell what opportunities may come down the road; however, the exposures and the breadth of knowledge she gained while at WVU have broadened her horizons. \"My vision, originally, was maybe orthopaedics,\" Stephanie said. \"That was until I had my internship at HealthSouth Mountainview, where I was an aquatic therapy intern and in charge of the therapy in the pool for the inpatients. Now I am torn, and I don't know what I am going to do. I got so many great experiences with so many patients that made tremendous progress after having a stroke, and it was really amazing. It makes me feel that I want to work more with neurologic rehabilitation, so right now I am up for anything.\" West Virginia University The West Virginia University Doctorate of Physical Therapy Class of 2018 We spent an exciting summer in the clinic full-time providing patient care under our gracious clinical instructors. After a taste of the real world, we are now back in the classroom for one last semester of didactic coursework, which includes completing research projects, working on group projects, and preparing for the upcoming comprehensive exam. Then, we will be gearing up to move on to our final clinical placements in the spring to apply the skills and knowledge we've gained over the last few years. Following this, we are excited to announce our graduation in May of 2018 and move on to taking our licensure board exams to become practicing physical therapists. We are ready to advocate for our patients and our profession and lead the charge to #ChoosePT. President: Wortner West Virginia University The West Virginia University Doctorate of Physical Therapy Class of 2019 The DPT Class of 2019 had a summer of all work and no play as we delved into our second year of the program headfirst in May! We had a brief chance to refresh and come back for the fall semester, excited to engage in more specialized areas of the profession throughout this year after the solid foundation of skills and knowledge that was built in our first year. We are also very excited to continue with our part-time integrated clinical experiences in clinics and hospitals of the Morgantown area, as well as our interprofessional community health projects this semester! It's a busy time for PT students everywhere, but we're taking on the challenges with a smile and a \"let's go Mountaineers\" chant! Vivek Patel West Virginia University The West Virginia University Doctorate of Physical Therapy Class of 2020 The DPT Class of 2020 is off to a great start! We finished off the summer session anxious for a break following an intense few weeks of advanced anatomy. After some rest and relaxation, we were excited to get back to school to see our new classmates and to get to work. Having just completed our first round of exams, we are all starting to get into a groove and find a balance between studying, more studying, and taking some time off here and there (especially to cheer on the Mountaineers!). This is such an exciting period in our lives and, while we may occasionally feel overwhelmed with information, we are learning so much that we can't wait to one day use with patients! Class "}
