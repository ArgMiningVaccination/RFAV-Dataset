(International) Applications are now CLOSED Overview Does vaccination against bacterial pathogens shape immunological memory differently from natural infection? Protection against infectious disease relies on long-term immunological memory. The central dogma has been that following exposure to a foreign pathogen, immune cells such as B and T lymphocytes become activated, divide and undergo somatic hypermutation, eventually producing memory cells which can recognise a specific antigen with high affinity. This bank of memory cells are then able to rapidly reactivate and respond with a greater magnitude upon reinfection with the same pathogen, for example production of large amounts of high-affinity immunoglobulins. Recent advances have challenged our current understanding of the development of immunological memory, highlighting that secondary responses involve very few of the original \"bank\" of memory cells. While most studies have focused on model and viral antigen, this project aims to understand if memory responses to bacterial pathogens exhibit similar dynamics and how this is modulated by antigen affinity. This research will help to shape how we design the future generation of vaccines to target bacterial infections. The project involves infection models, high-parameter flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and genomics. It would be suited to an ambitious individual interest in immunology or microbiology.

Course structure1. The School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences is dedicated to providing its postgraduate research students with a supportive environment to effectively promote their education, training and professional development. First year students enrol on a tailored training programme comprising a series of lectures, workshops and practical sessions focused on key research skills, including bioimaging, informatics, genomics, mass spectrometry, animal models and clinical trials. In addition, all students receive wide-ranging and ongoing training in generic and transferable skills, such as scientific writing, data analysis, presentation and critical appraisal, through dedicated communication courses and seminars. They also benefit from presentation of their research findings at major national and international conferences, which is an expectation of all postgraduate research students, and through regular interaction with the QUB Graduate School, whose specific function is to support postgraduate training, development and careers. Students undertake their specific research project under the close guidance of an experienced principal supervisor with support from 1 or 2 co-supervisors as appropriate. All postgraduate research students are initially registered as 'undifferentiated' which means that they are required to complete a probationary period after which they are assessed for their suitability to undertake a postgraduate research degree during the differentiation process. Differentiation normally takes place at 9-12 months for full time students and 18-24 months for part time students. Each student is required to complete a literature review, give an oral presentation of their research within their Centre, and provide evidence of appropriate training and completion of their Postgraduate Development Plan. They are then interviewed by a differentiation panel, comprising 2 or 3 academic staff, who assess the students understanding of their project and progress, based on both their submitted paperwork and response to questions. Differentiated students are required to complete a similar Annual Progress Review process in each subsequent year of their research degree. The duration of a full-time PhD programme is normally 3-4 years. For completion of their doctoral qualification students are required to submit a thesis of their research of appropriate length and content (as advised by their supervisors) which will be assessed by oral examination conducted by an external and internal examiner. Funded postgraduate research studentships are advertised on the School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences website: https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/mdbs/Study/PostgraduateResearch/CurrentOpportunities/ . We will also consider applications from externally or self-funded students who should identify potential academic supervisors aligned with their research interests: https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/mdbs/Research/find-a-phd-supervisor/ Please note that we can only support projects which fit within the overall research strategy of the School and individual research focus of our academic staff. Students who meet the eligibility criteria for postgraduate research should select ONE potential supervisor from our list of academic staff, https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/mdbs/Research/find-a-phd-supervisor/, and send an email containing: (1) a brief CV (1-2 pages maximum), (2) a concise statement of motivation including research interests, (3) source of funding, and (4) intended start date. Our academic staff welcome approaches from prospective students and are happy to develop research proposals of mutual interest. Often this process will involve an informal face-to-face meeting (in person or via teleconferencing) prior to an invitation to submit a formal application. If you have difficulty identifying or contacting an appropriate supervisor, please contact Professor AJ McKnight, Director of Postgraduate Research, a.j.mcknight@qub.ac.uk, or the School Postgraduate Office, pgoffice.smdb@qub.ac.uk, who will be happy to help. Assessment Postgraduate students in the School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences will receive ongoing training in scientific writing, presentation and critical analysis as the basis for a research career. The School supports and challenges its postgraduate research students through robust annual progress review, requiring satisfactory assessment of written work, symposia presentations, supervisor reports and panel interview, the success of which is evidenced by its excellent completion rates. At the end of their postgraduate research training period, students are required to submit a thesis of their research of appropriate length and content which is assessed by oral examination conducted by an external and internal examiner. Feedback Postgraduate research students in the School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences receive feedback on their written and oral work throughout the period of registration for their degree. This may be both formal and informal and is provided regularly by their supervisors, peers, academic/postdoctoral colleagues, and annual progress review panel. Facilities Postgraduate students in the School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences benefit from world-class infrastructure and academic faculty and are highly valued as a central and critical component of its research strategy. All students will have access to shared laboratory and office space as required by their research project.

Additional course costs All Students Depending on the programme of study, there may also be other extra costs which are not covered by tuition fees, which students will need to consider when planning their studies . Students can borrow books and access online learning resources from any Queen's library. If students wish to purchase recommended texts, rather than borrow them from the University Library, prices per text can range from \u00a330 to \u00a3100. Students should also budget between \u00a330 to \u00a3100 per year for photocopying, memory sticks and printing charges. Students may wish to consider purchasing an electronic device; costs will vary depending on the specification of the model chosen. There are also additional charges for graduation ceremonies, and library fines. In undertaking a research project students may incur costs associated with transport and/or materials, and there will also be additional costs for printing and binding the thesis. There may also be individually tailored research project expenses and students should consult directly with the School for further information. Bench fees Some research programmes incur an additional annual charge on top of the tuition fees, often referred to as a bench fee. Bench fees are charged when a programme (or a specific project) incurs extra costs such as those involved with specialist laboratory or field work. If you are required to pay bench fees they will be detailed on your offer letter. If you have any questions about Bench Fees these should be raised with your School at the application stage. Please note that, if you are being funded you will need to ensure your sponsor is aware of and has agreed to fund these additional costs before accepting your place. How do I fund my study?
